She was reported to have gone missing a little over three weeks ago. The investigation into the case gained traction as her 36-year-old father, who was put under emergency arrest, confessed Thursday to having dumped her body on a hill in the city 270 kilometers south of Seoul in April. Based on the father's statement, police presume that Koh died because she choked on food. Her father has said that he concealed her death for fear that it would cause trouble in his divorce settlement with her birth mother.Police plan to examine her body to find out the exact cause of death, officials said.Police opened their investigation into Koh's case after her stepmother reported to the police on Dec. 8 that she had gone missing.They mobilized 3,000 personnel, search dogs and helicopters to find her over the past few weeks.","year old missing girl ,friday found the body ,missing girl on hillside ,police on friday found ,body of missing girl","['JEONJU', 'South Korea', 'the Jeonbuk Provincial Police Agency', 'Koh Jun - hee']",10,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.92528868  0.47432354

The man, 39, has been charged with raping his former sister-in-law, 20, when his ex-wife was not at home. The victim was staying at the couple’s house on Jeju Island to attend their wedding last February, as she had been invited by the man.  The victim, who came from the Philippines, revealed the incident to her sister’s close friend, after the couple went on their honeymoon. The victim’s sister then divorced the suspect.The man was tried in court for rape. However, the lower court declared last October that the suspect was innocent, saying, “It is hard to agree with the claim that the victim failed to run away from the scene, despite the fact that she had multiple chances.”The prosecution appealed, and the second trial will be held Wednesday. Korean civic groups gathered in front of the Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Council on Monday to protest the court’s judgement. They said that the court had not considered that the case amounted to sexual harassment by an immediate family member. The protesters also argued that the suspect should be ruled guilty, saying, “The  court’s previous decision implied that the accused misunderstood the victim’s willingness, because she did not actively resist.”They added, “Considering that the Filipino victim was invited to Korea by the accused, she wasn’t able to actively take action against him.” By Im Eun-byel","raped filipino ex wife ,raping his former sister ,wife sister korean man ,raped his filipino ex ,ex wife sister korean","['korean', 'Philippines']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62502182  0.10173772

Cafes at which customers can pet unusual animals are an increasing trend in Korea, but questions have been raised over whether they are safe for the animals.The activist group accused the cafe of abusing the animals by not providing an appropriate environment for them. “The animals it kept -- a coati, northern fox, desert fox, prairie dog, boa constrictor, and chinchilla -- were not separated by species,” an official from the group was quoted as saying by the Hankyoreh newspaper.The cafe refuted the claim, saying that the coati and the fox were not kept in the same enclosures.

Neighbors had initially called the police on Monday at around 12 a.m., after hearing “loud club music blasting from the second floor” of their multi-family residential building in Nonhyeong-dong. The police officers, dispatched from Gangnam Police Station, arrived to the scene to discover the two men, surnamed Choi and Kim, sitting on the bed, facing two other men in their 30s, dressed in revealing women’s clothes.  The four men reportedly looked “embarrassed” as they glanced at the police officers. Police claimed to have found a gas injector for cold nitrous oxide along with 10 balloons sprayed across the room -- possible evidence pointing to the suspects making “happy balloons” and then inhaling the hallucinogenic substance. Police also found 1,500 nitrous oxide capsules inside a paper box weighing 50 kilograms. Some 1,200 capsules reportedly have already been used or distributed by the suspects. Upon interrogation, the suspects claimed to have “only kept the capsules after receiving them from an acquaintance prior to August when the government added them to the list of illegal, hallucinogenic substances.” Neighbors, however, claimed otherwise and said that the suspects were engaged in the “use of the gas injector to inflate starting at least two months ago” and saw “multiple capsules in their garbage disposal bags.” Police will investigate the suspects to identify how they obtained the nitrous oxide in large quantities and any possible distribution channels. By Catherine Chung","hallucinogenic party police arrested ,throwing hallucinogenic party police ,men arrested for throwing ,arrested for throwing hallucinogenic ,party police arrested two","['Nonhyeong - dong', 'Gangnam Police Station']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69086355 -0.2556541

The suspect reportedly stole 50 plastic bags, priced at 20 won  each, after her shift ended on Dec. 4 at 11:50 p.m. After doing a routine run-through of the security tape Sunday, the store owner called police to report the crime. The suspect denied stealing the 50 plastic bags and claimed to have taken only two bags because she planned on buying items from the store. The employee, who started working in September, also said the store owner did not provide the “promised minimum wage,” which sparked the verbal dispute. Police said they view a lack of “ill-intention to commit a crime” by the suspect and will need to further investigate the exact details of the case.

They found the captain of the Seonchang-1, only identified by his last name Oh, lying on a mudflat about 3 kilometers southwest of the accident site off Incheon at around 9:40 a.m., with his black clothes intact. Just past noon, a rescue helicopter discovered the last remaining missing person, a 57-year-old angler surnamed Lee, on the sea about 2.2 km southwest of where the accident happened. Both of them were identified by their families and transferred to hospital morgues.  The authorities had been searching the waters and nearby coasts for them since Sunday, when the 10-ton recreational fishing vessel overturned after hitting a 336-ton tanker in the Yellow Sea. Seven people survived the accident.   This photo dated Dec. 4, 2017, shows the wreckage of the Seonchang-1, the fishing vessel that capsized after hitting a tanker in waters off Yeongheung Island, west of Seoul, on Dec. 3 2017. It was the worst tragedy involving a South Korean recreational fishing boat since a similar accident in waters near Jeju Island in September 2015. Fifteen people were killed and three went missing at that time.The authorities have mobilized dozens of Coast Guard boats, Navy and government vessels, as well as Coast Guard and Air Force planes to search the area. Investigators said Monday they requested arrest warrants for the tanker's captain and a crew member on charges of professional negligence resulting in death. They have been put under emergency detention for questioning. The fishing boat was towed to the Coast Guard pier in Incheon earlier in the day.","capsized fishing boat found ,fishing boat that capsized ,from capsized fishing boat ,coast killing 13 people ,capsized fishing boat","['INCHEON', 'the Coast Guard', 'Incheon']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33057985 -0.63353342

The Seoul Central District Court dismissed the prosecution's writ requests on three executives, whose identities were withheld, saying that it is difficult to acknowledge the need and reasons for their arrests. Prosecutors filed for the warrants on Thursday, charging them with violation of the law regarding safety and hygiene control over livestock products. They are accused of overlooking a hygiene test for patties that might be susceptible to a type of bacteria that causes a form of acute kidney failure known as hemolytic uremic syndrome , and of still supplying them to McDonald's Korea.  But the court said there is insufficient evidence to prove the supplier's patties inflicted harm on consumers. It accepted the defense argument that the supplier provided reasonable grounds to believe the manufacturing process complied with international standards.  The Seoul prosecutors' office released a statement to media to refute the argument. It said its investigation has found the company sold at least tens of millions of hamburger patties that were either contaminated or suspected of being contaminated with the bacteria. It claimed the supplier also doctored the infection result in which about 1 million of the patties tested positive for the harmful virus, known as 0-157, and delivered them to McDonald's. The prosecution also accused the company of skipping additional tests required to finally determine whether the patties were infected with the bacteria. It said it plans to file for arrest warrants a second time once they supplement the case.Prosecutors have been investigating the local unit of the US fast food chain on suspicions that several consumers, including a 5-year-old girl, became sick after they ate McDonald's burgers served with undercooked patties. The young girl's mother filed a complaint in July seeking a probe into McDonald's, saying that her daughter now suffers from HUS and has to receive dialysis for the rest of her life. Prosecutors raided McDonald's Korea's headquarters and three of its partner firms last month to seize evidence. Joh Ju-yeon, the chief of the Seoul unit, has expressed regret over the issue.","officials from burger patty ,court denies arrest warrants ,supplier over patty scandal ,three officials from burger ,from burger patty supplier","['Seoul', 'McDonald', 'the Seoul Central District Court']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.06444177  0.03989872

The three executives, whose identities were withheld by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, will stand trial on charges of violating the law regarding safety and hygiene control over livestock products, the office said in a release.  They are accused of overlooking a hygiene test for patties that might be susceptible to a type of bacteria that causes a form of acute kidney failure known as hemolytic uremic syndrome, and of still supplying them to McDonald's Korea.  Prosecutors have been investigating the local unit of the US fast food chain over allegations that several consumers, including a 5-year-old girl, became sick after they ate McDonald's burgers served with undercooked patties. The young girl's mother filed a complaint in July seeking a probe into McDonald's, saying that her daughter now suffers from HUS and has to receive dialysis for the rest of her life. Prosecutors raided McDonald's Korea's headquarters and three of its partner firms last month to seize evidence. Joh Ju-yeon, the chief of the Seoul unit, has expressed regret over the issue.","from burger patty supplier ,three officials from burger ,supplier over patty scandal ,mcdonald for selling meat ,officials from burger patty","[""McDonald 's"", ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01827502 0.23880911 0.83234262],Yonhap,Social affairs,11,2017,"life prosecutors raided mcdonald korea ,officials from burger patty supplier ,indicted three officials from burger ,after they ate mcdonald burgers ,prosecutors raided mcdonald korea headquarters","[""McDonald 's"", ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'McDonald', 'Korea', 'US', 'McDonald', ""McDonald 's"", 'HUS', 'McDonald', 'Korea', 'Joh Ju - yeon', 'Seoul']",13,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01827502 0.23880911 0.83234262]

Lee is said to have approached the 57-year-old female victim, surnamed Kim, in Incheon early on this year. Because Lee appeared to look much like a man, the suspect used this to her advantage when approaching Kim to lure her into a romantic relationship. Lee and Kim had been in a co-living relationship for a while until Kim could not keep up with her living expenses. Soon after in July, Kim said that they moved into her 73-year-old sister-in-law‘s house in Gwangyang, South Jeolla Province. The sister-in-law, surnamed Im, who made her living on a farm with her son, offered to help Kim considering their close relationship and welcomed Kim, along with Lee, into her home.Jeonnam Gwangyang Police Station Both Kim and Im reported to the police that they had no idea about Lee’s gender due to Lee’s mischievous act of playing the “gentle boyfriend.” The victims further added on that Lee was “a man they could depend on.” After two months of living at Im’s house, Lee allegedly used the password to the house, stole Im‘s bank book, withdrew 2 million won  and then fled to Incheon in Im’s car. Kim suspected that Lee was actually a woman after recalling the times when Lee would avoid sexual contact and the fact that Lee had a different body shape than that of most men. After two months of searching for Lee‘s whereabouts, police officers arrested the suspect around Lee’s neighborhood in Incheon on Nov. 21. Lee is said to have appealed to the police officers upon arrest that she had neither denied being a woman nor acknowledged being a man. The suspect also denied “dressing up as a man.” Lee is known to have 18 previous convictions of fraud.

The 25-year-old mechanical engineering student at Yonsei University in western Seoul has been charged with inflicting injuries resulting from explosives. He built the explosive using a drink tumbler filled with gunpowder and nails and delivered it to the professor's office. Prosecutors have demanded five years for Kim.   The court said Kim's actions were premeditated, which deserves the verdict, citing the fact that he had placed the tumbler in a gift box with a note that read: ""Thank you always."" ""The tumbler explosive was dangerous enough to cause serious harm to the life and body of the victim,"" it said. The court also mentioned how the defendant tried to hurt the professor before by adding methanol to a water purifier in his office but failed. But the court said it took into account that he has no prior criminal records and shown remorse, and that the victim is not seeking punishment for him. The professor suffered only minor burns, as the bomb did not fully detonate.

A local Australian police station caught the suspect, a woman in her 20s, in the city of Darwin, a northern port city of the country. The suspect is being charged with child abuse. The suspect is accused of authoring a written account of sexual abuse of an underage Australian boy on Womad, an online Korean extremist misandry community. The suspect’s nationality has yet to be revealed. In the online post, the author claims to have drugged and sexually assaulted a boy staying at a resort facility where the author is employed.  A screen grab of the post on Womad, before it was deleted The post included a graphic description of the writer’s sexually misconduct and a screen grab of a computer screen showing nude images of an unconscious boy. The local police are investigating to verify if the suspect is indeed the author of the controversial post. Womad is an online community that received attention in 2016 when a schizophrenic man murdered a female victim for no apparent reason other than misogyny, in the busy area of Gangnam in Seoul. Some have accused Womad of taking advantage of the Gangnam murder to promote misandry. Womad has been embroiled in a number of accusations for mocking patriots and veterans and labor right activists. The community has recently parodied the late actor Kim Joo-hyuk, who died in a car crash in October. Various online petitions were made on Cheong Wa Dae as of late, requesting the Blue House to shut down the “hateful website that is aggravating conflict and division of society.” By Lim Jeong-yeo","australian child sexual assault ,tuesday local australian police ,australian police station caught ,australian child was arrested ,sexual assault allegation suspect","['australian', 'australian', 'Seoul', 'australian', 'Darwin', 'australian']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17079337  0.13518772

He has undergone two surgeries so far for gunshot-wounds after being shot five times by North Korean soldiers. Citing medical officials at the hospital treating the solider, the newspaper reported that the patient was “struggling” to recover from the critical injuries. His second surgery was last Thursday. “His liver doesn’t work well and he has been diagnosed with pneumonia and Hepatitis B. He even has blood poisoning. … He is in trouble,” the report quoted an official from Ajou University Medical Center as saying. The North Korean soldier who dashed across the border to defect was transported to Ajou University Medical Center after being shot five times from the North Korean guards last Monday. YonhapThe pneumonia is suspected to stem from gunshot injuries to his lung, while blood poisoning is associated with the massive blood infusion during the surgery and secondary infections from his abdomen wounds, the official added. When the solider was transported to the hospital, he appeared to be “untreatable” because his blood pressure had dropped to 70 mmHg, according to the official. He received a transfusion of O-type blood as there was no time to figure out his blood type. Some 16 liters of blood has been used, it added. When he was found under a pile of leaves south of the border inside the Joint Security Area, he was bloodied from gunshots to his shoulder, elbow and abdomen. He was rescued by South Korean soldiers and transported to the hospital. “We are paying extra care to prevent complications from feces and parasites,” Doctor Lee Cook-jong, who treated the solider, said after his second surgery on Thursday. “We are not in a position to be sure.”  The surgery has also highlighted the dire medical conditions in North Korea as the wounded soldier was found to carry dozens of parasitic worms and suffer from Hepatitis B -- a common disease in the North. Hepatitis B is an infectious disease that affects the liver. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infected blood or body fluids. It can lead to serious complications such as liver cancer. According to a report from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention in 2014, North Korean defectors residing in South Korea were found to be much more likely to have Hepatitis B and tuberculosis than South Korean citizens. Among the 1,588 defectors responding to the survey, 12.4 percent of male defectors and 10.4 percent of female defectors had Hepatitis B. The number was about three times as much as the rate among South Koreans.The escaped soldier’s specific identity and motive for defection have not been revealed. South Korea’s top spy agency said last week that he was a 20-something noncommissioned officer serving at the Joint Security Area.

The act was intended to be for discipline’s sake, but a visiting teacher who glimpsed the act thought of it as child abuse and alerted the police. Another family in the same region was also questioned by the police after their own child reported them. Both cases were closed by the authorities as parental discipline was misunderstood, but the parents were shocked for having been accused of child abuse.According to Chungcheongbuk-do Office of Education, the number of reported cases of domestic child abuse against elementary, middle and high school students in the region reached 86 in the period leading up to October this year. Of those, 43 were dismissed after initial investigation.The current law states that a teacher who has come across a suspicious case of child abuse must report to the police for following countermeasures to take place. Wrongly accused parents complained of lasting trauma.The police said while it’s unfortunate that a simple family affair could be wrongly taken as child abuse, there are real cases that only get unearthed thanks to the reports. In a recent survey of parents with underage children by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, 77 percent of respondents said they had never received education on human rights involving children and teenagers.By Lim Jeong-yeo","their child for stealing ,child abuse local media ,child abuse the parents ,child for stealing from ,child for stealing","['Cheongju', 'North Chungcheong Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57693893 -0.39894986

YonhapA woman identified by authorities as Chutima, 29, who had worked at a factory in Gyeonggi Province for nearly 10 years, was found dead on Nov. 5. She was killed by her Korean co-worker after a failed rape attempt, according to a police investigation. Police say the 50-year-old suspect, now under arrest, lured Chutima to the site of the crime, saying a crackdown on migrant workers here without legal status was imminent and that he would help her avoid being caught. Immigrant rights advocates said like Chutima, many unregistered workers are at risk of being targeted for crimes such as sexual assault, rape and human trafficking because they live in constant fear of deportation. “We often see that people in South Korea look down on immigrant workers. Some female workers suffer sexual assaults at their workplace,” activist Han Sang-hoon told local news agency Hankyoreh. Han volunteered as an interpreter for Chutima’s father, who came to South Korea last week upon learning the tragic news. “The law should acknowledge the fact that there is already a growing unregistered immigrant population working here, and should improve their conditions to protect their rights,” Han said. Apart from vulnerability to crimes, these workers, mostly from countries like Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, often earn less than the minimum wage and endure poor sanitary conditions. Critics claim that immigrants who come or stay here illegally are forced out of jobs and subject to immediate deportation once caught by authorities, inevitably leading them to keep silent even when treated poorly by employers. There are roughly 500,000 migrants in the country with E-9 visas for unskilled labor jobs, according to the Ministry of Justice. The total number of migrants would be considerably higher including those who have overstayed their visas.By Bak Se-hwan","killed by her korean ,worker after failed rape ,recent murder case ,recent murder case of ,dire condition recent murder","['Thailand', 'South Korea ’s', 'Chutima', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'korean']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41676801  0.05278911

Police found the 45-year-old owner of the hair salon, surnamed Lee, and her business partners guilty of violating the Special Measures Act on Health Crimes Control.  The head of a medical device maker and a pharmaceutical firm employee were also arrested on charges of illegal distribution of medicine. Police also added an illegal cosmetic practitioner to their list of suspects. Lee reportedly made profits from the 353 illegal cosmetic procedures -- such as facial lifting using Botox, double-eyelid surgery, nose fillers and eyebrow tattooing -- from December 2015 to April 2017 in the hair salon that she owned. She had a considerable client list made up of those in the neighborhood, and offered operations at a cheaper price than plastic surgery centers. She charged her clients $200 to $250 for double-eyelid surgeries and $100 for filler procedures.  Other suspects are facing charges of running an illegal drug trafficking ring; importing and exporting pharmaceuticals 25 times without customs clearance; blending illegal drugs to produce “diet-inducing injections” and illegally distributing those drugs to the domestic market. Gwangju Metropolitan Police have confiscated more than 8,400 types of professional pharmaceutical products valued at a total of 40 million won  from the office of one of the suspects.","police bust illegal cosmetic ,bust illegal cosmetic surgery ,illegal cosmetic surgery ring ,police bust illegal ,illegal cosmetic procedures 353","['Jeonnam Regional Police Agency', 'Mokpo', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Lee', 'Health Crimes Control']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3556354   0.39119765

The prosecution ordered the 46-year-old main suspect to serve 15 years in prison, while handing his two accomplices a seven-year jail term. On April 19, the four men were playing a game of cards between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. when an argument arose over a past grudge. The main suspect initiated a fist fight and brutally assaulted the victim multiple times using his hand and feet. The two accomplices joined in on the attack. The victim died at the scene following persistent fatal blows.  It is reported that the three suspects continued to play cards, despite seeing the victim lifelessly lying on the floor. All four, unemployed at the time, had first met at a local bar in Daegu. Their relationship of “drinking buddies” soon turned into “roommates” as the three suspects moved in to the victim‘s house. The main suspect argued in court that he held no intention of killing the victim and could not have possibly predicted the victim’s death after the assault. The court, however, did not take the appeal into consideration. The court view that the suspects’ “lack of appreciation for human life” cannot be tolerated for any reason.

The Seoul Northern District Prosecutors’ Office concluded that Lee, 35, has a sexual perversion disorder and committed the crimes on the teen girl to satisfy his sexual desires. He faces charges of rape, homicide of a minor, an indecent act by force, drug use and abandonment of a body. “We will seek heavy punishment corresponding to the cruel crime once the investigation is wrapped up,” a spokesperson for the office said in a press briefing, announcing the final result of the investigation. “Under the law, it is possible to seek the death penalty and a life sentence in prison for him.”Lee, arrested as a murder suspect last month, is accused of having his daughter lure her friend to their house in eastern Seoul, giving her drinks containing sleeping pills and sexually assaulting the teenage girl with adult toys while she was asleep on Sept. 30.Lee allegedly strangled her to death with a tie and wet towel the next day as the girl woke up and strongly resisted. Lee and his daughter then transported the body in a suitcase by a car to Yeongwol, Gangwon Province, and abandoned the body on a mountain there. His daughter, 14, was arrested Tuesday and is being investigated as an accomplice by police. She admitted to assisting her father in disposing of the body. After running several tests on Lee’s psychological state, the prosecution found he had a lower-than-average level of intelligence and lacked self-control, but had no problem in leading an everyday life. The prosecution also said he had scored highly on a paraphilia test, meaning he had distorted sexual obsessions. He was obsessed with showing off his masculinity out of a victim mentality stemming from his physical disability, it said. The prosecution believes that Lee chose the 14-year-old victim to replace his deceased wife to satisfy his sexual desires. His 32-year-old wife, surnamed Choi, took her own life in early September at their residence. Lee’s acquaintance, surnamed Park, was also indicted for allegedly assisting Lee and his daughter in fleeing. The prosecution suspects he helped them get a place to stay in northern Seoul after they committed the murder.Police will continue to investigate other suspicions surrounding Lee and his family, the prosecution said.  Police are looking into the death of Lee’s wife amid allegations she had been sexually abused by Lee and Lee’s stepfather for years. Lee’s stepfather was found dead in an apparent suicide last month amid an ongoing probe. Police also suspect that Lee pimped his wife out for his prostitution business and misappropriated donations, which he received from the public to treat his daughter, for his personal use. Over years, Lee had raised donations worth 1.3 billion won  between 2005 and 2017 for his daughter suffering from a rare, autosomal dental tumor. He had the same condition and lost all but one tooth while treating the disease, earning the nickname “Molar Daddy.”But he allegedly spent only 160 million won for his daughter’s medical treatment. The case has shocked the public, especially since Lee had been depicted as a loving and caring father by media since 2006. Numerous media reports have since reported on potential evidence and testimonies that hint at his alleged luxurious lifestyle, obsession with teenagers and distorted sexual desires.By Ock Hyun-ju","trial on murder rape ,murder rape the prosecution ,charges of rape homicide ,murder of his daughter ,on murder rape","['Lee Young - hak', 'the Seoul Northern District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14044403  0.09312289

Police and the National Forensic Service said Tuesday that the immediate cause of Kim‘s death was a head injury, serious enough to have instantly killed the actor. They added that there was no evidence of myocardial infarction, which was previously reported as a possible cause that led to the car accident. A more detailed autopsy result will become available after about a week, police said. On Tuesday morning, Gangnam Police station said that it had asked the NFS to conduct an autopsy on Kim in order to verify the exact cause of his death. Kim‘s body was sent to NFS Tuesday morning at around 9 a.m.Kim, 45, was driving a Mercedes-Benz SUV down Yeongdong Daero when it crashed into Hyundai Grandeur near an I-Park apartment complex in Samseong-dong, southern Seoul, on Monday at around 4:30 p.m. Kim’s car then crashed into the wall of an apartment block and flipped down the stairs. Firefighters extricated Kim from the vehicle at around 5:07 p.m. and took him to Konkuk University Medical Center. Kim died at the hospital at around 6:30 p.m. It has been reported that officials from the hospital named myocardial infarction as a major cause of the accident. While the police still haven’t found electronic recording devices from either Kim’s car or the Grandeur, it said Tuesday that there have been a number of misunderstandings concerning the accident. Previously, the driver of the Grandeur had told police that Kim seemed to be in pain, clutching his chest, after the SUV crashed into his car from the rear, adding that the car then swerved into the apartment wall. But after analyzing a footage of the accident recorded by a vehicle behind Kim’s car, secured by police Monday, police said that Kim’s car didn’t ram from the rear but crashed to the right side of the car. The Grandeur driver later admitted the error of his earlier statement saying that he was confused at the time of the accident. The Grandeur driver also corrected his statement about Kim clutching his chest in pain, saying that Kim was actually grabbing the steering wheel with his two hands while leaning his chest on it with a pain-stricken face.

YonhapThe man -- a 35-year-old Korean national with residency in New Zealand -- is under police custody in Auckland for theft he allegedly committed in 2015. The New Zealand Police said they are continuing to interrogate the suspect and liaise with Korean authorities through Interpol.Identified only by his surname Kim, the suspect is accused of killing his mother and half brother on Oct. 21 in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. On the same day, he is believed to have murdered his stepfather in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province.He flew to New Zealand with his wife and two young daughters on Oct. 23 and “arrived in Auckland on Oct. 24” according to New Zealand’s immigration office. It also confirmed the suspect was a New Zealand resident. “Extradition proceedings have not been received, therefore New Zealand police are not in a position to release further details,” a spokesman for New Zealand police was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. Kim was arrested by New Zealand police on Sunday on the charge of theft. He reportedly sold off electrical appliances worth 3.1 million won , from a rental house, such as a refrigerator, a microwave and a washing machine. Auckland’s North Shore District Court, which held a hearing on his charge Sunday, ordered the prohibition of disclosure of Kim’s identity and his remandment until Nov. 1. South Korean authorities have requested the court to extend his custody for the repatriation process. Although further details are not known on Kim’s trial, the result is expected to affect when he would be taken back to Korea, police here said.

The taxi driver had first picked up the passenger from a school for the blind located in Seoul’s Jong-ro district on Sept. 15.  Seongnam Sujeong Police Station When the passenger specified to the driver to take a different route to the destination in Gyeonggi Province, the driver expressed his anger. The passenger asked to be dropped off soon after hearing the aggression from the driver. The suspect told police that he had dropped off the passenger after driving four kilometers near Yaksu Station in Seoul. The police explained that “despite the passenger demanding to be dropped off several times, the driver ignored this request and kept driving on for an extra thirty minutes. The fact that the driver continued to drive showed intent to confine the 16-year-old.” The driver is being charged for allegedly using slander and confining the passenger within the taxi.","impaired passenger taxi driver ,taxi driver probed for ,visually impaired passenger taxi ,impaired passenger taxi ,taxi driver probed","['Seongnam Sujeong Police', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Seoul', 'Jong - ro']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59104604 -0.17037234

But in South Korea, where pet owners tend to face minimal prosecution only in dog attack cases, it was considered an unusually strong punishment.  123rfAlthough dog attacks have steadily increased within recent years, in some cases resulting in losses of life, South Korea’s authorities and many dog owners have been slow to react, giving rise to a public outcry for tougher measures. According to Korea Consumer Agency, a total of 1,019 dog bite accidents occurred here last year, more than quadrupled from 245 in 2011. Early last month, a couple in their 40s were attacked by four unleashed fierce dogs while they were strolling in a park in North Gyeongsang Province. About 10 days later, a year-old baby got her neck bitten by a 7-year-old Jindo, a traditional Korean breed that locals consider as a companion dog at home. The baby died three days after she was taken to the hospital. Jindo dogs are not among the five breeds categorized as dangerous dogs by the current Animal Protection Act. Five breeds under the category that must be put on a leash or muzzled in public are American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, the Rottweilers, the Tosa dogs and their mixed breeds. A violation of the law can be punished by a penalty of up to 500,000 won.According to 2016 data from the Seoul Metropolitan Government, authorities caught 813 cases of unleashed dogs in public spaces such as parks while just 33 were given a penalty. As of June, 1,224 cases were discovered but only 29 were fined.“These attacks are caused by a carelessness and weak responsibility of the dog owners. More than punishment or penalties, what’s most important is the change in attitude of dog owners,” said Professor Jung Seung-hwan of Korea University’s Law School. In other countries like the UK, prevention and legal measures on the management on fierce dogs were introduced decades ago. The Dangerous Dogs Act enacted in 1991, requires an owner of the fierce dog to get approval by the court when they want to register dogs categorized as fierce dogs -- Pit bull terrier, Tosa dogs, Dogo argentine -- as their pets. The law in the UK also bans breeding, sales and exchange of these fierce dogs, while obliging the owners to take out a compensation insurance and get their dogs neutered or spayed. Presently, three bills that intend to reinforce the responsibility of fierce dog owners and punishment of owners in the event of dog attacks are pending at the National Assembly. Similar bills were proposed before but discarded in 2006 and 2012. By Kim Da-sol","killer pet dogs last ,18 months in jail ,pet dogs last month ,neighbor pet dog broke ,against killer pet dogs","['Yongin', 'Gyeonggi Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59483933 -0.02208444

Lee, 35, was arrested on Sunday for killing a 14-year-old girl from his daughter's school in his home in eastern Seoul and abandoning the body on a hill in the northeastern province of Gangwon earlier this month. His daughter is also in police custody for helping him dispose of the body. The police have referred Lee's case to the prosecution, on charges of murder, sexual molestation, indecent act by force and body abandonment. They also sent the daughter to be charged for enticement and body disposal.The investigation found that he told his daughter to invite the victim over as he needed someone to ""play"" his deceased wife, who committed suicide early last month, the Seoul Jungnang Police Station said at a press briefing. When the victim passed out after sipping a drink his daughter gave to her that contained sleeping pills, Lee stripped her and carried out lewd acts on her body, the police said. The autopsy of the victim has found no signs of sexual assault, which is consistent with the fact that Lee is sexually dysfunctional. Lee Young-hak, the suspect in the death of his teenage daughter`s friend, makes a public apology at the Seoul Jungnang Police Station before he was transferred to a detention center on Oct. 13, 2017. According to the police's profile on Lee, he is believed to have experienced bullying in his adolescence due to his jaw deformity caused by a rare genetic disease known as gigantiform cementoma. Profilers also concluded Lee has a psychopathic tendency, possibly built over the years due to an unfortunate childhood. His daughter has mostly likely been in a master-servant relationship with the suspect in which she blindly followed his unreasonable orders and took part in the crime, the police said. The murder, though, was not part of Lee's plan, the police said. He strangled her to death in a panic after she suddenly woke up and began to scream in fear as she found herself lying naked beside him. ""It is believed that he was afraid the victim might report to police,"" authorities said.On Tuesday, he confessed to the murder. Up to that point, he had only admitted to dumping her body. Lee's case has appalled the public, making headlines as he once appeared on a TV program a decade ago as a father devoted to curing his daughter's severe dental tumor she inherited from him.  As he was transferred to a detention center, Lee offered an apology and said he is ready to pay the price. ""I am sorry,"" he told reporters. ""Ever since my wife died, I've been high and not myself for a while...

Although he has confessed to the murder, he remains silent on his motives. Commentators, however, have raised the possibility that the murder might be linked to an obsession with teenagers, citing his abnormal past behavior. “Given there were adult tools found at his house, Lee might have had sadistic sexual desires. It is highly probable that he chose a teenager, who was weaker than an adult, to completely dominate the person,” Lee Woong-hyuk, a professor at Konkuk University, was quoted as saying by a local news agency. A crowd of journalists and spectators gather around a vehicle carrying a suspect in the death of a 14-year-old girl, ahead of a police-led re-enactment of the crime. The suspect is referred to by local media as “molar daddy” as he and his daughter both suffer from a rare dental tumor and the victim was a friend of the daughter. Police found many adult toys when they searched his house last month.“The motive related to sex is considerably sensitive, so most criminals do not confess.”But the National Forensic Service verbally briefed investigators that there was no evidence of sexual assault on the victim’s body after carrying out an autopsy, police said. The victim was strangled to death using a rope or similar implement, according to the autopsy report. Police suspect the daughter lured the victim to her house at 12:30 p.m. on Sept. 30, and gave her drinks containing sleeping pills to make her fall asleep. Lee’s daughter then left the house alone at 3:40 p.m., spent time with other friends outside and came back home at around 8:15 p.m. on Sept. 30. The police suspected Lee of having killed the girl the next day and carried the victim’s body in a black suitcase in a car and abandoned it on a mountain in Yeongwol County, Gangwon Province.Bae Sang-hoon, a professor at Seoul Digital University and a retired profiler, also suggested the man had a sexual obsession with teenagers.“We could see that  related to his sexual preference for young children,” he said in the radio interview, adding that the man might not have made direct sexual contact with the victim but might have done so in other forms. The police, however, said during a briefing that it is yet to conclude whether he had a sexual perversion. “Lee has partially spoken about the reason behind the murder, but we cannot tell whether it is credible. We will have to gather more testimony from people involved in the case and make a conclusion,” a police official told reporters. Kwon Il-yong, who formerly led a team analyzing criminal behavior at the National Police Agency, said that his sense of inferiority stemming from his disease has developed into abnormal behavior. “In this context, he and his daughter might have been more like a master-servant relationship. The deceased wife also gave the impression of being a typical victim when she was alive.”His daughter, 14, also admitted to assisting her father in disposing of the body. She did not accompany the father for the re-enactment of the crime. Police have asked for an arrest warrant for the girl, with the hearing on the warrant scheduled for Thursday. Fresh testimony and possible evidence continued to surface. On his Twitter account, he had shown interest in teenagers, posting an advertisement recruiting teenagers aged between 14 and 20 to work with him at his massage parlor. The massage parlor was reportedly offering illicit sexual services. He also offered consultations with teenagers over their school or family problems on Twitter. Local media reported that Lee had coerced his wife to sell sex to other men. Police analysis of Lee’s computer, digital camera and several phones suggested he was a pimp recruiting prostitutes and connecting clients with sex workers. The police reportedly secured several sex videos, with some showing his wife. He secretly filmed the sex scenes and uploaded the videos on adult websites to earn money.The police are looking into whether his wife’s suicide was linked to sexual abuse. “I have been sexually abused by my husband and I could not endure continued violence,” his wife allegedly wrote on a four-page suicide note before taking her own life. She got pregnant at 16 and gave birth to their daughter at 17. In early September, Lee and his wife, surnamed Choi, filed a complaint with police against Lee’s 60-year-old stepfather, who they claimed had raped Choi on multiple occasions over eight years since 2009. Five days after they filed a complaint, the wife killed herself by jumping from a building. Police are conducting a separate probe into the alleged rape case. They called in the stepfather as a suspect for questioning Tuesday, but he refused to turn up. On Wednesday morning, police re-enacted how Lee allegedly killed his daughter’s friend at his house in eastern Seoul. He arrived at the crime scene at around 9:30 a.m., entered his residence to re-enact the murder and came outside 45 minutes later to show how he had carried a suitcase containing the body to his car. Some 50 reporters and spectators gathered outside his house. Asked why he murdered his daughter’s friend, he said, “I am sorry.” Some spectators vented their anger, shouting at him and hurling curse words at him. The man had previously earned a reputation for being a loving and caring father, after local media reported on his efforts to raise donations for his daughter, who was suffering from a hereditary tumor that causes disfigurement of the jaw and teeth, in the US in 2006. He had the same condition as his daughter. After receiving numerous surgeries with the money from donations, he was left with only one molar tooth, earning him the nickname “molar daddy.”","confessed killing of teenager ,rare dental tumor himself ,motive wednesday with police ,police search for molar ,suffering rare dental tumor",['Lee'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22452454 -0.05834946

86,86, 'Molar daddy' admits to killing daughter's friend,"A 35-year-old man, who had earned public sympathy years ago for suffering a rare medical condition himself and raising a daughter with the same condition, admitted Tuesday to killing the daughter’s friend and dumping her body. A murder suspect is escorted into a police station in northeastern Seoul on Tuesday, to undergo questioning over suspicions he killed a friend of his daughter and abandoned her body. (Yonhap)...","A 35-year-old man, who had earned public sympathy years ago for suffering a rare medical condition himself and raising a daughter with the same condition, admitted Tuesday to killing the daughter’s friend and dumping her body. A murder suspect is escorted into a police station in northeastern Seoul on Tuesday, to undergo questioning over suspicions he killed a friend of his daughter and abandoned her body. The man, surnamed Lee and arrested, made the confession during the third day of questioning, after his 14-year-old daughter testified to investigators that she heard her father say “I killed her ”Both Lee and his daughter are recovering from overdosing on sleeping pills in what appeared to be an attempted suicide. Police said that they asked for an arrest warrant to detain his 14-year-old daughter as well for assisting her father to dispose of the victim’s body. But the two did not elaborate on why and how the victim was murdered, according to the police. According to media reports, police secured testimony from the daughter that she had lured her friend into her house and gave her sleeping pills to have her fall asleep. She then left the house alone, spent time with her other friends outside and came back home to find her friend dead. She allegedly said that it was her father who asked her to bring the friend home and asked her to be outside home for a while. According to the police, the victim went into Lee’s house with Lee’s daughter at around 12:20 p.m. on Sept. 30. Lee’s daughter left the house alone at around 1 p.m. The next day, the father and daughter carried the dead body in a black suitcase in a car and abandoned it at a mountain in Yeongwol County, Gangwon Province. The father, who has an intellectual and mental disability, has initially claimed that the girl died after she mistakenly took sleeping pills that he had kept at his home to take his own life out of despair following his wife’s death. But the victim was strangled to death using a rope or similar implement, the autopsy report by the National Forensic Service found. The case surfaced in early September when Lee and his wife, surnamed Choi, filed a complaint with the police against Lee’s 60-year-old step father who they claimed had raped Choi on multiple occasions for eight years since 2009. Five days after they filed a complaint, the wife jumped off a five-story building and killed herself. She committed suicide after having a quarrel with Lee as he asked her to have sex with the step father to secure evidence for rape, an anonymous police official was quoted as saying. The police are conducting a separate probe into the alleged rape case. They called in the step father as a suspect for questioning earlier in the day, but he refused to turn up. Who Lee really is largely remains a mystery.The 35-year-old man has earned a reputation for being a loving and caring father after local media reported on his effort to raise donations for his daughter, who was suffering from a hereditary tumor that causes disfigurement of the jaw and teeth, in the US in 2006. He had the same condition as his daughter. After receiving numerous surgeries with the money from donations, he was left with only one molar tooth, earning him the nickname “Molar Daddy.” But testimony by residents in his neighborhood and police suggest that Lee had shown abnormal behavior such as shooting an hourlong video in which his deceased wife’s body was cleaned and shrouded. “I am happy to touch my wife for the last time” and “My wife is the prettiest,” kissing her on the lips and breasts, he allegedly told reporters. On Choi’s body, there was a tattoo showing a woman tied in ropes. Lee himself argued that he had owned a massage parlor in the affluent district of southern Seoul. There is suspicion that he has led a lavish lifestyle -- for example, modifying foreign cars. He has not avoided meeting or talking to his neighbors, but when asked what he did for a living, he gave different answers every time, according to local residents. The police said he had no stable income and lived on the donations raised for him and his daughter.","killing daughter friend 35 ,her body murder suspect ,dumping her body murder ,killing the daughter friend ,killing daughter friend",['Seoul'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54013842  0.16878113

Following a squabble rife with miscommunication, the foreign national in his 40s pushed Choi from the elevator.  Choi reportedly fractured his skull and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he remains unconscious. The case came to light after Choi’s son looked up CCTV footage and discovered the cause of his father’s sudden accident. The man accused of assault reportedly told police the harm caused had been unintentional. He had only meant to shake away Choi as his co-habiting partner, who was also present at the scene with another unleashed dog, was ill.Police have barred the man from leaving the country as they investigate. Unleashed dogs have increasingly become a source of social concern. In November 2016, a dog off its leash attacked a woman and left her in need of six weeks of hospital care. The owner of the dog was fined 4 million won  for gross negligence. Also, on Friday, four hunting breed dogs strong enough to overpower a wild boar attacked a couple in their 40s while off their leashes in Gochang, North Jeolla Province. The dog owner was booked without detention by police.","senior unconscious after scuffle ,older korean man escalated ,unconscious after scuffle with ,scuffle with foreign neighbor ,hemorrhage according to investigators","['US', 'korean', 'Muan', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Choi', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33755746  0.48509946

First, police could have prevented it had they promptly heeded the report in June. Second, what’s sparking an uproar is that police only acted after footage of the brutal violence went viral on social media. Third, police allegedly did not take the case seriously even though two of the attackers had already been on probation linked to a different case.","female students brutally attacked ,teenage female students brutally ,female students brutally ,busan teen girl attack ,girl attack case teenage",['Busan'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37763712  0.22692445

Even if shamanistic rituals do not yield the promised outcome, it is difficult to hold the shaman accountable for the failure,” the court said.The shaman in the case had blamed the spirits of the victim’s aborted twin babies for her husband’s flagging business and suggested the victim appease the spirit babies through special rituals. The prosecution accused the shaman of fraud for carrying out an excessive number of rituals and charging over 560 million won . The shaman provided 133 rituals in the period between January 2011 and December 2015. During the time, she sent mobile text messages to the alleged victim using baby talk as if she was possessed with the twins’ spirits.The text messages read, “I know how you feel mommy. Please don’t feel sad. We love you,” “We ate loads of the meat you sent us. We love it very much.” The prosecution claimed the shaman intended to con the woman and submitted the victim’s bank account records detailing the amount of cash she claims to have withdrawn to pay for shamanistic services. The court took the side of the shaman, deciding that there was ample possibility that the victim willfully relied on shamanism to deflect stress from her husband’s unstable business, marital relationship problems and children’s future. The court also took in to account that the victim could have used some of the withdrawn cash for matters other than the rituals.

The percentage of voyeurs among the total number of sex crime perpetrators also went up from 3.6 percent in 2006 to 24.9 percent in 2015. Sexual crimes occur more frequently in the summer season, the 2012-2016 National Police Agency data showed, with an average of around 6,400 cases being reported from June to August, which is 30 percent more than those that occurred from December to February. During the 50-day intensive crackdown period, the police found that devices such as a car key equipped with a micro camera and a pen-type camera were used in voyeurism crimes. Some even uploaded what they recorded in subways to pornographic websites. To prevent additional and secondary damages on victims, the police vowed to continue with the intensive crackdown online until November through monitoring with the Korea Communications Standards Commission. They will mainly crackdown on voyeurs from uploading or spreading the videos they recorded on pornographic websites and control those who broadcast obscene contents on live streaming channels. The current law states that those who take pictures of others’ body parts without consent can be jailed for up to five years and be fined with 10 million won . Those who sell, distribute or openly screen such pictures can also face the same punishment.However, in most cases, if the violators are a first-time offender and are not considered to be a danger to society, they are usually not detained and just fined with a small amount of penalty.While blame the legal loopholes for the increase of such crimes, there are no regulations currently to curb the misuse of the high-tech equipment in Korea.“Considering the suffering that victims experience, the legal measures are not strong enough to make the peeping toms realize that they are committing serious crimes,” Lee Sang-hyun, an emeritus professor at police administration of Dongguk University.By Kim Da-sol","caught this summer police ,at beaches 705 restrooms ,980 peeping toms caught ,this summer police ,beaches 705 restrooms at",['the Korean National Police Agency'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50167811  0.01773485

After checking the woman’s condition, which appeared to be stable, the rescuers decided not to force the elevator door open and wait for an engineer to arrive, as requested by the building’s management officer. The woman’s husband, who later arrived at the scene, strongly protested the delay and demanded his wife be rescued immediately. The rescuers then opened the door and found the woman unconscious. The husband reported the case to the police, accusing the apartment management authority for delaying the rescue. The accused maintenance officer denied wrongdoing, saying the rescue team was in full control and that he did not hinder their rescue effort.

It was not registered with authorities as a public lodging facility as required by the Public Hygiene Act. The operator had insisted the mansion operated not as an accommodation facility, but a private club. Despite the facility’s permanent closure, police are continuing to look into whether nudists going au naturel at privately owned lodgings can be punished for public lewdness.The facility, registered as a farmhouse lodge when it first opened in 2009, had its operations suspended two years later due to complaints from nearby residents and only recently reopened.

The woman, whose identity was withheld, is accused of strangling her own child after giving birth to it inside the bathroom cubicle of a sauna in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, in June 2013. She allegedly abandoned the body in an outdoor area within the vicinity. The woman is also accused of an identical crime in November 2014. She allegedly gave birth to another baby, this time at an acquaintance’s residence, and killed and deserted it in a flowerbed in Jungni train station in Changwon. The police came to know the suspicious circumstances surrounding the woman toward the end of 2016 and began to investigate the case.After going through interrogation, the suspect admitted to her crimes and told the police the locations where she had deserted the babies. The police found the body of one of the babies wrapped in a plastic bag in a location the woman indicated. They’re still searching for the other baby’s body. The woman reportedly told the police that she had committed the crimes because she could not afford to raise the children. The woman had been living with a man when she committed the crimes. While he did not partake in the killing of the babies, he appeared to be aware of what the woman had done. Police, however, did not seek any criminal charges against him.By Lim Jeong-yeo","mother who killed newborns ,mother who killed ,who killed newborns caught ,woman who had killed ,strangling her own child","['South Gyeongsang Provincial Police Agency', 'Changwon', 'South Gyeongsang Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55217957  0.06350529

The move came several days after a family filed a complaint saying that their daughter developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome and lost 90 percent of her kidney function after consuming a burger from a McDonald’s outlet in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, in September. HUS, also known as “hamburger disease,” is from bacteria in contaminated foods such as undercooked hamburger patties. McDonald’s Korea, however, has denied responsibility for the incident, although it said it would cooperate fully with the investigation.

Shin was the first to act. He grabbed one of the man’s arms as Han reached for the other arm and held onto the man’s torso.In order to shake off the two men holding onto him, the man threatened to harm them with a knife if they did not let go. Both men held him tightly, and Shin eventually snatched the man’s knife away.The Busan Metropolitan Police came onto the scene and lifted the man over the railing, back to safety. The man was subsequently taken to the hospital.Han and Shin were formally thanked by the Busan Metropolitan Police. “What I did was not a big deal.

But it failed to properly cook the patty, nor did it provide any notification in advance of such a possibility when selling the Happy Meal children’s option,” she said. The complaint claims McDonald’s violated local food safety rules by serving contaminated meat that was not fully cooked. The plaintiff also made a tearful plea at the press conference, asking state prosecutors to investigate and hold McDonald’s Korea responsible for her daughter, who has suffered irreversible damage to her kidneys and must undergo eight to 10 hours of peritoneal dialysis on a daily basis. “I cannot turn back time and I can only wish for  to get better,” she said. According to the mother, the child ate a hamburger at a McDonald’s outlet in Gyeonggi Province in September and fell ill about three hours afterwards. She was brought to an intensive care unit three days later, where she was diagnosed with HUS, a food-borne disease that can cause acute kidney failure. The child was discharged from the hospital two months later, but had lost 90 percent of her kidney function. The McDonald’s outlet denied any link between its product and the child’s illness, saying the meat is machine-cooked, eliminating human error. The lawyer called on the prosecutors to seize the CCTV footage of the kitchen on the day as evidence. The disease is called the “hamburger disease” as it is often caused by bacteria in contaminated ground meat, and usually develops in children. The symptoms of the disease include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting.

The prosecution has barred the official from overseas travel on suspicions that he is behind the smearing scheme. The prosecution is set to summon him for questioning this week. Lee You-mi reportedly stated she didn't act alone. The People's Party and Lee Jun-seo have insisted that they had no knowledge of the scheme. The intensifying scrutiny is putting pressure on the party's former leader and then Moon's rival Ahn Cheol-soo to clarify his stance.

Officer Woo Jung-hoon of Anyangmanan Police Station is 170 centimeters in height and 62 kilograms in weight making it easier for him to be disguised as a woman. Despite his slender physique, Woo is a martial arts champion, with several silver medals in Wushu and many kickboxing national matches under his belt.  It recently came to the attention of the police that narcotics addicts often looked for paid hookups through smartphone dating apps. The police found that it was easy to approach these offenders online under the pretense of being a woman, but actual arrests were difficult as the suspects would remain hidden and check from afar whether the person turning up at the promised meeting spot was indeed a woman.The Anyangmanan Police Station has only one female detective, and it was a risk for her to fight the criminals on her own. Woo, 32, volunteered to dress up as a woman to go undercover. He personally invested in female undergarments and mini-skirts and completed the look with pantyhose and high heels, topping it off with a long wavy wig.“It was embarrassing at first, but other officers gave a heated response and support. That gave me courage,” Woo said. Woo’s latest catch, a 47-year-old man whose identity was withheld by the police, had 18 grams of methamphetamine which was worth as much as 3 million won .The suspect had been released from a local prison three months earlier and acquired the illegal drug through his former prison inmate’s acquaintance. He was arrested on the spot by Woo in disguise for violation of narcotics laws.The local police station told The Korea Herald that Woo would not give any comments on the arrest because he is “shy.”Since joining the police agency in 2011, Woo has regularly fought in kickboxing championships two to three times a year. Over the years, he has been in more than 20 matches, some of them qualifiers for national competitions.

149,149,Choi Soon-sil gets jail term over daughter’s illegal college admission,"Choi Soon-sil, a close friend of South Korea’s former President Park Geun-hye, has been sentenced to three years in jail for pulling strings to get her daughter into an elite university.　The Seoul Central District Court found Choi guilty of obstruction of duty by exerting influence on Ewha Womans University to give undue favors to her 21-year-old daughter Chung Yoo-ra, using her ties with the former president.

The prosecution had sought a seven-year prison term for her. “ is found to have committed wrongdoing too grave to consider as an act of a loving mother who wants the best for her child,” the court said in its ruling.  Choi Soon-sil is being escorted to the courtroom. Judges handed down a two-year and a 1 1/2 year imprisonment sentence to the university’s ex-president Choi Kyung-hee and former head of admissions Namkung Gon, respectively, for their role in the admission fraud. In 2015, the school gave special favors to Chung, a former national dressage player, in the admissions process and grades despite her rarely attending classes. In return for admissions favors, Ewha received state subsidies and projects via her mother. Chung, who is currently under prosecutorial investigation, recently said she didn’t even know what her major was and that she did what her mother told her to do. Prosecutors sought to arrest her twice for the school scandal and suspicions surrounding Samsung Group’s generous sponsorship of her for equestrian training, but the court refused to issue a warrant.Monday’s ruling is the first made against Choi, who faces several more charges in connection with the wide-reaching corruption scandal which brought down Park.Key among them is bribery. Choi is standing in a separate trial together with Park accused of extortion, abuse of power and attempted fraud to extort bribes from local business conglomerates while acting for years as an adviser to the ex-head of state.By Bak Se-hwan","daughter illegal college admission ,jail term over daughter ,over daughter illegal college ,daughter illegal college ,three years in jail","['Choi Soon - sil', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Chung Yoo - ra']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38270259 -0.10937283

The Seoul Central District Court cleared Hahn Seung-hun, chair professor of Chunbok National University, of charges that he wrote a piece in a magazine in the early 70s that sympathized with the North Korean regime and its propaganda.  Hahn Seung-hun, former human rights lawyer and current chair professor at Chunbok National University, makes a speech at an event in South Jeolla Province, southwest of Seoul on Sept. 7, 2015. The court said Hahn's testimony was not admissible as it was written without being given a chance to seek legal counseling. It also found that there was no mention in the article that indicated he had advocated for the North Korean regime or called for the abolition of the National Security Law. In 1972, Hahn published a commentary in which he lamented the death of an opposition lawmaker, Kim Kyu-nam, who was executed that year for carrying out anti-state activities in Europe. The prosecution indicted Hahn three years later for what it called ""praising the traitor's activities."" He was sentenced to 1 1/2 years in prison by a lower court but was released later when a higher court suspended his sentence. Hahn served nine months and lost his license to practice law for eight years.Hahn, now 83, requested a retrial after the Supreme Court posthumously acquitted Kim in 2015. Hahn is known for his relentless devotion to the protection of those who faced political persecution under the dictatorial Park Chung-hee government. He served as the head of the Board of Audit and Inspection during the Kim Dae-jung government in 1998-1999.","lawyer convicted of violating ,lawyer acquitted of pro ,lawyer convicted ,rights lawyer convicted ,lawyer convicted of","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Hahn Seung - hun', 'Chunbok National University', 'north korean', 'Hahn Seung - hun']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22383933  0.1018832

This undated file photo shows a Taser gun. Another officer, who was 3 meters away from the man, used a Taser on him as he was acting violently and combative with officers, police said. He fell down after being shot in his right side and right arm and was handcuffed.A single shot from a stun gun contains two needle-tipped electric darts. Police then had to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation after the man stopped breathing. He was pronounced dead around 8:20 p.m. after being treated at a nearby hospital.The man was confirmed to have a record of stays at mental hospitals due to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. His parents were attempting to have him admitted again as his condition worsened due to his refusal to take medication.At the scene, there were three officials present from a mental hospital located in the neighboring city of Jinju.The police said they will conduct an autopsy to find out whether the Taser led to his death. Incidents of death caused by Tasers have been reported many times in foreign countries but there have been no such cases reported in South Korea.The Hamyang Police Station expressed its condolences over the man's death and promised to investigate whether the officers' handling of the situation was appropriate.In South Korea, the use of stun guns has been on the rise since it was introduced in 2005, when it was used four times. Taser use increased to 431 times last year from 116 times in 2011, 199 times in 2012, 246 times in 2013, 328 times in 2014 and 432 times in 2015.Under a law on police execution of their duties, police are allowed to use Taser guns with a maximum range of 6.5 meters and an electric current of 2.1 milliamperes when it is necessary to protect others or to restrain people resisting their execution of duties. However, they are prohibited from aiming stun gun’s at the target's face, heart and genitals.","man dies after police ,died after police shot ,dies after police shoot ,illness died after police ,after police shot him",['Hamyang'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49919975  0.12050828

The suspect was reportedly a captain at the time. The major defied the order, saying that she “could not follow the orders as a professor overseeing the cadets.”She was instructed to act as the sister of the suspect, who had been arrested on accusations of setting up hidden cameras. Whether the suspect actually had a female sibling is unknown. In response to her refusal, the colonel gave poor feedback on her performance reviews, putting her at the risk of being discharged from the military. The human rights team under the Ministry of National Defense, however, only gave a written warning to the colonel, deeming the order as “inappropriate, yet it did not force a ... settlement through a forceful command.”However, a group of her former and current superiors signed petitions to block her from being discharged. The judging committee ruled to maintain her position in the Army in February. Despite the efforts of her supporters, the major has yet to recover her teaching post and was punished with a two-month temporary wage cut, according to the released document. A military official told a local media outlet that there is no connection between the reported case and the military discipline against the major. The South Korean military has often been accused of deep-rooted discrimination against female soldiers. The state human rights committee decided to launch an in-depth probe into sexual harassment issues involving female personnel early this month.

Foreign media reported that a gunman barged into a mall at the Resorts World Manila complex early in the day and fired shots multiple times toward a large TV screen, before he poured gasoline on gambling tables and set them on fire.The South Korean Embassy in the Philippines said a man presumed to be in his mid-40s died from a possible heart attack, while three other Korean nationals sustained minor injuries during the ensuing panic. The victim was among some 36 bodies found at the site, most of whom may have likely died from suffocation, according to the authorities. The Manila police said it has no evidence that it was a terrorist attack and suspects it to be a robbery.  The suspect stole casino chips worth about 110 million pesos  and fled the scene. He was later found dead in a room of the same hotel, apparently after committing suicide. Hundreds of people flocked to the exit to escape, causing chaos. Some 54 people have been treated for injuries so far. The South Korean Embassy has dispatched two officials to the scene to determine if any additional South Korean nationals were hurt, official sources said.","in manila shooting embassy ,injured in manila shooting ,shooting attack at resort ,breaking korean dead injured ,gunman barged into mall","['south Korean', 'Manila', 'Seoul', 'southeast asian']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28778628 -0.06286149

Chung, whose mother is at the center of the scandal that led to the impeachment and arrest of former President Park Geun-hye, had been in custody of Danish authorities after she went into hiding to avoid the prosecution’s summons.The prosecution said that Chung, a 20-year-old former national dressage team member, was arrested at 4:08 a.m. on a Korean Air flight departing from a transit point in Amsterdam. She is expected to arrive at Incheon Airport at 3:05 p.m. escorted by five officials.Upon arrival in Seoul, she will be taken directly to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office for questioning. Under local laws, Chung can be held up to 48 hours without arrest warrant.After the corruption scandal involving her mother Choi surfaced late last year, Chung and her 23-month son had remained in hiding in Germany and Denmark. In January, she was taken into custody by Danish authorities for visa-related violations. South Korea’s Justice Ministry had asked for her extradition in connection with the corruption scandal. Although Danish courts accepted the request, Chung appealed to avoid extradition. Chung’s appeal, however, was rejected on April 19. Chung again filed an appeal, but withdrew on May 24.Chung faces allegations that she received illicit funding from Samsung Group for her equestrian training abroad and preferential treatment in entering Ewha Womans University and for her academic records on the back of her mother’s influence.Park and Choi are on trial for colluding to receive bribes and favors from local firms including Samsung Group in return for the Park administration’s policy favors.","arrested tuesday on board ,arrested on flight chung ,sil was arrested tuesday ,tuesday on board flight ,was arrested tuesday on","['Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Seoul', 'Chung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'danish', 'Chung']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.06767671  0.20907633

The man, showing no remorse, signs of being intimidated or fear for his own fate, confessed to killing two boys in 2004 and more. His cool-headed confession made investigators shudder. It was then that criminal profiler Kwon Il-yong was brought in.  Kwon Il-yong Through a series of interviews with the suspect, Kwon managed to help resolve the case, analyzing Jeong’s motives and obtaining full confessions to the killings of 13 people from January 2004 to April 2006. “It was the case that I will never forget for my entire life,” recalled Kwon, now retired and enjoying life away from the world of crime. Jeong was sentenced to death in 2007 -- the death penalty remains in South Korea, but no executions have been carried out since 1997. Two years later, he hung himself in jail, with a noose that he made from plastic dust bags. Before his death, he is said to have remarked, “It’s easy to quit smoking, but not killing.” “Pure evil itself -- I saw it in him,” Kwon said during an interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday. Kwon started off his 28-year career with the police, as a patrol cop. After he was selected to become the nation’s first criminal profiler 17 years ago, he was part of investigations into almost every major crime. He has interviewed over 1,000 criminals, including Yoo Young-chul, a serial killer and self-confessed cannibal who murdered 20 people, and Kang Ho-sun, who murdered eight women and killed his wife and mother-in-law by arson. He also pioneered the police’s behavioral science-based investigation. Before his retirement in April, he was the head of the Criminal Behavior Analysis Team at the National Police Agency. In person, Kwon, 53, is a cordial man, with a disarming smile and observant eyes. When he spoke of his past work, his intensity and focus was a reminder of his trailblazing path in South Korea’s approach to criminal investigation. “Everybody reacts differently in a situation. A monster is born when a person’s genetic factors meet with a bad environment,” he said.As society changes, so does crime. In South Korea, breakneck economic development and social changes has had its impact on crime patterns and motivations, Kwon explained. “Before the early 1990s, criminal motivations were pretty clear. There was no need for investigators to adopt such modern investigation techniques such as criminal profiling. Most criminal activities at that time had something to do with poverty, personal revenge or love affairs, and could be explained as easily as they seemed on the surface.”Killers who randomly selected their victims began to emerge noticeably in the 1990s, when social and political changes beset the country following democratization and the advent of global free trade. One of the most notable cases was that of the “Jijon clique,” created in 1993 with the specific intention to kill.The seven members of the gang, all in their 20s, shared a grudge against their well-off, kidnapped victims and took them to the cellar of their rustic hideouts. There, they murdered, dismembered victims’ bodies and ate their flesh. Five people -- all ordinary citizens not superrich-- lost their lives at their hands. “Hate crimes, which mostly target women and the weak, are an example that shows a growing sense of deprivation and alienation among underprivileged people of that time,” said Kwon. Crimes of today are increasingly driven by “rage and anger” caused by social inequality, he noted. “Feeling deprived of opportunities to take roles in society, people commit horrendous acts of violence against others who they have no ties with, simply to feel superior to them and show their anger toward society. They believe that their actions are justified. These are certainly not a common type of crime you could see a few decades ago,” said Kwon. He said he also grew up in a poor family, but the major difference between himself and such criminals was that “I’d never considered myself as being isolated from friends, colleagues and society.” “Criminals tend to believe they are deprived of the opportunities .” Kwon acknowledged that he had battled with post-traumatic stress in the course of his work with brutal criminals. “Memories linger on for quite some time,” he said.He was also not free from fear. He recalled the shock he felt when he learned that a photo of him was found at the home of a suspect. To avoid letting work affect his upbeat personality, Kwon made it a rule to have a party after closing a case at a nearby pub, simply to talk. “It could be an unbearable burden if we  have to endure such mental pain all alone. We gather together often, just to exchange idle chitchat sometimes,” he said.Having grown up in a Catholic family, faith also helped him to get through the day, Kwon said, quoting Friedrich Nietzsche’s admonishment that those who fight monsters risk becoming monsters themselves. Despite being a Catholic, Kwon said he supports capital punishment.“It seems to me that our judicial system is better than some people worry with regard to the possibility of executing falsely-charged, innocent citizens. I also believe that the statute of limitations should be abolished for serious crimes,” he said. “Or we could also consider allowing judges to give imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, like they do in the United States, to curb crimes.” By Bak Se-hwan","attempted murder in 2006 ,housebreaking and attempted murder ,killing two boys ,to killing two boys ,first arrested for housebreaking",['Jeong Nam - gyu'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0079662  -0.24776666

The case mirrors that of a 32-year-old man surnamed Hong sentenced to 8 months in jail by a Seoul court in April for leaving a similar threat against high school students on Ilbe, an extreme right-wing online community, last February. The school located in the Gwangjin district of eastern Seoul had to undergo an emergency shutdown and immediately alerted the police after finding the threat. Police arrested the suspect within 24-hours of the threat being made. Hong later confessed that he posted the threat under the influence of alcohol.

He has since been charged with sexual harrassment.The disputed man came under fire the previous day by posting a photo of himself with the junior Yoo during her father’s street campaign near Hongik University in Seoul.A capture from Rep. Ha Tae-keung’s Facebook account shows a man molesting Yoo Dam as presidential candidate Yoo Seong-min campaigns in Seoul, Thursday.He was pictured putting his arm around Yoo and holding out his tongue toward her, though he was soon stopped by surrounding party officials and observers.“She was so much prettier in person. It was so hot today that I panted,” the man wrote while uploading the photo on Ilbe, an ultraconservative online community.Yoo Dam rose to fame while helping out with her father’s campaign in last year’s parliamentary election, gaining attention for her looks.Responding to the issue, the party immediately excluded her from Friday’s campaign events and filed a complaint against the unidentified assailant.“The most important thing is to create an environment in which the socially disadvantaged may live in peace,” the party’s lawmaker Rep. Ha Tae-keung wrote via his Facebook account Friday, announcing the arrest of the culprit.“The Bareun Party will make sure to be kind to human rights victims and stern upon aggressors.”The election camp of Moon Jae-in, the candidate of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, also commented on the incident.“The sexual harassment of Yoo is an intolerable action, an insult of the people who seek to confirm their freedom and equality through elections,” said Rep.

Iron, 25-year-old whose real name is Jeong Heon-cheol, was indicted last month on suspicion of hitting his then-girlfriend in September and October of last year. He will be tried on charges including battery and threatening harm. The alleged victim had alleged that the supposed assault came first in September when she refused to comply with his demand during sex, and again in October when she announced she is breaking up with him.But the rapper had claimed that the aforementioned physical assault was consensual, due to the women’s sexual orientation. He claimed that the rumors against him have been greatly exaggerated and he is suffering from the accusations.Her legal representatives countered by saying that the supposed victim had suffered from Iron releasing her personal information -- including photos and social media accounts -- and spreading false information about her sexual orientation.The rapper made a name for himself in the mainstream music scene via his 2014 appearance in Mnet’s “Show Me the Money,” but he has since been a magnet for trouble and controversy.Iron’s song “System“ came under fire for using derogatory terms against homosexuals. Another lyric from a different song depicting how he stabbed a person sent shockwaves across the nation when it was revealed in a 2016 interview to have actually happened.Later in the year, he was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years, for smoking marijuana. By Yoon Min-sik","assaulting girlfriend the trial ,hitting his then girlfriend ,trial for korean rapper ,rapper tried for assaulting ,tried for assaulting girlfriend","['korean', 'Jeong Heon - cheol', 'Ilgwang Polaris']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38934606 -0.08416156

It was exhibited in a facility in the southern city of Changwon in commemoration of a 1960 civil uprising against election fraud. A photo of then-President Park Geun-hye vandalized at a memorial hall of a 1960 pro-democracy movement in the southern city of Changwon. The Masan branch of the Changwon District Court fined Kim, the leader of a local anti-Park group, 2 million won  for damaging public property and breaking into a building.Judge Choi Ji-ah said in his ruling that it is recognized that Kim entered the memorial hall illegally and compromised the utility of the exhibit.Kim said he will appeal the ruling, adding ""Park's photo was inappropriate for the hall honoring a pro-democracy uprising.""On Dec. 14, Kim and his colleagues visited the hall and demanded the removal of the photo showing Park posing with children before he damaged the picture.Prosecutors initially filed a summary indictment. He defied it and demanded a formal trial.On March 15, 1960, thousands of students and citizens in the city rose up amid widespread allegations of vote rigging by the Rhee Syng-man government. Rhee had ruled the country since becoming the country's first president in 1948.The March uprising was forcibly quashed, leaving seven dead and many others injured. The deaths became the rallying point for a nationwide pro-democracy movement on April 19 that brought down the Rhee administration.","activist tuesday for vandalizing ,tuesday for vandalizing photo ,fined an activist tuesday ,tuesday for vandalizing ,activist fined for vandalizing","['Park Geun', 'Kim Young - man', 'Changwon']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11839144 -0.21867339

The Incheon murder is the latest in a series of high-profile crimes involving schizophrenic patients in South Korea in recent years.  The suspect in a kidnap and murder case of an 8-year-old child is seen at Yeonsu Police Station in Incheon, west of Seoul, Thursday. In May last year, a 23-year-old woman was stabbed to death in a restroom near Gangnam Station by a 34-year-old man with the same mental illness. The killer had been diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2008 and had since been hospitalized six times, a police investigation revealed. In October, a policeman was shot in the back with a homemade gun by a 45-year-old suspect who also had a medical record of being treated for schizophrenia four times. Another schizophrenic patient in Incheon last month kicked his father to death after his father had sworn at him.Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear and reduced social engagement.The suspect in the killing last week, a 17-year-old high school dropout surnamed Kim, admitted to having strangled the girl to death with a cable wire, but said she does not remember the reasons for her action. She reportedly told her lawyer she thought the whole incident was a dream.In Korea, approximately 500,000 people suffer from schizophrenia. Clear reasons behind the disorder have yet to be identified. Schizophrenia can be treated with medication, but many suffering from the illness here refuse to get professional help, trying to hide their symptoms, local experts said. The social stigma attached to mental disorders prevents them from getting treatment, they added. “We shouldn’t assume that all schizophrenic patients are potential criminals,” said Lee Soo-jung, a professor of criminal psychology at Gyeonggi University. Schizophrenic patients can lead a normal life if they take medication, the expert stressed. According to the Korean Neuropsychiatric Association, the number of crimes committed by those with mental disorders account for around 0.3 to 0.4 percent of total crimes committed each year.A separate report by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office showed that the crime rate of those with mental disorders was at 0.08 percent, while that of those without disorders was at 1.2 percent. The number of suspects under indictment with a mental disorder was 3,244 in 2015. Some said the government should come up with measures to tackle the problem. “Crimes committed by patients with mental disorders happen mostly when they were not receiving timely treatment,” said a 55-year-old mother in Ilsan, who knows a family struggling to care for a schizophrenic child due to economic reasons.“It would be helpful if the government provided financial support to patients such as subsidies for the medicines and other treatments,” she said. Experts stressed that the government should first create an environment for mental disorder patients to receive timely care and treatment, without fear of being sent to hospitals against their will. An inconsiderate approach can only backfire, they said. In June 2015, about one month after the Gangnam Station killing by a schizophrenic patient, the government rolled out measures aimed at preventing hate crimes against women and strengthening early discovery of criminals with mental conditions. But it immediately faced backlash from rights groups, which called for apologies, as the government “shifted responsibilities of high-profile crimes to citizens with mental disorders,” assuming them to be potential criminals.

Police concluded that the suspect, a 17-year-old high school dropout, acted alone, ruling out the possibility of an accomplice.  The 17-year-old suspect walks into local court in Incheon on Friday. Investigators plan to send the case to prosecutors for further investigation and an indictment. The suspect, identified only by her surname Kim, was apprehended in a quiet residential district of Incheon, Wednesday, after the victim’s body was found dismembered in garbage bags atop the roof of a facility housing a water tank at 10 p.m. on the same day. She and the victim lived in the same apartment complex, but reportedly had no prior contact. According to police, the suspect met the victim at a playground on Wednesday and lured the elementary school student to her home with a phone. Kim confessed to having strangled the girl to death with a cable wire, but said she does not remember the process of dismembering the body or the reason for committing the crime. She is also reported be to have told her lawyer she thought the whole incident was a dream. According to her family, Kim has been receiving treatment for mental illnesses over the past seven years and dropped out of high school last year after difficulty adjusting.Depending on whether she had the deliberate intention to kill the child, she could face up to 15 years in prison.

To restart his career, Shim chose to take online courses to obtain an electrician’s certificate. “I had to find a new job to support my family. However, people who are old like me have problems learning as quickly as young people,” Shim said. “Online courses let me review materials repeatedly. I can even slow down the speed , which is great!” The Ministry of Education and National Institute for Lifelong Education host a briefing session for K-MOOC business operations in a conference room on March 17. According to the recent survey conducted by Mirae Asset Global Investments, workers in South Korea retire from work at the average age of 54. Most retirees seek to start a second career. Shim was once the head of his department at a leading conglomerate in Korea. When he was 55 years old, he came under pressure to quit, but he was not financially prepared to stop working. He decided to take online courses from a lifelong education institute. Getting a new job or better position is a problem that goes beyond the older generations. Younger people in their 20s or 30s also face the same problem. They are now paying attention to lifelong education, often in the form of online programs. K-MOOC, which stands for Korean Massive Open Online Course, has been available since October 2015, with support from the Ministry of Education and National Institute for Lifelong Education. Over 140 web-based courses from local universities such as Seoul National University and KAIST provide free learning to students, regardless of age or nationality. “As of February 2017, more than 125,000 users have learned via K-MOOC,” Suh Heon-joo, executive director of K-MOOC said. “Our system helps students to engage in interactive learning such as discussions, quizzes and offline activities. Suh said the age of the students ranges from 20 through 50, and more teenagers are opting to take K-MOOC courses. A 32-year-old woman, who requested anonymity, said she worked at a law firm and takes online classes from the Cyber University of Korea. “My work sometimes requires foreign language skills but I was afraid to speak a foreign language,” she said. “I’ve been taking the foreign language courses for two years and now I’m getting more confident and I also got promoted.” The Cyber University of Korea said that 12,000 students are enrolled as of March. The university said electrical and electronic engineering is one of the most popular courses. Female students who had quit their jobs to take care of their children are favoring counseling and health-related courses to prepare for a job search. Not all MOOC students are concerned about getting a job. Suh Young-wan, director at Lifelong Education of Konyang Cyber University, said students in their 50s and older are showing great passion for lifelong learning.

He was taken to hospital, but was pronounced dead eight hours later.  Seo’s death poses a challenge to the investigation team, as he was considered a prime suspect in the case. They had discovered additional evidence that pointed to the suspect. Before he died, the only evidence against Seo was a fingerprint of his found on a balcony. The bodies of the 84-year-old and his grandson were first discovered in a room with signs of arson, but were unaffected by the fire.Recently discovered CCTV footage showed Seo in a car not registered as his personal vehicle, near the scene at around the time of the alleged crime. According to local reports, Seo was not close to the victims.“We are thoroughly investigating potential suspects to bring the case to justice,” a police spokesperson said. “Seo was just one of the suspects.”The two bodies were found Thursday.

The other four, all his friends in their late teens or early 20s, stood as lookouts while he stole the dolls.The exit, which is 210 millimeters wide and 297 millimeters high, hardly appears large enough to admit a man, and will just barely admit an A4 sheet of paper.But CCTV footage at the shop showed Lee, who has a skinny figure, on his back pushing the upper part of his body through the exit and reaching the coveted dolls.The five decided to steal the dolls after spending 30,000 won failing to get any dolls from the machine, police said.Police are investigating into whether Lee and the four accomplices committed other similar crimes.In October, rescuers removed an inebriated woman, 20, from another claw machine for dolls after she crawled into the game machine's exit following frustration over her failure to get any dolls from it.The woman, 20, got herself stuck inside the machine in the city of Incheon, west of Seoul, around 4:00 a.m. on a Monday morning, before being rescued.

The report is not confirmed as Malaysian police have yet to make an announcement.South Korea's intelligence service said that the murder of Kim Jong-nam has been a ""standing order"" issued by Kim Jong-un since he inherited power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father.The 46-year-old was at the airport to take a flight to Macau when he was attacked by two ""Asian"" women, he died en route to a hospital.The South Korean government confirmed Kim’s death, but stopped short of saying that North Korea was behind it, adding that it is awaiting the results of Malaysian police's probe.""If Kim Jong-nam's murder was carried out by North Korea, the North's leader would have been aware of that,"" said an official at Seoul's unification ministry.Kim Jong-nam was once viewed as the heir apparent, but he had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.The latest case marked the most high-profile death under the Kim Jong-un regime since the execution of Jang Song-thaek in December 2013, the once-powerful uncle of the incumbent leader.Experts said that the assassination is seen as the North Korean leader's move to strengthen his reign of terror by eliminating any potential challenge to his one-man rule.","thursday arrested another female ,police on thursday arrested ,malaysia arrests another suspect ,arrested another female suspect ,malaysian police on thursday","['malaysian', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Siti Aishah', 'indonesian', 'malaysian', 'southeast asian', ""Kim Jong - nam 's""]",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38922709  0.228278

A press statement released by the Malaysian police on Feb. 14 said a 46-year-old North Korean named Kim Chol died the previous day on his way to a hospital from a Malaysia International Airport service counter where he sought initial medical treatment. Reports said Kim Chol, an alias used by Kim Jong-nam, was attacked by two unidentified women with chemical spray. During a meeting with the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee, Lee confirmed that Kim was killed with poison at the airport, although it still needs to find out whether a needle or chemical spray was used. The agency conceded it was notified of the incident about four hours after it occurred.Kim was at the airport to take an airplane heading to Macao when he asked the staff for help after interacting with two ""Asian"" women. Kim died on the way to a nearby hospital.The Malaysian authorities presume Kim was poisoned, although details will be revealed through an autopsy. The agency said the suspects are presumed to be still at large in Malaysia. ""There was also an  in 2012,"" Lee was quoted as saying by Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the Democratic Party.Lee then said the North's latest action is presumed to have been based on Kim Jong-un's ""delusional disorder,"" rather than on any calculation that his half brother is a threat to the regime.The NIS head also told lawmakers that Kim sent a letter to the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 2012, asking his brother to spare his and the lives of his family.Kim Jong-nam's wife is currently staying in Beijing with a son, while his second wife is living in Macao with a son and a daughter.All of them are currently under the protection of Chinese authorities.The son in Macao is Kim Han-sol, who came into the spotlight in 2012 after being interviewed by a Finnish television station. He said he hopes for the unification of the two divided Koreas and wants to improve the livelihoods of ordinary people living in the impoverished country now controlled by his young uncle. The agency said Kim has never asked South Korea for asylum, nor was there an effort within North Korea to place Kim Jong-nam as the leader.South Korea's unification ministry also said it is certain that Kim has been killed in Malaysia.""Police in Malaysia are conducting a probe into the killing, and they have yet to announce the results ,"" Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at Seoul's unification ministry said.""Seoul is closely cooperating with the Malaysian government."" Experts said that Kim might have been killed due to the North Korean leader's move to strengthen his reign of terror by eliminating any potential rivals to his iron-fist rule.Kim Jong-nam -- the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il -- had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.He was critical of the power succession to his brother Kim Jong-un. In 2010, Kim Jong-nam told Japan's TV Asahi that he is ""against third-generation succession,"" although he said he hopes Kim Jong-un will do his best to improve the lives of North Koreans and that he stands ready to help from abroad.It marks the highest-profile death under the Kim Jong-un regime since the execution of Jang Song-thaek in December 2013, the once-powerful uncle of the incumbent leader.Since inheriting power from his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011, the North's young leader has propped up his control by executing more than 100 military, party and government officials, according to Seoul's spy agency.Japan's Kyodo News, meanwhile, said that authorities in Tokyo are checking reports that the two suspected assailants may have died.South Korea police said it has increased the number of officers protecting high-ranking North Korean defectors in the country.""We have added more forces to the team since Tuesday night amid the rising concerns over the safety of many important defectors,"" an official from the police said.","spy agency confirms murder ,half brother was murdered ,murder of nk leader ,spy agency on wednesday ,brother was murdered with","[""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Malaysia', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Lee Byong - ho', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'chinese']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54276377  0.42185721

The key goal of searching the hospital, home and office of the hospital’s Chairman Cha Kwang-yul, as well as the head of the hospital’s cord blood banking service, was to find evidence the chairman gave direct orders for illegal stem cell therapies. By law, donated cord blood can only be used for research purposes.  Bundang Cha Hospital, the flagship branch of the Cha Medical Group. The given case is also connected to the extensive corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, as the two are also under suspicions of receiving illicit anti-aging therapies at the group’s affiliated hospital. The group chairman and his family members, including his father and wife, are suspected of receiving therapies using donated cord blood.Such allegations came to light on the sidelines of charges that President Park and Choi frequently visited Chaum, a prestige hospital branch of the group, to receive unauthorized cosmetic surgeries.So far, the prime charge has been on the cord blood bank chief, surnamed Kang, who allegedly gave nine therapies in total to Cha family members from January 2015 to September 2016. None of them suffered from critical genetic diseases that require stem cell treatment.The Act on Cord Blood Management states that a maximum jail term of two years or a fine of 10 million won  is to be imposed on those who carry out therapies using cord blood without due authorization.“As of now, the range of our investigation only involves Kang, as the related clause does not explicitly include those who received therapy,” the police had said last month, upon taking on the case.After questioning several hospital officials, however, investigators decided that the chairman’s family may also be subject to sanctions if Cha turns out to have given direct orders to Kang to perform the disputed surgeries.Their legal basis is another clause of the law, which says that those who aid or abet cord blood therapies in exchange for benefits are to face a maximum jail term of five years or a fine of 30 million won.The Health Ministry earlier revoked its designation of the group as a state cell bank, a move which will force it to return some 500 million won it received in government subsidies.Umbilical cord blood, which refers to blood that remains in the placenta and the attached umbilical cord after childbirth, is considered useful in treating genetic disorders.The substance, usually donated for research purposes or stored in banks by parents, may only be used upon the authorization of the Koreas Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the consent of the client.By Bae Hyun-jung","therapy the police raided ,blood therapy the police ,the police raided monday ,medical group chief raided ,hospital cord blood banking","['the Cha Medical Group', 'Cha Kwang - yul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18311453  0.23200949

Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn Hwang has been increasingly speaking for the need to address the troubles faced by poor and marginalized citizens recently, which some observers construed as a move to boost his political profile ahead of an upcoming presidential election. Hwang has been bandied about as a potential conservative contender though he has remained noncommittal about whether to throw his hat into the ring.Political circles have carefully watched Hwang's public activities and messages that could appeal to conservative voters, as his popularity has been on a steady rise.After former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon renounced his presidential ambitions on Wednesday, Hwang was touted as Ban's replacement to carry the flag of the conservative bloc in the race for the presidential office.Hwang came in third place in a Gallup Korea poll released Friday, by garnering a 9 percent approval rating, up 6 percentage points from a month earlier. Moon Jae-in, former head of the main opposition Democratic Party, remained as the most favored potential candidate with 32 percent. Liberal provincial governor An Hee-jung shot up to the second place at 10 percent, up 7 points in the past month.During the meeting, Hwang vowed to strengthen the existing institutions to protect the socially vulnerable through various measures such as enhancing rules to protect workers on the receiving end of verbal abuse and toughening punishments for those refusing to pay overdue wages to their workers.The acting president also said the government will seek to enhance social awareness about the recurring cases of abuse through education and publicity efforts.""We will continuously conduct a national campaign to pursue a fair and transparent society and warm community that cares for the socially disadvantaged,"" he said.","swearing at flight attendants ,beating an old janitor ,clients assaulting department store ,heeled clients assaulting department ,assaulting department store clerks","['South Korea', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn']",10,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.20110825 0.30041113 0.16189085],KH디지털2,Politics,2,2017,"heeled clients assaulting department store ,swearing at flight attendants ,and swearing at flight attendants ,clients assaulting department store clerks ,drunk son of business tycoon","['South Korea', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Hwang', 'Ban', 'Hwang', 'Gallup Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party', 'an Hee - jung', 'Hwang']",11,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.20110825 0.30041113 0.16189085]
