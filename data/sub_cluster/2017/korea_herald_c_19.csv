And the North Korean leader is putting his money where his mouth is.On the outskirts of Pyongyang, surrounded by snow-covered farms and greenhouses, stands one of Kim's latest pet projects, the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory, which produces 4,200 tons of the iconic Korean pickled vegetable dish a year. The shiny new facility replaces an older factory and opened in June last year after getting Kim's final seal of approval, according to manager Paek Mi Hye. In this Dec. 20, 2017, photo, workers prepare kimchi on the production line at the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory on the outskirts of Pyongyang, North Korea. The factory is a showcase of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s efforts to boost the country’s domestic economy and produce more, and better, consumer products. The strategy, known as “byungjin,” is intended to simultaneously develop the national economy and North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. The factory is intended to showcase Kim's efforts to boost North Korea's domestic economy and produce more, and better, consumer products. His strategy, known as ""byungjin,"" aims to simultaneously develop the national economy and North Korea's nuclear weapons program.North Korea's repeated underground nuclear tests and launches of long-range missiles that could conceivably reach the U.S. mainland have brought more sanctions down on the North than ever before. But outside experts believe the country — while still struggling in many areas — is showing signs of modest economic growth and improved agricultural production. It could be just a year or two away from having an operational, nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.Applied science, according to the North's policymakers, is absolutely essential on all fronts.Kim has transformed the Pyongyang skyline with high-rise apartments to house his prized rocket scientists and nuclear engineers, and Paek repeatedly stressed while giving a tour of the facility to The Associated Press how even an ancient delicacy like kimchi can benefit from scientific innovation.Paek, who accompanied Kim on his ""on-the-spot guidance"" visits, said the factory has 150 workers but is for the most part automated.She said the primary objective of the factory is to operate in a ""scientific manner at every stage."" In kimchi-making, that means inspections all along the production line to ensure quality and hygiene. The factory boasts of a one-of-a-kind ""kimchi analyzer"" to maintain the proper levels of saltiness and lactic acid — its signature ingredient. In this Dec. 20, 2017, photo, manager Paek Mi Hye holds a package of kimchi produced at the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory on the outskirts of Pyongyang, North Korea.

The strategy, known as “byungjin,” is intended to simultaneously develop the national economy and North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Koreans North and South have been making kimchi for generations, often passing family recipes down from mother to daughter or mother-in-law to daughter-in-law.In 2015, UNESCO added kimchi to its ""intangible cultural heritage of humanity"" list, noting that the traditional sharing of know-how and materials to prepare large quantities of kimchi for the winter months ""boosts cooperation among families, villages and communities, contributing to social cohesion.""Paek acknowledged that some people might resist giving up the cherished tradition of communal kimchi-making. ""But they also recognize the quality and reliability of our factory-made product,"" she said.The factory produces eight kimchi products, from the very spicy staple ""tong kimchi,"" which has a red tint and is made of whole cabbages, to a milder variety designed for children. Its kimchi products are distributed to restaurants and grocery stores around Pyongyang.""This is the model,"" Paek said.

The Moon Jae-in administration has been struggling to reopen a solid inter-Korean dialogue channel in a bid to patch up ties that have been strained for nearly a decade.  President Moon Jae-in speaks at a special event in July, marking 200 days until the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. Viewing the Winter Games as an opportunity to ease tension, Seoul has been urging Pyongyang to participate in the Olympics in hopes of turning it into a “peace festival.” It has reiterated the doors for North Korea will be open “until the last minute.”Experts noted that inter-Korean sports exchanges in the past have set precedents for the creation of platforms to revive talks when political and military exchanges were at a standstill. Paik Hak-soon, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, chose “military drills” and “envoys” as keywords that could determine North Korea’s presence at the resort town of PyeongChang.If the South Korean government wants North Korea to come to PyeongChang, “the South Korea-US joint military exercise must be either halted or delayed during the Olympic Truce period,” Paik said in the think tank’s 2018 forecast. Annual joint military drills -- Key Resolve and Foal Eagle -- are expected to coincide with the Winter Olympics and Paralympics. North Korea views these exercises as rehearsals for invasion despite the allies’ reiteration that they are defensive in nature. In a recent interview with NBC, President Moon said he had suggested postponing the drills and the US is “currently reviewing” the possibility, but he also added it all “depends on how North Korea behaves.” “Also, it  must swiftly dispatch an envoy to the North in private to actively suggest and convince its participation in the Olympics,” added Paik, noting that PyeongChang may be the last chance for a while for Seoul to start talks with Pyongyang. But chances North Korea will participate in the upcoming Winter Games are looking slim, although it is also difficult to confirm its absence, according to Paik. North Korea has been maintaining an ambiguous stance toward Seoul’s offer. It missed an Oct. 30 deadline to confirm its pair figure skating spot at the Winter Games, without issuing a public statement. Current circumstances surrounding North Korea’s fast-developing nuclear weapons program are also expected to pose a major obstacle. On Friday, the UN Security Council slapped another round of fresh sanctions on the rogue nation to further curb its economic growth. The decision addresses North Korea’s recent launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov. 29, which experts say could put the US mainland within its target range. Although North Korea lambasted the UNSC’s move as “an act of war,” the Korea Institute for National Unification recently said North Korea may refrain from provocations around the Olympics period. “The atmosphere for dialogue over inter-Korean ties and North Korea’s nuclear weapons may start from May if the North suspends its nuclear and missile provocations during the Olympics, and Seoul and Washington’s military drills are delayed or scaled down,” the institute said.“Pyongyang may deliver a positive message at its annual New Year’s address because President Moon has sent a positive signal to the North with his proposal to delay the annual joint military exercise,” Cho Sung-ryul, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy, said.By Jung Min-kyung","2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,pyeongchang winter olympics questions ,the pyeongchang 2018 olympic ,winter olympics questions remain ,pyeongchang 2018 olympic","['PyeongChang', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Moon Jae -', 'Paraly']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47851953  0.81577706

The iconic Salvation Army red kettles appear at major thoroughfares and Christmas songs and decorations fill the streets. Christmas-theme merchandise, and advertisements for them, fill the shelves and the airwaves. The typical Christmas scene in downtown Seoul could be from any major metropolis around the world. And, just as it has in the West, the days when Christmas was a strictly religious festival are long gone. The fading of the religious tint from Christmas celebrations may be accelerated in Korea by the country’s irreligious population. South Korea, despite the countless neon crucifix-adorned churches, is one of the world’s least religious nations, with more than half saying that they are irreligious. Christians of various denominations number about 13.4 million, or about 27 percent of the South Korean population in 2015, according to Statistics Korea. While the religious meaning of Christmas may be fading here, the year-end celebrations continue to rage on despite Koreans’ perpetual lamentations over the “slow economy.”“The year end, in general, is usually quite busy but around Christmas you really should call and reserve a cab, particularly in popular areas like Hongdae,” Kim Dae-young, a 62 year old taxi driver, said. He added that although earnings are good during this time of the year, he doesn’t fully agree with the materialistic culture that seems to hold sway in Korea.“Young people enjoying themselves is good, but as a Catholic I think things these days are going a bit too far. It’s supposed to be about Jesus, but it seems to be all about drinking and dating.” Cashing in on the atmosphere, many restaurants often offer Christmas menus specifically arranged for couples. Despite prices that are often much higher than usual, trendier establishments require reservations, if not weeks in advance. As the Christmas season also overlaps with year-end parties -- both personal and work-related -- that many Koreans consider a must, December is the season many small businesses look forward to.“About an hour is the normal waiting time. It’s Christmas, nobody seems to want to leave, particularly since they are using company money,” Chang Sang-hyung, a staff at a popular watering hole in southern Seoul said. While such commercial and secular celebrations may set the tone of the Christmas season for the general public, some Christians taken an entirely different approach. Churches of various denominations hold charitable events such as fund raising campaigns around this time of the year, and hold special services. “On Christmas Eve, we gather at the church to attend service, and for a range of events like secret Santa and general celebrations,” Jang Ha-young, a 30-year old professional interpreter, said.“There is also a service on Christmas morning, and different churches engage in a diverse range of charitable events.”For others, Christmas is a holiday for the family, regardless of religion. “I will be going on a trip to Japan with the family this year,” Jun Min-suk, a 36-year old project manager visiting Korea for the holidays, said.

But over the decades that followed, the two nations have strengthened their relations by leaps and bounds, becoming strategic partners and exploring new horizons for a shared sustainable future, Kazakhstan’s top envoy here highlighted last week while celebrating the silver jubilee of bilateral diplomatic relations.Similar to Korea that has achieved its “economic miracle on the Han River,” Kazakhstan is now universally recognized for its rapid growth and modernization since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kazakhstan has become a shining example of progress and globalization in Central Asia, a region long insulated from the world under the Iron Curtain, analysts say. There are currently more than 400 joint economic projects between Kazakh and Korean companies, trade turnover is expected to reach $1.2 billion this year and cumulative bilateral investments have reached $4 billion as of the first half of this year, according to Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Eleven presidential summits have been held since the two nations established their diplomatic relations in 1992. Kazakh Ambassador to Korea Dulat Bakishev  and Kim Chang-kyu, deputy minister and standing commissioner for the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, pose at a reception marking Kazakhstan’s National Day and silver jubilee of diplomatic relations with Korea in Seoul on Thursday “Kazakhstan and Korea are actively cooperating in the international arena promoting global peace, stability and security, including a world free of nuclear weapons,” said Kazakh Ambassador to Korea Dulat Bakishev at a reception in Seoul on Thursday. On Aug. 29 1991, Kazakhstan voluntarily renounced 1,400 nuclear warheads -- then the world’s fourth-largest atomic arsenal -- by closing down the Semipalatinsk test site, a primary experiment ground for the Soviet Union’s atomic arsenal. Kazakhstan has continuously urged the denuclearization of North Korea as an example of successful national development without nuclear weapons capability. “Both countries share common positions on major global issues and fruitfully interact with each another at the United Nations,” he added, noting Astana is a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council for 2017-18. “Under the leadership of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, my country has made significant structural and economic reforms, so that our people today enjoy the fruits of political stability, democracy and free market economy,” the envoy said. Astana has made substantial efforts to be integrated into the global economy in recent years, in large part through China’s “One Belt, One Road” global infrastructure and economic integration initiative. Over the past three years, the country has carried out large-scale infrastructure construction projects and created transport and logistics links to the world’s major markets, Bakishev said.  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev The construction of the nearly 3,000-kilometer Kazakhstan section of the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor has been completed, which will shorten the time needed to transport cargo from the port of Lianyungang in China to St. Petersburg in Russia to 10 days. Via this route, new opportunities for transporting goods between Kazakhstan and Korea using the seaports of Lianyungang, Busan and Incheon can be found, he pointed out. Furthermore, the 900-kilometer Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran railroad corridor has recently been constructed to connect Central Asian countries to the Persian Gulf and the port of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran. The Khorgos-Eastern Gate dry port in eastern Kazakhstan bordering China has been built as the country’s first land port and Central Asia’s largest logistics park.“These new routes have removed constraints on our infrastructures and shortened cargo transport time in all directions,” said the ambassador. “Kazakhstan today is an attractive destination for foreign investment, infrastructure development, logistics, transport and related services.”Kim Chang-kyu, deputy minister and standing commissioner for the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, congratulated Kazakhstan for its “remarkable feats” in achieving political stability, economic development and related international recognition over the last 26 years. “I express my sincere respect to the people of Kazakhstan for their remarkable achievements in pioneering their national destiny,” he said.  Kazakhstsan's capital Astana “Kazakhstan entered a period of economic and political crises following the independence in 1991, with severe shortages in foreign currency, skyrocketing prices of commodities, a lack of food and dilapidated production facilities. But Kazakhstan pressed on unwaveringly on the back of the government’s leadership and unified and tolerant spirit of people of diverse nationalities.”Over the last 25 years, exchanges have grown comprehensively between politicians, parliamentarians and legislators, as well as civilians and students of Kazakhstan and Korea, Kim noted. Some 60,000 people from either side visited the other country in the last year, supported by eight direct flights between Kazakhstan and Korea every week. Noting the administration of Korean President Moon Jae-in is invested in bolstering relations with Central Asian and Eurasian countries, Kim forecast bilateral ties will continue to grow in the future through complementary economic partnerships, especially after Seoul enters into a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union.

People attend a candlelight rally in Seoul on Oct. 28, 2017, the first anniversary of the launch of similar rallies to call for then-President Park Geun-hye`s resignation over an influence-peddling scandal involving her longtime close friend Choi Soon-sil. Park, who took office in February 2013 and is now being detained in jail while on trial over corruption charges, was impeached and removed from office in March for allowing her friend to interfere in state affairs for private gains. The Moon administration, which came to office in May, has pledged far-reaching reforms to remove alleged accumulated ills of previous governments. In July, the presidential state affairs planning advisory panel fleshed out Moon's reform pledges in a five-year policy road map that calls for building a country worthy of being called a country on the foundation of justice, the panel said in a statement, pledging to begin a ""citizens' era based on the candlelight civil revolution.""","2017 group of college ,professors pick fight for ,college professors has picked ,the kyosu sinmun weekly ,group of college professors","['chinese', 'Hasahyeonjeong', 'South Korea', 'Kyosu Sinmun', 'Dec.']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40357572  0.61782014

A project led by the central government and Incheon Metropolitan City, the educational complex has the campuses of five universities ranking in the top 100 in the global university index.  National and local governments have invested about 1 trillion won  in the IGC, aiming to host 10 prestigious universities there. They envision the IGC, located in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, as a regional educational hub where about 10,000 students study at modern, state-of-the-art facilities. At the project’s launch in 2007, the State University of New York Korea became the first university to open a campus at IGC in 2012. George Mason University Korea opened two years later, followed by the University of Utah Asia Campus and Ghent University Global Campus in September that year. The IGC welcomed a new educational institute in September, the Fashion Institute of Technology, one of the top five colleges in the world specializing in fashion design and business management. Graduation assessment and overall educational management is done by the schools’ main campus in their respective home countries. This is designed to allow students to acquire degrees from renowned world universities while still studying inside South Korea at a much more affordable cost. Each class at the IGC universities is taught in English. Students come from both Korea and abroad and are exposed to a global learning atmosphere, presenting the opportunity for students to build networks of people with different cultural backgrounds while receiving a high-quality education.SUNY Korea, which produced the first graduates among the universities here in January this year, held its third graduation ceremony Thursday, and now has the largest number of graduates, with 108.The education offered at IGC helps students pursue their dream careers. The graduates have landed jobs at global companies including Korean Air, LG Electronics in Iran, Facebook Singapore and Genesem, a semiconductor company in Songdo International City.The first graduation ceremony will be held for George Mason University Korea on Saturday. The 12 students are already off to a good start, getting jobs at multinational corporations such as accountings firm KPMG. University President Angel Cabrera will deliver the graduation certificates. After the ceremony, a homecoming event will be held to invite all alumni of the university who reside and work in Korea. The University of Utah Asia Campus had its first graduation in the main campus in Utah in the United States in May. Fourteen of the 17 graduates attended, receiving bachelor’s and master’s degrees. To celebrate the next graduation event, which will be the first held at IGC, President David W. Pershing from the main campus will visit the country in March. Ghent University Global Campus expects its first graduation in 2018.

The mayor became the first Korean politician to receive the prestigious honor given to political and cultural figures around the world, such as former President of Israel Shimon Peres and Karl Lagerfeld, creative director of fashion house Chanel.Since 1911, the Council of Paris has been awarding the medal to figures who have contributed to building cooperative relationship with Paris or advancing the development of art, culture, or sports. Seoul and Paris have been working closely especially in the environment sector, such as shaping policies for urban restoration and air quality improvement, the city government said. Earlier this year in March, Seoul, Paris and London jointly announced the creation of a system to grade vehicles based on their emissions in real-life conditions, after growing uncertainty about automakers efforts to skirt rules intended to limit pollutants. “Seoul and Paris share many things in common. Projects such as pedestrian-friendly roads and measures to fight climate change are what both of our cities eye on,” said Park as he received the medal.Since both cities have a lot to learn from each other, programs such as employee exchanges can accelerate the development of the two cities, Park said. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who received an honorary citizenship of Seoul in October, will visit Seoul in February to get an insight from Seoul’s urban restoration projects. In 2014, Paris announced an urban restoration plan called “Reinventer Paris ” to transform underutilized city spaces.Park arrived in Paris on Tuesday to attend the One Planet Summit, marking the second anniversary of the Paris Agreement.The summit is co-sponsored by the French government, the United Nations, and the World Bank. Park is attending as the district government representative and president of Local Governments of Sustainability, at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron.During the summit, Park emphasized the most important part of responding to climate change is citizen participation, giving the example of the city government’s “2022 Solarcity Plan” which the city government announced last month that it will inject 1.7 trillion won  to ensure one out of three households in the city are equipped with solar panels in five years. By Kim Da-sol","seoul mayor awarded paris ,wednesday seoul mayor park ,mayor awarded paris highest ,wednesday seoul mayor ,said wednesday seoul mayor","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Paris ’', 'Grand Vermeil', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Paris', 'Anne Hidalgo', 'Paris', 'korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45575517  0.56522417

Some 360 guests, including military officers and noncommissioned members, diplomats, members of the KAFS and their spouses, participated in the event at Millennium Seoul Hilton. Music performances were provided by Songpa-gu Boys and Girls Choir. “Despite the tumultuous international relations surrounding the Korean Peninsula, with a growing possibility of conflict between the US and China, the relationship between Korea and America should be strengthened,” said KAFS President Han Chul-soo, former general and deputy commander in chief of the ROK-US Combined Forces Command. “Based on the alliance, Korea has deterred war on the peninsula, maintained peace for the last seven decades, enrooted democracy and become one of the world’s top 11 economic powerhouses.”Members of the Korea America Friendship Society post at the annual year-end reception at Millennium Seoul Hilton on Dec. 5. Seoul, Washington and their international allies and partners should enhance cooperation to counter the escalating threats from the North, Han stressed. He added that the security-based bilateral alliance has evolved into a comprehensive one, including an advanced economic partnership. Mark Knapper, charge d’affaires ad interim the US Embassy in Seoul, said 2017 was a busy year culminating in the state visit of US President Donald Trump to Korea, preceded by Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence who came to Korea. “We see these visits as really critical for helping strengthen our bilateral relationship as we face critical issues not just here on the peninsula but around the world,” Knapper said. “We see our alliance bound by not only our shared sacrifice in the battlefield, but also as a friendship that is strengthened every day through our economic, cultural and many other ties.”General Kim Byeong-joo, deputy commander of the ROK-US Combined Forces Command, underscored that the alliance is not only signed on paper but forged in blood in the battlefield. “The KAFS has served as a reliable supporter of our alliance for the past 27 years,” he said, adding the organization has helped deepen friendship through seminars, ceremonies and cultural activities for veterans and soldiers.

In celebration of the rotational presidency of the Visegrad Group -- also known as the V4, an alliance of four Central European states the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia -- the Hungarian Embassy held the concert “European Quartet One Melody” at the JCC Art Center in Seoul on Wednesday. The Central European Jazz Connection, an internationally acclaimed quartet comprised of musicians from the four countries, played harmonized melodies. Hungarian trumpeter and flugelhorn player Fekete Kovacs Kornel, Slovakian guitarist Matus Jakabcic, Polish pianist Kuba Stankiewicz and Czech bassist Tomas Baros played their tunes as they have done in major cities around the world. The V4 group -- named after the historical Hungarian town, Visegrad, north of Budapest on the Danube -- was established in February, 1991, among the erstwhile Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, with their collective aim of joining the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Since Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, the group became an association of the four nations. In 2014, Korea and V4 launched their “V4+ROK” cooperation mechanism -- part of the “V4+” channels between the nations and their major partners around the world -- encompassing political dialogue, social exchange, tourism, science and technology and innovation.

At weekends, I get too tired, sleep or do work I couldn’t get done during the week,” Park Geun-young, 35, told The Korea Herald. “I feel like I have no life here.”A group calling for the revision of labor laws for fairer working conditions holds a rally outside the National Assembly on Nov. 15. A picket reads “over-work death out,” referring to deaths allegedly caused by the physical strain brought on by excessive work. Yonhap“I am stressed about the social atmosphere that pushes me to compare myself to others and compete for better pay, a better house and better education for my children all the time,” said the office worker. “All I want is to be happy and enjoy the moment without having to care about what others think.”For Park, who lived in Australia for two years, the remaining option is to leave the country and find hope elsewhere. “I know that life abroad wouldn’t be perfect, but at least, I think my work-life balance will be improved and I could enjoy the present more,” she said. She is not alone in feeling disenchanted about life in South Korea and seeking to escape from it.“We constantly receive inquiries from Koreans seeking to move to other countries for job opportunities and education for children,” said an official from a privately-run Boram Emigration Corporation. According to a survey on 3,710 Korean adults conducted by a job portal site Incruit from Nov. 28 to Dec. 5, 62.7 percent of the respondents agreed that South Korea is a “Hell Joseon.”“Hell Joseon” is a term coined in 2015, which harks back to the five-century-long, feudal Joseon dynasty’s class system and lampoons a growing inequality between the haves and not-haves in Korean society.The survey showed that some 54 percent of them had considered moving abroad. Their favored destination was Canada at 25.2 percent, followed by New Zealand at 21.2 percent, Singapore at 8.6 percent and Australia at 8.1 percent. More than half of them, 56 percent, said that they were willing to give up their Korean nationality if they succeeded in settling in another country.A desire to leave Korea seems to be more prevalent among the young generation who struggle to find a job amid the high unemployment rate. The youth unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 29 was 8.6 percent in October, hitting an all-time low. After they land a job, many struggle to find a balance between family and work in the country, where people on average work 2,069 hours per year as of 2016, the second longest among member counties of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. In a 2015 poll by a market research firm by Macromill Embrain on 1,000 adults, 57.9 percent said that they would not want to be born again in South Korea. In a survey that allowed multiple-choice answers, 76.6 percent of the respondents said that they wanted to live in a country where they can be more relaxed, 62.9 percent said they wanted to live in a country with a solid welfare system and 61.7 percent said they wanted to get out of the fierce competition in society.  Canada Carrer Immigration Fair But the reason they want to leave Korea is not just about the fierce competition. It is more about frustration and helplessness stemming from a social structure which seems to benefit only those who are privileged, said a 30-year-old student. “I think that the competition in Korean society is not something I can get over through efforts,” said the student, who only wanted to be identified by his surname Jung. “For someone like me without a good educational background and wealthy parents, there are only limited opportunities to enter the system.”A series of irregularities in society laid bare by a corruption scandal that removed former President Park Geun-hye from power in March and sent many of high-profile government officials and business tycoons to jail further eroded hope for the future, he said. “I cannot put my children through such an unfair system and I want them to live in a less competitive society,” Jung said. Kim Bong-moon, 31, who quit a job as a journalist, studied IT through a masters’ program at a university in New Zealand and moved to the country last year, said that he has no regrets about leaving Korea. “On the surface, my life in Korea was not bad and I was confident that I could do well in the competition,” said Kim, who now works as an engineer. “But by living that way, I realized that there would be nothing left for me. It was not a sustainable way of living.”“One of the major difference between life in Korea and life in New Zealand is that I don’t have to lock myself in a cycle  and can be on equal footing with everyone,” he said. “And people are more accepting of differences.”But he warned about fantasizing about moving outside of Korea. “Moving abroad doesn’t guarantee one’s happiness or solve all the problems from Korea.” Lee Byung-hoon, a sociology professor at Chung-Ang University, said that the ‘Hell Joseon’ phenomenon is a reflection of South Koreans of all ages struggling to survive amid a lack of jobs and unstable livelihoods. “By objective yardsticks, South Korea is better off than many other countries. But South Koreans feel discontent because of an inequality of opportunity. They feel like the playing field is uneven in the first place and their efforts will not pay off,” he said.“Such a problem has been developing for a long time, so it won’t change overnight,” he said. “The government should work to improve protection for the marginalized and improve the fairness of society through policies.”","korea dazzles the world ,joseon south korea dazzles ,sensational pop music cutting ,elsewhere many south koreans ,koreans want to leave","['South Korea', 'South Koreans']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57702708  0.55880821

The current law requires a state-issued license, but the majority of users are not aware of related regulations.  Two districts in Seoul will be designated as PMD test areas in 2018 to explore the effectiveness of the envisioned regulations. After the test period, the city plans to evaluate the results and move to revise the related laws. About 60,000 PMDs were sold in Korea last year.

As ASEAN generally suffers from a shortage and dilapidation of infrastructure, Korea’s expertise in industrial and infrastructural development comes in handy, particularly in the frontier fields of smart transportation, renewable energy and information and communication technology, industry experts said at the fifth ASEAN Connectivity Forum on Wednesday.The event was jointly organized by the ASEAN-Korea Center and Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and invited many high-level government officials, financial institution and corporate executives, scholars and journalists from ASEAN and Korea. Participants pose for a picture at the fifth ASEAN Connectivity Forum on Wednesday. Experts from multilateral development banks offered comprehensive overviews of financing and procurement through the public-private partnership arrangement; ASEAN government representatives presented the latest information on key connectivity-related projects; and Korean investors and ASEAN company representatives engaged in one-on-one business meetings. “Recently, we have seen positive signs that global private capital is increasingly invested in developing countries’ infrastructure projects,” said Bambang Brodjonegoro, Indonesian minister of national development planning. “Multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, Asian Infrastructure Development Bank and Asian Development Bank, as well as government agencies of developing countries have assisted the PPP framework in most ASEAN countries, to attract more private sector and foreign investments in infrastructure projects.”ASEAN needs $3.3 billion of investment in its transportation, water, energy and ICT infrastructures through 2030, the second-largest demand in the world after the Middle East, according to a report by McKinsey and Co. The region’s combined population of 670 million people and combined gross domestic product of $2.6 trillion present gigantic commercial opportunities, experts say. “Korean President Moon Jae-in’s vision for a ‘future Korea-ASEAN community’ comprises people-to-people exchanges, security cooperation and economic collaboration, a goal ASEAN and Korea can pursue together,” said Yoon Soon-gu, Korea’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs. Seoul will provide an additional $100 million to its Global Infrastructure Fund for increased investment in ASEAN by 2022, he added.ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary General Kim Young-sun speaks at the 5th ASEAN Connectivity Forum on Nov. 29 Son Byeong-suk, Korea’s vice minister of land, infrastructure and transport, said the forum will help formulate different models of strategic collaboration between the two regions’ governments and companies, financial institutions and technical centers.“I firmly believe that combining ASEAN’s boundless growth potential and the people’s passion for national development on one hand, with Korea’s experience, technology and financing on the other hand, would contribute greatly to both their economic growth,” said Son. ASEAN is Korea’s second-largest trade partner and top investment destination, and the two sides are working to reach $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. Since the entry into force of the ASEAN-Korea Trade in Goods Agreement in June 2007, bilateral trade in goods has grown by 9.2 percent annually, reaching $125 billion last year and making Korea ASEAN’s fifth-largest trade partner.“The Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity 2025 targets five strategic areas of sustainable infrastructure, digital innovation, seamless logistics, regulatory excellence and people mobility,” said Ambassador Elizabeth P. Buensuceso, chair of the Committee of Permanent Representatives to ASEAN and ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee. “By 2025, we should like to have increased infrastructure investments, higher infrastructural productivity and more application of smart city models throughout ASEAN.” By Joel Lee","asean connectivity 2025 blueprints ,for asean connectivity 2025 ,plan for asean connectivity ,asean connectivity woos smart ,asean connectivity 2025","['ASEAN', 'Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'ASEAN', 'Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26259342  0.30666122

But the case of a skin impression preserved in a dinosaur footprint is very rare,"" Paik said.The discovery of the skin impression suggests that some sauropod dinosaurs in the Cretaceous had a well-developed polygonal skin texture covering nearly the whole of their foot pads, as seen in modern elephants, which would increase stability when walking on muddy and wet ground.The team's findings were published in the latest edition of Scientific Reports, part of Nature, the prestigious international journal.","on sauropod dinosaur footprint ,south korean research team ,sauropod dinosaur footprint from ,dinosaur footprint found ,sauropod dinosaur footprint","['south korean', 'South Korea', 'Pukyong National University', 'Gunbuk', 'Haman', 'South Gye']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35589164  0.6138829

If no one claims the items, they are handed over to police stations, where they are kept for nine more months until they become property of the state. Lost-and-found items are stored for 7 days at the subway station, before they are moved to a police station. The amount of money found on Subway Line Nos. 1 to 8 between January 2014 and December 2016 showed a yearly upward climb. In 2014, 340 million won was reported missing. The figure climbed to 460 million won in 2015 and 590 million won in 2016. During the period, approximately 130 million won went to police stations, as their owners did not turn up.

After the Olympics, the facilities should remain as a sports heritage, and be used as a foundation to promote winter sports in the nation and build a healthy society,"" Kim Tae-dong of the Research Institute for Gangwon claimed in a paper titled ""The Use of Winter Olympic Facilities as Legacy."" ""It's common for most Olympic facilities to be operated at the national level as shown in other cases at home and abroad,"" Kim said, while reminding that the International Olympic Committee designates Olympic facilities as one of the five Olympic heritages. The Korea Sports Promotion Foundation was set up after the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics with the event's profits and state funds used to manage its facilities.The 1980 Lake Placid, 1988 Calgary, 2002 Salt Lake and 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympiads have also managed their facilities as legacies with the federal government's financial support and profits from the events, he claimed. ""In particular, the facilities for speed skating, hockey, skiing and ski jumping of the PyeongChang Olympics should be administered later by the state as they all are very low in profitability,"" he said, insisting a special law be enacted to provide financial assistance to their post-event management.

But Pyongyang has since remained mum on the matter and made no attempts to communicate so far, said NBC sports, citing the International Skating Union. It also added that by ISU rules, the spot initially occupied by the North Korean skaters will eventually be offered to Japan, a top contender who has not already qualified. “It is up to the North Korean Olympic Committee to decide whether they will participate or not,” Ryom and Kim’s coach, Kim Hyon-son, said after the Berlin competition, according to the New York Times.Despite North Korea’s lack of response, it still has a chance to compete in the Winter Games as the International Olympic Committee has hinted it may grant special wild card slots to North Korean athletes. IOC President Thomas Bach said and offered to provide support if necessary.The committee said in September it could cover the costs of their athletics equipment if the North asked for support. Seoul has repeatedly urged its neighbor to participate in the upcoming Winter Games to turn the event into a “peace festival.” President Moon Jae-in and South Korea’s top officials reiterated that the doors for North Korea will remain open until the last minute. Many saw North Korea’s nearly 70-day hiatus in military provocations as a sign of willingness to talk, but the rogue nation shattered expectations by launching a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday. It is capable of reaching the US mainland, experts in both South Korea and the US said. The latest missile liftoff sparked concerns here on the possibility of hosting the games amid mounting tensions on the Korean Peninsula. “As the PyeongChang Winter Olympics and the South Korea-US military exercise happen to coincide with each other, how to resolve this situation is an important task,” Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said at a Seoul forum on Thursday, referring to a joint military exercise between South Korea and the US that usually takes place in March and April. A senior Cheong Wa Dae official told reporters Friday that despite the North’s latest missile launch, its presence at the Olympics is expected alleviate ongoing tensions on the peninsula. Whether the military drill will be delayed or scrapped remains undecided, he said.The IOC is considering inviting North Korea’s IOC member to its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to address its stance toward the upcoming games. Last month, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution upholding peaceful and safe passage for all participating nations during the Olympic period. It was submitted by the South Korean government in September in a bid to halt all conflicts during the athletic events. North Korea in November also skipped the final competition of the ISU World Cup Short Track in Seoul, which was considered as a last chance to qualify for the Olympic Games. North Korea only competed at the first two events of the four short track World Cups and the Olympic quotas were filled based on the top three winners who participated in all four rounds. The organizing committee for PyeongChang told Yonhap News Agency on Friday it is taking a “wait-and-see approach” on North Korea’s participation. The Olympic participation is apparently a sensitive issue in Pyongyang as well, an official there said.

The Korean government constructed five large oil storage tanks for national energy security amid an oil crisis in the 1970s. The place was abandoned after its operation was halted in 2000. The sixth tank was built last year as part of the depot’s renewal. Mapo Cultural Depot Park. Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentMaking use of this site was one of the first projects Mayor Park Won-soon initiated after he took office. Park’s main question was how to maximize the potential of the old 11,510-square-meter space. “Through six rounds of public hearings and contests in which citizens, students and city construction experts participated, a public consensus was constructed that the site should be renewed into an eco-friendly culture complex,” said Choi Hyoun-sil, director of the parks development division under the city government. A detailed blue print was unveiled earlier this year, which focused on transforming the site into a place for cultural events, performing arts and exhibitions. “By taking into account the fact that the area around the storage was the city’s garbage dump and that it is close to major performance venues such as the Sangam World Cup Stadium and the Digital Media Center, the city government decided that it would be appropriate to build a culture park on the site,” said Heo Seo-goo, architect and CEO of Wondoshi Architects Group, which designed the culture park. Mapo Cultural Depot Park. Seoul Metropolitan Government“Although the surrounding area had seen a rapid pace of makeovers for the past 10 years or so, the oil storage site had remained a remnant of the industrial age,” Heo said.Instead of demolishing the former oil storage facility, the city government decided to keep the 15-meter tank walls and retain the natural topography of the area as much as possible. The facility was 10 times larger than Seoul Plaza.Heo highlighted how the storage tanks have been revamped. “These tanks were empty and still are empty, although they have been transformed into exhibition halls and concert halls. The unique beauty of these massive oil tanks will provide joy and fun to citizens,” he said.Following its grand opening in September, over a thousand people have visited Mapo Cultural Depot Park, which has walking trails and eateries. Out of the original five tanks, tank one has become a multipurpose pavilion made of glass. A design festival was recently held there. Tank two serves as an outdoor amphitheater with a wall of cascading green vines and concrete stones scattered around that can be used as seats or tables. Tanks three, four and five are spaces for exhibitions and cultural events. Tank six -- the largest -- serves as an information center. It also houses a cafe on the bottom floor.Mapo Cultural Depot Park represents a new model for public development through renewal, Seoul City said.“Without wide public discussion such as contests, civic forums and expert workshops, it would have been impossible to come up with the best idea -- to have the old oil reserve reborn into a place for every citizen,” said Lee Je-won, director of urban planning at Seoul City. “We are committed to making this place a new landmark of Seoul.”By Kim Da-sol","old oil depot reborn ,constructed five large oil ,decades old oil depot ,seoul mapo oil depot ,oil depot reborn","['Mapo Oil Depot', 'Maebongsan', 'Seoul', 'Mapo Cultural Depot Park', 'korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26159     0.28744894

Anyone from the neighboring country who fits the required criteria will be eligible for a 15-day stay in South Korea without a visa, starting Dec. 1 through the end of March next year, the ministry said in a statement. The no-visa applicant must be a Chinese citizen with records of arrival and departure in and from Korea with a legal visa issued by the Korean authorities in the last five years. The applicant also needs to have an entry ticket to the Olympic Games, purchased through designated Chinese travel agencies, among other requirements.  The applicant's request will be denied if he or she is either convicted of a crime in violation of Korean laws, or holds an extradition record or a history of illegal stay, the ministry said. The move comes amid signs of a diplomatic thaw between Seoul and Beijing over a prolonged trade spat stemming from Korea's deployment of the THAAD advanced US missile defense system. Beijing had banned its travel agencies from selling group tours to its citizens in protest of the deployment, dealing a blow to tourism-related industries in Korea. But following the summit earlier this month between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, Korea seems to be getting back on track with its Chinese tourist tallies. The justice ministry also said it will temporarily allow individual Chinese tourists to land here by ship next year, on top of groups from cruise ships already being permitted into the nation. Additionally, the ministry said the length of stay for cruises entering ports near PyeongChang during the games will be extended to five days from the current three days.","pyeongchang winter olympic games ,winter olympic games anyone ,without visa starting dec ,olympics south korea justice ,chinese around pyeongchang olympics","[""South Korea 's"", 'Chinese', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45090464  0.50559193

The Paralympics are scheduled from March 9-19 in the same location. Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon ""What's most important is to host the PyeongChang Olympics in a stable atmosphere,"" he said.The allies have not announced the start date for the major exercises, named Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, but they usually kick off the war games in late February or early March.The North has long described the drills as a rehearsal for invasion and used them as an excuse for provocations.Defense sources said earlier that South Korea may request that the US postpone the training to avoid an overlap with Olympic events.The minister was doubtful about the secretive communist nation's claim that it has completed the nuclear weapons development.Emboldened by the successful launch of what it claims to be a new intercontinental ballistic missile Wednesday, the North announced that it has completed the establishment of the country's ""nuclear force.""Cho said the government's view is that it might be a ""hasty"" declaration.""Until recently, there were indications that North Korea has faced limits in connection with atmospheric re-entry technology, guiding and sending  to an intended point, and blowing up  at a timing it wants,"" he added.","war games that pyongyang ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympic ,pyeongchang winter olympic games ,pyeongchang 2018 minister concerned ,us war games south","[""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'US']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.48358491  0.71525365

The Olympics Information Call Center will join hands with Korea Tourism Organization‘s calling number ’1330‘ and provide assistance in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese, starting from late November to March 2018. It is said that 19 to 23 call center operators will be on stand-by to help those in need of assistance related to the Olympics. With just 70 days left ahead of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics, Gangwon Province vowed to push ahead to alleviate the accommodation problem. Gov. Choi Moon-soon’s first priority is to actualize policies regarding accommodation prices‘ stabilization by expanding the number of bookable rooms in the region that are reasonably priced. In order to expand the number of bookable facilities available to Olympic Games’ visitors, the number of rooms bookable at good quality facilities, such as large-scale hotels and resorts, will be promoted first such that general visitors can make reservations early on. It is currently estimated that there are 44 large-scale facilities and 15,322 rooms that are a 1-hour journey the Olympic Games events, but most run on a ‘members-only’ policy. Visitors can only reserve a room at these places 30 days prior to their intended stay.  Gangwon Gov. Choi Moon-soon  speaks at a press meeting on Monday.Recent negotiating talks between Gangwon Province and hotels and resorts have successfully ended in mutual agreement to provide 4,904 bookable rooms in 17 facilities, starting from December. Furthermore, Gangwon Province plans on future negotiating talks with 27 facilities under Daemyung and Hanhwa Resort to vitalize both early reservations for the 10,418 rooms and the overall region during the Winter Olympics. Because most large-scale hotels are located in a nearby city of PyeongChang, a free shuttle bus will be provided for visitors‘ convenience in going back-and-forth from the Olympics events to the hotels and resorts. To observe an increase in early reservations for hotel accommodations, Gangwon Province and Booking.com plan on holding a joint press conference, explaining the details regarding activating the reservation system. Moreover, to stabilize prices in accommodation during the Winter Olympics, Gangwon Province plans on encouraging hotels to participate in rational pricing policies by providing firm guidance and inspection on price information. In efforts to prohibit any facilities from overcharging visitors, a call center for those wanting to make a report regarding accommodation, prices such as overcharging practices, will be in place. Visitors can call the following numbers: 1330, 033-249-3186, 033-660-3023, 033-330-2303. Follow-up investigations will be strictly enforced. Those found to be guilty of overcharging practices will be excluded from any support the Gangwon Province provides during the Winter Olympics. Also, a full-on tax report investigation will be conducted on those businesses. A special safety inspection on all 1,404 facilities in PyeongChang and nearby cities will be routinely carried through in order to eradicate any unreasonable pricing in business operations, starting from December to the end of PyeongChang Olympics. On top of issuing facilities’ owners reasonable room pricing information, the policies will help accommodations avoid any empty rooms during the Olympics and provide visitors with accurate, reasonable room pricing and transportation. Gov. Choi also predicted that with the opening of high-speed KTX train service, which connects the gateway city of Incheon to Gangwon Province via Seoul within an hour, will result in an increase in room prices in Seoul if the cost of a room in PyeongChang remains high. Most importantly, Gov. Choi also vowed to make Gangwon Province a year-round tourist spot.

Seoul Metro said the operator will impose a total ban on plastic surgery advertising when making contracts with advertising agencies from now, and enforce a stricter review of advertisements by launching a new review board. The plans were made following many complaints from the public, according to the Seoul Metro.

The PyeongChang Olympics runs from Feb. 9-25 in several cities in Gangwon Province, but ticket sales have been lagging partly due to difficulties in booking affordable accommodations near the sports venues.With rooms in brand hotels and resorts already booked by the organizing committee, individual visitors have found it hard to reserve decent places in Pyeongchang, Gangneung and other cities. PyeongChang will host some skiing and sliding events, while Gangneung, some 20 kilometers east of PyeongChang, will host all ice events. Jeongseon, about 20 kilometers south of PyeongChang, will be home to alpine skiing.The average prices for cheap accommodations go over 500,000 won  per night, more than triple the peak season prices, with a pension with a spacious room asking for 1.8 million won per night.Some business owners even refuse to take reservations from individual travelers, while others ask for more than is shown on the official booking system. In response to rising complaints, the provincial government released a set of measures to increase the number of rooms available during the sports events and encourage local business owners to offer rooms at reasonable prices. ""Excessive room rates would only hurt local tourism,"" a provincial government official in charge of accommodation policy said. ""Business owners will have to set up reasonable rates soon if they do not want to leave their rooms empty during the Olympic period.""The provincial government also plans to operate a call center to link foreigners to local business owners in the run up to the games.As a high speed train linking between Seoul and Gangneung is set to operate starting from Dec. 22, industry officials expect some travelers may opt for hotels in the capital city and use the train that takes less than two hours to get to major venues.

Seoul Rotary Club.Seoul is home to the first Rotary club established in Korea, chartered in 1927. Today, Korea has the fourth largest Rotary club with 1,616 sub-clubs and 19 district clubs, with over 62,300 Rotarians in Korea.The club mainly serves to support the organization‘s top philanthropic goal of eradicating polio. Since 1985, Seoul Rotary club participated in donating more than $14 million to polio eradication. “In addition to contributing funds, Korean Rotary members have traveled at their own expense to immunize children against polio in India,” Han Tae-sook, head of the Seoul Rotary Club, told The Korea Herald. The history of Seoul Rotary Club dates back to early 1900s.With the initiative of Bishop Boaz of the Southern Methodist Church, the club received its official Charter in 1927 and was designated as Rotary International club No. 2703. The original charter membership consisted of 21 members, 4 of which were Korean, such as the founder of Korea University Kim Seong-soo and the president of Chosun Fire Insurance Han Sang-yong.

Recently, some of these spaces were unveiled to the public for the first time under a special one-month tour program. Although city-run tours of the “ghost station” in Sinseol-dong and the air-raid shelter underneath Gyeonghuigung Palace are to end this weekend, one underneath Yeouido, turned into a museum, will remain open for visitors. Ghost station A pair of purple doors hides a secret platform that has been sealed off to the public for over four decades underneath Sinseol-dong Station. One floor below the busy Sinseol-dong station, this ghost station has been regularly awaken by passing trains, though, as those finishing the day’s work run on its rails in the darkness on their way to the garage. The platform was constructed in 1974, but the route plan changed and it has never been used by passengers. On the wall at one end of the platform hangs a sign “11-3 Sinseol-dong,” so dusty and worn that it is hard to make out, reflecting the time passed since it was put up. Sinseol-dong station’s secret platform did not arouse much public interest until location scouts for film and music videos became interested in its unique atmosphere and setting. The Korean film “Cold Eyes” and music videos by some of K-pop’s most popular groups, such as EXO and Twice, were shot here prompting viewers to call the hidden platform “ghost station.” The “ghost station” under the Sinseol-dong subway station During the tour program that runs through Nov. 26, the dark tunnel was opened to the public for the first time in 44 years. Registrations for the tour program quickly filled up in October. A Seoul City official said no decision had been made on its future use, including whether or not to hold the tours again next year. Secret presidential hideout In the financial district of Yeouido, a secret bunker is hidden below the Yeouido Bus Transfer Center, and is now being used as a public museum. Nothing was known about the underground shelter before it was discovered in 2005, when the city was constructing the bus transfer center there. The 871-square-meter area was flooded when it was first found and it had sofa sets, a toilet and a shower booth inside. The city looked into aerial photographs of the surface area taken in the past and finally concluded that the bunker was likely to have been constructed in 1977. They also believe it was created as a secret hideout for the dictator at the time, Park Chung-hee, as it is located right below where the stage was placed for the Armed Forces Day event in 1977. The interior of a secret underground bunker in Yeouido The city gathered ideas from citizens and turned the area into an art exhibition space, but left everything where they found it, except for installing safety and air conditioning facilities. A box that was found full of keys is displayed there along with modern art pieces now. The Seoul Museum of Art, which launched on Oct. 19, is open from Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and entrance is free. Air-raid shelter underneath palace Just below the historic Gyeonghuigung in Jongno is a secret air-raid shelter that is sealed off from the outside world by a thick, blueish iron gate.This door, which stands out in the grassy surroundings, leads to a hidden space that dates back to South Korea’s Japanese colonial period from 1910-1945. Located below what used to be the site of the king and queen’s bedroom, the underground shelter is thought to have been built in 1944 as an annex to the communication base station at that time. It appears to have been protecting the network facilities against possible air-raids during the warring period. Its outer concrete wall appears to be about 3 meters thick and the ceiling, 8.5 meters thick. The gate of an air-raid shelter on the compound of Gyeonghuigung Palace The site is left in its original state with its old, cracked walls and holes. It was discovered in the 1980s during excavation which was part of preparations for the restoration of Gyeonghuigung. The two-story area is divided into 10 rooms and a hallway, with the rooms ceilings open as to provide a view inside of the rooms on the second floor. On the attic-like second floor is a gate reduced to rubble, which is assumed to have connected the shelter with the palace. Seoul City has installed special sound effects of the emergency siren and one resembling an air raid, to re-enact how it might have felt to use the shelter, and to add to the eerie and cold atmosphere. The shelter is now managed by Seoul Museum of History. During the tour program, 960 citizens visited. Previously the area was opened only for educational purposes for middle and high school students from 2014 to 2016.

Seoul City further hopes to change the remaining 3,000 buses from 2026. An electric bus model with a 300-kilometer range was recently produced, enabling the plan. Previous models, able to run between 100 to 200 kilometers with a single charge, were difficult to utilize for long-distance routes. City officials are worried that some bus operators might disagree with the new plan. It is to offer a subsidy of 250 million won  to the operators for buying a single electric bus, which costs around 500 million won. The operators would have to cover for the remaining 200 million won for each bus. Previously, with the CNG bus which costs around 200 million won, the government and the operators shared the burden equally, paying 100 million won each. Operators have to pay an extra 100 million won with the new change. “There is a supplementary burden for the operators. Electric buses, however, do not charge fuel,” a city official said. “Local buses are one of the main reasons for the fine dust in the city. This is a policy to ameliorate the atmosphere and make Seoul better.”By Im Eun-byel","starting 2018 electric buses ,buses in 2018 hyundai ,seoul city announced thursday ,electric buses will replace ,2018 electric buses","['Seoul City', 'Hyundai Motors']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48444989  0.40697309

Latvia waded through devastating foreign reigns, but preserved its indigenous spirit, culture and language, a historical path that has similarly molded the modern Korean psyche. Akin to South Korea perennially under the menace of its bellicose northern neighbor, Latvia has had to confront increasingly assertive Russia on its eastern flank.But these adversities have strengthened their national characters: Korea achieved its rapid postwar development as one of the “Four Asian Tigers,” while Latvia has steadily punched above its weight by adroitly aligning with European institutions and its Baltic neighbors to engage with far-flung economic powerhouses around the world. The freedom-loving northern European country commemorates the 100th anniversary of the declaration of independence next year, when Korea will host its first-ever PyeongChang Olympic Games. Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis will visit Korea on a maiden state visit to mark the occasion.Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars  and his spouse Rina  greet Georgian Ambassador to Korea Otar Berdzenishvili  at the National Day reception in Seoul on Friday, which celebrated Latvia’s 99th anniversary of state proclamation on Nov. 18, 1918. Latvia and Korea’s growing partnership and friendship were on full display at the National Day reception in Seoul on Friday, which celebrated Latvia’s 99th anniversary of state proclamation on Nov. 18, 1918 from the Russian Empire.“I would like to underline the continuing strong ties between Latvia and Korea since we established our diplomatic relations 26 years ago,” said Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars in a speech. “We have been blessed with all our Korean partners’ friendship and eagerness.”Vaivars, who previously served in Japan, is the first resident Latvian ambassador to Korea. The embassy opened in September 2015 and moved to Hannam-dong in March. The Korean Embassy was inaugurated in Latvian capital Riga in 2013.“Despite our geographical distance, Korea and Latvia share many similarities in history,” said Yoon Soon-gu, Korean deputy minister for political affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Both our countries endured and overcame hardships throughout our histories, fought for national independence and successfully developed democratic and prosperous nations.” Korea and Latvia became full-fledged members of the United Nations on Dec. 17, 1991, and have been contributing to world peace and security as well as universal human rights and development, he added. Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars In late October last year, Ojars Eriks Kalnins, chairman of the Latvia Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, made an official visit to Korea marking the 25th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations. Rep. Shim Jae-kwon, chairman of the Korean National Assembly’s Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, reciprocated by visiting Riga during Patriots’ Week, a time of remembrance and celebration in Latvia. Latvia is a member of the European Union and eurozone, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, among other multilateral institutions. It joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in July last year, a membership poised to curb corruption and inequality and be a catalyst for domestic structural reforms targeting international trade and investment, innovation, education, health and labor.Latvia is a Baltic tourism jewel with pristine nature, architectural splendor and an abundance of cultural heritage. The country has made efforts to spotlight its tourism abroad by cooperating with Baltic neighbors Estonia and Lithuania and presenting themselves as an integrated region for travel and business. The three nations are part of the Schengen Area: a zone comprising 26 European states that have abolished passport and border control at their mutual borders to encourage unrestricted travel. No visas are required to travel across the three countries for Koreans. The three states all use the euro currency. Incheon Seo-gu Girls and Boys Choir performs at the Latvian National Day reception on Friday. Riga -- the European Cultural Capital in 2014 -- is the largest city in the Baltic States and home to one-third of Latvia’s 2 million people. The Latvian capital is strewn with Art Nouveau and other architectures dating back to the Middle Ages, earning it the nickname “Pearl of the Baltic Sea.” Riga’s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 for its ample stock of buildings constructed between the 16th and 19th centuries. The city offers myriad festivals and art performances throughout the year, including choral, opera and ballet performances and art exhibitions. Major events for next year are the Lattelcom Riga Marathon in May, Riga Opera Festival in June, Riga City Festival in August and Staro Riga light festival in November. In an interview with The Korea Herald in June, Vaivars said exchanges through tourism would spark mutual interest and eventually lead to greater economic cooperation, highlighting Latvia’s strengths in the wood and timber, furniture and interior design, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, cosmetics and fashion industries. Korea is Latvia’s second-largest export market in Asia after China.The embassy recently produced a Baltic travel map with information on popular and hidden spots in Korean, as around 10,000 Koreans visit Latvia annually, with the number rising.

Wellingtonians have told me they want their mayor and council to be innovative, decisive and have new ideas. I’m going to work hard with a united team of councilors and council officers to deliver on that.”Lester was elected to office last year, and worked as the city of Wellington’s deputy mayor from 2013-2016 and councilor for the Northern Ward from 2010. He was a businessman working in property and asset management prior to entering politics. Seoul and Wellington became friendship cities last year. The 38-year-old mayor presented capital Wellington as a city of creative lifestyles, art and culture and distinct Kiwi architecture at the reception. His policies have focused on vitalizing the economy, making housing affordable, improving the city’s transport, replacing outdated bylaws and prioritizing arts funding. Lester led a delegation of Wellington businesses, academics and artists to Korea to further strengthen people-to-people links between Wellington and Korea. He met leaders in startups and small and medium-sized enterprises, film, education, digital governance and other areas during his visit. “One of the core initiatives of the Kiwi Chamber is our ‘Inspire with Innovation’ series, which focuses on mutually beneficial collaboration in innovation between Korea and New Zealand,” said Garrett. “We are very fortunate to have Ambassador Fearnley and Mayor Lester with us this evening to understand how innovation impacts both business relationships and creative cities.” Korean goods exports to New Zealand stood at $1.4 billion in June, with strong growths in vehicles, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances as well as iron and steel sectors. Korea is New Zealand’s seventh-largest importing country. New Zealand’s exports to Korea have also increased with strong gains in the food and beverage sector, which rose nearly 30 percent from the beginning of last year to June this year to $455 million. Other industries that have benefited from the free trade agreement include meat, dairy products, fruit, vegetables, wine and beer. The two economies have gained from science and innovation partnerships in information and communication, digital, bio and health technologies. In particular, collaborations in 4-D technology, health and agricultural robotics and Antarctic research have been cemented.

The opening ceremony will take place Thursday at 4 p.m. and visitors should RSVP by emailing culture@mofa.go.kr or calling  2100-8335. “Iran has always been an art and cultural matrix of the world and contributed to the richness of world’s arts and cultures. The list continues and includes imaginative Iranian poetry written by brilliant minds, such as Grand Hafiz, Rumi, Saadi and Khayyam,” Iranian Ambassador to Korea Hassan Taherian told The Korea Herald, pointing to exquisitely spun Persian rugs, enameled pots and metalwork of dazzling colors, dainty miniature paintings and hypnotic architecture. Traditional Iranian pottery “Cultural exchanges between Iran and Korea date back to the seventh century along the ancient Silk Road, but the formal diplomatic relationship between the two countries was established in 1962. We believe that cultural exchanges between the two countries could further strengthen our existing friendly relationship and bring out new ideas of cooperation in unexplored areas.”Iranian handicrafts include weaving, metalwork, woodwork, stonework, glasswork, furniture, enamel work and engravings, pottery, ceramics, tiles and mosaic, which embody the skills and cultural and religious symbols of premodern civilizations. Handicrafts exports make up a large part of Iran’s non-oil exports, earning over $250 million from March through June . The province of Isfahan, 340 kilometers south of the capital Tehran, is the center of the nation’s handicrafts industry, and was named a World Crafts City in September 2015 by UNESCO’s World Crafts Council. Nearly 200 handicrafts out of the country’s 300 types originate from Isfahan, according to Iran’s Financial Tribune. The government estimated that the revenue from the industry will reach $1 billion through 2022, with Isfahan at the center of global trade that is increasingly taking place online. Online shops selling handicrafts have increased hundredfold to 200 over the last five years, and efforts are underway to create links with international sites such as Amazon and eBay, according to Iran’s Cultural and Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization.By Joel Lee","foundation gallery in seoul ,handicraft treasures from thursday ,2017 iran korea cultural ,iran will feature handicrafts ,gallery in seoul marking","['the Iranian Embassy', 'the Korea Foundation Gallery', 'Seoul', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'the Iranian Cultural Heritage', 'Handicra']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05407539 -0.03960471

I want to meet with my North Korean counterpart and others to discuss issues, including reunions of separated families,” Park, 78, said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency on Thursday. Park Kyung-seo, president of the Korean Red Cross The human rights expert took office on Aug. 18. At an inauguration ceremony, he voiced hope to have talks with the head of North Korea‘s Red Cross as soon as possible.But inter-Korean relations have been long strained amid the North’s nuclear and missile threats. It has kept quiet toward Seoul‘s July offer to hold Red Cross talks to resume suspended reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.The issue of dispersed families is the most urgent humanitarian matter for the two Koreas, which still remain technically at war as the three-year conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.About 55 percent of an estimated 131,260 South Koreans on the waiting list for reunion have already died. Data showed that 62 percent of South Koreans hoping for the reunions are aged over 80.The last reunion event was held in October 2015.Pyongyang has posed conditions that could politicize the issue.In exchange for the reunions, it is demanding Seoul return 12 female North Korean workers who worked at a restaurant in China and defected to South Korea en masse last year.“The resumption of family reunions is urgent, but it is also a sensitive issue,” Park said. “This issue involves the North Korean counterpart. I plan to handle it with a sense of duty and in a calm manner.”Park said that he prefers a two-track approach of providing humanitarian aid to North Korea -- first via international organizations and then through direct cooperative projects.The Korean Red Cross has assisted the impoverished country through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, an international humanitarian network.In 2015, the agency contributed 378 million won  to the IFRC’s pilot project for community-based development in the North. In 2016 and 2017, it offered a combined 330 million won to help the North cope with floods that hit its northeastern areas last year.Park said that his agency set aside 400 million won to support the IFRC‘s project for this year, but it has yet to provide it amid tensions over North Korea’s sixth nuclear test.“When situations get better, I plan to send the money,” he added.Park expressed a desire to promote cooperation between the two Koreas‘ Red Cross societies.“I believe that the two Koreas’ Red Cross should jointly push for cooperative programs based on humanitarianism in a bid to bring genuine peace to the Korean Peninsula,” he said.Park cited the feeble health care sector in North Korea as a potential area for cooperation, given that North Korean children are suffering from malnutrition.“I would like to focus on improving North Koreans‘ health and its health care system. That would be commensurate with the spirit of the Red Cross,” he said.“I hope to let North Koreans share our know-how about running a blood bank and help them advance their health care system. In the long term, I want to push for community-based sustainable development programs for North Korea.”Park attended the general assembly of the IFRC in Turkey in early November. North Korea’s Red Cross also sent its delegation including vice chief Paek Yong-ho to the meeting.Park and Paek encountered each other at a lunch meeting among chiefs from the Red Cross in East Asia on the sidelines of the IFRC gathering, but there was no official meeting between them.Paek told his Asian counterparts that North Korea is still struggling to fight damage from last year‘s floods, according to Park.Park said that he hopes to further improve fairness and transparency in the operation of the Korean Red Cross.“I wish to nurture the Korean Red Cross as an agency shared by all South Koreans. By strengthening fairness and transparency in running the agency, I would like to develop it into something like peers in advanced nations,” Park stressed.","nk for family reunions ,for family reunions aid ,resume reunions of war ,korea red cross hopes ,countries improve park kyung","['South Korea ’s', 'Red Cross', 'Park Kyung - seo', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'Pyongyang']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.35838604  0.12761252

Seoul Public Bike, or “Ttareungyi” in Korean from the sound of a bike bell ringing, was launched in September 2015 to allow anyone to rent a bike from 878 rental stands across the city. Presently, there are 11,600 bikes in the system. The city government plans to expand that to 20,000 bikes and 1,290 docking stations by year’s end. This will give Seoul the second most public bikes after Velib in Paris, which had 23,600 as of 2016. Bicycles are seen that belong to Seoul's bike-sharing system, Ttareungyi. YonhapSeoul is well connected by bus and subway, and rental bicycles are particularly popular at places like bus interchanges and subway stations for use for the last-mile commute.From its launch through October this year, people used Seoul Public Bike over 5 million times, city government data shows. It also shows that the bikes have proved especially popular near Yeouido Park and Ttukseom Hangang Park, as well as in university areas like Hongik University Station. The number of users rose more than sevenfold to 231,000, with nearly 50 percent of the registered riders in their 20s. How to useTo rent, one has to purchase a pass through the service’s official webpage  or via a mobile app. One can then book the bike online or through the app, pick it up from a rental station, ride and leave it at a different station. The website is available in English, Japanese and Mandarin, in addition to Korean. Ttareungyi docking stations are located 500 meters to 1 kilometer from each other to make renting and returning easy and convenient. Users are advised to bring their own helmets. For one-time use, the rental price is 1,000 won. Regular users can purchase a 30-day voucher at 5,000 won for one-hour use or 7,000 won for two hours at a time, while a 180-day voucher is 15,000 won for one hour or 20,000 won for two hours. In an odd wrinkle, a user can return the bike to any station within the one- or two-hour limit, and rent it again to restart the clock throughout the day.According to Rep. Kang Suk-ho of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, the prices are set below operations and maintenance costs. The more popular the service becomes, the greater loss Seoul would suffer, Kang said. According to Seoul officials, as of the end of August, voucher sales amounted to 1.7 billion won , but expenses spent on the system’s operations and maintenance totaled 4.1 billion won. The city explained that a large part of the money was spent on relocating bicycles and repairing and removing faulty or damaged ones. So far, there have been no reports of vandalism. Safety issues While bike-sharing seems to be off to a good start, the biggest concern is the safety of users and availability of bike paths.To create more bike paths, the city government said the additional bicycle roads will be built across 84 kilometers by 2020 with a focus on safety over quantitative expansion. City data showed that the city spends about 4.9 billion won each year for maintenance and repair of bike roads.The Seoul city government said it would also form three Ttareungyi special zones in Seoul. The special zones will allow citizens to commute to work and school and go shopping via the public bikes. The goal is to work in connection with urban development projects to build various infrastructure, such as bike paths and rental spots at the planning stage to form residential districts optimized for public bike usage.As of December last year, about 27 accidents been reported with Ttareungyi bikes on the road. Most were reportedly caused due to the inexperienced bikers.“The maximum speed for Ttareungyi is about 20 kilometers per hour,” said a Seoul City official, adding there’s less likelihood for riders to be involved in accidents in such situations.

In the Primary Years Program, or PYP, for age 3 to grade five, teachers harness students’ natural curiosity about the world for their academic experiences. Students get to choose topics they are passionate about and delve deeply into those topics. In the Middle Years Program, MYP, for grades six to 10, a student might partner with a medical researcher for a rare mentorship in the sciences or get one-on-one tutorials to help overcome a particular academic challenge. In the Diploma Program, DP, for grades 11 and 12, a student might volunteer in an orphanage in Nepal for a week for a project in sociology or develop and build a touchscreen remote control for a drone in product design.As a student grows up in the challenging, comprehensive IB program, proceeding from PYP to MYP to DP, teachers and mentors help students find their “spark of genius” and that lights the way to developing the independence and critical thinking skills that are demanded in university and today’s globally competitive workplace. The IB Diploma Program -- internationally known as the “gold standard” in university preparation -- is the only curriculum where students all around the world are measured with the same academic benchmarks. Graduates of the Diploma Program at Dwight School Seoul continue to outperform their peers around the world.

This file photo taken July 18, 2007 shows the production of bottled water at a factory near Mount Kumgang in North Korea. A Chinese-Korean businessman is known to have bought bottles of Mount Kumgang Spring Water in North Korea and donated them to the group. It plans to use them for religious rites to mark the lunar national foundation day later this month.The bottled water, which arrived in the South last month, is awaiting customs clearance at a port in Incheon, west of Seoul.It is rare for Seoul to allow North Korean products to make their way to the South since it slapped sanctions on the North on May 24, 2010. The unilateral sanctions banning inter-Korean exchanges were designed to punish North Korea for the torpedoing of a South Korean warship in March 2010.The government dismissed the view that its latest approval indicates Seoul's softening of sanctions.""The government does not seek to ease its unilateral sanctions. The approval was made on the basis that the shipment does not hamper the international sanctions regime,"" the official said.He added that even after the imposition of the 2010 sanctions, the government previously approved civilians' moves to bring in North Korean items such as books when their use was not for commercial purposes.Mount Kumgang Spring Water was first brought to the South in the mid-1990s and was imported to South Korea after 2000 when the two Koreas set up a joint venture for mass production until shipments were halted due to Seoul's sanctions.","move since seoul 2010 ,since seoul 2010 imposition ,seoul allows korean bottled ,seoul 2010 imposition of ,seoul 2010 imposition","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'North Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.40014672  0.22069111

The country at the foot of Africa has been relatively unexplored by Korean visitors over the years, despite offering wide-ranging attractions from natural adventure to cultural heritage.“We are now one of the most sought-after destinations in the world offering a variety of unforgettable experiences in leisure, ecotourism, cultural tourism and business,” South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam said at a gathering with Korean tour operators in Seoul on Nov. 7. Quoting the late President Nelson Mandela’s speech at the maiden international tourism conference Indaba in 1995, she said, “Our natural beauty only offers a fitting setting for our country’s most valuable asset -- our people. Ours is a nation of warm and generous people. Our various cultures and heritages, once exploited to divide our people, have turned into a source of strength and richness in every sphere of life.” Bam encouraged people to attend the Inbada conference, one of the largest tourism promotion events in Africa that takes place May 8-10 next year.  South African Embassy First Secretary Raymond Manzini, Deputy Head of Mission Ismail Esau, Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam and South African Airways General Manager Hans Kim Tourism is one of six selected drivers of the South African economy, alongside manufacturing, mining, finance, communications and retail. The country received nearly 19,000 Korean tourists last year, a 40 percent on-year increase.“There are seven reasons why South Africa is the most beautiful tourism destination in the world,” said the embassy’s Deputy Head of Mission Ismail Esau, referring to the country’s topographical and biological diversity, sundry coastlines, exotic landscapes, action-packed outdoor activities, ethno-cultural diversity, vibrant cities and towns and well-connected infrastructure. South Africa is one of the world’s 17 countries classified as “mega-diverse” in terms of terrain, vegetation and wildlife. It has 2,800 kilometers of coastlines flanked by two different ocean currents, including nearly 50 blue-flag beaches, marinas and coastal sanctuaries. Various sharks, whales and dolphins can be seen near the coast where divers can get up close to them. There are world-class golf courses, walking trails, suburban jungles and serpentine rivers well suited for outdoor activities. Thrill-seekers can see in person the “big five” of African animals: elephants, rhinos, buffalos, leopards and lions.Johannesburg, Durban, Bloemfontein and Nelspruit are internationally renowned travel destinations, said Esau, also recommending smaller sites and towns like Hermanus, Pilgrim’s Rest, Sutherland, Jeffreys Bay, George, Clarens, Oudtshoorn and Dullstroom. South African Airways -- a member of the Star Alliance -- offers flights to Johannesburg from Incheon via a layover in Hong Kong, which together takes some 17 hours of flying time.

The convenience of online purchases and home delivery, however, has its downsides. All the delivery boxes, wrapping and padding meant to protect what’s nestled inside are waste, once delivered, and a burden on our environment. According to Korea Waste Association, most of plastic bags are single-use, while packing tape is made of polyvinyl chloride, which takes a century to decompose. Cardboard boxes are another problem. Many believe that cardboard boxes are OK because they can be recycled, but officials say at least 10 percent of such boxes are dumped as trash and even those collected for reuse have a not-so-long life span after recycling. “Unfortunately, cardboard can’t be recycled indefinitely, because every time it’s remade, the fibers shorten. After five to seven recycling loops, the fibers become too short to be made into cardboard,” said Kim Dong-hyuk from Korea Recycle Association.The growing waste from parcel packaging is a problem in many other countries where online shopping is popular. China is grappling with mountains of packaging waste, while shipping boxes and packaging materials accounted for 30 percent, or 75 million tons, of total solid waste generated in US in 2015. Around the world, over 16.9 billion meters of box tape were used for parcel service in 2016, according to industry data, equivalent to the length it would take to wrap around the Earth about 425 times. Over 8.2 billion plastic bags and 3.1 billion packing strings were used in the same year. As parcel packaging becomes a growing environmental headache, some companies have begun to seek out green alternatives. Innisfree, a local cosmetics brand, has been using recycled cardboard boxes and biodegradable foam made of corn since 2012. Though costs went up, the company said it has decided to stick to eco-friendly options to provide consumers the value of going green. “We wanted to convey the message that our company values naturalism and cares about environmental issues and waste problems. Delivery is a small part of our business, but it may be the most effective way to portray our value,” said Seo Sung-hyuk, a manager at Innisfree’s E-commerce team. Boxes for some of the cosmetic products are made of recycled citrus peels and green tea leaves, he added. Some consumers are going package-free on their own. “After I saw a box of toothpaste that I ordered online arrived packed with several layers of plastic bags and air caps, I always leave a note  that I do not need extra wrapping when the product is not something fragile,” wrote a member of an online moms’ community. Going package-free and promoting zero-waste shopping has been a trend around the globe in recent years, although it hasn’t arrived here yet.In a typical package-free grocery store in Europe, customers are required to bring their own containers to buy food and ingredients in bulk, from cooking oil and vinegar to grains. Ko Su-ra, 33, shops at local organic stores and expressed hopes for more package-free shopping options here. “It’s such a great idea. You can just go and shop at those stores, instead of telling the industry what they should do ,” Ko said.“We want to see the world become sustainable, clean and thriving for future generations to enjoy.”","trillion won billion quadrupling ,online shopping has long ,market grew to trillion ,won billion quadrupling from ,environmental problem online shopping","['South Korea', 'the Korea Integra']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54898363  0.21511739

Ra, 36, has been indicted on suspicion of smoking an e-cigarette on the plane that left San Francisco at 4:50 a.m. on Feb. 22 this year and was scheduled to land at Incheon at 5:10 p.m. the same day, according to the ruling.He was caught smoking an e-cigarette in his seat at around 1:10 p.m. before being arrested by police upon arrival in Incheon.The aviation security law bans an airline passenger from causing disturbances or puffing cigarettes to ensure the safety of the plane and its other passengers.The court imposed a lighter penalty on the musician as his in-flight smoking took place before March 21, when a revised aviation security law, which calls for stronger punishment of people causing disturbances and smoking in flight, went into force.The revised law stipulates that anyone smoking in a plane could face a penalty of 10 million won if a plane is in flight and 5 million won if it is parked.Even though e-cigarettes involve no combustion, they are classified as general tobacco under related laws and are subjected to the no smoking ban on a flight just like general cigarettes.Amid the popularity of e-cigarette use, the number of cases of people caught smoking in airplanes showed a marked increase in the 2012-2016 period. The number of such cases, which stood at nine and 14, respectively, in 2012 and 2013, soared to 90 in 2014 and 333 in 2015 before hitting a record high of 360 last year.Kim Ban-jang and Windy City, a five-member reggae band formed in 2005, has released two regular albums and single albums.","reggae band million won ,south korean reggae band ,incheon district court fined ,longest running roots reggae ,roots reggae band million","['south korean', 'Korean Air Lines', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Ra Guk - san', 'Kim Ban - jang', 'Windy City', ""South Korea 's""]",19,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.12577006 0.49270338 0.23454298],Yonhap,Social affairs,11,2017,"reggae band has been fined ,korea longest running roots reggae ,reggae band million won for ,band million won for violating ,roots reggae band million won","['south korean', 'Korean Air Lines', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Ra Guk - san', 'Kim Ban - jang', 'Windy City', ""South Korea 's"", 'San Francisco', 'Incheon', 'Incheon', 'Kim Ban - jang', 'Windy City']",1,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.12577006 0.49270338 0.23454298]

The wild animal cafes place racoons, meerkats and other wild creatures in their facilities as a tool to attract customers. According to the report by animal welfare group Aware, there are more than 35 such cafes in Korea where wild animals are offered as companions to the customers. Racoon was the most common species on display, as it was found in 29 out of the 35 cafes. Other wildlife species include meerkat, wallaby, desert fox and ferret. A racoon at a wild animal cafe in Seoul appears stressed from exposure to customers trying to pet and hug them. Through on-site investigations in nine wild animal cafes in Seoul, Aware found that animals were mostly stressed from all-day-long exposure to customers trying to pet and hug them, often displaying signs of lethargy and sickness. Moreover, different species of wild animals were often kept in the same place with other domestic and wild animals, sometimes giving rise to hostile interactions among them. Hygiene in these cafes were also poorly taken care of. Excrement from the animals was improperly handled, with potty pads left in open areas in the cafe, giving rise to the risk of infections. Only one out of the nine cafes investigated, had a sink where customers could wash their hands before and after touching the animals.Aware seeks to use the result of this investigation to inform authorities to come up with legal measures to block these animal cafes from placing wild animals in poor conditions. A racoon is surrounded by customers trying to pet and hug them at a wild animal cafe in Seoul.","animal cafes in korea ,korea where wild animals ,wild animal cafes in ,animal cafes place racoons ,over wild animal cafes","['Korea', 'Aware', 'Korea', 'Racoon']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44180587  0.68870407

This file photo taken July 4, 2017, shows the lobby of the headquarters of Hyundai Asan Corp. in Seoul. In July 2008, Seoul suspended the Kumgang tour project after a South Korean woman was killed by a North Korean soldier at the mountain resort. The program was launched in 1998 under a previous liberal government.If Hyundai Asan had received approval to hold the event, it would have marked the first visit by South Koreans to the North under the Moon Jae-in administration.Pyongyang also rejected the company's previous request to hold a memorial service in the North to mark the anniversary of the death of its former chairman Chung Mong-hun. The operator of the suspended tour program had held a memorial service for Chung in North Korea every year since his death in August 2003, but did not seek approval for the visit last year due to tensions on the Korean Peninsula.","suspended inter korean tour ,pyongyang turns down hyundai ,korea has rejected hyundai ,said tuesday the company ,rejected hyundai asan corp","['North Korea', ""Hyundai Asan Corp.

The 846-kilometer project -- part and parcel of the Trans-Asian Railway Network, also known as the “Iron Silk Road” -- is expected to halve the time it takes to move goods from China to Turkey. It is a crucial part of the OBOR initiative designed to integrate Asian and European economies and reshape the order of global trade. The BTK line will initially carry 1 million passengers and 5 million tons of cargo a year, and increase cargo to 50 million tons when a parallel track finishes construction in the near future.“The BTK line will make the region an important center on the new Silk Road, which begins from Russia’s Far East and ends in Western Europe,” said the diplomatic mission in a press release. “Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan will benefit from a more efficient transit route and other users will profit from a shorter and safer transit route. Via the route, goods will reach Europe from South Korea, China and India within 15 to 20 days.” A map shows the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Turkey, prime ministers of Georgia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and other high-level officials participated in the commencement ceremony at the Port of Baku on Oct. 30 to dispatch an inaugural freight train on the corridor. Seventy-nine kilometers of the railway passes through Turkey, 246 kilometers through Georgia and 504 kilometers through Azerbaijan. The scheme has been completely financed by Azerbaijan and Turkey.Analysts say the project’s key objective is to improve economic relations between the three countries and attract foreign direct investment across Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, some pundits speculate the project will further marginalize Armenia in the geopolitically volatile region of the South Caucasus.

A joint team of government and the May 18 Memorial Foundation announced the project late last month, and it will start as early as this week. The Ministry of Justice said it completed all necessary procedures, including verifying the expertise of the team and safety checks, and will fully support the project going forward.  Dozens of missing victims are believed to have been secretly buried during the bloody crackdown 37 years ago, when thousands of Gwangju citizens rose up against the military junta led by Gen. Chun Doo-hwan, who seized power in a coup. The junta sent tank-led paratroopers to ruthlessly quell the nine-day revolt. More than 200 people were killed and 1,800 wounded, official data show, while many believe the death toll was much higher. The excavation site, now covered in asphalt, is where the Gwangju Prison had been located. The team plans to bring in a ground-penetrating radar that can reach as much as 10 meters deep. Calls for a fresh investigation into the massacre have been strong, but moves were tepid under the two previous conservative governments. President Moon Jae-in, who took office in May, has promised to get to the truth and has ordered a special probe into the case. The excavation team chose the old prison site based on the testimony from a then major in an airborne brigade in charge of the crackdown. He confessed to burying some 12 bodies in the farm that was at the facility. A couple of people who were inmates at the time also told the foundation they witnessed bodies being disposed there.Any remains they find at the site will be analyzed for DNA comparison with the samples collected from 295 families of the missing, the foundation said.","find gwangju massacre victims ,may 18 memorial foundation ,project late last month ,gwangju massacre victims ,to find gwangju massacre","['Memorial Foundation', 'the Ministry of Justice']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05158664  0.35803905

Milan Stech, president of the Czech Republic’s Senate, said during a visit to Korea last week that the Central European nation will participate in the PyeongChang Winter Games in Korea next February with a National Olympic House in Gangneung, Gangwon Province. Stech -- the country’s second-highest constitutional representative -- came to Korea on Sunday with a business delegation. His visit follows earlier visitations this year by a delegation of the Chamber of Duties’ committee on economic affairs in May and the Chamber Speaker Jan Hamacek in June. “We will celebrate the centenary of Czechoslovakia in 2018, and firmly believe that the anniversary will serve as a great opportunity to introduce our culture and country to our friends around the world,” he said at a reception in Seoul on Monday. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1990 before Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 2013. They upgraded their relations to a strategic partnership in 2015. The Czech Republic is a strong player in ice hockey, having won the gold medal at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics in Japan, as well as 12 gold medals at World Championships, including six as Czechoslovakia and for three straight years from 1999 to 2001.

The fair was held in conjunction with Food Week Korea -- the country’s largest international culinary exhibition -- at Coex in Seoul from Wednesday through Saturday. Under the banner “Taste the Happiness,” the event invited 100 food and beverage companies from the block of 10 nations -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.Pavilions representing the 10 member states’ cuisines showcased their products and offered samples to visitors. They also explored commercial opportunities with Korean partners through meetings. Last year, over 1,500 meetings took place and contracts worth more than $2 million were inked. Kim Young-sun , secretary-general of the ASEAN-Korea Center and Korea’s former ambassador to Indonesia, examines food products at the ASEAN Trade Fair 2017 at Coex in Seoul. In the photo are Malaysian Ambassador Rohana Ramli , Indonesian Ambassador Umar Hadi  and Myanmar Ambassador Thura Thet Oo Maung . “There is a growing interest among Korean consumers and buyers in ASEAN’s unique, high-quality food and beverage products,” said the center’s Secretary-General Kim Young-sun, a career diplomat and Korean ambassador to Indonesia from 2011-14. “Despite the surging demand, many ASEAN products have not been introduced to the Korean market yet. I hope the ASEAN Trade Fair will be a platform not only for Korean buyers exploring opportunities with ASEAN partners, but also for the general public, who are increasingly enjoying the exotic and diverse gastronomies of the region.”Showcased goods included citric fruit Kalamansi from the Philippines, popularly used in detoxification; jam, juice and snack products made from mango, durian, papaya and pineapple; coconut oil, snacks and juice; packaged, easy-to-cook tom yam kung and pho; organic coffee varieties Robusta and Arabica; as well as various seasonings. A booth promoted the region’s coffees and teas, with baristas brewing beverages for attendees to taste.Prior to the event, a trade facilitation seminar for representatives of participating ASEAN companies was held on Oct. 24. The seminar enabled them to gain an understanding of the latest trends in Korea’s food industry, and also helped build business links with Korean firms.  ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary General Kim Young-sun  poses with Myanmar Ambassador Thura Thet Oo Maung and Cambodian Ambassador Long Dimanche  and Thai Ambassador Sarun Charoensuwan . Korean experts gave presentations on a wide range of issues in the country, including distribution, policies on safety control of imported foods, technological developments and regulations on food packaging. In turn, the ASEAN representatives explained latest trends in their respective countries, followed by a visit to the Daesang Cheonan food plant and CJ Freshway Icheon distribution factory.ASEAN is the world’s seventh-largest economy with a combined population of 625 million and gross domestic product of $2.8 trillion. It has become South Korea’s top investment destination and second-largest trade partner, trailing only China. Bilateral trade between ASEAN and Korea topped $124 billion last year, and is expected to reach $200 billion by 2020. The ASEAN-Korea Center was established in 2009 to mark the 20th anniversary of a bilateral sectoral dialogue partnership. The intergovernmental organization is mandated with promoting two-way exchanges in trade and investment, tourism, cultural and people-to-people relations. It has participated in the exhibition since 2009 to introduce a wide range of ASEAN products to Korea’s increasingly diversifying consumer market.

Yonhap“The government expresses our regret over the International Advisory Committee’s advice and UNESCO Director-General ’s decision,” the ministry said in a statement, while stressing that it is opposed to any moves aiming to undermine the historical truth. The Ministry of Gender Equality here echoed the statement. The statement came mere hours after the South Korean Culture Ministry delivered the result of a recent meeting of the International Advisory Committee, UNESCO’s de facto group in charge of reviewing the policy for the Memory of the World Program, in Paris. An official proposal was drawn and submitted in May 2016 by 15 civic groups from eight countries, including South Korea and China, for the listing of nearly 2,700 documents including court records and materials handed by the victims. The documents are valued here as an indispensable resource on the tragic history that continues to haunt relations with Japan.Upon hearing the news, a South Korean civic group said Tuesday that the goal of the proposal was not to blame Japan for its wartime atrocities, but to preserve a historical record of women’s rights and how the victims overcame the pain of their past.UNESCO instead recommended the nomination of “Joseon Tongsinsa” from 1607-1811, which refers to the series of diplomatic records of Korean envoys to Japan. The goodwill missions are a symbol of peace between the two neighboring nations. Signs of postponement had been looming as Japan’s NHK reported Friday that the IAC saw the need for further dialogue among “relevant nations” before registering the documents in the program. Japan had been campaigning against the civic groups’ wishes, saying that it goes against the resolution reached between Seoul and Tokyo in 2015. The controversial deal, which received widespread public disapproval here, proposes a compensation of 1 billion yen  to South Korean victims coupled with a government apology to “finally and irreversibly” resolve the bilateral tension surrounding the comfort women issue. But the Foreign Ministry here has expressed its support for the civic group-backed movement, saying that it coincides with the government’s basic stance that historical lessons should be learned from the comfort women issue. It also disagreed that such efforts are a violation of the bilateral agreement between South Korea and Japan which states both countries should refrain from criticizing each other in the international community. In 2016, Japan withheld its annual funding for the heritage body after the UNESCO program decided to include documents about the 1937 Nanjing Massacre with Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga calling the decision “problematic.” It triggered an angry reaction from China by questioning the authenticity of the relevant documents.Japan currently provides about 9.7 percent of the UNESCO budget, which makes it the second-largest donor of the UN agency after the US at 22 percent. It is forecast to take the lead as the US announced its withdrawal from the agency by the end of 2018. South Korea and Japan have experienced decadeslong conflict over the issue of comfort women in both diplomatic and historical terms. Historians believe more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were taken to work as sex slaves for the Japanese military during the colonial era. Out of 239 comfort women survivors registered in the government database, only 35 remain alive as September 2017. Meanwhile, the Moon Jae-in administration launched a public-private task in July to review the 2015 bilateral settlement with a more “victim-oriented” approach.

Packed with lectures and panel discussions on the issue of human ageing, a perennial question for scientists and a common social problem in many developed countries, the event is part of the annual Nobel Week Dialogue organized by Nobel Media and Nobel Center Foundation. The main one-day program is slated for Dec. 9 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The Seoul forum is being held in partnership with Korean Academy of Science and Technology. “Nobel Prize Dialogue is one of the pillars of our global outreach and aims to stimulate interest in science, literature and peace in line with Alfred Nobel’s vision and legacy for the greatest benefit of mankind,” said Mattias Fyrenius, CEO of Nobel Media. The five Nobel laureates in Seoul to offer their insights are Ada Yonath, Nobel laureate in chemistry, Finn Kydland in economics, Richard Roberts in physiology, Serge Haroche in physics and Robert Huber in chemistry. Lee Myung-chul, president of the KAST, said the forum “will encourage scholars to exchange their thoughts on global issues affecting all humanity and states and inspire Koreans about the future and innovation.“Monday’s forum is expected to raise issues of how AI can help optimize geriatrics as well as ways to slow the ageing process. Scientists and panels cover questions such as: “How can AI help improve the lives of older people?“ and ”What role will the medical and food industries play in the ageing society?“The forum will also cover topics including the health care industry and new generations under the theme of ""Science and Technology in Health Care"" and ""Next Revolution for Better Living"" until Nov. 1.

In front of the National Assembly building in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Saturday, some 10,000 people – mostly young – held their “Candle Party” to celebrate the new era ushered in by peaceful candlelit protests last year. Organized 100 percent by individual volunteers, the event was notably more upbeat than the other, larger event held at Gwanghwamun Square, the main venue of last year’s movement, by left-wing civic groups and labor unions. ""Candle Party"" at Yeouido “We came here to have fun and celebrate the first anniversary of the candlelight movement,” Lee Ki-hwa, who helped organize the event in Yeouido told The Korea Herald. “We planned the event here because it is lawmakers who should listen to our demands.” Yeouido is where the National Assembly is located. “But I think our hope to eradicate deep-rooted evil in society would be the same here or there,” he said in reference to those who gathered at Gwanghwamun Square. One year on, participants at both locations have the same stated goal – eradicating deep-rooted evil that they think has made society unfair, unjust and unsafe. And they believe candles should continue to be lit to have their voices heard by the parliament and government. Getting rid of deep-rooted ills begins with investigating Park’s predecessor Lee Myung-bak, who is suspected of creating a slush fund, using the nation’s spy agency to intervene in 2012 election and clamp down on liberals, they said. But some protesters held a separate event in Yeouido because they opposed the idea of marching toward the presidential office, following the main event in the evening at Gwanghwamun Square. They believe the civic groups demand “too much” from the Moon Jae-in administration that only took office in May.“President Moon is doing well now. But the organizations are bombarding him with too many demands. We should not be impatient and support him to achieve what he intended to do step by step,” Jeon Young-ok, 58, while marching toward the headquarters of the main opposition Korea Liberty Party. The anniversary event at Gwanghwamun, which drew some 60,000 participants, was hosted by left-wing civic groups, student groups and labor unions. They are among some 1,500 civic organizations that were behind the 23 anti-Park rallies that took place from October till this year.  Anniversary event at Gwanghwamun The groups said they would march toward the presidential office as a warning to the Moon Jae-in administration not to forget about his unfulfilled tasks. In the face of strong resistance and criticism from some supporters of President Moon, they withdrew the plan. Only the nation’s second-biggest umbrella trade union went ahead with the march.“I think the meaning of candles was distorted by groups of left-wing civic groups. I think the candles were purely the power of the people. I feel like they are using the candle-holding citizens to serve their own interests,” Jeon said. At recent candlelit rallies at Gwanghwamun Square, there have been several voices raised by different civic groups. Some called on the government to get rid of irregular jobs, others opposed the deployment of anti-US missile system or US President Donald Trump’s upcoming two-day visit here. But after they helped unseat Park, many citizens, who resonated with the calls to remove the corruption-ridden leader from power, appear to feel uncomfortable with the groups who they see as “using candlelight force to suit their own agendas.”Unlike the rally at Gwanghwamun Square, participants at the Yeouido rally focused on demanding a thorough probe into ousted Park’s predecessor Lee Myung-bak and criticizing the opposition Liberty Korea Party for not cooperating with the Moon administration for reform plans. But many saw the divide itself is not a bad thing. It is a display of diversity and a result of maturing democracy in the country, they said. “I think that those who were once unified started to grow apart. But on the other hand, I think that is a desirable thing in a democratic country,” said Lee Song-ho, 42. Those who gathered at the Gwanghwamun rally also welcomed the different opinions. “I am positive that diverse voices start to come out. And Gwanghwamun is a symbolic place for the diverse voices to be heard. I don’t see  as a rift,” Choi Mi-young, 38, said.

The Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentTentatively named Seoul Children Hospital’s Samsung Development Center, the hospital project was initiated by the city government in 2013 in partnership with Samsung Group and non-profit organization Community Chest of Korea. Seoul City injected 11.8 billion won  to build the center, while Samsung chipped in 20 billion won. Developmental disorders refer to psychiatric conditions originated in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. Disorder comprises language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders, while in broader definitions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  is also included. In Korea, developmental disorder is not covered by the national health insurance system. Data show that Korea’s number of developmental disorder patients is on the rise, although the overall number of disabled children has been dropping since 2011. Each year, approximately 7,000 people are newly diagnosed with the condition. In the past four years, those suffering with an intellectual disability went up by 8.9 percent to 195,000 patients, while those with autistic disorder increased by 27.8 percent to 23,000. About six in 10 patients with autism here are teenagers or younger. Spanning 11,950 square meters of space across five floors in Seocho-gu, southern Seoul, the facility comprises doctor’s offices, 30 rehabilitation treatment and activity program rooms, a family counseling room, an auditorium, a gym and other facilities. “We hope the establishment of the facility to strengthen national research and treatment on developmental disorder and also to serve as a momentum to create a better public healthcare service,” said Yoon Ju-hwa, head of Samsung’s society volunteer division. Officials said the center will also provide counseling and psychological treatment for patients’ families. Surveys showed that psychological disorders of the caregivers of children with developmental disorders such as autism and intellectual disabilities were marked with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Many of the Korean parents of children with developmental disorders have demanded the government take more responsibility for affected children, when the President Moon Jae-in rolled out a state program in June to increase the number of support centers and hospitals dedicated to dementia patients. By Kim Da-sol","seoul opens first public ,seoul children hospital samsung ,its official opening friday ,children hospital samsung development ,governmenttentatively named seoul children","['South Korea ’s', 'Seoul Children Hospital ’s Samsung Development Center', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Children Hospital ’s Samsung Development Center']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.204578    0.34143311

But public services for animal welfare have been at a very low standard,” said the city government. Officials cited the 2016 Seoul Survey that showed 93 percent of Seoul citizens supported the establishment of a city-run animal welfare center, while 9 in 10 of those who do not own pets also supported its establishment. The center will also conduct emergency rescues of abandoned animals on the street, with help of other animal rights groups. Rescued animals will go through medical examinations for infectious diseases and receive the corresponding treatment. The center’s adoption program offers counseling and education for wannabe pet owners. Those who are interested can visit the center or its website at cafe.naver.com/seoulanimalcare.The center opens from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Tuesdays.“Seoul City will continue to make efforts to spread a culture for animal companions and humans to co-exist in our society, while promoting correct ‘petiquette’ -- the proper way to control and handle a pet -- to pet owners,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. By Kim Da-sol","open this week seoul ,week seoul animal care ,this week seoul animal ,center will open saturday ,week seoul animal","['Seoul Animal Care Center', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul Animal', 'CenterThe']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11132067  0.31176394

Despite South Korean organizers’ determination to make the Winter Games a big hit, much of the event’s success may depend on the host country’s enigmatic neighbor, North Korea.  North Korean figure skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik compete during the pairs free program at the Figure Skating-ISU Challenger Series on Sept. 29 in Oberstdorf, Germany. Taking place just a scant 80 kilometers away from the heavily fortified border with the communist regime, the PyeongChang Games have made some athletes wonder about their safety, amid all the news about the North’s unpredictable young dictator Kim Jong-un and his dangerous pursuit of nuclear weapons. Officials in Seoul, however, rule out such concerns. Contrary to that, they pin high hopes on Kim’s interest in sports and that the North may send a delegation here. “There have been some positive signs from the North ,” South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said Monday while visiting Greece for the torch lighting event, although he refused to disclose details. International Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas Bach also said that he is trying “through various channels to have North Korea participate” in the games. He added that the IOC is studying “technical measures” to provide the North with an opportunity to take part in PyeongChang. The IOC said earlier that it would consider wild-card entries for North Korean athletes, on top of special provision of aid such as equipment, travel and accommodation. Positive or ambiguous signs Last month, North Korea secured its presence at the Winter Olympics set to run from Feb. 9-25 in the South’s sleepy resort town, with figure skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik grabbing one of the last Olympic spots in a competition in Germany. On Oct. 13, the North submitted a document to the International Paralympic Committee, conveying its wish to participate in the upcoming winter’s multisport event for disabled athletes. The 2018 PyeongChang Paralympics are scheduled to take place from March 9-18. But other than the two developments, the reclusive nation has been dealing with the situation with ambiguous responses. On the application for the Paralympic Games, South Korea’s Minister of Culture Sports and Tourism Do Jong-hwan recently said the North has “not followed up with any official moves” to enter the competition. An unnamed official with the IPC told Yonhap News Agency that he echoed Do’s view and said the North’s Paralympic committee sent the document via email on May 9. Asked about the PyeongChang Olympics, Chang Ung, a North Korean delegate to the IOC, said, “I am quite sure that politics is one thing and Olympics is another thing,” adding that he did not see any “big problem.” ‘Waiting until the last minute’ Some of the most animated moments of inter-Korean relations were highlighted through gleaming sweat and joint teamwork in sports in the past. It would be the “cherry on top” of the South Korean government’s agenda to make the event serve its goal as the “Peace Olympics,” if the North decides to join the first Winter Games here.In July, President Moon Jae-in stressed that South Korea would keep the door open to the North “until the very last minute,” a month following his proposal to form a South-North unified team.To lure North Korea to compete at the Winter Games, the government is preparing a United Nations resolution that will allow all conflicts surrounding North Korea to temporarily freeze from Feb. 9-25, during the Olympics and the ensuing Paralympics. It is scheduled to be voted on around November, the Foreign Ministry here said. However, experts here are expressing skepticism over Seoul’s interpretation of several of the North’s sports-related moves as “signs of willingness.”“North Korea may be simply weighing the current situation or trying to give its athletes chances ,” said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, while mentioning that the diplomatic circle here believes the North will maintain an obscure stance to the end. “The current regime headed by its leader Kim Jong-un believes sports is very important in terms of economics and leisure, so it would be misleading to connect the North’s sports-related moves to PyeongChang,” he said.  South Korean former soccer player Park Ji-Sung  receives flame from former torch bearer Greek cross-country skier Apostolos Angelis  during the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame in Ancient Olympia, southwestern Greece, on Tuesday. Another expert also said Seoul should be cautious and watchful of North Korea’s true motives behind its every move. “North Korea has shown signs with the construction of Marikryong Ski Resort, but  has more to do with Kim Jong-un’s goal of showcasing to his people and the global community that he could handle North Korea’s economy and future,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. In 2013, North Korea opened Masikryong Ski Resort in a province that shares a border with the South. In a telephone interview with Voice of America at the time, Chang Ung linked the ski resort to the PyeongChang Olympics. “Such infrastructures designed and built at the time embody Kim’s experience in Europe,” added Go. Above all, it would be difficult for the North to join the games as it refuses to discard its decadeslong nuclear ambition, both experts noted. North Korea’s sixth and largest nuclear test in September triggered the United Nations Security Council to impose strict sanctions on the rogue regime. It also sparked security concerns among participating nations due to the escalating military tension on the Korean Peninsula.

The idea might have looked brilliant to the operator of Incheon Airport, the country’s main gateway, looking to add a unique, new feature to its soon-to-be completed passenger terminal. However, doctors and medical professionals seem to think otherwise. Transfer terminal in Incheon International Airport. According to data from Incheon International Airport Corp. released by Rep. Kang Hoon-sik of the Democratic Party of Korea, the airport’s project to set up a 240-square-meter cosmetic surgery center on the third floor of its new terminal slated to open in January has hit a wall, as no doctor has come forward to open a clinic there. A public notice of the bid to run the clinic was put up on Sept. 13. “The airport operator, blinded by the pursuit of profits, overlooked some very important medical questions. It needs to rethink the project from square one,” Rep. Kang said. According to the airport’s operator, the plan aimed to attract more foreign patients to the country as well as to the airport, as South Korea has emerged as a medical tourism destination. The number of foreign patients that visited South Korea was 364,000 last year, jumping 22.7 percent over the previous year, data showed. The most sought-after medical services among Chinese and Japanese patients were plastic surgery and dermatological treatments.The airport’s plan was to allow transit passengers to receive those popular medical treatments between flights in Incheon. But the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons sent an official request to reconsider the plan, saying the plan lacks understanding of medical treatments and could lead to legal problems. “What if patients cannot get on their scheduled flight due to some unexpected medical problems that occur after the surgeries or treatments?” the association posed. “Even the simplest double-eyelid surgery could be affected due to differences in air pressure, and side effects could occur if immunity is lowered due to fatigue from long flights.” The Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons echoed the view, adding that the project may not be lucrative even if realized. Nearly 70 percent of medical tourists visiting South Korea are from Asian countries -- including China -- who often do not need to transfer flights. “One must reconsider using medical services and treatment as a means to increase the number of airport users,” added the society.

At a time when nation-states are mired in ideological infighting and hegemonic rivalries, Tehran and Seoul -- by relying on civic passion, corporate investment and public goods -- can together contribute to international peace, prosperity and sustainable development, Najafi said during his visit to Korea last week.“The world is moving in a direction where cities and regions will increasingly play greater roles, replacing the functions of nation-states,” the mayor told The Korea Herald in an exclusive interview at Conrad Seoul on Friday. “The changes will not be speedy, but steady and piecemeal. But I am confident that cities will be the ones making long-term strategic decisions and luring investments toward sustainable development, not only on the national scale, but global scale.”Tehran Mayor Mohammad-Ali Najafi, one of Iran’s staunch advocates of global engagement and domestic reform, says the Iranian capital presents untested opportunities to Korean investors. Najafi came to Korea last week to participate in the third meeting of the Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and Seoul Metropolitan Government. Following the third meeting, he took part in the Seoul Mayors’ Forum on Climate Change, organized by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, Seoul Metropolitan Government and Global Covenant of Mayors.Stressing that today’s world faces many grave challenges, most fundamentally climate change, the mayor said he critically addressed issues of curbing global warming and promoting inclusive growth, aimed at empowering all people economically, at the two forums from Wednesday through Friday. He reiterated his point that cities and mayors are poised to play an ever-larger constructive role in mitigating these manmade predicaments, a view passionately echoed by leading urban scholars.The scholar-turned-politician assumed office on Aug. 27 in the government of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. He has a track record of reformist views urging Iran’s engagement with the world at large, even as the Middle East powerhouse remains deeply divided over its relationship with the United States, which has threatened to annul the 2015 Iran nuclear deal under President Donald Trump, to the detriment of outside investors.The multilateral accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was reached in Vienna in July 2015 between Iran and the “P5+1” governments of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, United States and Germany, as well as the European Union, to eliminate Iran’s stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, scrap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 percent and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its gas centrifuges for 13 years. A handout picture provided by the office of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on October 13, 2017 shows him speaking on Iranian state TV Broadcast in reaction to a speech by US President. US President Donald Trump's speech in which he outlined an aggressive new strategy against Iran shows that he is ""more than ever against the Iranian people"", President Hassan Rouhani said. Against this backdrop, Najafi stated, “There will be major changes under my mayorship.” The 65-year-old native of Tehran added his city now has a reformist administration, marking a sea change after 14 years of the previous administration, and that he maintains “a very close relationship and coordinated policy responses” with President Rouhani, also a reformist with moderate centrist views who has sought to integrate Iran into the global economy. Rouhani won re-election on May 19 on promises of enhancing civil rights and restoring the economy and relations with Western nations. “Since taking my office in August, I have been a member of the cabinet as well and participate in important government meetings,” Najafi stressed. “This means that there is close policy coordination between the national and municipal governments and any differences are resolved through rational discussions. The people of Tehran expect fundamental changes in the city’s governance and ways of life.”Tehran, with a population of 15 million in its metropolitan area, suffers from air pollution, lack of infrastructure and overreliance on cars that run on gasoline engines. Najafi said his key vision for Tehran is to bolster exchanges and contacts with leading cities of the world in finance, entrepreneurship, manufacturing and renewable energy, so that the underinvested capital can lure large-scale investments and professionals for industrial diversification in a post-oil economy. Over 100 large-scale projects are being planned for foreign investors, he highlighted, encouraging Korean companies to plow capital into knowledge-based industries, as well as construction, industrial and car manufacturing, electric battery production, air pollution control and waste recycling into energy and fertilizer. In this photo released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks at a meeting in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017. Khamenei on Wednesday urged Europe to do more to back the 2015 nuclear deal after President Donald Trump refused to re-certify the pact and European companies have rushed into the Iranian markets since the landmark accord. Of particular importance, constructing and expanding the Tehran Metro subway hold much potential, he said, citing the need for expertise in mechanical components, electronic equipment and software. The government of Tehran offers municipal guarantees for returns to investment, just as the central government provides sovereign guarantees to investors. Iran has secured a line of credit of 8 billion euros  from the Korea Eximbank since August, the country’s biggest loan since the nuclear deal that will finance Korean firms’ projects in Iran. “Over the last four years since the launch of the Rouhani administration in August 2013, many effective programs and initiatives for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises have materialized,” explained Najafi, adding he, too, pays keen attention to the issue. “Knowledge-based SMEs have expanded as a result in Tehran. My administration has identified zones for attracting knowledge-intensive companies, modeling ‘Station F’ in France,” he added, referring to the world’s biggest startup incubator in Paris. Refashioned from an old train station, the venture ecosystem covering 34,000 square meters has capacity for more than 3,000 startups, eight event spaces, 30 shower stalls, 60 meeting rooms and 100 shared apartments for entrepreneurs.Najafi underlined that Tehran -- the main industries of which include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics, electrical equipment, textiles, sugar, cement and chemical products, alongside government jobs, labor-intensive services and management of oil refineries -- aims to replicate France’s experience to nurture and protect the growth of its SMEs. Provisions of facilities, reductions in payments of expenses, local tax deductions and other related incentives are offered. Tehran Mayor Mohammad-Ali Najafi, one of Iran’s staunch advocates of global engagement and domestic reform, says the Iranian capital presents untested opportunities to Korean investors. Prior to his current position, Najafi was the minister of higher education from 1981-84, minister of education from 1989-97 and vice president of Iran Head of Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization from 2013-14. He was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he obtained his master’s degree in mathematics, but couldn’t complete his doctorate due to the 1979 Iranian revolution. Upon returning to Iran, he taught mathematics at Sharif University of Technology as a professor from 1979-81. One of Najafi’s priorities is increasing the transparency of municipal administration. “We encourage people to take part in various activities and management of the city, as well as voicing their opinions on its budget and expenses. We will try to put forward a more balanced and fair budget for the overall benefit of our citizens,” the mayor said. On the question of an ideological split in Iran, intensified by saber-rattling rhetoric from Washington, he said conservatives and reformists have no differing views over the basics of the 1979 revolution -- where the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown and replaced by an Islamic Republic -- or the principles of the Islamic Republic. Differences lie in the level of international engagement and the state’s reach over civil society, according to Najafi. “We reformists strive to develop comprehensive, far-arching relations with the international community, while removing limits on the civil society and various cultural practices. This is absent among the conservatives,” the mayor said. “We believe the key to shared growth and peace is by keeping the door open to all parties of the world.” By Joel Lee","herald interview tehran mayor ,tehran mayor eyes sustainable ,global cities in iran ,civic passion corporate investment ,interview tehran mayor","['Iran', 'Tehran', 'Mohammad - Ali Najafi', 'Tehran', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43326852  0.70395255

Seoul Metropolitan Government.Spanning 160,000 square meters of space across six basement floors, the Yeongdong-daero transit terminal is to be the single largest multifunctional underground complex to be built in the country, the city government said. “A global consortium led by French architect Dominique Perrault has been selected for the complex’s design,” the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced Monday. Perrault is an architect known here for his work at Ewha Womans University -- the Ewha Campus Complex building. Perrault’s “Light Walk” project was selected for its “compatibility to nearby districts and ability to digest massive traffic,” city officials explained. Construction is to begin in 2019 and end in 2023. Located between Samsung Station on Subway Line No. 2 and Bongeunsa Station on Line No. 9, the underground complex is envisioned to be a multifunctional, cultural and retail space while serving as a major transport hub in the southern part of the capital. On the upper two levels of the complex, there will be an exhibition hall, a museum, a library and a shopping mall. The levels from the third underground floor down will be used as bus, subway, train transit and transfer centers and parking lots for tour buses. An artist’s rending of the mammoth underground facility to be built in Gangnam. Seoul Metropolitan Government.The complex will connect Subway Lines No. 2 and 9 with a direct transfer passageway, and offer a junction of five train lines including the high-speed KTX and bus stops. The city expects at least 600,000 transit passengers will visit the underground terminal every day, nearly double the number at Seoul Station. Over 180,000 people are expected to take buses here, following the 2023 opening of a bus-only lane in the area.Yeongdong-daero’s 480-meter sector of road will go underground and the surface area will be created into a 30,000-square-meter public plaza, which is double the size of Seoul Square in front of the City Hall building in Jung-gu.

Seoul Metropolitan Government.On the surface area between the Coex shopping mall and Hyundai’s proposed new headquarters, Seoul will create an urban park-themed plaza, touted as a rival to New York’s Central Park and London’s Hyde Park.Solar-powered lamps will be installed by the 560 meter-long boulevard surrounding the plaza and light will come in all day through a specially designed skylight, all the way down to the underground floors.Seoul City also plans to use this spot as the Korean version of Time Square, as a zone outside Coex was allowed by the Interior Ministry last year for the first time to freely install outdoor digital screens and billboards without any restrictions on types or sizes. The size, type and location of outdoor ads had been strictly restricted prior.“We will continue to develop this area and complete the underground complex construction successfully so many citizens can visit and commute easily,” said Chung Su-yong, head of the Seoul City’s urban space development bureau.By Kim Da-sol","built in gangnam seoul ,build mammoth underground public ,in gangnam by 2023 ,traffic in seoul most ,trillion won 15 billion","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26135829  0.09139034

We will continue to make every effort to ensure that our cities and societies are more inclusive and sustainable for current and future generations,” the agenda read.The agenda was written based on the mayors’ agreement on working together to create more inclusive cities through four policy domains, which include education, labor markets, housing and urban environment and infrastructure and public services.The Paris Action Plan for Inclusive Growth in Cities, which was drafted in November last year, urged cities to promote policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises and expand opportunities for entrepreneurship.The inclusive development conference will also see two sideline discussions on topics such as gentrification, social enterprises, public procurement for inclusive development and women‘s and children’s issues.Since March 2016, more than 50 mayors from around the world have joined forces to address rising inequalities in various sectors through the OECD Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth initiative.By Kim Da-sol","in seoul for forum ,also have seoul mayor ,have seoul mayor park ,angel gurria seoul mayor ,publish seoul implementation agenda","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy Christiana Figueres', 'Kim Da - sol', 'the Korea', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Secreta']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68002677  0.60610867

Concrete manufacturing and construction work contributed to 22 percent.By Kim Da-sol","cars starting from 2021 ,korea will require diesel ,test on diesel cars ,from 2021 south korea ,on diesel cars starting","['South Korea', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gye']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63917917  0.10233389

The Change Up Campus run by Gyeonggi Province will provide programs designed to help students to better prepare for the coming “fourth industrial revolution” on top of learning the English language, the province said.  Key panelists pose before attending a forum to discuss creativity in education held at Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning in Suwon on Tuesday. From left: Lee Chung-hwan, president of Herald Edu, Chang Jae-young, president of RAM Korea, Hong Sun-ho, professor at Seoul National University of Education, Kim Gyeong-pyo, president of Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning, and Bae Soo-moon, councilor of Gyeonggi Province. Marking the reopening, a forum was organized Tuesday by the province and the Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning, where five experts on a panel exchanged views on what kind of education Change Up Campus should strive to offer. Professor Shin Kwan-soo of Namseoul University, who obtained a Ph.D. in international education from the University of Southern California, said programs should be based on “creativity, collaboration, communication and critical thinking” in line with global educational standards. Creativity in education has often been associated with arts education, he went on, but it could be expanded to teaching students how to think creatively in various fields, he said.  Kim Gyeong-pyo, president of Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning “A great many business leaders think they were not born more creative than others, but were educated to be so,” he said, citing a study published in Harvard Business Review. Another participant, Chang Jae-young, president of Royal Academy of Music Korea, cited the UK’s art education where students must master at least one musical instrument until high school, as a successful model of teaching that needs to be adopted at the Change Up Campus. “The UK and other developed countries in Europe emphasize the importance of art education since preschool,” Chang said. “Here, we do have an art class in public schools, but it is rather treated separately among other subjects. But in the UK, arts instruction is integrated into math, science, foreign language and other subjects, allowing students to learn it in the context of everyday life,” Chang said. “By doing so, creativity can thrive,” Chang added. With the launch of the new educational hub, the province should work in partnership with local communities and educational experts for the development of its programs, said Gyeonggi Province councilor Bae Soo-moon.The councilor said that the campus could provide classes run by apprentice teachers from the region’s education colleges through partnership.“It’s a win-win for everyone. With the partnership, the province can resolve the possible problem of insufficient supply of native English-speaking teachers, while apprentice teachers can effectively develop their teaching skills,” Bae said. Seoul National University of Education professor Hong Sun-ho, however, emphasized that the province should learn from its own experiences of running the English village business and prepare for more high-quality education options. “We need to think about what to learn from the previous business model and what to work on to improve it. We need not only high-quality educational programs for students, but for teachers as well to run the programs more smoothly,” Hong said. “Having good software is as important as having good hardware as part of the overall package,” Hong added.At an opening ceremony held two days earlier in Paju, Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil said that the remodeled campus “carries the values of evolution and revolution” to provide a better learning opportunity to the next generations, and that it would “provide a model for the country’s new education.” The new campus provides classes for students including experimenting with drones, robotics, coding and 3-D printing, as well as language courses and mentoring, as part of a solution to help them learn arts, science and technology out of public schools, according to the province.By Bak Se-hwan","english camp has rebranded ,gyeonggi province rebrands english ,coming fourth industrial revolution ,province rebrands english village ,change up campus gyeonggi","['English Village', 'South Korea ’s', 'Gyeonggi Province']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65590596  0.77521706

According to a quarterly poll conducted by Sejong University’s Tourism Industry Institute and a marketing research firm Consumer Insight, fishing has topped the list of activities that Koreans would like to do on vacation for two quarters in a row.    In the poll for the July-September period, some 40 percent of the respondents said they would go fishing, up 8 percentage points from the same period a year earlier, while only 31 percent said they would go climbing, down 12 percentage points from the previous year. In the previous survey for the April-June period, fishing had garnered 40 percent of support, while hiking received 34 percent. Hiking has been Koreans’ favorite outdoor activity since August 2015, until it was overtaken by fishing in the second quarter. “The popularity of climbing might have diminished due to this year’s long monsoon period and heatwave which was more severe than last year. Such a trend would possibly bring changes to the patterns of trips in the country,” Consumer Insight said.","koreans have voted fishing ,fishing as their favorite ,koreans enjoy most south ,enjoy most south koreans ,on vacation for two","['South Koreans', 'Sejong University ’s Tourism Industry Institute', 'Consumer Insight', 'Koreans']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61030477  0.4624781

Kang Kyung-wha said during a parliamentary audit in Seoul that North Korea sent a letter to the International Paralympic Committee to show its intention to compete at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Paralympic Games.South Korean organizers and the government are hoping for North Korea's Olympic and Paralympic participation next year regardless of the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula sparked by Pyongyang's nuclear test and missile provocations. South Korea`s foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha speaks during a parliamentary audit on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the National Assembly in Seoul on Oct. 12, 2017. An official with the IPC, however, told Yonhap News Agency that it's still uncertain whether North Korea will actually compete south of the border, adding that the communist state hasn't made further moves to visit PyeongChang, some 180 kilometers east of Seoul, after sending the message. According to the IPC official, who asked for anonymity, North Korea's Paralympic committee sent the document via e-mail on May 9. To take part in the Paralympic Games, athletes need to earn quotas for the quadrennial event by collecting good results in international competitions or receiving wild card slots by the IPC.Since North Korea is a relatively undeveloped country in disabled sports, its realistic scenario for participation will be earning wild cards from the IPC. For wild card consideration, North Korean athletes first need to be registered in the IPC database, and then wait to be classified based on their physical abilities. However, North Korea has yet to register any of its athletes in the IPC database. South Korean officials and the IPC are expected to discuss the North Korean participation issue next week. The new IPC leader Andrew Parsons is scheduled to visit PyeongChang on Monday for the IPC Project Review meeting to examine local organizers' preparedness for the Paralympics.  North Korea has never performed at the Winter Paralympics, though it did take part in two Summer Paralympics. North Korea made its Paralympic debut in 2012 by sending one athlete to London, and was represented by two athletes at the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Paralympics.","document for pyeongchang paralympics ,2018 pyeongchang winter paralympic ,for pyeongchang paralympics participation ,for pyeongchang paralympics ,pyeongchang paralympics participation","['North Korea', 'Paralympic', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'the International Paralympic Committee', 'PyeongChang']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2079054   0.11125992

Frank Rijsberman, the Global Green Growth Institute’s director-general, speaks at a conference. “ South Korea to demonstrate how to develop renewable energy sources and invest in green growth,” Rijsberman said during an interview with The Korea Herald. The GGGI was launched in 2010 with the goal of bridging the rich and poor by sharing funding and technological know-how for environmentally friendly development. It seeks to introduce comprehensive planning frameworks for each member country. It has 26 donor and recipient member states working on 34 programs in 24 countries. “It’s also our mission to support green mechanisms and make sure actions are on the ground,” the director-general said. With South Korean President Moon Jae-in pushing to increase the use of renewables to 20 percent of the country’s total power generation by 2030, the country needs to focus on energy sources that are becoming cheaper, the GGGI chief stressed. “The biggest advantage of renewable energy is that it’s cheap. Korea is one of the OECD member countries that has the lowest renewable energy source use rate despite its severe fine dust problem derived from using fossil fuels.” Rijsberman said over the past 18 months, the price of solar energy fell by 70 percent -- it is on track to becoming the cheapest energy source and beating out fossil fuels. With regard to the government subsidies given to households and building owners for the installation of solar power grids here, he made it clear that the government should rethink the program. “Many countries have the government to provide subsidies for power grids, but it has become so cheap that they do not need to.”Currently, the Seoul Metropolitan Government is funding 415,000 won  for the installation of one 1.6-meter-wide and 0.9-meter-tall solar power panel at home. The resident pays the remaining 200,000 won, or can get additional subsidies from the district office.On worries that solar power grids are not quite reliable for widespread use, he said the key is innovation. “Part of that can be solved by connecting the grid with smart grid software. Korea is the world’s strong battery builder so it’s well placed to develop such programs,” he said.With renewable energy entrepreneurs like Elon Musk -- who runs a solar panel firm that specializes in efficiently storing large amounts of electricity in power banks -- solar grids for battery storage will be a “big game changer,” he said. Moving toward the paradigm of practical and cheap energy, Korea will go through similar discussions on nuclear power plants that climate leaders had in European countries, he said. “European countries also had  hard time meeting energy requirements, just like here in Korea.“Sometimes those shifts in society require a lot of discussion and there is a lot of resistance from implementing the system. Korea will go through various discussions and observations.”With global efforts underway to enforce the climate accord reached in Paris, the GGGI is hosting Global Green Growth Week 2017 together with the Government of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa from Oct. 17 to 20. World climate leaders will discuss topics such as climate finance; bankable projects in developing countries; the sustainable management of resources to address water and food security challenges; and the development of policies that drive environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth.By Kim Da-sol","green growth institute seoul ,global green growth institute ,the global green growth ,of global green growth ,global green growth","['Global Green Growth Institute', 'Seoul', 'Frank Rijsberman', 'GGGI', 'Korea', 'Frank Rijsberman', 'Global Green Growth Institute ’s']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4484264   0.61179221

Hanwha Group`s defense goods are on display at the AUSA 2017 Annual Meeting & Exposition in Washington D.C. in this photo provided by Hanwha Group. Hybrid Biho is a new weapon that combines the self-propelled anti-air artillery of the existing system with the Shingung short-range anti-air guided missiles.Hanwha transfered the equipment, weighing dozens of tons, from South Korea to the venue in D.C., which reflects its desire to make inroads into the local market.""South Korea has been an importer of the US weapons. I am deeply moved that we put the locally made weapon systems on display at the heart of the US, which is a defense industry power,"" said Lee Jae-moo, who's in charge of Hanwha's overseas sales of defense goods. ""We will push for aggressive marketing so that South Korea's defense industry will move forward through the entry into the US and Latin American markets.""Hanwha aims to become the world's top ten defense firm by increasing its arms sales to 12 trillion won  by 2025.Earlier this year, it appointed Bernard Champoux, formerly a three-star commander of the US Eighth Army in South Korea, to lead its department dealing with US-related projects.","2017 annual meeting exposition ,in major defense expo ,major defense expo underway ,expo underway in washington ,joins global arms expo","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hanwha Group', 'Washington D.C.', 'US', 'latin american', 'Hanwha', 'Annual Meeting & Exposition', 'the Association of the United States Army']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36853755  0.11026945

Heaps of garbage were thrown away nearby the southern end of the Wonhyo Bridge in Yeouido.  Garbage were thrown away at a bus stop in front of the event area. In the area street cleaners faced mounds of garbage haphazardly thrown away by the 1 million-strong crowd that attended the event. In order to prevent this, Hanwha, who organized the event, had precautionary measures in place on the night of the event; plastic refuse bags were handed out and warnings were issued to only dispose of waste at designated zones. However, it seems the effort largely went ignored.

The expressway in Seoul is seen congested on Sunday, the second day of the 10-day Chuseok holiday period. YonhapThe Korea Expressway Corporation said that as of 9 a.m., the travel time on the 428-kilometer-long expressway between Seoul and the southeastern port city Busan is expected to be 4 hours and 20 minutes. It is expected to take 1 hour and 50 minutes from Seoul to Daejeon, and 3 hours and 10 minutes from Seoul to Gwangju. The KEC said congestion started on major expressways from 8 to 9 a.m. and is expected to peak between 5 and 6 p.m. and ease around midnight.According to the authorities, the country’s notorious holiday traffic is expected to be lighter this year due to Chuseok being stretched out over a record 10 days. With the government designating Monday a national holiday, this year’s Chuseok holiday stretches from Saturday to Oct. 9. Still, huge numbers of vehicles are expected to travel across the country. On Sunday alone, 4.5 million vehicles are forecast to leave Seoul while 3.8 million are to enter the capital city, the authorities said. All expressways across South Korea will be toll-free for three days from Tuesday, a day before Chuseok. Travelers are preparing to go through the departure procedure at Incheon International Airport on Sunday. YonhapKorea’s main gateway also saw the highest number of travelers to date.Officials at Incheon International Airport said almost 2 million Koreans are expected to travel abroad during the Chuseok holidays. A daily average of 177,000 people left the country since the holiday kicked off on Friday, about 10 percent more people than the last year. To prepare for the higher-than-average influx, the airport has taken measures to make the process smoother, such as opening up the departure gates at 6 a.m., 30 minutes earlier than usual, to accommodate more passengers in the early morning flights.During the Chuseok holiday, the first subway coming from Seoul Station to the airport will also start running 30 minutes earlier than usual at 4:50 a.m.By Kim Da-sol","long expressway between seoul ,holiday expressways across ,highways congested airport packed ,seen congested on sunday ,428 kilometer long expressway","['Seoul', 'YonhapThe Korea Expressway Corporation', 'Seoul', 'Busa']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32263884  0.3501665

Yonhap    Kimchi and keytars -     It was the first of six evening performances, which included a flautist, a fan dance and a skit where two waitresses moved their limbs like marionettes, acting out a courtship between a male suitor and his darling.   Other waitresses buzzed around the restaurant, one moment grilling beef bulgogi  to be served with spicy kimchi , the next strapping on an accordion and heading to the stage.   They perform the 8:00 pm show every day of the week -- every single night of the year.   ""We makes small changes every time,"" one waitress said with an enthusiastic smile, when asked if she ever became bored of the nightly routine.   ""We arrange the music, we choose the costumes, we do everything,"" Kim Songum added.   As for holidays, the waitresses say they get a month off a year.   ""Of course, we go home to . It's home and it's cheaper there. Everything is free,"" Kim said, comparing it with the high cost of living in capitalist Dubai.   Speaking in English with help from a translation app, she said the waitresses are aware of the latest news from North Korean television.   ""We do not want war,"" Kim typed in Korean, pulling the phone back to add: ""But we are not afraid.""   'Gulf exception'?    Patrons entering Okryu-gwan cannot miss the enormous group photos of the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, flanked by the entire smiling restaurant staff.   The portraits are a treasured symbol of approval for the management, in a country which also enjoys close relations with rival South Korea and the United States.   The North Korean culinary establishment may be a taste of home for East Asian patrons -- even South Koreans, according to the waitresses -- but it is also a source of contention for Washington and Seoul, both on a fresh drive to isolate Pyongyang.   South Korea, which enjoys multi-billion dollar trade and investment ties with the Gulf states, has had recent success in pressing its allies to isolate its neighbour.   Kuwait City, the only Gulf capital to host a North Korean embassy, this month ordered its ambassador to leave and put a charge d'affaires in his stead.   Kuwait has also slashed the number of North Korean workers on its soil from4,000 to 1,500, according to a South Korean diplomat in charge of North Korean issues in the Gulf.   Qatar and Oman, which host up to 2,000 and 100 North Korean labourers respectively, are now phasing out those work permits, the UAE-based diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity.   Only the business-centric United Arab Emirates, with around 1,300 North Korean construction workers and restaurant staff, had ""unfortunately"" not taken any action, he said.   South Korea accuses North Korean authorities of confiscating a significant portion of the income of workers in the Gulf, which the diplomat said averaged around $1,000 per month.   But he acknowledged the financial contribution of an estimated 5,000 workers across the Gulf could not come close to funding a nuclear programme.   He alleged that North Korean authorities use restaurants and construction companies as cover for more lucrative side businesses.   But more important, the diplomat said, was the need to build a global consensus on implementing UN sanctions.   ""If we give an exception to the Gulf,"" he said, ""that is not good for the concept of international solidarity"".","cola in dubai ,waitress wearing stoplight red ,matching red coca cola ,pyongyang massive national canteen ,weekend night waitress","['Dubai', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'Coca - Cola', 'asian', 'North Koreans']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.34799135  0.06913124

""The government plans to consistently seek to offer humanitarian assistance regardless of political situations and will simultaneously make efforts to improve North Korea's human rights records,"" the ministry said.Seoul said that a center tasked with probing human rights violations will do its work in a full-fledged manner after it was launched in September 2016 in accordance with the relevant law.The law on the North's human rights was enacted and went into effect last year under the conservative government of Park Geun-hye, an ousted president on corruption charges.The 2017 action plan reflects the liberal Moon Jae-in government's stance on how to handle North Korea's human rights violations.Critics said that previous liberal administrations in 1998-2008 shied away from taking issue with the North's human rights violations out of concern that it could strain inter-Korean relations.Last week, Seoul approved a plan to provide US$8 million in aid to North Korea via UN agencies, citing a serious humanitarian crisis facing infants and pregnant women.It also said that the ministry will seek cooperation with UN bodies over the North's rights issue, adding that it will make efforts for the adoption of resolutions condemning North Korea's human rights at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.The action plan does not include Seoul's push for holding inter-Korean dialogue on human rights and identifying human rights perpetrators. Such plans were originally laid out in the three-year road map.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world. The North does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.Under the law, the government opened the Center for North Korean Human Rights Records, an agency to investigate and collect data on Pyongyang's rights situation.But the government has yet to launch a foundation to support relevant civic groups' activities and do research on the North's human rights violations due to a delay of the parliamentary process to recommend candidates for board members.","seoul 2017 action plans ,of seoul 2017 action ,2017 south korea unification ,north koreans this year ,implement three year strategy","[""South Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'North Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean']",19,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.84382653  0.41654536

The event on the pleasant Sunday afternoon featured performances of Indonesia’s traditional ensemble music Gamelan and lion dance Reog, marking the launch of weekly music classes for students. “Harmony in Gamelan is created through the disciplined application of each percussion instrument,” said Indonesian Ambassador Umar Hadi in front of some 40 Koreans and other audience members. “The same principle applies to our life as well. Our life cannot operate outside the boundary of harmonious existence with others.”An artist performs a traditional Indonesian dance at the Indonesian Embassy in Seoul on Sept. 17, where Gamelan ensemble music and Reog dance were featured. Emcees of the event at the Indonesian Embassy in Seoul on Sept. 17, where Gamelan ensemble music and Reog dance were featured. Gamelan is predominantly made up of percussive instruments, including metallophone, kendhang, xylophone, bamboo flute, rebab and sindhen. The music predates the Hindu-Buddhist culture that thrived in Indonesia millennia ago, and developed into the current form during the Majapahit Empire from the late 13th to early 16th century. In modern times, Gamelan has influenced Western contemporary, romantic, avant-garde and jazz music as well as Japanese contemporary music, leaving its unmistakable melodies in the works of composers Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, Bela Bartok, John Cage, Don Cherry and Ryuichi Sakamoto, among numerous others. “I have played Gamelan for many years since I was young. Whenever I play the music, I feel replenished and mystified by its soothing sounds,” the envoy said. “Gamelan incorporates many philosophies and traditions of Indonesia, chiefly our national motto ‘unity in diversity.’ There are many varieties of Gamelan in Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan, and even in Java there are many different kinds of Gamelan music.”Describing his compatriots as a “lucky people” exposed to the country’s sundry musical traditions -- a nation comprised of some 17,000 islands spanning three time zones -- Hadi said, “Our contemporary cultures are becoming more diverse and complex, as cultures merge to create new hybrid cultures. I hope the Korean people’s experience in learning Gamelan would lead to more creative endeavors between our two countries.”At the venue, Indonesian traditional dance group Kelompok Tari Tradisional Indonesia, Gamelan-performing ensemble Laras Garis and a team of dancers in Korea, Reog Singo Mudho, showcased their music, following a lunch of traditional Indonesian dishes. Laras Garis has Korean players, who use Gamelan instruments owned by the embassy and several Indonesian communities and universities in Korea.The embassy initially opened one Gamelan class for learners, but due to the surging number of applicants, has decided to offer two classes on Saturday. Korean students who have studied in Indonesia through the government-sponsored Darmasiswa scholarship program also participated in the event.  Indonesian Ambassador Umar Hadi A tiger dance by Reog Singo Mudho “Indonesian is a relatively easy language to learn, because it uses an alphabet and its pronunciation is similar to English. The grammar is simple with no past, present and future tense,” Jun Hyo-bin, who studied in the city of Solo for a year through Darmasiswa, told The Korea Herald. “I went to Indonesia because it is a growing country with many possibilities. The market is still unpenetrated in many ways, and people love Korea thanks to the ‘Hallyu Korean Wave’ boom.”The one-year scholarship -- covering all the costs of education, housing and food -- is organized by Indonesia’s Ministry of National Education in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs, and has been offered to foreign students from countries with diplomatic ties to Indonesia since 1974. Students learn about the Southeast Asian country’s diverse cultures and language, encompassing art, music, dance, cuisine, philosophy and more.Twenty-eight Korean students were selected from a pool of about 100 applicants for the 2017-18 program, and have started their education at leading universities in and around Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Malang, Medan and Aceh, among others.Students taking Gamelan classes at the Indonesian Embassy Indonesian Ambassador Umar Hadi  with his spouse and Reog dancers For those interested in experiencing Indonesia through the scholarship, Jun advised them to “live like locals, riding motorcycles, eating on the streets and rubbing shoulders with the natives.”“Although Indonesians and people of Southeast Asia are passionate about Korea largely through our pop culture, our understanding of their cultures is skin-deep and shallow,” she said. “Koreans make up the largest foreign community in Indonesia. But if you go there without any preparation, the chance of failure in business is high. Mastering the language and understanding the culture are crucial.”By Joel Lee","indonesian music dance spark ,weekly music classes ,in seoul on sept ,weekly music classes for ,of weekly music classes","['the Indonesian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'indonesian', 'korean', 'Gamelan', 'Indonesia', 'Gamelan', 'Reog']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17428915  0.27474999

But she doesn’t usually tell acquaintances where she lives. “My friends gave me a mixed look of pity and concern when I said I live in a gosiwon,” Park, 22, told The Korea Herald. A 3.5-square-meter Goshiwon room in Sinchon, one of the university neighborhoods in Seoul, is furnished with a desk, bookshelf and bed. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldGosiwon are a form of low-cost, cocoon-like accommodation, usually larger rooms divided by thin walls and makeshift doors. Rooms are rented on a monthly basis, and are the cheapest and most flexible form of housing in a country where better options almost always require handsome deposits. Rooms are as tiny as 3.5 square meters and furnished with a desk, bookshelf and bed. If you are lucky, you get a small refrigerator in the room. But unless you pay for the luxury of a private shower or toilet, you will have to share one with up to 40 other tenants. “But you know, living in gosiwon should not be something frowned upon by others, because it may be someone’s last resort to get a place to live,” said Park who attends a university in Sinchon.She is one of 1.3 million young Koreans who live in gosiwon units, basement rooms or makeshift rooftop houses. Park said there are some perks living in a gosiwon than in a university dormitory, although she ended up in a gosiwon because of a failure to apply in time for the dorm last semester. “There are some benefits. The  rooms are cheaper and I do not have a curfew.”Gosiwon rooms generally cost 300,000 won  a month and come with a shared kitchen with complimentary rice and kimchi, although the food is often poor quality. “I do not eat the rice. Chinese rice is not delicious nor of good quality,” Park said, adding that she normally goes to a convenience store on the first floor to buy something to eat. Park’s room, which does not have a window, costs 200,000 won a month. The monthly rent goes up to 500,000 won for a room with a private bathroom and a window.“I wanted to save money for the next semester. It’s OK to live here even though I can clearly hear the man living next door fart and burp through the thin wall.” In one of the Goshiwon in Sinchon, each room is separated by walls and doors. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldGosiwon originally took off as a distraction-free housing option for students preparing for exams to become public servants and legal practitioners.Amid soaring housing prices here, however, gosiwon now function as living spaces for ordinary students, college graduates, or people on a tight budget who can’t afford to rent a house with a big deposit amount.Industry data shows that housing prices in major metropolitan cities continue to soar. Prices of homes in Seoul apartment complexes rose to 5.89 million won per square meter as of June.Even those who make it onto the property ladder can find themselves stuck. In Seoul and the surrounding area, 4 in 10 homeowners under 35 are house poor, according to Statistics Korea last year, meaning the cost of housing left them without enough money to meet the basic cost of living. In recent years, the popularity of gosiwon as living spaces has grown rapidly in areas near schools as well as office-packed areas in Seoul.“Not only students, but low-wage workers began seeking refuge in various forms of gosiwon,” said Hwang Kyu-seok, head of the Korean Gosiwon Society. “Even areas like Sillim or Noryangjin -- districts where academies for aspiring civil servants are located -- are seeing more nonstudent tenants than before,” he added. According to government data, there are at least 12,000 registered gosiwon across the country. About 7,000 of them are in Seoul.Due to their affordable prices, gosiwon have become a refuge for society’s most vulnerable, such as migrant workers, low-income earners and seniors with no family to rely on. Some of them die in their rooms and go unnoticed for weeks. In June, a man in his 50s was found dead in a gosiwon in Busan. It was reported that he had experienced economic hardship and that malnutrition may have caused his death. Police said that he seemed to have no family, friends or close relatives. In 2015, a 20-something woman was found dead in a gosiwon about two weeks after her death.Data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that the number of solitary deaths surpassed 1,245 in 2016, just five years after the figure hit 682 in 2011. Many of those deaths took place in gosiwon, police said. Civic activists demand the government come up with measures to support the house poor. “I hope the Moon Jae-in administration can provide a clear vision for the young house poor in the country, rather than focusing on policies to help prospective home buyers. Implementing practical measures to help them with housing will naturally solve social issues like late marriages and low birth rates,” said Lim Kyung-ji, chief of the Minsnail Union, a housing cooperative for young people. Kim Jin-ah, 22, who has lived in a gosiwon since she opted to live alone three years ago, said, “When it comes to other necessities of life, students can handle food and clothing, by doing part-time jobs. But we cannot really do anything about shelter.” But she doesn’t think her gosiwon life is bad. There are positive sides to it, she said, in keeping with the global fad for micro homes and minimal lifestyles. “Before, I thought living in a big house was a recipe for happiness. But now I know I can be happy, living in a small room,” said Kim.

It will be the first Olympics in South Korea since the 1988 Seoul Summer Games.In mid-March, China banned the sale of group tours to Seoul in retaliation against the installation of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in southeastern South Korea, which Beijing sees as a security threat.The move has sent the number of Chinese visitors to South Korea tumbling, hitting the local tourism industry hard. South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Lotte groups have taken a big hit in the wake of China's retaliation.Industry sources said the upcoming quadrennial sports showcase may improve the strained ties between economic powerhouses in Asia. During a summit in Berlin in July, South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to visit Seoul on the occasion of the Winter Games. Moon and Xi may ""make a decision"" to iron out the conflict over the missile defense system should the Chinese leader pay a visit to Seoul next year, they said.""We hope that the PyeongChang Games will serve as a chance to eliminate negative factors for the South Korean economy, such as China's retaliation against South Korea over the THAAD deployment and North Korea's nuclear risk,"" an industry watcher said. ""South Korean companies' active marketing activities during the games will likely help tide over the crisis.""China's retaliatory measures have dealt a harsh blow to South Korean companies. Hit hardest is retail giant Lotte Group that has invested more than 8 trillion won  in China.Lotte Group is now in negotiations with foreign companies to sell its discount store chain in China, having decided to withdraw from that market following Beijing's retaliation.About 80 percent of the 112 Lotte Mart stores in China have been closed for more than six months following a series of economic measures taken by China against Lotte's land-swap deal with the Seoul government to host the US missile defense system. Lotte Mart's damage is expected to reach 1 trillion won by the end of this year. Lotte exchanged its golf course in the southeastern county of Seongju, where the THAAD battery is now being installed, for a lot of land near the South Korean capital of Seoul.On the domestic market, Lotte's duty-free business has been floundering due to a tumble in the number of Chinese tourists.Lotte officials expected the upcoming Winter Olympics to come as an occasion for China to start relaxing its retaliatory measures.""The PyeongChang Games will be a global sports festival, so we hope they will serve as an opportunity to resolve conflicts and misunderstandings between countries,"" said an official of Lotte, an official sponsor of the Olympics.Lotte is not alone. Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. -- South Korea's top two automakers -- also want the Winter Games to become a turning point in Sino-Korean relations as the prolonged diplomatic tension has battered its operations there.""Hyundai and Kia will introduce their eco-friendly and self-driving technologies to Chinese athletes and tourists who are expected to visit South Korea during the games, thus refurbishing their image to consumers in China,"" a Hyundai Motor Group official said.Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, the flagships of the world's fifth-largest automaker Hyundai Motor Group, have been designated as domestic sponsors of the PyeongChang Games, and they plan to provide hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and self-driving cars for the Olympics.The hope comes amid their plunging sales in China. Hyundai and Kia sold a combined 576,974 vehicles in the world's largest car market in the first eight months of this year, down a whopping 44.7 percent from the same period a year earlier.Concerns are growing that the combined sales of Hyundai and Kia may drop below the 7 million mark this year, retreating to a level posted six years earlier.Despite rising hopes, some watchers offer a pessimistic outlook, saying the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may not help ease China's retaliation dramatically. ""There are no signs of China lifting its retaliatory measures that have been in place for more than six months,"" an industry source said. ""It may take a long time for things to return to normal even if China decides to end its retaliation.""","pyeongchang winter olympics may ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,winter olympics may ,winter olympics may serve ,sunday the winter games","['PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'China', 'US', 'PyeongChang', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70524389  0.76606846

Two years later, the new decade saw the completion of the Seoul-Busan expressway -- a project personally overseen by late President Park Chung-hee and often considered a milestone in Korea’s industrialization. Since then, the network of highways have expanded to over 4,000 kilometers, and nearly 700 kilometers of new and extensions will be added by 2024. While the primary function of expressways is to facilitate the movement of vehicles, they have become a major industry in their own right.The Jungang Expressway near Danyang, North Chgungcheong Province. According to Korea Expressway Corporation, the state-run body that manages most of the expressways, there were more than 4.2 million highway journeys each day last year. The figure comes to over 1.5 billion journeys a year, raising over 4 trillion won  in toll fees. In addition, the rest stops – now numbering over 170 – employ thousands of people across the nation, and serve as retail and logistics hubs in areas that would otherwise have little commercial activities. For travelers, rest areas provide welcome breaks from journeys that can take unreasonably long for such a small country. Although the distance from Seoul to Busan comes in at just under 400 kilometers, the average duration of the journey came to about 7.5 hours during last year’s Chuseok holidays. “I used to love stopping at rest areas. It was great just begin able to run around after having spent what seemed to be forever in the back of my father’s car with my brother,” 40-year old Kim Min-sung said, recalling his childhood trips to his father’s hometown of Daegu.“I don’t think there were so many  back then, and my brother and I would start begging our parents to stop at every single one soon as we set out.”With increasing traffic and the number of rest areas, and rising living standards of Koreans, the role of such establishments have also changed.Long gone are the days when rest areas were far and between, and offered basic services.Many rest areas now include a range of retail stores, as well as specialty restaurants and entertainment. “There are some rest areas where they sell particularly good regional specialties like walnut cookies, and I have driven to a rest stop just to get a snack,” Joo Ha-yun, a 27-year old IT worker said.“There is a rest area with a dog park that is on a whole different scale in Gyeonggi Province, and I have also driven there just to play with my dog for the day.”South Korea’s expressways themselves sometime provide the stage to scenes not often seen elsewhere. Like the city roads, the expressways are not free from the nation’s notorious traffic jams, and at times and locations of slow traffic, opportunistic merchants lie in wait. Some arrange their wares -- ranging from children’s toys to wood carvings -- on the sides of the roads, while bolder entrepreneurs can often be seen venturing out to the lanes to walk in between the cars.

They were written and stretched in 3-D and formed together in a cylinder shape.PyeongChang's organizing committee said the medals were also inspired by the texture of tree trunks, as trees represent the work put into developing Korean culture and the Olympic Games. Medals to be awarded at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics are presented at a ceremony in Seoul on Sept. 21, 2017. From left: TV personality Jung Chan-woo, an honorary ambassador for PyeongChang 2018; Song Seok-du, governor of administrative affairs for Gangwon Province; Do Jong-hwan, minister of culture, sports and tourism; Lee Hee-beom, head of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics organizing committee; and Sean, South Korean recording artist and an honorary ambassador for PyeongChang 2018. ""Hangeul is the foundation and the soul of Korean culture,"" PyeongChang's organizing committee said. ""Hangeul is considered the seed that eventually blossoms and bears fruit, which symbolize Korean culture. The trunk is the process of that development.""PyeongChang said the process also resembles efforts of athletes preparing for the quadrennial competition.Each medal is 92.5 millimeters wide, 109 mm long, and between 4.4 mm and 9.42 mm thick.The gold medal weighs 586 grams, the silver 580 g and the bronze 493 g. Compared with the previous Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, in 2014, PyeongChang's gold and silver medals are heavier and bronze medal is lighter.The gold and silver medals for PyeongChang are 99.9 percent silver, and the gold medal is plated with 6 g of gold. The bronze medal is made of red brass. PyeongChang said it will create 259 sets of the medals. Of them, 222 of them will be awarded to the medal winners at the Olympics, and five sets will be set aside in case of ties. The International Olympic Committee will retain 25 sets for display overseas, and seven other sets will be exhibited in South Korea.According to PyeongChang, the IOC approved the medals in March and gave positive reviews of their design.PyeongChang also presented the medal lanyard, which has snowflake patterns embroidered on ""Gapsa,"" a type of cloth used to make the traditional Korean costume hanbok. Light teal and light red were used in consistency with the look of the 2018 Winter Olympics. The words ""PyeongChang 2018"" and the five Olympic rings are embroidered on the Gapsa lanyard.The curved pattern of the medal case was inspired by the Korean traditional architecture, PyeongChang said.""Now that the medals have been unveiled, I can really feel that the Olympic Games are fast approaching,"" said Lee Hee-beom, head of PyeongChang's organizing committee. ""The medal itself and its lanyard both highlight the traditional beauty of Korea. IOC officials who saw the medals beforehand raved about how refreshing and creative the medals are.""Lee Suk-woo, the designer of the medals, said he wanted to present Korean traditional aesthetics ""in multi-dimensional fashion.""""I tried some new techniques and went through a lot of trials and errors,"" Lee said.

Parents of the infant, who was hospitalized for urinary stone treatment at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital in western Seoul, found what appears to be a tiny insect floating inside the plastic bag connected to the child, at around 8 p.m. Sunday. It was about 14 hours after the young patient began receiving fluids from it.  The administration was stopped immediately and the child was put under close medical observation, undergoing several tests, the hospital said. As of Tuesday morning, there is no sign of a potential impact on the patient’s conditions, it added. The hospital reported the case to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for further investigation. In the meantime, it has banned the administration of such IV bag products to patients, it said. Families of the patient blamed hospital staff for negligence and a flawed hygiene management of the medical equipment. The hospital, however, put the blame to the manufacturer of the IV bag or the needle, suspecting that the insect may have gotten inside during the manufacturing process. It is nearly impossible for the insect to find its way through the needle and end up in a sealed IV bag, it claimed. Both the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and the hospital said there has been no reported case of an insect found inside an IV bag.

Mexico is Korea’s top trade partner in Latin America, while Korea is Mexico’s sixth-largest trade partner worldwide. Over 1,600 Korean companies operate in the Mexican market of $1.5 trillion, increasingly in innovative projects, the envoy highlighted. Kia Motors opened a new production facility in Mexico in September last year, and the first Mexican industrial investment transpired in the city of Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, with the launch of a steel dust recycling plant in June.Since July, a new direct flight connecting Mexico City and Seoul has also begun. Ambassador Lee Jeong-kyu, Korea’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs, expressed his condolence for the loss of lives and property in the recent violent earthquake and hurricane in Mexico on Sept. 7. Turning to North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations, Lee said the Mexican government has always taken a consistent stance against the dangerous brinksmanship, strongly condemning Pyongyang’s sixth nuclear test on Sept. 2 and expelling the North Korean ambassador in response.

The group will attend seminars and visit several colleges in Korea for the promotion of cultural exchanges. From the 17th to 19th centuries, representatives from both sides had visited each other during the Joseon era to enhance diplomatic ties between the Korean king and the Japanese shogun. They shared traditional artworks and also played a role in reaffirming friendly relations following the Japanese invasion of Korea that took place from 1592-1598.The two neighboring countries submitted a joint application to register the centurieslong exchange program on the UNESCO Memory of the World list in 2016. The result will be announced later this year. An official who organized the event this year said the program would help build friendships among the participating students, especially in the face of current diplomatic challenges as nuclear threats from North Korea continue to grow.By Bak Se-hwan","korea for weeklong cultural ,south korea for weeklong ,weeklong cultural exchange trip ,of japanese college students ,for weeklong cultural exchange","['japanese', 'South Korea', 'Joseon Tongsinsa', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Waseda University', 'Keio University', 'Septhrough', 'japanese']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51491117  0.36508426

Most of the damage caused by the downpours, or 230 cases, were reported there. Busan Small buildings collapsed and some 600 elementary, middle and high schools as well as 400 kindergartens were closed. Soil at a construction site was washed away, damaging six cars. At least nine people were rescued after they were trapped in waterlogged buildings or cars. Seven major roads were temporarily shut down.Some 210 national parks were restricted from access, and 15 flights were canceled. No deaths were reported. Heavy showers, which began to batter the southern region early Monday morning, continued through the early afternoon. All the heavy rain warnings in seven cities were lifted as of 12:30 p.m. A heavy rain warning is issued when a region is expected to receive more than 110 mm of rain in six hours or more than 180 mm of rain in 12 hours. As of noon, Geoje had received the most rainfall of 308 mm, followed by Tongyeong at 273 mm and Busan with 263.2 mm. Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province were not affected.After the unexpected downpour, the weather agency came under fire for its failure to predict the rainfall and its botched response. The weather agency initially forecast more than 30 mm of rain to fall per hour, totaling some 150 mm in southern regions. Text messages were belatedly sent to citizens to notify them of the restricted roads in Busan, hours after the restriction was lifted. Regional education offices informed students that schools would be temporarily closed at around 8:10 a.m., after some students had already left for school. The KMA cited the high temperature and humidity, coupled with low atmospheric pressure, as the reason behind the heavier than expected rainfall. According to a 2017 report from the Board of Audit and Inspection, Korea’s weather agency got about 46 percent of predictions accurate between 2012 and 2015.","southern cities torrential downpours ,torrential rain hits busan ,busan southern cities torrential ,korea on monday flooding ,rain hits busan southern","['Korea', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Busan', 'Jeolla', 'Gyeongsang']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24474601  0.20778142

The 100-meter stretch of land at the back of the embassy did not formally belong to the British mission, but was incorporated into the compound since the 1960s. The issue was put under the spotlight in 2010, and raised with the embassy, leading to a memorandum of understanding between the embassy and the Seoul Metropolitan Government. “Whether residents of Seoul or visitors from other parts of Korea or abroad, I hope that as they walk along the road they will catch a glimpse of the natural and cultural legacy of this area, and reflect on the unique contribution that it has played in the history of the great city of Seoul, and its relations with the rest of the world,” British Ambassador to Korea Charles Hay said at the commemorative ceremony on Aug. 30. British Ambassador to Korea Charles Hay  and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon  mark the return of Doldamgil Road to the public at a ceremony on Aug. 30 “The embassy was committed to finding a solution that allowed for the development of a green cultural and historic zone at the heart of Seoul without compromising the security of our people and of our historic buildings,” the diplomatic mission said. “As with any such changes to the infrastructure and integrity of an embassy compound, the proposal was thoroughly reviewed by security and other experts in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. Their decision was that the increased security risks associated with the project were not compatible with the FCO’s duty of care to embassy staff, clients and visitors, and that there were no suitable mitigation measures that could be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The embassy therefore reverted to the idea simply of returning the leased land. ”The embassy is committed to giving opportunities to the public to see the embassy and its grounds, it explained, mentioning the Jeong-dong Culture night organized by Jung Gu government and the Seoul Open Night organized by Seoul Metropolitan Government. Both events have allowed ordinary Korean citizens to experience and witness the embassy compound, it said.By Joel Lee","british embassy in seoul ,seoul returned the doldamgil ,embassy in seoul returned ,years the 100 meter ,in seoul returned","['the British Embassy', 'Seoul', 'british']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77340829  0.14031926

The map suggests a visit to a section of the famous stone wall surrounding Deoksugung palace, which was restored and opened to the public just last month. The 170-meter section of the 1.1-kilometer wall had been occupied by the British Embassy here for nearly 60 years. It displays traditional South Korean architecture meeting the beauty of fall foliage. An abandoned oil reserve base in Mapo, northwestern Seoul, was recently re-created into a “cultural reserve base,” an eco-friendly park housing several cultural infrastructures. The oil depot now houses a concert hall and exhibition center. An underground military bunker in Yeouido, South Korea’s main financial district, is also a unique spot where Seoul transformed a forgotten war venue into a modern art space for locals. It had been off-limits to the public since the 1970s and its reopening this month is expected to draw many curious visitors. The map also recommends a stroll on the overpass-turned-park Seoullo 7017, which received over 3 million visitors by its 100th day open. Seoul also plans to finalize the renovation of 6.3 kilometers of railroad tracks in Nowon, northeastern Seoul, to an eco-friendly trail. The trail is set to open in November.

Asia Society Korea is the Korean branch of the New York-headquartered Asia Society, which was founded in 1956 to promote mutual understanding and strengthen partnership between Asian nations and the United States. It now runs centers in 10 locations -- four in US cities, apart from New York, and six outside America, including China, India and the Philippines. Asia Society Korea was established in April 2008, with support from Christopher Hill, the 25th assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Richard Holbrooke, former chairman of Asia Society. Since then, the institute here has been promoting cooperation between South Korea and the Asia-Pacific region through seminars and forums dealing with social issues. Through its major project Asia 21 Young Leaders Initiative, the institute has built a network of over 800 leaders from 30 countries. The initiative kicked off in 2006 and annually selects 30 leaders of the year to support them.

Over the past three years, KIS worked together with the GAA and the Irish Embassy for the football tournament as a way to introduce Irish as well as other international cultures to the students. During the tournament, KIS students enjoyed the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and to develop communication and problem-solving skills while interacting with them. Through organized team sports like football, students can foster teamwork, leadership and perseverance, the school said. These skills are critical for the students to work as a team and get tasks done, it added.

The scale of the annual event has doubled since 2012, when it was first launched with participants from 15 countries and two international organizations. This year, the number has increased to 37 countries and three international organizations. SDD is Korea’s only high-level multilateral security dialogue and has developed into one of the top three security dialogues in Asia along with Shangri-la Dialogue and China’s Xiangshang Forum. However, there is still a long way to go. SDD will have to aim for a role in a unified Korean Peninsula as its long-term goal, but for the short run, it will have to deeply consider its direction during the five-year term of President Moon Jae-in.  Hwang Jae-ho, a professor of International Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.First, SDD needs to make full use of its platform capability. The Korean government has recently established the Korea-ASEAN Vice Defense Ministers’ Dialogue and has hosted multiple meetings such as Korea-Africa, Korea-Mekong, UN PKO contributors, Korea-V4 . Such meetings can be incorporated into SDD as special sessions. For instance, discussions on military interchange and defense cooperation can be carried out under the title of Korea-ASEAN defense cooperation. Korea should strengthen military ties with middle powers in addition to its relations with US, China, Japan, and Russia. Beside the existing MIKTA countries , other significant middle power countries like Canada, Vietnam, Italy and Saudi Arabia should be added to the club of MIKTA.SDD needs to clearly differentiate itself from other security dialogues. The dialogue should select a theme more related to its home region. If Shangri-la Dialogue is specialized in the South China Sea issue, SDD should focus more on the North Korean crisis. The main theme of the sixth SDD, “Visions for Security Cooperation in an Era of Uncertainty” was appropriate with US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un becoming more engaged in a war of words and North Korea’s ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons posing a threat to South Korea, US and Japan. However, it was not enough to address the immediate threats faced by the region. The theme should focus more on the North Korean issue in the future. SDD should give the impression that officials can update their security information related to the Korean Peninsula only when they actually attend the meeting. For the first time this year, SDD had an official from the US Department of Defense to brief proven facts. It could be good for the dialogue to include a closed briefing session for representatives to share information on North Korea. SDD can also either create one main session in which many nations interested in North Korea can participate or have several special sessions on specific issues such as North Korea’s internal problems, ballistic missile capabilities and nuclear threats. A shift from quantity to quality is needed. This year, for the first time, SDD included discussions on the influence of the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ on weapons system and warfare and the effects of future warfare on states’ defense policies. Although these are appropriate and important topics, work is needed to give them have more Korean colors. More specific topics need to be covered. For example, participants can discuss on the North Korean issue, Korea-China-Japan defense cooperation, military build-up on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia as well as confidence building measures in the region. Cyber security and maritime security which are already regularly discussed should include military implications for Northeast Asia and Korea. SDD should be able to lead the security discourse. It should select and dominate creative issues. It would be good to invite military strategists or theorists who have deep understandings of military security trends to lead the discussions.The content and suggestions discussed in the sessions should be able to be incorporated into policies. Discussions should not only be focused on issues such as North Korean missile threats but they should also cover possible solutions and policy responses. Sessions can be organized together with relevant countries to select a topic that can help achieve joint performance or coordinate policies. SDD should naturally induce interest and participation of related countries instead of forcing attention. The Chinese military delegation did not attend the dialogue both this year and last year due to the ongoing tussle over South Korea’s deployment of the US’ Thermal High Altitude Area Defense system. SDD should not beg for participation of those who are not willing to come. Instead, the dialogue should create its own charm to make them feel that they are losing voice and are harming their national interests. The scale of SDD has grown but it is important to fill it up with good content. In order not to hear the Korean proverb, “There is nothing to feast at parties that are rumored to be the best,” in-depth discussions and joint action plans will need to be carefully organized. Only then the SDD will be able to enhance the competitiveness and contribution of Korea’s national defense power and become the blue ocean of Korean diplomacy.

It also raises rent, driving some residents out of their homes.In Barcelona, as a result, anti-tourist rallies took place and a group of masked men punctured tour bus tires. Some tourist bicycles were also damaged. Residents at tourist destinations in Seoul like Bukchon Hanok Village are no exception.

As it was the bear’s second time being captured there, it has been disputed whether the bear should be allowed to settle in the new habitat.   A black bear captured in Sudo Mountain The bear was first released into a special protected area on Jirisan in 2015, 10 months after it was born in January that year. Due to the GPS failure of a chip implanted in the animal, his whereabouts had been unknown until he was caught on Sudosan in June for the first time this year. The bear is believed to have passed through Hamyang and Geochang in South Gyeongsang Province to reach Sudosan, according to the ministry. The animal’s move had surprised many, as the average typical radius of the species’ activities is less than 15 kilometers. The farthest that a black bear on Jirisan had gotten was to Hamyang in South Gyeongsang Province, which is 15 kilometers away. Calls are rising for the quick release of the bear, which has been in captivity for over a month in a nature adaptation center on Jirisan, but opinions are sharply divided over the location of its release.Environment activists say that the bear’s move is not a simple deviation, but its natural instinct to explore a new habitat. However, the government is worried about human safety and habitat protection.Opponents calling for the bear to be returned to its original habitat argue that Sudosan is not equipped to protect endangered bears and that it could also put passers-by in danger due to possible encounters with the animals. Park Bo-saeng, the mayor of Gimcheon City where the mountain is located, asked for the government to designate it as a natural habitat for the bears and promised “to create the best environment for the wild animal.”The Ministry of Environment is still considering the best option, but agrees with the need to release KM-53.“We are trying to release the bear as soon as we can, but nothing has been decided yet. It is very difficult to decide on the location because there are so many different opinions,” ministry official Kang Mi-jeong told The Korea Herald.South Korea first released four bears on Jirisan in 2001, before its endangered species restoration project officially kicked off three years later. Now, there are 47 black bears living in the Jirisan area.Considering that the receptive capacity of a natural habitat for black bears is thought to be 50, experts say it is time for the ministry to seriously consider expanding the area for the bears.

At her wrap-up press conference, Lindberg said she was ""very pleased with the progress"" by PyeongChang.""This visit has given me full confidence that PyeongChang is ready to welcome the world next February,"" she said. ""We saw firsthand the advancements that have been made in venues and infrastructure as well as heard updates on plans to further engage with Olympic fans. Details must now continue to be refined in the coming months to ensure the successful delivery of the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games."" Gunilla Lindberg, head of the International Olympic Committee`s Coordination Commission on PyeongChang 2018, speaks at a press conference at Alpensia Convention Centre in PyeongChang, Gangwon Province, on Aug. 31, 2017. Lindberg also called on PyeongChang to generate more buzz for the Olympics with the start of the second phase of ticket sales next week and the torch relay set to begin on Nov. 1.""This is an opportunity for Koreans to show their pride and be a part of what will be remembered as a historic time for their country,"" she said. ""It'll be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Koreans to come together and spur their athletes to Olympic glory. I would encourage them to not miss this chance.""Lindberg identified one area of concern for the IOC: PyeongChang's plans for the use of its Olympic venues after the Games. Lindberg said the definitive plans for several venues are still missing.""The IOC once again requests the final plans be presented as a priority,"" she said. ""This is a concern for us. We are expecting the plans to be ready by the end of November. We have pushed not only PyeongChang but local and national governments to come back with plans for the legacy.""Lindberg also noted that the absence of the National Hockey League pros in the men's hockey tournament will not have a negative impact on PyeongChang 2018. NHL pros have competed in every Winter Olympics since 1998, but the league office has announced it will not send the players to South Korea this year.Lindberg said the IOC has been involved in all relevant negotiations with the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation, but the show will go on as scheduled.""We'll have all the countries participating in the ice hockey tournament with or without NHL players, and most of those players are very good players,"" she said. ""I don't think you'd see such a big difference. We can guarantee that the ice hockey tournament will be an exciting one.""Regarding the possible presence of North Korean athletes here, Lindberg said the IOC has extended an invitation to North Korea to take part in PyeongChang 2018, reiterating what IOC President Thomas Bach previously said.""The IOC has promised to help North Korean athletes with extra training and to have the facilities if they need them for qualification,"" she said.

A 33-year-old man surnamed Lee filed a suit against the tech giant in 2011 requesting legal acknowledgment of the multiple sclerosis he had developed over the years of working at a Samsung factory as an industrial accident. His claim was turned down by two lower courts, which both cited a lack of evidence to prove his workplace, the liquid crystal display panel production line in Cheonan, south of Seoul, had caused the disease.   Families of industrial accident victims and a civic group representing them hold a press conference in front of Samsung Electronics headquarters in southern Seoul, on Jan. 13, 2016, urging the tech giant to come up with preventive and compensation measures. The Supreme Court quashed the judgments by the lower courts and sent back the case to the appeals court to be retried. The top court said, ""It is highly probable that the causality of Lee's illness and its aggravation may well be acknowledged in relation to his work.""It noted that Samsung's repeated refusal to disclose details on toxic substances at its production facility has hindered the plaintiff's efforts to substantiate his argument and said this should be taken into account. The court also said Lee comes from a family with no such medical history and that he was diagnosed with the incurable disease at the age of 21, far younger than the average of 38.  Lee, who worked there from 2002 to 2007, was tasked with checking the image quality of the display panels. In 2003, he started having conjunctivitis and nerve dysfunction then had chest pains and joint problems. He has argued he was exposed to electromagnetic waves and other harmful chemicals for over 12 hours a day. Lee's case is the first that the country's top court has recognized such a claim as an industrial accident. Two other former Samsung production workers with the same disease were accepted by lower courts as industrial victims in May and July, respectively, with another pending an assessment result from the state compensation and welfare agency. So far, a total of 21 workers have won legal battles for the acknowledgment as victims of industrial accidents, according to court records. They had mostly worked at semiconductor and LCD production lines, and have suffered from leukemia, breast cancer, brain tumors and other neurological disorders.","ailing ex samsung worker ,ex samsung worker south ,neurological disorder 33 year ,ex samsung worker ,ailing ex samsung","[""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Lee', 'Samsung']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25768569  0.12270727

The conference was inaugurated in 2003 as a venue for women scientists to share their research work and findings. It has since been organized in 2009 and 2013. This year's conference is expecting attendees from 23 nations.Plenary speakers include Justine Cassell, professor at Carnegie Mellon University, on socially aware artificial intelligence, and Jung Jae-ung, professor at the University of Southern California, on the Zika virus and brain defects in babies. Special sessions have been arranged on the fourth industrial revolution and future technology.","women scientists to meet ,conference of women scientists ,women scientists and engineers ,in seoul this week ,women scientists","['the International Conference of Women Scientists and Engineers', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63309228  0.49634811

The man, Daniel Olomae Ole Sapit, was quoted as saying, ""There's a lot of confusion between the two.""The KOCIS officials had been worried that the similarity of the two names, coupled with the much higher level of the North Korean capital's international recognition, could cause visitors to mistake the South Korean ski town for Pyongyang.As part of ways to distinguish the South Korean host city from the North Korean capital, PyeongChang has opted to capitalize the ""c"" in its name.With the Olympics just over five months away, the KOCIS officials said they are no longer afraid, as their efforts to publicize the Olympics overseas have paid off, and they are confident South Korea's first Winter Olympics will be a success. This April 2017 file photo shows Canadian women posing for a photo with the mascots of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics -- Soohorang , a white tiger, and Bandabi, an Asiatic black bear -- during an event at a Toronto hotel to whip up interest for South Korea`s first Winter Games that will be held in the host city of PyeongChang, some 180 kilometers east of Seoul. The KOCIS, which serves as the control tower for the country's endeavors to make the Olympics known around the world, is working with the Korean Culture Center, which has been posted in 31 regions worldwide; King Sejong Institutes, which offer foreigners Korean language courses and Korean cultural activities; the Korea Tourism Organization; and the Creative Content Agency's overseas branches.The Korean Culture Center in New York engaged in publicity work for the PyeongChang Olympics through cultural activities, including a choir performance from the South Korean city of Daegu in June.In Ottawa, the Korean Culture Center has utilized the mascots of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics -- Soohorang, a white tiger, and Bandabi, an Asiatic black bear -- when it made pitches for the Olympics timed with the Changing of the Guard ceremonies taking place on Parliament Hill.The Korean Cultural Center in Paris has organized a Korean culture festival to promote the Olympics in the resort city of Honfleur in Normandy Province.With 32 offices in 20 countries, the Korea Tourism Organization is waging an all-out war to attract foreign tourists to South Korea with the Feb. 9-25 Olympics.South Korea is also promoting the Olympics to foreigners visiting state-run King Sejong Institutes set up overseas to teach the Korean language. The King Sejong Institute Foundation, the operator of the institutes, has said it is screening a promotional video for the PyeongChang Olympics in Korean cultural classes at 174 institutes in 58 countries around the world.A video, made by the KOCIS and released in July to celebrate the 200-day countdown to the 2018 Winter Olympics, has already garnered more than 8 million views. The video features South Korean magician Yu Ho-jin, who became the first magician from Asia to win the top prize at the International Federation of Magic Societies World Championship of Magic in 2012.High-profile personalities who have been designated as promotional ambassadors for the international sports event include soprano Jo Su-mi; Taeyang, a member of boy group Big Bang; the girl group Girl's Day; comedian Kim Byung-man; and former English Premier League player Park Ji-sung.Other outlets that the KOCIS is using for making pitches for the sports event are overseas broadcasters and news organizations.The US broadcaster NBC, the rights holder for broadcasting the Olympics in the United States, aired video clips on the Olympics through its program ""Today Show"" in March to April and will feature the sports event in the broadcaster's weekly travel and lifestyle television program in October.Promotional videos on the Olympics have been aired on other broadcasters, including CNN, Eurosport, Fox Sports, Fuji TV, America TV, and Vietnamese and Chinese ones.The KOCIS, which has also arranged for the coverage of the Olympics by news organizations from 40 countries, plans to invite an additional 60 journalists from overseas to the Olympics by December.Other events implemented by the KOCIS include a tour of the venues involving journalists at foreign news organizations in South Korea and the release of Olympics-related ads through overseas major broadcasters to mark the 100-day countdown to the Olympics.An official at the KOCIS said festivals and events held following the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics have given the country opportunities to tout itself as a well-off country. ""But through the Olympics this time, we plan to instill the world with a message that the country has grown up well thanks to its help, and it's about time for us to give new dreams and possibilities back to the world,"" the official said.","pitches for pyeongchang olympics ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,for pyeongchang olympics the ,pyeongchang winter olympics according ,for pyeongchang olympics","['pyongyang', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'Korean Culture and Information Service', 'south korean', 'korean', 'Oly']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2477966   0.34120455

The findings were released by a team of researchers from Seoul National University‘s Graduate School of Public Health, and were from the analysis on bacterial DNA of fine dust concentrations in Seoul, Beijing and Nagasaki in Japan. South Korea is bordered by China to the west and Japan to the east.  Over the yearlong study, the researchers found that 83 percent of the total species of airborne bacteria overlapped in Seoul and Beijing. Seoul and Nagasaki showed a 73 percent similarity of bacterial communities, while Beijing and Nagasaki had 66 percent. Researchers said the highest similarity was observed in spring and winter, noting the speed and frequency of the prevailing northwesterly wind blowing from the Siberia region.Bacteria species like proteobacteria, firmicutes and actinobacteria -- common types of bacteria found from the human skin -- accounted for 67 percent of bacteria found among these three cities.“Findings are meaningful as it catalogs the diversity and similarity of bacteria in the airborne dust detected in the three Northeast Asian cities, but further study is needed to conclude that bacterial movements are driven by meteorological factors,” said professor Kim Ho who led the research.

South Korean table tennis player Hyun Jung-hwa  and Li Bun-hui from North Korea playing double matches under a unified team at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships. The rival Koreas sat together for talks for the first time after the 1950-53 Korean War, indicating that sports exchanges could be used to ease military tensions even in the wake of a particularly bloody conflict.Their attempt to make a united team fell through, but international sports games had served as a venue for the two Koreas to come to talks and seek reconciliation.South and North Korea fielded joint teams at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship.South Korean table tennis player Hyun Jung-hwa played double matches with Li Bun-hui from North Korea, upsetting China, which was gunning for a consecutive title.The 1991 world championships marked the first time the two Koreas created a united team in any international sports competition, and the team remains the only joint Korean squad in any sport to win an international title.Since 1991, the two Koreas have failed to create a single team. But athletes from the rival Koreas marched under a unified Korean flag at the opening ceremonies of the Olympics and Asian Games several times including at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics and the 2002 Busan Asian Games.North Korea did not take part in the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul, but it sent a delegation of three high-ranking officials -- Hwang Pyong-so, Choe Ryong-hae and the late Kim Yang-gon -- to the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games held in the South.Top military official Hwang is a close aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, making him the highest-ranking North Korean official to have visited the South in recent years.At the height of military tensions in 2002 when a naval skirmish occurred near the western sea border, North Korea sent its sports team and a cheering squad to the Busan Asian Games in South Korea.There were scant sports exchanges during conservative governments of President Lee Myung-bak and his successor Park Geun-hye from February 2008 and May 2017.Amid strained ties, athletes from the two Koreas did not jointly march at the opening ceremonies of international sports games since the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.","pyeongchang olympics will facilitate ,winter games the government ,2018 pyeongchang olympics will ,korea hopes sports exchanges ,the 2018 pyeongchang olympics","['South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'North']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64535922  0.56204438

However, the city is becoming greener as local governments turn to forests to battle pollution. Forests in urban areas work as filters for air pollutants and fine particles. According to the National Institute of Forest Science, a single tree can absorb 35.7 grams of fine dust particles in a year -- an amount that could fill an espresso cup. A coniferous tree can absorb up to 44 grams of air pollutants, and environmentalists say such trees help raise humidity and reduce temperatures in cities. Visitors stroll through a forest in Seoul. A study conducted by the NIFS showed that in April, when the amount of fine dust particles peaks, the level of PM 2.5 concentration hits an average 75 micrograms per cubic meter inside an urban forest, while 110 micrograms per cubic meter can be recorded near bus stops.“The presence of a large number of plants, trees and shrubs contributes to the cleaning of the air,” said Park Chan-yeol, a researcher at NIFS. “What is important is that the greenery inside the city significantly contributes to air purification in terms of absorbing the dust produced by urban traffic.”Urban forests also help the city cool down.A study by the Seoul Institute showed urban forests can decrease temperatures by as much as 7 degrees Celsius and increase humidity by up to 23 percent. The study also observed that temperatures on tree-lined streets were an average 2.5 degrees lower, which researchers say is equivalent to operating five air conditioners for five hours in a room the size of 15 square meters. With more citizens preferring to live near wooded areas, certain areas of Seoul have also seen property values rise sharply. Despite increased awareness of the benefits of trees, Seoul remains far less green than other cities.The World Health Organization’s recommended per capita urban forest area is 9.9 square meters. London has the most with 27 square meters, followed by New York with 23 square meters. Seoul’s per capita urban forest area amounts to just 4.4 square meters.In April, the city government mapped out a new initiative to establish more than 400 forests by 2023 to offer outdoor education programs such as “forest kindergartens,” where children living in urban areas can experience nature.“As many citizens share the opinion that there is a lack of opportunities for them to experience nature in Seoul, we will continue to build more urban forests for families, children and senior citizens so they can enjoy the benefits of greenery without having to travel to the countryside,” said Choi Gwang-bin, a Seoul City official in charge of the green policy division.By Kim Da-sol","forests to battle pollution ,in seoul concrete jungle ,urban forests offer greener ,pollution forests in urban ,greener life in seoul","['Seoul', 'the National Institute of Forest Science']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62443298 -0.00289764

Yonhap Their visits were arranged by the city government as part of its effort to attract more tourists amid a continued tourism boycott by China in retaliation against Seoul’s decision to deploy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here. The number of tourists to Korea in May -- a peak tourism month for the Chinese with a weeklong holiday marking Labor Day -- fell 27 percent on-year to 1.08 million tourists compared to last year, with a 60 percent drop in Chinese visitors. To ease the impact of China’s boycott, the Seoul Metropolitan Government launched a tourism program to provide benefits to tourists coming as a group, mainly targeting those from Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries. In a joint effort with the Korea Tourism Organization, the city government opened a tourism promotion booth in Taipei last week to attract visitors. It was the third of its kind, following promotion booths in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, earlier this year. According to the Seoul City’s tourism policy division, those who travel as a group and stay in Seoul for over two nights with an accumulated 100 nights of stay as a group can receive 20,000 won  to 30,000 won of sightseeing subsidy per person. Travelers can also participate in one of five sightseeing programs hosted by the city government, which include visiting Seoullo 7017 and Bukchon Hanok Village.As a result, the city government said at least 350,000 visitors from Taiwan visited Seoul during the first half of this year, an about 28 percent jump compared to last year. Those from Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries went up by 53.3 percent over the same period. “The city government will continue to come up with creative programs and promote the benefits of trips to Seoul, especially in the MICE tourism sector, for groups who are brought for a particular purpose like meetings, incentives, conference and exhibitions,” said Kim Jae-yong, head of the Seoul City’s tourism policy division. In recent years, Southeast Asian firms and institutions have been sending thousands of employees and students to Seoul on trips, on the back of the growing popularity of South Korean TV shows and K-pop.In April, employees of insurance firm AXA from Indonesia came for a weeklong tour and participated in a bike-riding program near the Han River, followed by a group of students from an Indonesian university who visited in July. The staff of an underwear manufacturer from Vietnam also visited Seoullo 7017 in the same month through Seoul’s sponsorship. By Kim Da-sol","tour seoul for five ,thousands of taiwanese tourists ,trips some 000 employees ,tourists to visit seoul ,will tour seoul for","['Taiwan', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'group', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43753323  0.44164094

The inaugural October Pyongyang Marathon will run on Oct. 22 this year,"" an advertisement by Uri Tours said. This file photo released by North Korea`s KCNA on April 9, 2017, shows foreigners taking part in the 28th international marathon in Pyongyang.  This adds to North Korea's existing annual marathon event held every April in Pyongyang. The new event was also announced in the tour agency's Facebook account late last month. ""This spectacle is sure to offer a more intimate local marathon experience running directly alongside far higher numbers of North Korean runners than in April,"" its Facebook feed said.The website advertisement said any foreigners, Americans and other nationalities, can apply to run for the October marathon, adding that participants will be given an exclusive Pyongyang Marathon medal as well as a matching T-shirt. Whether Americans would in fact join the marathon is unclear, however, as the US imposed a travel ban, forbidding Americans from visiting North Korea from September. The measure was taken after American college student Otto Warmbier died after being released in a coma in June from a 17-month detention in North Korea. North Korea has denounced the US travel ban and has vowed to continue to leave the door open for Americans intending to visit the country. The North Korean move also suggests the country's continued efforts to source foreign currency through the foreign tourism industry amid tightening international sanctions on it.","new annual international marathon ,annual international marathon in ,annual international marathon ,international marathon in october ,marathon event for oct","['Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Uri Tours', 'the United States', 'China', 'north korean', 'Wednesda']",19,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.64486521  0.66152632

As the seat allocation process opened at 10 a.m. at the Seoul Bankruptcy Court in southern Seoul, applicants filled out forms, threw them into a box and crossed their fingers to be one of the lucky 30 people to watch the court issue its verdict on the country’s most prominent businessman. Reflecting the keen public interest in the case, 454 people entered the draw for the 30 seats reserved for the general public in the 150-seat courtroom. The remaining seats were reserved for the accused’s family, lawyers and reporters. Lee, the only son of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee, is on trial for bribery in connection with the corruption scandal that led to former President Park Geun-hye’s ouster. He faces charges of bribery, embezzlement and illegal transfer of assets abroad for paying or promising to pay 43.4 billion won  in donations to foundations controlled by Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil and in sports sponsorship to Choi’s horse-riding daughter. Lee has denied all the charges. Friday’s court session will begin at 2:30 p.m. Judges will decide whether to convict Samsung’s heir and de facto chief, and if he’s found guilty, will hand down a sentence. “I wanted to see justice served myself. I think the case was a typical one showing cozy relations between politics and business in the country,” said Han Sook-hyun, a 24-year-old university student. “I hope the court gives a righteous ruling and it paves the way for a more just and fair society.” Yi Kye-hyang, 54, called the ruling “symbolic” and “historic.”“Whether Lee is punished is not only a matter for Lee and Samsung Group, but an important matter for the public,” said Yi, who took a half day off to participate in the draw with her two children. “I thought it would teach my children a good lesson.”“I hope that the sentence hearing will be televised as the public interest is at stake,” she said. It is not yet decided whether the verdict hearing for Lee and Samsung executives will be televised. According to a recent change in court rules, the sentence hearings deemed crucial for public interest can be broadcast live. There were also many avid fans for ex-President Park who they believe was falsely accused by liberals and a biased media. They say Samsung Lee couldn’t have bribed Park, since the former leader is not the kind of a person who pursues personal interests. Park is on trial on 18 charges including bribery for making the alleged deal with Lee. “The ruling must prove Lee and Park’s innocence. I have watched the court proceedings, but they were filled with lies. The trials have been too biased against them,” said Kim Mi-ja, 57, who said she has attended hearings for Lee and Park as a spectator several times. As a court official picked up 30 pieces of paper and read out numbers to announce who gets a seat at the sentence hearing, there was both excitement and disappointment. “I could not believe it when he called my number. I feel so good! I appreciate it,” said a 60-something woman, who only gave her surname Park. She cheered and clapped hands as the court official called her number 363.Some angrily complained about a lack of seats allocated to the public. “Why only 30 citizens are allowed in the courtroom that can house 150 people? Please explain why!” a man in his 60s shouted at the court official. The court said it had reduced the seats for spectators to maintain order and ensure security. Special Counsel has sought 12 years in prison for Lee, claiming that the money was a bribe to win the government’s backing of the 2015 merger of Samsung Group’s two affiliates. It viewed the merger as a crucial step for a smooth leadership transition from its ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. Former President Park, in return for the money, is suspected of having pressured the state-funded National Pension Service, the largest stakeholder in Samsung C&T;, to vote in favor of the controversial merger.

172,172,[Herald Interview] How comfort women statues got to ride Seoul buses,"Five Seoul buses have recently received an unusual passenger -- a statue of a barefoot teenage girl in traditional Korean hanbok dress.

Do...","Five Seoul buses have recently received an unusual passenger -- a statue of a barefoot teenage girl in traditional Korean hanbok dress. Similar to the original statue situated in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, the lightweight effigy represents the euphemistically labeled “comfort women” -- women mostly from South Korea and China who were forced into sex slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Donga Traffic Service CEO Rim Jin-wook appears behind a statue of a girl installed on one of his company’s commuter buses in Seoul. Their bus ride, unveiled on the eve of the Aug. 15 Liberation Day, which marks Korea’s independence from Japanese colonial rule, has been the talk of the town in Seoul. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, accompanied by a group of journalists, rode one of the buses on Aug. 14 to pay tribute to the victims. Commuters have shared photos of the statues they encounter on the buses via social media.Behind this much-publicized event, which has also grabbed the attention of Japanese media and politicians, is Rim Jin-wook, owner of Donga Traffic Service. It was Rim who first came up with the idea and he who pushed for it, assuming the entire cost by himself. “Some may call me nationalist or political, but I’m doing what I can do as a citizen,” Rim said at the firm’s garage in Ui-dong, northern Seoul. “Only 37 of the victims are still alive . They will die sooner or later.”Rim wanted to remind passengers of the plight of comfort women and protest against the 2015 deal between the Seoul and Tokyo governments to “finally and irreversibly” settle the issue, which did not consider victims’ opinions. “The deal was made without any consent of the victims, which was just outrageous and unacceptable. I’m not a politician or in any position to protest the deal alone, but as a head of a bus company, I wanted to fight it in my own way.” Rim said. Under the deal, Japan offered 1 billion yen  in compensation, though without acknowledging legal responsibility. The money was channeled via a South Korean fund to some former comfort women and their families. The statues were created by artist Kim Eun-sung and his wife, who made the original in front of the Japanese Embassy. Rim met Kim at an alumni event in 2014. “I went to the same college with the artist, although we did not know each other back then. I called the couple earlier this June to see if they were interested in designing a set of lightweight copies to be installed on my buses and they said OK,” Rim explained. Pictures of the statues riding the buses have been carried by almost every major newspaper in South Korea. Those taken by passengers have gone viral through social media, successfully rekindling the public’s interest in the unresolved wartime atrocity.Some have paid tribute to the statues by placing floral wreaths at their knees. Others put socks on their bare feet. Not surprisingly, Rim’s actions have irked Japan, which has reacted sensitively whenever a new comfort women statue is erected. One day after their unveiling, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga publicly expressed concerns over the operation of the buses carrying statues, according to Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun. “Japan and South Korea are making efforts to develop a future-oriented relationship,” Suga told a press conference, adding that setting up the statues “may put a damper on the efforts,” the news outlet reported. Japanese news outlets, including the largest broadcaster NHK, also weighed in, saying the statues could make Japanese travelers uncomfortable.Affected bus routes include some spots favored by Japanese tourists, such as Namdaemun Market and Lotte Department Store in Myeong-dong.But that doesn’t seem to bother Rim at all. “Just think about how absurd it is when a political heavyweight such as a chief cabinet secretary himself reacts extremely sensitively to a mere owner of a local bus company like myself. If they feel uncomfortable about it, I think they should feel the same way to the horrific plight of our victims,” Rim opined.“The statues will be on the bus until the end of September as scheduled,” he said.

As part of the event, a 300-meter-long and 22-meter-high “bobsleigh waterslide” was open to the public Saturday to draw public attention to the 2018 Winter Olympics.At least 5,000 citizens gathered Saturday and waited for an average of two hours, Seoul City said. The ride was free of charge. However, the operation of the waterslide only lasted 12 hours Saturday from 10 a.m., after Seoul City officials canceled the operation Sunday following a forecast of sudden downpours in the capital on Sunday. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the city government and Gangwon Provincial Government spent 250 million won each on ordering 2,000 custom-made tubes specially designed for the large-scale waterslide. Over 400 million won went into borrowing and installing the waterslide, while 130 million won was used to hire on-site staff. Another 200 million won was spent to alert citizens to traffic restrictions in the area for four days -- from setting up the waterslide Friday until its dismantlement Monday morning. Major traffic jams continued until Monday morning, as the dismantling of the waterslide was delayed due to rain. At least three bus-only lane were blocked, leading to the inconvenience of commuters on their way to work. “Seoul City should spend such money on events for good causes, instead of wasting taxpayers’ money for just one-time entertainment or a promotional event,” wrote a commenter online. As the complaints continued, the city government released a statement Monday, saying the two-day event not only involved the operation of the waterslide but also other activities such as musical performances, Olympics promotion booths and food stalls. It added that the entire budget was not just spent on the waterslide. Seoul City’s spending on the installation of facilities or structures has long been at the center of public criticism.“Shoes Tree,” a giant art installation made from thousands of worn-out shoes, was installed in front of Seoul Station in May, in line with the opening of the highway-turned-park Seoullo 7017.The city government spent 139 million won to create the 100-meter-long and 10-meter-wide installation, with most of the budget spent on setting up the metal skeletal structures of the piece. Many called the installation “monstrous” and “eerie.”By Kim Da-sol","winter olympics the waterslide ,pyeongchang 2018 winter olympics ,22 meter high bobsleigh ,2018 winter olympics stands ,winter olympics stands idle","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyeongchang']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11817245  0.06657325

The catchphrase, which urges Melakan citizens to reduce littering in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a reflection of the city’s strong drive to make it inclusive, resilient and sustainable not only for today’s population, but for future generations.  Students look around the energy-saving facilities on the rooftop of Ramada Hotel Melaka as part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop in Melaka, Malaysia, on July 9. “I learned how the effective management of the systems can turn a city into an eco-friendly city, with the backing of government’s measures and policies,” Zaw Zaw Aung, a 22-year-old student from Myanmar, told The Korea Herald.“It is sad many cities around the world are losing their culture, but Melaka has been doing an excellent job in incorporating its local culture and environment in a modern style to make it more sustainable.” Three students carry a bag bearing the slogan ""Don't mess with Meleka"" in Melaka, Malaysia, on July 9. Along with the Myanmarese student, some 40 young people from South Korea and four countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia -- joined a five-day trip in Malaysia last month, the second part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop organized by ASEAN-Korea Centre and International Youth Centre. ASEAN-Korea Centre's Secretary General Kim Young-sun and tudents plant trees along a river as part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop in Melaka, Malaysia, on July 9. By taking part in lecture, field trips and cultural activities, they not only rediscovered a meaning of sustainable development in terms of economic growth, environmental protection and social inclusion, but also forged strong networks to continue their partnership in building sustainable cities in Asia.Making cities sustainable is considered a crucial part of meeting the United Nations’ sustainable development goals as more than half of the world’s population -- some 3.5 billion people -- live in urban areas today and cities are the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The role of developing countries, especially the 10 ASEAN countries, is vital as it has a combined population of 900 million people as of 2016, some 12 percent of the world’s population, and urbanization is rapidly taking place in their cities. Malaysia is already positioning itself at the forefront of developing cities in a sustainable way by shifting to green energy, improving public transport and dispersing population nationwide. Melaka, a trading hub in Asia in its heyday, is one of the pioneering green cities promoted by the Malaysian government. Through the river rehabilitation project, it improved the irrigation system to clean the muddy water and prevent flooding. Melaka, Malaysia The participants looked around Ramada Plaza Melaka, which earned a Green Apple Award from the municipality, for its efforts to adopt an eco-friendly way of business, picked up litter and planted trees along the Melaka river. They also visited the city‘s solar farm at the Melaka World Solar Valley. But going green in terms of energy consumption is not all the city has to offer. Christ Church in Melaka, Malaysia It has turned itself into a popular tourist spot with its rich history and multicultural heritage affected by trading and cultural exchanges between East and West. It has well-preserved architecture which originated in the Malay sultanate in the 15th century and the colonial era under Portuguese and Dutch. Melaka riverside, Malaysia “As for city planning, I think that Korea should learn to protect the environment and cultural heritage to make cities sustainable. Melaka’s environment and culture are well preserved, while I think that Korea tends to focus more on destroying and re-building things,” said Im Chae-hyeon, 25, from Busan. The students also visited Putrajaya, the federal administrative capital of Malaysia, which became a sustainable low-carbon city with a goal of reducing its greenhouse emissions intensity by 60 percent by 2025, compared to 2012 levels.  Putrajaya, Malaysia In Putrajaya, buildings were constructed in accordance with green building standards. Solar photovoltaic systems are installed and electric buses are run. It also has the country’s first man-made wetland in the city.“Putrajaya’s buildings look all different. I felt like Malaysians have made efforts to conserve diversity in terms of building designs rather than focus on applying advanced technology,” said Cho Young-ju, a 22-year-old student from Korea. Students post for a photo at Wawasan Park, Putrajaya, Malaysia, on July 11. “I think diversity is an important factor in making cities sustainable. Technology can be copied, but diversity, perception and culture cannot.”Malaysia is one of the most multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-lingual society, with Malays, Chinese and Indians making up the largest ethnic groups. With its culture stemming from indigenous tribes, it has incorporated suitable elements from Chinese, Indian, Persian, Arabic and western cultures and created its own.“Malaysia’s sustainable cities are telling a story,” the center’s Secretary-General Kim Young-sun said, noting that Korea’s signature smart city Incheon is rather focused on promoting cutting-edge and energy-saving technology. “What makes sustainable cities truly sustainable is the cities’ history and culture, along with technology and environment. I hope that Korean students learn from Malaysia where diverse cultures coexist in harmony,” he said. “I hope that youths from the 10 ASEAN countries and Korea work together, form friendships and grow as future leaders through this program,” Kim added. In the first part of the workshop held from July 3-7 in Seoul, some 80 students visited facilities such as a sewage treatment plant and a tidal power plant in Incheon. They also received lectures on ASEAN-Korea relations and sustainable development from experts. Under the theme of “Promoting Clean and Green Environment through the Establishment of Environmentally Sustainable Cities,” students toured Korea and Malaysia from July 3 to 13. For the participants, it was a chance to realize the importance of continued exchanges from ASEAN countries and Korea. “The experience in both countries helped me to figure out how we can achieve a sustainable city development for our country,” said Nur Fazliyana Binti Yusoff, 21, from Malaysia. “Malaysia can learn from South Korea’s advanced technology in saving energy and environment. And Korea can learn from Malaysia‘s green environment  and use of nature,” she said.At the closing ceremony, five groups of students made presentations on ways to improve cities they chose. Some chose to transform Indonesia’s capital Jakarta into a green city, others chose to make Jeju Island and Incheon environmentally-sustainable. The top award was given to the team which suggested ideas for Jeju Island now grappling with the soaring number of tourists and environmental damage by the tourism boom. Some of their ideas for the municipality was to set up more bike rental stations, allow ride-sharing application like Uber and encourage use of electric rental cars. The ASEAN-Korea Centre, an intergovernmental organization established in 2009 to enhance social, economic and cultural exchanges between ASEAN countries and Korea, has held an annual youth workshop on environmental issues since 2013.By Ock Hyun-ju / The Korea Herald Correspondent","asean students contemplate sustainable ,students contemplate sustainable city ,asean students contemplate ,contemplate sustainable city development ,malaysian city to learn","['MELAKA / PUTRAJAYA', 'Malaysia', 'Melaka', 'english', 'Melaka', 'southeast asian', 'Korea', 'malaysian', 'Melakan', 'UNESCO']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40407339  0.35195127

Transportation is one of the key elements of preparations for the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in the nation's east coast resort town of PyeongChang in Gangwon Province, which lies some 180 kilometers east of Seoul. New roads to be opened this year include a 22-kilometer expressway between Seongnam and Anyang, which will help reduce the overall travel time from Incheon International Airport to the main Olympic venues by 40 minutes to about 95 minutes.A 72-kilometer extension of the expressway between Seoul and Yangyang, Gangwon Province, will also open by the end of this year, reducing the travel time from the capital to the remote coastal city to 90 minutes from the current 130 minutes, according to South Korea's transportation ministry.In June, another new highway linking East Hongcheon and Yangyang in Gangwon Province was opened. It used to take two to three hours to reach Yangyang, 215 kilometers east of Seoul, using existing highways and roads. This has changed, with provincial roads from East Hongcheon to Yangyang being transformed into an expressway. A speedway already exists between the capital and the city of Hongchon. Depending on traffic, it could take about 90 minutes to get from Seoul and Yangyang, according to the ministry. The new expressway will not only allow visitors to have better access to the host cities, but also take some traffic volume off existing expressways.Previously, Yeongdong Expressway 1 was the only major expressway bridging the Seoul Metropolitan area and Gangwon Province, but following the opening of Yeongdong Expressway 2 last November -- a route between Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, and Wonju -- and now with the Dongseo Expressway, Gangwon Province-bound traffic is expected to flow better. The authorities also said they are working on renovating road surfaces and other traffic facilities.While improving long-distance accessibility, Gangwon Provincial Government is trying to ensure comfortable and speedy travel near the Olympic venues. The officials are expanding or constructing 16 roads, and nine of them are 90 percent complete, while rest are 75 percent done.The organizers said these roads will be completed by November.","upcoming winter olympic games ,the upcoming winter olympic ,the 2018 pyeongchang olympic ,upcoming winter olympic ,2018 pyeongchang olympic venues","['PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'transportation', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon Province']",19,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03784329 0.45851451 0.07069709],Yonhap,Social affairs,8,2017,"the upcoming winter olympic games ,upcoming winter olympic games ,upcoming winter olympic games in ,june another new highway linking ,for the upcoming winter olympic","['PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'transportation', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Seoul', 'Seongnam', 'Anyang', 'Incheon International Airport', 'olympic', 'Seoul', 'Yangyang', 'Gangwon Province', ""South Korea 's"", 'East Hongcheon', 'Yangyang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Yangyang', 'Seoul', 'East Hongcheon', 'Yangyang', 'Seoul', 'Yangyang', 'Yeongdong Expressway 1', 'Gangwon Province', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Wonju', 'Gangwon Province', 'Gangwon Provincial Government']",12,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03784329 0.45851451 0.07069709]

The ranch in Daegwallyeong allows an opportunity to view herds of cattle and sheep as well as beautiful landscapes all year round. Premium beef produced there, called ""Daegwallyeong hanwoo,"" is a must-eat in the area. An ice park featuring the Olympic rings opens at a snow festival in South Korea`s alpine town of PyeongChang, the venue for the 2018 Winter Olympics, on Feb. 3, 2017. Looking for winter activities for special fun, one option is to visit Hoenggyeri village in Daegwallyeong to take part in a snow and ice festival held every winter.If you want to fish for trout, known as ""songeo"" in Korean, through a hole in the frozen Odae Stream in the town, get ready to experience the PyeongChang Songeo Festival. PyeongChang is home to the fish's first and largest farming area. PyeongChang trout has a springy meat and high quality taste.The Bongpyeong area in the town is the hometown of renowned novelist Lee Hyo-seok  and is famous for its buckwheat production. A visit to Lee's birthplace and his memorial hall gives a glimpse to his literature world, including the writer's most famous story, ""When Buckwheat Flowers Bloom.""A cultural festival featuring the writer takes place every September that is aimed at paying heed to Lee's literature at a time of buckwheat flowers reaching full bloom. At the festival, visitors will find a variety of foods made of buckwheat including jelly ""muk,"" pancake ""jeonbyeong"" and noodles ""makguksu.""Timed with the Olympics, dishes newly developed for visitors include ""hanwoo bulgogi,"" or sliced prime beef marinated in sweet soy sauce, buckwheat pasta, rice topped with trout, ""hwangtae kalguksu, or hand-rolled noodles in dried pollack broth, and trout dumpling. -- Gangneung, a cultural city in harmony with tradition, coffeeIn Gangneung on South Korea's east coast, which will host competitions on ice, visitors are offered opportunities to enjoy touring sites of culture, history and arts as well as the natural scenery.Just 10 minutes from Olympic Park is Gyeongpodae Pavilion, a must-visit place known to be the No. 1 tourist attraction on the east coast. It is often said that in the pavilion, visitors are able to see the sky, the sea, the lake and the moon reflected in a glass of drink and the pupil of one's eye.The lake of Gyeongpo, around which many young people walk on a date, has Wolpa Pavilion on it. The name Wolfa originated from the sight of lake being shaken by waves in the moonlight.Near Gyeongpodae are the birthplace of Heo Nanseolheon, a 16th century poet, and the Ojukheon house, where Shin Saimdang , Korea's maternal icon associated with raising Korean Confucian scholar Yulgok of the Joseon Dynasty, lived. It is also worthwhile to visit Seongyojang, an aristocratic house and one of the best preserved traditional houses in Korea. Cherry blossoms reach full bloom near Gyeongpo Pavillion and Gyeongpo Lake in the city of Gangneung on South Korea`s east coast in this undated file photo. Just south of Gyeongpo Beach is Chodang Dubu Village, which produces ""sundubu,"" or soft Korean-made tofu. In the making of Chodang dubu, salt water from the East Sea is used in the congealing process that results in a soft and light tofu. The name of this village, Chodang, originates from the pen name of Heo Yeop, the father of writer Heo Gyun and poet Heo Nan-eolheon.Other delicacies in the area are raw fish and white noodles in spicy raw fish soup ""mulhoe.""Gangneung is also characterized by the popularity of coffee.People's love of coffee is palpable wherever you go in Gangneung, as there are more than 300 coffee houses in a city with a population of 220,000. Strolling on the coffee street of Anmok Beach, visitors can spot many coffee houses roasting their own coffee beans. A group of seasoned baristas has set up coffee houses on the street since 2007, leading to the establishment of the coffee street.-- Jeongseon, a town of folk song ""Arirang""The town of Jeongseon, which will host the Olympics' alpine skiing speed events, is strongly associated with the origin of ""Arirang,"" a traditional folk song that was put on UNESCO's intangible heritage list in 2012.The Olympic town is best known for ""Jeongseon Arirang,"" one of the folk song's variations that is Intangible Cultural Asset No. 1 designated by the Gangwon provincial government. Essentially a simple song, Arirang consists of the refrain ""Arirang, arirang, arariyo"" and two simple verses, which differ from region to region. Experts estimate the total number of folk songs carrying the title ‘Arirang' at some 3,600 variations belonging to about sixty versions.Visitors to a traditional market that is open every five days in the town are treated to a glimpse into how everyday Koreans used to live and a performance of ""Jeongseon Arirang.""Also at the market are homegrown medical herbs and traditional dishes that include ""gondeure bibimbap,"" or edible wild plant ""gondeure"" mixed with steamed rice, sesame oil and soy sauce. A bronze statue of Virgin Auraji stands in Auraji in Jeongseon, a town in the northeast province of Gangwon. Two other dishes available are the weird-looking but tasty noodles ""olchaengi guksu"" -- noodles of dough droplets that look like tadpoles -- and ""kotdeung chigi"" -- buckwheat noodles. Meaning hitting one's nose ridge, the noodles of kotdeung chigi are rough and solid in texture.In order to do sports with a scenic view, visitors can take part in Jeongseon Rail Bike, a 7.2 kilometer-long ride in a comfortable rail bike that passengers pedal through the area's landscape. The bike sits on a continuous descent that makes it easy to ride along clean valley waters and crimson red foliage.At the end of the ride is Auraji Station, a pier on the Dong River that flows from PyeongChang to the nearby towns of Jeongseon and Yeongwol in Gangwon Province. Auraji is also the birthplace of ""Jeongseon Arirang Aejeongpyeon""The folk song involves the heartbreaking story of a woman whose husband, a raftsman, departs down the river one day never to return. A bronze statue of Virgin Auraji representing the woman stands near the station.","pyeongchang winter olympics set ,winter olympics towns ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,pyeongchang winter olympics ,winter olympics towns in","['PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon', 'Gangneung', 'Jeongse']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64397508  0.14738412

YonhapSouth Korea on Wednesday won the bid to host the international quadrennial event in Saemangeum, North Jeolla Province, at the 41st World Scout Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. Saemangeum competed with Poland’s coastal city of Gdansk and won 607 to 365 in a ballot held among the 168 members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. Each member nation was allowed six votes. President Moon Jae-in shared a congratulatory message via Facebook saying, “I’d like to thank the President of the Korea Scout Association, Ham Jong-han and all who .”“I hope the effort of North Jeolla Province leads to the development of Saemangeum,” he said. Moon also vowed to back the event with full government support and said he is personally looking forward to watching the “grand spectacle” of the global gathering.About 5,000 youth scout members from 168 countries are expected to gather in the area for the 12-day event. A government think tank report shows the event is capable of generating about 79.6 billion won  in economic impact and 1,054 jobs at a national scale. The North Jeolla Province government unveiled plans to establish special laws and a committee for the event, along with measures to secure funds. It is also preparing to build sustainable infrastructure dedicated to global youths, with accommodation services and camping grounds. Despite South Korea entering the race almost a year later than Poland, North Jeolla Province officials campaigned rigorously. The delegates personally visited scout associations in major continents to ask for support. The Korea Scout Association has been actively pursuing the 2023 event in order to mark 100 years since its establishment in 1922. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also attended the Baku conference to join the campaign and meet with key scout officials there. The Saemangeum area spans 40,200 hectares and is home to the world’s longest man-made seawall at 33.9 kilometers. The seawall was completed in 2010 to attract businesses mostly in the agriculture and renewable energy industry. It was also certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest man-made sea barrier in the world, in the year of its completion. On the other hand, it has also financially burdened the South Korean government for decades, as both environmental and political issues slowed the construction process. A total of 7.3 trillion won is believed to have been invested in the project so far. The Moon administration has been ramping up efforts to invigorate Saemangeum by building roads connecting the area to other key cities. The first phase of the two-tier construction project is slated to be finished by 2022. The 2023 jamboree coincides with the WOSM’s goal to enter China and expand its membership to 100 million. South Korea hosted the World Scout Jamboree in 1991 in Goseong, Gangwon Province. The event is believed to have contributed to the local community through cultural development and road expansion, with 19,000 scout members from 135 nations participating. The World Scout Jamboree was first organized by The Boy Scout Association in London in 1920. The event is attended by scouts aged between 14 and 17.By Jung Min-kyung","2023 world scout jamboree ,korea to host 2023 ,scout jamboree in 2023 ,korean delegation celebrates winning ,host 2023 world scout","['South Korea', 'south korean', 'Baku', 'Azerbaijan', 'YonhapSouth Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61808276  0.52660221

Park said he is envisioning a city that is similar to a southwestern city of Freiburg in Germany, which is known as the greenest city in the world with eco-housing and car-free streets. The Seoul Metropolitan Government’s green energy division told The Korea Herald that it is currently studying a budget expansion for 2018 to financially support more households to install solar panels at their houses. As of June, 34,000 households installed solar panels at their houses, less than 1 percent of a total of 3.6 million households in Seoul. Seoul City officials attributed such a number to a lack of subsidy to promote use of solar power. Currently, the city government is funding 415,000 won  for installing one 1.6 meter wide and 0.9 meter tall solar power panel at home. The resident pays the rest of 200,000 won, or can get additional subsidies from the district office. The panel can be attached to the veranda to generate up to 30 kWh of electricity per month, enough to run a refrigerator. By Kim Da-sol","seoul city to expand ,solar energy in 2018 ,energy sources seoul mayor ,wishing to install solar ,he will declare seoul","['Seoul City', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56124085  0.19731261

Dubbed “Kil Won-ok’s Peace,” the EP contains some 15 songs that she liked to sing, including “Bitter Daedong River,” which was originally sang by Sohn In-ho. Ten youth volunteers also participated in the recording, which begin last September. She was able to achieve her lifelong dream at the age of 89, with the help of a civic group, the Korea Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. Kil, who was born in Huichon, South Pyeongan Province, in North Korea in 1928, was taken to Harbin in China and was forced to serve as a sex slave in 1940, when she was 12. She was later moved to Shijiazhuang in 1942, and was forced to spend three more years serving the military there.She will first perform in the tribute ceremony taking place at Cheonggye Square located in Jongno, Seoul, Monday.

Starting from next week till the end of September, five buses will have seats that feature a light-weight copy of the 1.5 meter-tall bronze statue of a barefoot girl seated on a chair, created and erected in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul in 2011 by artists Kim Woon-sung and Kim Seo-kyung.  A girl statue symbolizing victims of Japan's sexual slavery during World War II. It is part of a campaign to remember the victims of sexual trafficking by theJapanese military from 1939 to 1945, many of whom have died. “The victims were forcibly taken out of the country during the Japanese colonial era and into isolation and sex slavery . We hope the bus campaign can console and free their souls,” artist Kim Woon-sung who is organizing the event told The Korea Herald. After the bus event, the statues will be moved to five different locations nationwide where they will be displayed for the Chuseok holiday in October, or Korean Thanksgiving.  Around 200,000 women are said to have been forced by the Japanese authorities to work as wartime sex slaves. Most of them were Korean, while others were from China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Indonesia. The issue is a long-standing thorn in Japan‘s diplomatic ties with the victims’ countries. South Korea and Japan signed a settlement deal in 2015, describing it as ”final and irreversible,“ but the new Moon Jae-in administration is seeking to scrap the agreement, calling it “unacceptable to the public sentiment.“ Artists and activists have been installing around the world dozens of the Peace Statues to honor the victims.As of January, there are approximately 55 such statues nationwide, and others in the US, Canada, Australia and China. Seoul City officials said the city is currently reviewing necessary procedures regarding the installation of the artworks on buses to support the event.By Bak Se-hwan","downtown buses in seoul ,teenage girl statues symbolizing ,aug 15 art activists ,sex slaves for japanese ,september five buses will","['Seoul', 'japanese', 'National Liberation Day']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.02183289  0.37034404

Last month, a woman lodged the first complaint with the prosecution, claiming her 5-year-old daughter now has permanently damaged kidneys due to hemolytic-uremic syndrome after eating a Happy Meal burger served with an undercooked patty. A few other families and an individual followed suit, putting the total number of claimed victims at five.Yet, the KCA said no enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, known to cause HUS, was found in any of the 38 hamburgers tested.The announcement came shortly after a regional court dismissed an injunction filed by the local unit of McDonald's seeking to stop the disclosure of the report.McDonald's claimed that the probe did not follow the proper procedures in transporting the food. It said the consumer watchdog official carried the burger in question in a shopping bag instead of a sealed and sterilized container designed to maintain a low temperature.The court, however, dismissed the fast-food chain's request earlier in the day. Following the ruling, McDonald's immediately released a statement saying that it is reviewing whether to file a separate suit against the KCA for disclosing the report results and failing to meet due procedures in the course of carrying out the inspection.","consumer watchdog cheongju hamburger ,38 hamburgers sold at ,cause food poisoning local ,hamburgers sold at five ,cheongju hamburger from mcdonald","[""McDonald 's"", 'US', 'the Korea Consumer']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34923401  0.44289118

But is it safe to play there? Does anyone mind the water quality? Children play in a floor fountain at Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul, on Aug. 3. “I think it is a great idea to build splash parks like this for kids to play with water in the middle of the city,” said a mother in her 30s, who brought her 7-year-old son to a splash park at Seoul Square last week, when the daytime high recorded 34 degrees Celsius. “I hope my son did not drink a single drop of that water though,” she said. According to Seoul city officials, the play fountain at Seoul Square is not equipped with any kind of water purifiers, although the water contains some chlorine, as required by law. The water is tested for contamination once every two weeks, in accordance with the law, they added. Whether this is enough seems to depend on who you ask. “I saw from an online community of mothers that waterscape facilities without water purification devices have the same water quality as the water in a swimming pool unfiltered for two weeks. Of course I cannot stop worrying about water contamination,” said a mother in her 40s, who frequently takes her kids to splash parks near the Han River. Lee Cheol-hae, manager of the water recycle system division at Seoul City, said the current level of monitoring is OK, adding that the city has had no issue regarding water quality so far. “But, we are planning to strengthen monitoring during the summer vacation period and conduct  up to three times a day at certain facilities,” he said. To enforce stricter monitoring and further alleviate public concerns, the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Monday announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive safety examination of a total of 186 waterscape facilities currently in use, over the next three weeks. Seoul Metropolitan Government officials, along with the Seoul Institute of Health and Environment, the Animal Health Laboratory and district public health centers, will check the levels of pH, turbidity and E. coli, among others, in water collected from the facilities, they added. Of the 204 waterscape facilities that are used for children’s water play in summer in Seoul, 81 are not equipped with water purification devices, which would enable constant and automatic water quality management, Seoul Metropolitan Government revealed in response to an inquiry from The Korea Herald. The number is the same as last year’s, as not a single facility had new purification devices installed this year, the city said. Some popular splash parks, such as the one at Mulbit Square by the Han River and a fountain at Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul, are also not equipped with the devices. “It costs at least 10 million won to install an automatic water purification device, which makes it difficult for the city government to practically change all of the water facilities,” said the city government’s Lee. Another problem is that the city’s measure leaves many splash pads and water playgrounds unchecked, as there is a loophole in the regulations: privately-run water facilities in big residential complexes. The current law covers water fountains, artificial streams, spray grounds and splash parks in privately run hospitals, tourism venues, sports facilities and children’s facilities, on top of all public facilities, but it leaves out those in private residential complexes. “We thought that water fountains and splash pads installed at public facilities should be prioritized  since more people have access to them,” said Chung Kyung-yoon from the Environment Ministry, which pushed for the revision of the related law to have all waterscape facilities subject to the law to receive regular checks every 15 days and report the results to the authorities. The amended and toughened law came into effect late last month. The ministry said it is currently considering whether to expand the law’s scope to include those in apartment complexes. A decision will be made in November, it said. By Kim Da-sol","fountains are popular hangout ,parks hit in summer ,play fountains are popular ,to build splash parks ,summer among families",['Seoul'],19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45501247  0.47359636

Yonhap“There have been consistent talks within the International Olympics Committee meetings here to send the torch to Mount Kumkang or Pyongyang during the final stages of the relay in Gangwon Province -- with distance and time in consideration,” the source said, requesting anonymity. The insider based the time frame on the theory the torch would travel by foot and boat. The organizing committee for the 2018 Winter Games announced in April the torch will arrive in South Korea on Nov. 1 from Greece to embark on a tour through 17 cities nationwide. It is then scheduled to pass through another 18 cities and counties in Gangwon Province. The prospects of a North Korean leg of the torch relay look slim, however.  The source stressed that reviving frozen inter-Korean dialogue was a prerequisite of the collaboration. “The committee’s talks on the plan are on hold due to diplomatic circumstances. They are expected to resume once inter-Korean ties recover,” the source said. The source also revealed North Korea’s recent series of intercontinental ballistic missile liftoffs have posed as obstacles and the committee has not yet officially informed South Korea’s Ministry of Unification of the plan. The North Korean regime’s ongoing silence toward the Moon Jae-in administration’s offer of an olive branch is dimming prospects that the plan will come to fruition. It already indirectly rejected Seoul’s offer to hold separate military and Red Cross talks at the truce village of Panmunjeom in July. But Seoul has refused to give up hope that it can work out sports exchanges with Pyongyang, including a South-North unified team for the Olympics next year. On Monday, South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism Do Jong-whan pledged to continue to persuade North Korea to participate in the upcoming Winter Games, according to Yonhap News Agency. Do said discussions to fuel the inter-Korean sports exchanges were being carried out, referring to a July meeting between World Taekwondo chief Choue Chung-won and North Korean IOC member Chang Ung. The two reportedly talked about a possible WT demonstration team performance staged in North Korea. When he first took office in June, Do voiced his wish to extend the torch relay route to key North Korean regions such as Kaesong, Pyongyang, and Mount Kumkang, but it was uncertain whether the IOC had received the message. President Moon said “South Korea will keep the doors open until the last minute” for its Northern neighbor to respond to the invitation for the Winter Games, during an Olympic promotional event held on July 24, marking 200 days until the start of the games. Moon added that the IOC has also agreed to “open the doors for North Korea’s participation” and Pyongyang’s response is the key to a historic event. Mount Kumkang, a tourist destination in North Korea known for its beautiful scenery, straddles the North Korean side of Gangwon Province. It is in close proximity to PyeongChang -- the designated venue for the upcoming Winter Olympics -- which lies some 180 kilometers east of Seoul in South Korea’s side of Gangwon Province. The 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games take place from Feb. 9 to 25.By Jung Min-kyung","pyongyang kumkangsan the olympics ,exclusive 2018 olympic torch ,pyeongchang olympics organizing committee ,the pyeongchang olympics organizing ,2018 pyeongchang winter games","['PyeongChang', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee Hee - beom', 'Insooni', 'Gangwon Province']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38337144  0.4013738

""The IOC's stance is basically to have the two Koreas exchange peacefully through sports and North Korea participating ,"" he said. ""But if the South is hasty, it may be forced to take responsibility for the outcomes, and many unexpected things could occur. So all the plans should be approached step by step with a broad perspective.""Do said inter-Korean exchanges in other sports are also being discussed. In June, a North Korean taekwondo demonstration team performed at the World Taekwondo Championships in South Korea.  ""World Taekwondo chief Choue Chung-won met with North Korean IOC member Chang Ung last month to discuss the WT demonstration team's performance in North Korea in September,"" he said. ""Discussions are also under way for North Korea's participation in the Asian Cup & Asian Inter-Club Weightlifting Championships . Since weightlifting is a sport that North Korea collects medals in, we have a high expectation of its participation.""With the PyeongChang Olympics less than 200 days away, Do said the government will lead the way to promote the first-ever Winter Games in South Korea. He said the government will help South Koreans pay more attention to the games and let them participate in the promotion activities. ""I think the G-100 and the torch relay events will be important for the promotion of the Olympics,"" he said. ""We will escort our president to PyeongChang when there are events. Not only the Gangwon provincial government or the organizing committee, but the  government will also step up to promote the Olympics."" When asked about the post-Olympic plans for the competition venues, Do said he will come up with ""sustainable measures."" ""Our biggest headache will be financial problems regarding the venue operations after the Olympics,"" he said. ""Our task force unit will prepare a sustainable operation plan for the venues.""","winter olympic games due ,2018 south korean minister ,next year winter olympic ,pyeongchang 2018 south korean ,year winter olympic games","['south korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'Yonhap News Agency', 'North Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71971768  1.03740013

The North’s latest test of an ICBM marked a step closer to them being capable of striking the US mainland with a nuclear weapon. To attack the South, conventional artillery and short-range missiles would suffice. The situation gives many South Koreans an eerie feeling that their fate is falling into the hands of others, namely US President Donald Trump and the North’s leader Kim Jong-un. “My biggest worry is that the US would plot a pre-emptive attack on North Korea and carry it out without consulting our government,” said Kim Ho-joon, a 40-year-old office worker. “I think it may be a plausible option for the US, because the war would play out on the Korean Peninsula, not on their land.” A 30-year-old Korean-American office worker, Lee Ha-young expressed similar concerns over what the escalating hostilities between the North and US would mean for South Korea. “What if Trump posts a tweet like ‘North Korea is out of control and it must be taken down’ and North Korea takes it as a declaration of war?“North Korea is irrational, but not irrational enough to risk the survival of its own regime. But with Trump’s reckless words, I fear the North may feel pressured to do something more dangerous,” Lee said.  US President Donald Trump. YonhapFueling such worries have been Trump’s inconsistent remarks swinging between the possibilities of a military strike against the North to a more reserved diplomatic approach, as well as the growing belligerence among Americans against the defiant North Korean regime. In an interview with Reuters in April, after ordering a missile attack on Syria for its use of chemical weapon against civilians, the US president said a “major, major conflict” with the North was possible. Two days after the North’s July 4 ICBM test, which Trump had previously said “won’t happen,” he said he had “severe things” on his mind. And this week came the unnerving news that the US president told a senator that he was willing to go to war with the North. “If there’s going to be a war to stop him , it will be over there ” Sen. Lindsey Graham said on a TV show. “If thousands die, they’re going to die over there. They’re not going to die over here -- and he’s  told me that to my face.” A Fox News poll in July found 55 percent of Americans think the US should seek military options against the North and 68 percent said they were worried about a war with North Korea. A Washington Post survey revealed a similar result, with 74 percent of respondents expressing concerns about the possibility of a “full-scale war” with the North and 66 percent saying the communist country poses a “direct threat” to US security. “I don’t know exactly what Trump’s policy on North Korea is,” said 28-year-old graduate student Ham Young-ku. “Sometimes he talks about military strikes and then suggests diplomacy. ... I just hope he won’t do something crazy.” In Seoul‘s National Assembly, conservative opponents of President Moon Jae-in are speaking up about South Korea being sidelined in US-led discussions on the North Korean issue, which is critical to the South’s national security. They wanted the president to cut short his scheduled vacation and return to work immediately, saying the security crisis the country is currently facing is the greatest since the end of World War II.To be sure, much of the political rhetoric on the North is meant to criticize liberal President Moon -- whose recently unveiled peninsular peace initiative is “naive and unrealistic,” according to them -- not to offer an objective assessment of the country’s security conditions. Military experts here and abroad view the idea of the US carrying out a pre-emptive strike on the North, in particular without consulting South Korea, as far-fetched. The last time the US seriously considered attacking North Korea was in 1994 when then-Defense Secretary William J. Perry sought a “surgical strike” against the North’s nuclear reactor. He canceled the plan after concluding that it would escalate into a full-scale war that could lead to hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties. Even if the US were to proceed with a surprise military campaign -- like the one Trump conducted in Syria -- the allies have built “procedural safeguards” that can prevent Trump or any other US president from acting unilaterally, experts said. Under the current chain of command, the Combined Forces Command, the allies’ supreme command during the wartime, cannot engage in a military mission unless there is a prior agreement between the two countries’ military and political leaders.“The United States’ unilateral pre-emptive strike against North Korea is impossible unless the US wants to completely destroy the South Korea-US alliance,” said Kim Yeol-su, an international politics professor at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul. President Moon and top security officials in Seoul have said repeatedly that they will not let another war happen on the peninsula. In an effort to assuage the public again, Cheong Eui-yong, chief of the National Security Council, on Thursday revealed that the Seoul government had confirmed with the US, through many channels, that war would not break out. By Kim Da-sol, Yeo Jun-suk","in seoul eerie ,in seoul eerie feeling ,feature in seoul eerie ,south korean capital just ,others life in seoul","['Seoul', 'North Korea', 'south korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69206321  0.17997259

According to a team led by Oh Jeong-eun, a professor of environmental engineering at Pusan National University, at least seven kinds of drug components were detected from samples of untreated wastewater from Busan’s three major sewage systems from July to September 2013. One of them directly controls wastewater from popular beaches. The seven drug components include methamphetamine -- the most common illegal drug in Korea -- codein, meperidine and cis-tramadol, which are normally used in painkillers. The team calculated the amounts using a method called sewage epidemiology. The daily consumption of meth per 1,000 inhabitants went up to 31.89 milligrams during the peak summer season, about 2.4 times higher than in winter. The amount is equivalent to nearly 2 percent of the average consumption in European countries.Sewage epidemiology is an analysis method used to obtain direct evidence on how much drugs a community consumes by looking into what is excreted into sewage systems. The daily consumption of meth per 1,000 inhabitants rose to 31.89 mg in August from 21.20 mg in July, and dropped to 17.88 mg in September as the vacation season ended. The analysis was conducted on three separate occasions. The end of July and the entire of August are the most favored periods for vacation in South Korea. Previous data from the team showed that the daily consumption of meth per 1,000 inhabitants was 13.10 mg in December 2012. The team, the first to try sewage epidemiology in Korea, had previously found that 410 kilograms of drugs are consumed every year in Korea, nearly 20 times larger than the amount seized by the prosecution annually.Their findings were published in the latest issue of Science of the Total Environment, an international scientific journal.“Drug consumption is not only a serious issue in developed countries but rising as a social problem around the globe. There’s more need to actively make use of sewage epidemiology to prevent drug-related crimes in Korean society,” said Professor Oh who conducted the research. As of last year, 8,853 people were arrested for drug-related crimes. Nearly 80 percent of the narcotics confiscated by the Korea Customs Service were methamphetamines, according to police. By Kim Da-sol","peak summer vacation season ,famous beach in southeastern ,wastewater rise in summer ,the peak summer vacation ,peak summer vacation","['Busan', 'South Koreans', 'Haeundae Beach', 'Busan', 'South Gyeongsang Province']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67721218  0.47674924

Last January, Meari claimed that North Korea’s National Science Institute had developed and introduced a variety of 3-D PC games. The state mouthpiece added that one of the game’s main purposes is to educate its users through the use of realistic strategies, tactics and techniques. It also stressed that the game reflects modern-day soccer and trends. Like the “FIFA” video game series, the game allows its players to experience simulations of major tournaments including the prestigious UEFA Champions League and the UEFA European Championship. The game also features realistic characters based on actual soccer players and what is perceived as an expert evaluation of the athletes’ statistics. The statistics in such games include speed, stamina and temperament. Complementary settings such as training and highlights are also included in the package, which happens to be a characteristic of the FIFA series. The game is reportedly built for PC, mobiles with the Android system and Kinect, which is a line of motion sensing devices by Microsoft. North Korea has been developing computer games over the years, despite most of its citizens’ restricted access to the internet, PCs and mobile phones. Most of its games are 2-D flash games of poor quality, distributed through propaganda sites. Online services and technology are permitted only to the privileged, with the country’s telecommunications network tightly controlled. In 2013, foreigners in North Korea gained internet access via a 3G network run by the state’s wireless telecommunications provider Koryolink, according to foreign media outlets. “FIFA” is a football video game annually released by Electronic Arts, a US-based video game developer. It is a household name among similar sports video games, with a record as one of the best-selling video game franchises.

A new release from the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit, Sunday, sought to explain possible reasons behind the metro’s No. 1 ranking on the list, citing widely acclaimed features of the transit system.The major perks of Seoul Metro as shortlisted by SMRT were complimentary Wi-Fi coverage, air-conditioned cars and the public transport card that enables easy transfers between subway lines. The extensive presence of escalators and elevators was also mentioned as a notable advantage raising accessibility of the transit system.“Last month, London Underground announced plans to improve the transit experience for older and disabled people by raising the proportion of step-free access from 26 to more than 40 percent of stations in the network. The proportion of such stations in Seoul Metro is already three times higher than that of London,” said an SMRT official.

198,198,[Herald Interview] South Koreans yet to discover true joy of volunteering,"When Ahn Seung-hwa started her career in volunteer management as chief program manager of South Cheungcheong Volunteer Center in 1999, she had no office or budget to run. “Me and two other colleagues literally started from scratch,” Ahn recalled in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.  Ahn Seung-hwa, CEO of Seoul Volunteer Center, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald in her office in Seoul. (Park ...","When Ahn Seung-hwa started her career in volunteer management as chief program manager of South Cheungcheong Volunteer Center in 1999, she had no office or budget to run. “Me and two other colleagues literally started from scratch,” Ahn recalled in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.  Ahn Seung-hwa, CEO of Seoul Volunteer Center, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald in her office in Seoul. The center was among several community-level facilities that opened in 1997, as part of the government’s campaign to promote and nurture volunteerism in South Korea, after rapid urbanization and industrialization destroyed communities. Ahn was one of the few first-generation volunteer coordination and management experts in the country. Nearly two decades have passed since then, but Ahn says South Korea still has a long way to go when it comes to discovering the joy of helping others.  In her opinion, the current education system takes the wrong approach to volunteerism, making students feel as if volunteer work is extra homework -- something that they do because they are “told to do so.”“It’s so burdensome for young students to wake up early in the morning and go pick up trash for a certain amount of hours just because they are told to do so. They would think that volunteering is time-consuming, boring and meaningless.”Until 2000, South Korea’s middle and high schools forced students to spend 20 hours annually volunteering for their community. It has since become more flexible and the required hours are down to 10. The system of mandatory hours of community service or volunteer work has led to a barrage of students each year counterfeiting their certificates of volunteer service or inflating their service hours.Ahn, who now heads the Seoul Volunteer Center, said that South Korea’s volunteering culture is “conservative,” often associated with the stereotype of one-off street cleaning campaigns or helping the disabled at welfare centers. “Most volunteering programs here involve welfare programs. Volunteer program facilitators as well as participants should think out of the box and forget the concept of mandatory volunteer hours. Volunteering can be more fun and easy, done in everyday life.”“Volunteering is not difficult. It is as simple as showing others that we respect them and sharing what we have,” she said. In a similar vein, the Seoul volunteer center is exploring creative ways of volunteering, she stressed. At a recent conference organized by her center, over 250 volunteer program managers, experts and social workers gathered to discuss ways to change the volunteering paradigm, such as venturing into digital platforms. In a society where social disconnection and isolation are major problems, she said regular volunteering can help communities. She suggested that active participation from those in their 20s and 30s could make a society even stronger.“Although those in their 20 and 30s are riddled with serious unemployment, the low birthrate and housing problems, a good dose of volunteering can help them contribute to community and provide them with the time to look back on themselves amid busy daily routines,” she said. Noting that the young generation’s participation in volunteering is more crucial ever than before, the Seoul Volunteer Center plans to financially support startups and social entrepreneurs that strive to make a social impact and spread positive messages. “We do not know yet the exact budget for the project. I think it will be probably small, but we’ve decided to help them because it is our -- as a volunteer center -- role to serve the society,” Ahn said.

With the money, the city will subsidize the early scrapping of old diesel cars, installation of exhaust reduction devices on diesel-powered vehicles and engine modifications. Seoul City said about 34,900 diesel cars registered before 2005 would qualify for the subsidies.  According to the Environment Ministry, diesel cars registered before 2005 are manufactured without exhaust reduction devices and can produce as much as eight times more emissions than recently produced diesel cars.The city government data revealed that household heating accounted for 39 percent of locally produced fine dust, while vehicles produced 37 percent, largely caused by the wearing of tires on roads.

Villagers say they started spotting people in the altogether around the lodge on weekends. One member from the naturist group laid bare his feelings, saying, “Our lodge is located on privately owned land, quite a way off from the residential area.” He stressed that they could do as they please in the space they own.Despite receiving angry complaints from villagers, police also admitted they could not forbid the group from strutting around in the buff -- as long as they keep their birthday suits to their private space.Though no official sanctions can be imposed, villagers have come up with their own measures to express their bare dissatisfaction, such as by putting up banners and organizing a rally against nudity.By Kim Min-joo/ Intern reporter","chungcheong province nudist lodge ,the controversial nudist resort ,korea exposed to nudist ,pick herbs their naked ,chungcheong province nudist","['Korea', 'Jecheon', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Jecheon', 'n']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43218929  0.42483255

There has been speculation that fears of sexual harassment accusations may have played a role.One witness said, “The woman danced angrily and shrieked several times.

It has recouped money spent on the work through yearly lawsuits against the central government. Based on the Status of Forces Agreement between South Korean and US forces, the responsibility to compensate a third party for a damage related to US military bases lies in the South Korean government. This is the 13th time Seoul has demanded compensation since the oil contamination was first reported in 2001.  Concerns have been intensifying over the health effects of exposure to contamination on the base. Following the relocation of key military bases in central Seoul to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, by 2018, the area will turn into a public park.The central government has demanded that US Forces Korea bear 75 percent of the cleanup costs in accordance with the SOFA, but it has not received that money. By Kim Da-sol","cleanup costs the seoul ,purifying oil contaminated groundwater ,government will file lawsuit ,oil contaminated groundwater ,seoul to sue","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'US', 'Yongsan', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39013934  0.4176214

Pyongyang rejected the offer for talks with silence, refusing to confirm the meeting Seoul hoped to hold Friday.  Relatives separated by the Korean War bid a tearful farewell to each other after a reunion event in 2015. YonhapHowever, the meeting between the two Korea’s respective Red Cross officials on Aug. 1 remains scheduled, and if the meeting materializes it is expected to act as a key to reviving cross-border reunion events. The events were indefinitely halted in 2015. Amid North Korea’s cold shoulder, several South Korean citizens are holding out hope to meet their relatives in the North. “We received three new applications July 17-21, following the current administration’s offer to hold a Red Cross meeting with North Korea,” a South Korean Red Cross official said Sunday. “We also sent seven more application forms to family members who requested them after the announcement of the talks offer -- they are expected to apply by mail.”The South Korean government urged the North to respond swiftly after the military talks failed, but said they would remain patient with the process. “It’s necessary for us to make step-by-step efforts in a calm manner. ... We expect the North’s swift, positive response,” deputy ministry spokesperson Lee Eugene said during a press briefing Friday, stressing there is no “deadline” for cross-border dialogue.But luring Pyongyang back to the negotiation table is forecast to be a time-sensitive task for Seoul, with the physically frail state of the remaining war-torn family members in South Korea. According to the Ministry of Unification, out of 131,200 South Korean family members registered in a government database, only 60,513 are alive as of 2017. There are 70,687 deceased members on the rolls, which amounts to 53.9 percent of registered applicants. About 62.6 percent of the remaining population is over 80 years old and in June, 258 members passed away. North Korea’s state-owned newspaper Rodong Sinmun said Thursday that it is nonsense for Seoul to hope to improve inter-Korean relations while supporting sanctions against Pyongyang simultaneously.Pyongyang has also demanded the return of 12 North Korean restaurant workers who defected to South Korea last year, claiming they were abducted against their will. While South Korea hopes for improved inter-Korean relations, the situation faced by North Koreans eyeing to escape continues to deteriorate. A North Korean family of five attempting to defect to South Korea via China took their own lives when captured and questioned by Chinese Police, according to the Yonhap News Agency on Saturday.

A monument to comfort women stands in the garden of Trinity Episcopal Church near Cliffside Park, New Jersey, on July 19, 2017. It marked the fourth such monument in New Jersey and the eighth in the United States.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were mobilized by the Japanese military to work in front-line brothels during the war. Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910-45.The issue of the ""comfort women,"" a euphemistic term for the victims, has long been a thorn in South Korea-Japan ties. The two sides reached a deal in 2015 to resolve the issue, but many of the victims have rejected it, saying it fails to address their grievances. Korean residents and American veterans of the Korean War attend an unveiling ceremony for a monument to comfort women at Trinity Episcopal Church near Cliffside Park, New Jersey, on July 19, 2017. The tablet is engraved with a picture of a girl crouching with her face in her hands, as well as a description of the atrocity that took place.Kim Jin-sook, a leader of the Korean community, said she hopes the monument will serve as a reminder of the painful history of the comfort women and of the fact that it should not be repeated.","commemorate the korean women ,korean community american veterans ,jersey wednesday to commemorate ,slavery for japanese troops ,women monument unveiled in","['New Jersey', 'New Jersey', 'korean', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Trinity Episcopal Church', 'korean', 'american']",19,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01676391 0.22227089 0.45358101],Catherine Chung,Social affairs,7,2017,"wednesday to commemorate the korean ,to commemorate the korean women ,new jersey wednesday to commemorate ,korean war attend an unveiling ,brothels during the war korea","['New Jersey', 'New Jersey', 'korean', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Trinity Episcopal Church', 'korean', 'american', 'Trinity Episcopal Church', 'Cliffside Park', 'New Jersey', 'New Jersey', 'the United States', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'american', 'Trinity Episcopal Church', 'Cliffside Park', 'New Jersey', 'Kim Jin - sook', 'korean']",1,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01676391 0.22227089 0.45358101]

The ministry said that it gave the green light to the company's plan to contact the North. If North Korea sends an invitation, Hyundai is expected to ask the government to approve its bid to visit the North.If approved, it would mark the first visit by South Koreans to the North under the government of President Moon Jae-in.In July 2008, Seoul suspended the Kumgang tour project after a South Korean woman was killed by a North Korean soldier at the mountain resort. The program was launched in 1998 under a previous liberal government.The government announced the flexible resumption of civilian inter-Korean exchanges to an extent that the move would not compromise the international sanctions regime.But North Korea has turned down South Korean aid groups' move to spur exchanges, in protest of Seoul's support of the latest UN sanctions.","mountain since his death ,on wednesday approved hyundai ,suspended inter korean tour ,wednesday approved hyundai ,wednesday approved hyundai asan","[""South Korea 's"", 'Unification Ministry', ""Hyundai Asan Corp.

But on Sunday Lim abruptly appeared in a video on the North's propaganda network, describing how her “fantasy” about the wealthy South had been shattered.In the video, posted on the North's Uriminzokkiri website, Lim says she had “returned home” last month and was now living with her family in the western city of Anju.It is unclear whether Lim returned voluntarily, with South Korean media speculating that she might have been kidnapped at the Chinese border with the North while trying to reunite with her family.Seoul police sources who probed Lim's home and financial accounts in Seoul told the South's JoongAng Ilbo daily there was little sign of her trying to wrap up her life in the country and move elsewhere.“Relevant authorities are investigating the North Korean defector Lim Ji-Hyun,” said Lee Yoo-Jin, deputy spokeswoman of Seoul's unification ministry handling North Korea affairs. Seoul's spy agency declined to comment. In the video, Lim identified herself as Chon Hae-Song, which she said was her real name in the North.Wearing a traditional silk hanbok and red badge bearing the images of the North's two former leaders, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, Lim tearfully detailed her “miserable” life in the capitalist neighbour where “money is all that matters.” “I went to South Korea harbouring this fantasy that I would able to eat and live well there, but the South was not the place I imagined,” she said, adding she wanted to become an actress in Seoul. “Every single day in the South was like hell. Every night ... I cried thinking about my motherland and my parents in the North,” she said.  Lim also accused a Korean TV station of pushing her to lie about her life in the North to make it sound more miserable than it actually was. “Everything I said on TV was scripted ... to make North Koreans look barbaric, ignorant and stupid,” she said, describing herself as “human trash”.Other defectors who have reappeared in the North have been displayed on similar programmes, prompting speculation they had been kidnapped by Pyongyang or coerced into returning by threats to their families.Many defectors who reach the South hire brokers to take their remaining family out of the North through the border with China, and some even visit the Chinese border areas themselves -- a dangerous move in a region monitored and frequented by North Korean agents.  The North has tightened border security since young leader Kim Jong-Un took power in 2011, sharply reducing the number of defectors and increasing the cost of hiring brokers.","celebrity refugee in seoul ,korea celebrity who returned ,refugee in seoul but ,korea probes korea celebrity ,south korean tv shows","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Lim Ji - Hyun', 'Seoul', 'south korean tv', 'Sunda']",19,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.65797395  0.39167789

It was the largest crowd that the pro-gay event, held as part of the Korea Queer Culture Festival, has attracted since the inaugural event in 2000. Last year’s parade, the previous record-setter, had drawn about 50,000. Sexual minorities and their advocates march through central Seoul in the pride parade Saturday. “I am happy that I can finally express who I really am. I am surprised that so many people came here because I usually don’t see openly gay people around me,” said a 22-year-old university student, a lesbian who only wanted to be identified by her surname Park.“I haven’t told my parents or friends about my sexuality,” she said. “I would have no friends if I came out of the closet. I would feel excluded. People would see me differently.”Moon Cheol-beom  and his friends pose for a photo at Seoul Plaza ahead of the pride parade in central Seoul on Saturday. While homosexuality is not a crime in South Korea, LGBT people live largely on the fringes of society, as the majority of Koreans remain intolerant of homosexuality. Conservative Protestant groups here typically oppose homosexuality, believing it is sin and a condition that can be cured.Even left-leaning President Moon Jae-In -- formerly a human rights lawyer -- said that he “opposed homosexuality” on his presidential election campaign trail in April.Sexual minorities and their advocates march through central Seoul in the pride parade Saturday. This year’s pride parade came amid growing calls for the abolishment of a gay ban in the military after the military court in May sentenced a gay solider to six months in jail, suspended for a year, for having consensual sex with a soldier of the same sex in a private place.“I feel that Korean society is changing to embrace differences, given that so many people came here today despite the heavy rain,” said Kang Myeong-jin, who has headed the organizing committee for the Korea Queer Culture Festival since 2010. “I cannot say I am not mad at anti-gay protesters, but it is not their fault. They just cannot accept drastic changes,” he said, citing a need for the Korean government to play a bigger role in raising awareness and enforcing policies banning discrimination against LGBT people Same-sex couples march while holding hands during the pride parade in Seoul on Saturday. Participants marched 4 kilometers following nine decorated trucks, dancing to music blaring from the floats, waving rainbow flags and joyfully cheering at anti-gay protesters along the way. Many same-sex couples were seen engaging in public displays of affection. A group of friends pose for a photo at Seoul Plaza ahead of the pride parade in central Seoul on Saturday. “When my daughter came out six years ago, I could not accept it and I had conflicts with her. But I learned that it is she who has to suffer most in the face of people unfavorable to the LGBT community,” said a 53-year-old man who is father to a 26-year-old lesbian.“I hope that my daughter will be able to live in a society without discrimination based on sexual orientation or identity.” A group of parents of sexual minorities march through central Seoul during the pride parade, Saturday. On the other side of the festivities, thousands of anti-LGBT campaigners, mostly right-wing and Protestant groups, staged counter protests near Seoul Plaza. They signified their opposition to homosexuality by collectively praying and singing religious hymns.“Homosexuality is bringing down social values and ethics and striking society with illness. We, in the name of the public, oppose those attempting to spread homosexuality in disguise of human rights activities,” pastor Choi Ki-hak said in a speech in front of the Deoksugung palace.But not all Protestants supported the anti-gay movement.“I came here to show that opposing homosexuality is not the Bible’s teaching,” said Chung Sang-hyuk, a 26-year-old Protestant who dressed as Jesus. “What Jesus has taught us is to love everyone. Homosexuality is not sin. It is love. It is not subject to approval or opposition.”Anti-gay protestors hold up placards reading “homosexuality is sin, return to Jesus” and “No!! Same-sex marriage” on the sidewalk as pro-gay participants parade through central Seoul during the pride parade on Saturday. Some 6,000 police officers were stationed around the plaza and along the parade route to separate LGBT advocates from their opponents. No major clashes were reported.Earlier in the day, 101 human rights organizations, global companies, embassies from 13 countries including the US and the UK and university groups set up booths to raise awareness and understanding of gay rights, as well as to sell goods.Chung Sang-hyuk, a 26-year-old Protestant who dressed as Jesus, poses for a photo at Seoul Plaza ahead of the pride parade in central Seoul on Saturday.

It will be a real opportunity,” Morgan said in an interview in Seoul on Wednesday.“Making transition to renewable energy is a good start but it can go even further. The key is to get the right policy to make sure that benefits go to the people.” Going 100 percent renewable is what Greenpeace asks for from all countries, governments and companies around the world, Morgan said. Nuclear energy and climate change are the two biggest threats to humanity, requiring efforts on all levels and fronts, she went on. “Climate change should not be something political. It should be about us, our kids, nieces and nephews.” The top environmental activist was in South Korea on a five-day visit, meeting policymakers and administers interested in environmental issues. Among them were Gangwon Province Gov. Choi Moon-soon, South Chungcheong Gov. Ahn Hee-jung and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. “I think it is important that those governors are linked in with others who try to move forward. They are key players, not only nationally but also globally as well,” she said.On Wednesday, Morgan gave a lecture at Ewha Womans University on Wednesday, saying the massive impeachment protests last winter were “inspiring” for activists around the world to see. “By looking at photos and news showing people power, I noticed the evolution of democracy, which is a type of people power that Greenpeace relates to,” Morgan said. “You would not know how connected you are to other groups around the world.”Founded by Canadian and US environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace has over 3 million supporters worldwide. It has presence in 55 countries, operating 26 regional offices. In Asia, it has four offices in Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei and Seoul. Although Seoul office is relatively young, established in 2011, there is “so much occurring” here, Morgan said. Since South Korea is home to high-tech and IT companies, it should challenge the industry by showing the way to recycle gadgets, like smartphones, Morgan said. Globally, the IT industry is making a green revolution, she added.“Committed to 100 percent renewable energy values, IT companies like Apple, Google, Facebook have moved to solve their IT waste issues and they support related laws to get passed,” Morgan said. On the US’ recent pullout from the Paris Agreement, the Greenpeace chief said it was wrong. “He  was so inaccurate,” she said, “Trump is holding back other Americans who want to move forward.”By Kim Da-sol","100 renewable south korea ,100 renewable south ,the top environmental activist ,at 100 renewable south ,greenpeace encourages south korea","['South Korea', 'Greenpeace', 'Jennifer Morgan']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35708568  0.54137671

Inside the windowless, video screen-lit arcade, there is only one rule: Crush as many enemies as you can. 







A “Tekken” arcade machine at a Game Land arcade in Seoul 




This may be a typical childhood scene, but in an era when even coins may soon become relics, the future of coin-operated video games looks bleak. 

“It seems things could never be worse,” Park Sang-hyuk, owner of Game Land, an underground game arcade in Imun-dong, eastern Seoul, told The Korea Herald. 

It was Wednesday afternoon and the place was nearly empty. 

Park sighed deeply at a question about the prospects of the coin-op game industry. 

“Monthly income has come down more than half compared to a decade ago. I don’t know how long I can keep doing this,” he said. 

There used to be two more arcade malls in the neighborhood, but they all shut down, the 62-year-old added. 

He still gets some nostalgic visitors, but not enough to think about the future. 

Coin-op game arcades thrived in the 1980s and ‘90s, giving young Koreans a new option in the art of idling. 

Now, their popularity is increasingly in retreat: South Korea’s game arcades had combined revenues of 47.4 billion won  in 2015, 36 percent down from 73.6 billion won in 2011. Last year, the number of coin-op video game arcades stood at 450, an 89 percent decrease from 3,877 in 2009, according to government data. The figure does not include claw game arcades.

Not surprisingly, mobile games and other high-tech pastimes have dealt a heavy blow to the arcade cabinets. 

According to the 2016 White Paper on Korean Games released by the Korea Creative Content Agency, which handles the country’s game policy, in the country’s video gaming market of 10.7 trillion won, PC and mobile games accounted for 49.2 percent and 32.5 percent, respectively, in terms of revenue. Arcade malls generated only 0.4 percent of the total. 

“Penny arcade games no longer attract younger customers because there is no fun in them anymore,” said Park Sung-gyu, 49, head of the Korea Amusement Industry Association and director of a local game machine developer.

“And there is no fun in them because we have so many regulations to deal with, which makes it utterly impossible for developers to keep up with the trends.” 

In 2005, sometime after game arcades began their long, slow decline, South Korea’s arcade industry had a brief rebound with the introduction of Sea Story cabinets, similar to Japan’s Pachinko gambling devices or Western slot machines. 

After several addicted players committed suicide, the government launched a clampdown on arcades for adults, which had illegally reprogramed the games to change the odds of winning the jackpot. 

The incident brought about the formation of an independent body, the Game Rating and Administration Committee. It strictly bans gambling content it sees as addictive and has clamped down on adult arcades that operate past midnight. 

To find a way out, attention is now turning to claw machine shops, which have grown 24-fold over the last two years. The claw machines too, however, face yet another set of regulations, blocking the newly emerging market from becoming the real deal.

“The authority now bans using dolls that cost more than 5,000 won as prizes in a claw machine to remove gambling quality. Authentic Pikachu dolls cost around 20,000 won each, so people use fake ones instead. If you both run video games and claw machines, you have to close the store before midnight,” said Park of the amusement industry association. 

The restricted business hours also apply to claw machine shop owners. 

The rules may have been successful in stopping coin-op arcades from turning into gambling dens, but they also effectively killed innovation and creativity, industry insiders have said. 

In fact, the global coin-op amusement industry is having a revival with the arrival of new networked, multiplayer arcade games and a breakthrough in virtual reality technology. 

According to the game watchdog, the world market grew 12.8 percent in 2015. 

“If we are not prepared, we will fail to gain a foothold in the global arcades market, where so many leading game makers are already pouring resources into developing new products,” said Han Jae-suk of Hanmax Entertainment, which sells imported coin-op cabinets. 

The game rating and administration panel, in a short response to The Korea Herald, revealed an outdated approach. 

Asked about claims that excessive regulations are hindering development of the industry, the committee’s deputy manager Kang Suk-ha said the committee “has difficulty in applying the same approach” to the arcade industry as other sectors. 

The committee’s website says its mandate is to foster a “sound game culture” for teenagers and adults, classify game contents that are produced and distributed here and “protect the public from negative influences.” 

Han of Hanmax Entertainment called for a paradigm shift in the industry as well as the regulatory authorities in order to allow coin-op arcades to find new appeal that goes beyond nostalgia. 

The global popularity of augmented reality mobile game “Pokemon Go” shows how explosive it can be when nostalgia meets new technology, other experts said. 

“Honestly, I understand why kids like to play games on their iPhones or computers more,” said Kim Ki-soo, a 31-year-old businessman who said he traveled several blocks to visit Game Land from time to time.

Playing “Tekken” at a lunch break, the nostalgic gamer said it felt like traveling back in time to his boyhood years when things were simpler. In Tekken, a few good punches and kicks is all you need to feel proud of yourself. 

“Look at this game, still as amusing as anything else to kill some time,” said Kim, watching the “KO” sign blazing across the screen. He adds, “Why not continue the fun, or even make it better?”

Therefore, we view the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act to be consistent with the values and principles that guide the conduct of our member companies in engaging in business activities not only in Korea but in all parts of the world.Australian enterprises are well-accustomed to having internal processes and policies to ensure compliance with international standards on improper solicitation and anti-corruption legislation. In particular, companies with global profiles and operations have high awareness of the requirements of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  and the United Kingdom Bribery Act  and the extra-territorial application of both these laws. As such, many AustCham member companies already operate under advanced internal compliance regimes and these systems and processes, have for the most part, enabled our member companies to have a smooth transition and adapt to the new Korean legislation. Ethical conduct is a core company value for our member companies, whose workforces are educated on the expected behavior in relation to improper solicitation. Several member companies publicly report on any contraventions.On the introduction of the new legislation, AustCham had early engagement with the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, as the organization leading the implementation of the new legislation. The ACRC has provided AustCham with several opportunities to engage directly with them and they remain open to ongoing engagement. The regular engagement with the ACRC has enabled AustCham to increase our understanding of the new legislation, the approach to implementation and obtain clarity in certain areas. In turn, AustCham has been able to increase the awareness of the new legislation among our member organizations and gain an understanding of the areas where they may require more clarity.AustCham has received positive feedback from our members that they are witnessing changes in Korean business culture and practices since the introduction of the Kim Young-ran Act. We are optimistic that the act will achieve its stated objectives for the betterment of Korean business and society. AustCham firmly believes that the proper implementation of the act should be the ongoing focus. There is a need for awareness that the one-size-fits-all aspects of the act may have some unintended consequences. It will remain crucial that any prosecutions under the act are targeted at instances of genuine acts of corruption and bribery; rather than focusing on unintended, innocent, minor breaches. AustCham encourages the government to ensure the ongoing engagement, guidance and clarification on the issues concerning the practical implementation of the act. We acknowledge and appreciate that the ACRC has been responsive, pro-active and facilitative. AustCham will continue to act as a channel and voice for our members on this issue. We look forward to continuing to cooperate with and support the efforts of the ACRC to realize the objectives of the act.

225,225,Korea to build comfort women museum in Seoul,"South Korea's Gender Equality Minister Chung Huyn-back said Monday the government plans to set up a museum for Korean victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery in Seoul, in an apparent show of the new Moon Jae-in government's resolve to sternly deal with Japan's wartime human rights violation.""The government plans to build the museum for the comfort women in a place easily accessible so that it can play a role as a m...","South Korea's Gender Equality Minister Chung Huyn-back said Monday the government plans to set up a museum for Korean victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery in Seoul, in an apparent show of the new Moon Jae-in government's resolve to sternly deal with Japan's wartime human rights violation.""The government plans to build the museum for the comfort women in a place easily accessible so that it can play a role as a mecca for people to remember and recall the human rights violations that the war brought,"" the minister said. Comfort women is a euphemism for Asian women, mostly Koreans, who were forcibly taken to front-line military brothels to serve the Japanese army during World War II. Chung made the remarks during a visit to the House of Sharing, a shelter for the former sex slaves, in Gwangju, east of Seoul. The visit was her first on-site activity as minister since her inauguration late last week.The comfort women question no longer remains an issue just between South Korea and Japan, the minister said, adding it is now an international one.  Gender Equality Minister Chung Hyun-back talks with former sex slave Kang Il-chool during a visit to the House of Sharing, a shelter for the former sex slaves, in Gwangju, east of Seoul, on July 10, 2017. It's hoped that the museum will be erected near the National Museum of Korea in Yongsan, the eastern part of Seoul, the minister said, adding that the government plans to immediately start the work by securing a lot for it first.""The minister also said the government will hastily seek the listing of the comfort women as a UNESCO heritage as part of ways to expedite the museum project. Chung's remarks are a sharp departure from the stance of the former Park Geun-hye government on the issue, which declared the ""final and irreversible"" resolution of the comfort women issue in a December 2015 deal with Japan. In exchange, Japan provided 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims. The organization was launched last year.South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a telephone conversation made soon after his inauguration in May that most South Korean people could not ""emotionally"" accept the deal, strongly hinting at a possible renegotiation of the deal.During her parliamentary confirmation hearing, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, who had long worked in UN human rights organizations, also said doubts linger over whether the agreement was surely based on ""a victims-oriented approach."" Many Korean people censure Japan for refusing to recognize its legal responsibility for the forced mobilization of the women. They also criticized the deal being hastily arranged without sufficiently listening to the opinions of the victims. Since the conclusion of the deal, however, Tokyo has called on Seoul to faithfully implement it, insisting that the issue has been completely settled amid the international community's high evaluations. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.Later in the day, Minister Chung reiterated the government's will to launch the comfort women museum while attending a ceremony to mark the opening of a special exhibition on the women at the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History in downtown Seoul. The government will go ahead with projects to investigate and study the comfort women issue ""stably and systematically"" by setting up the museum, and strengthen related education for the next generations, she said in a congratulatory speech. ""I'm very sorry and regretful whenever I see our grandmas  struggle to attend the regular Wednesday rally,""she added. Surviving former sex slaves and civic activists have been staging the weekly rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul every Wednesday for more than a decade, calling for Japan's official apology and compensation.","women museum in seoul ,korea gender equality minister ,museum for korean victims ,sexual slavery in seoul ,museum in seoul south","[""South Korea 's"", 'Gender', 'Chung Huyn - back', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Japan']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18100059 -0.10343128

226,226,Korea neglecting mental health issues: experts,"South Korea is renowned for its rapid economic and technological advancement, but when it comes to mental health there is a lack of resources, experts have warned.“The atmosphere around mental health is not so good in terms of the perception about mental illness, government investment and budget allocation,” said Park Jong-ik, a professor of psychiatry at Kangwon National University. With a rapidly aging society an...","South Korea is renowned for its rapid economic and technological advancement, but when it comes to mental health there is a lack of resources, experts have warned.“The atmosphere around mental health is not so good in terms of the perception about mental illness, government investment and budget allocation,” said Park Jong-ik, a professor of psychiatry at Kangwon National University. With a rapidly aging society and a struggling economy taking priority on the national political agenda, professor Park said people who suffer from a mental illness -- particularly those with a more severe illness -- are not a sought-after section of voters and funds are being allocated elsewhere.“The elderly was a very important issue in the election because we are an aging society, so voting rights are very important, but mentally disabled people are not such attractive voters so the politicians and bureaucrats don’t focus on mentally ill patients,” he said.Known for long work hours and competitive society, South Korea has the developed world’s second-highest suicide rate and the highest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, according to OECD data. Despite this, mental illness is still a taboo subject that Koreans seem reluctant to address. Government statistics released earlier this year showed that 1 in 4 Koreans experience a mental health disorder at least once in their life with only 1 in 10 pursuing professional help. Of those surveyed, a quarter said they suffered from disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and alcohol addiction at least once, while 12 percent said they suffered from a psychiatric illness in the past year. However, there seems to be change emerging in how people deal with their emotional health here. Dr. Park Jin-seng, a private practitioner in Gangnam, said that he has witnessed an increase in Koreans coming to his practice for help over the past few years. The reasons drawing people to seek help, he says, is the high expectations people feel society places on them. “If you live and you work in Korean society there is a lot of competition and it’s a hard working society. It’s very stressful,” he said.“Life is like a marathon so in the course of life, sometimes people can fail and sometimes people succeed, but in Korea if they fail sometimes they think they can’t rebuild.”Numerous research studies and data confirm that Korea is a nation suffering from stress issues. Last year, a study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs found that, of the 7,000 people surveyed, over 90 percent said that they were under some form of stress, while a quarter said that they were under high stress. A study by Yonsei University Institute for Social Development released last year, which focused on the happiness level of children and young people, found that Korea’s youth were the least happy in the OECD.In a bid to raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide prevention, the government initiated the National Youth Healing Center under the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in 2012. The service recruits youths with mental health issues, such as ADHD and depression, who are willing to participate in the treatment program for four months. This year the Ministry of Health and Welfare finished a yearlong suicide prevention campaign “Are you OK? Air kiss campaign” which included an array of celebrities.In December the government announced an allocation of 48.2 billion won  for suicide prevention and mental health projects, a 7.7 percent increase from the previous year.However, a health policy overview of Korea last year by the OECD stated that Korea lags behind other countries in terms of mental health services and reports the third-highest excess mortality rates from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the bloc of 34 countries.While an increase in funds allocated to mental health is a positive sign, recent moves to strengthen mental health policies have caused controversy. The revision of the Mental Health Act, which came into effect in May, changes the criteria for involuntary committing a psychiatric patient. The change has come under fire from medical professionals, including both professor Park and doctor Park who say it complicates a system which is already lacking in resources.Professor Park said that the lack of support available to psychiatric patients after they have been discharged from hospital means they could easily end up back in hospital or could potentially pose a risk to themselves or others.As a way to combat this he recommends the government invest in training programs and residential facilities where caretakers can oversee that medication is being taken.However, he doesn’t see this happening in the near future. For now, he believes more focus should be put on promoting mental health literacy to end the stigma surrounding it and funding research which can be used to give a voice to those suffering from a mental illness.“In the current government, I think the mentally ill have the last status following other disabilities. They don’t have any capacity to raise their voices. I think it’s related to stigmatization against mental illness,” he said.By Anita Mckay","korea neglecting mental health ,university with rapidly aging ,psychiatry at kangwon national ,korea neglecting mental ,korea is renowned for","['South Korea', 'Park Jong - ik', 'Kangwon National University']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18924788  0.46537447

Seoul citizens, art connoisseurs and city officials are gathered at Seoul City Hall to mark the completion of the “Art on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens” project on Saturday. During Saturday’s wrap up session, participants shared their views on what they have felt and found over the last two months. One team, which mainly focused on finding public art that contains historical traces of Seoul, said public art helped citizens connect with how today’s Seoul came into being. Citing examples of Yangjae-dong’s memorial park built to remember the 1995 Sampoong Department Store Collapse and Jeon Tae-il Bridge in Jongno, participants said public art allowed people to remember and find traces of Korea’s tumultuous modern history.Another group highlighted the positive function that public art plays in citizens’ lives.“Seoul’s installed art, some with witty message and unique structure, provide energy to passersby,” said Jung Yo-han, who said that his team discovered some 150 installed arts through the program. Marking the competition of their mission to find and promote artistic appeal of the city, participants created a public art map indicating 73 installed art in the capital, based on each team’s top 5-10 favorite pieces.After learning about relatively unknown artworks, participants said they developed a sense of duty to preserve them for the next generation through this program. They suggested the city government to also actively engage in management of public art. Rather than setting up brand new art each year, it is more necessary to keep the original pieces clean and make sure installed artworks are not neglected, they said. Eleven curators, who each led a group of 10 to 11 citizens, also shared “sad part” about Seoul’s public art, from expert’s point of view.Some of unappealing murals, which were indiscreetly introduced in the city when a mural town became a big hit a decade ago, are going out of trend, they said.“We want the Seoul City to look into undiscovered public art more with thorough review so they can intrigue more citizens to enjoy,” said Gwak Na-yeon.Seoul City welcomed the suggestion. “Based on various opinions and suggestions made on Saturday, we will hear more voice from citizens and take them into consideration when executing the city government’s design policies,” sad Byun Seo-young, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s design policy division.

The second part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop will continue in Malaysia from Saturday to Wednesday. Under the theme of “Promoting Clean and Green Environment through the Establishment of Environmentally Sustainable Cities,” the students took part in lectures, field trips and cultural activities from Monday to Friday.  At the closing ceremony, videos that students made to promote a sustainable environment were played, speeches on their experience in Korea were made and cultural performances by students from Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia were staged. “When I was in Seoul’s Energy Dream Center, I was astonished to find that a zero carbon emitting building actually exists,” Christian Cabatay from the Philippines said. Christian Cabatay “This means that someday the whole ASEAN community can learn how Korea took on challenges of climate change seriously,” he said. “Personally, I felt emotional to realize how big the gap in technology here and in the Philippines. But that doesn’t stop me from believing that we can do what Korea did.” A Korean student, Yu Ah-ran, said that she had learned about the importance of collective efforts to make cities sustainable and her generation’s role as a youth. “All in all, the program raised awareness of the environment we are currently living in. Not only that, I think it could help other countries to be inspired by Korea’s efforts in dealing with environmental issues,” she said.The workshop in Korea was jointly organized with the United Nations ESCAP North-East Asia Office and Incheon Metropolitan City.The students visited facilities such as a sewage treatment plant and a tidal power plant. They received lectures on ASEAN-Korea relations and sustainable development from experts. They also engaged in cultural activities including a tour to historic sites. “It makes me sad that we are closing doors to the dynamic exchange of ideas, to interesting activities, and bid farewell to our newly-found friends,” said Hong Sung-wook, head of the development planning and general affairs unit at the ASEAN-Korea Centre.“I am glad, knowing that through this workshop, we have been able to forge strong networks and inculcate knowledge,” said Hong, expressing hope for a continued friendship between Korean and ASEAN students. In Malaysia, some 70 students from ASEAN member states and Korea will visit Melaka, Putrajaya, and Kuala Lumpur to get a glimpse into how environmentally-friendly cities are run during the five-day workshop.

The fifth World Education Leaders Forum, hosted by IYF and sponsored by Busan Metropolitan City and Korea Tourism Organization, was held July 5 at Nurimaru APEC House in Busan. Over 60 university presidents and vice presidents from 25 countries attend the World Education Leaders ForumIt was attended by over 60 university presidents and vice presidents from 25 countries. The event looked at solutions to youth problems faced in today’s society from an educational perspective under the theme of “character education, the power behind the growth of convergent-type talent in the fourth industrial revolution.’In his welcome speech, organizing committee Chairman Sang Yong Kim said, “In a rapidly developing industrial society, we need to bring back the focus of college education on the minds of people.” “As technology develops and information increases, the values of the people utilizing them will greatly determine its outcome,” he added, highlighting why the World Education Leaders’ Forum was focusing on character education.The forum discussed the following: What convergent-type talent is needed in the future? Character education is the strength of deep-thinking and self-control; and wise future character education learnt from the past. It also discussed the direction of future character education based on the advantages and disadvantages of the past system.The university presidents agreed to the need for convergent-type talent possessing both knowledge and character.President Kabera Callixte of the University of Tourism Technology and Business Studies in Rwanda said, “For the correct character development of students, character education for educators must be prioritized. Education for global future leaders must be based on character education and family, schools, government, etc. society must work together.” IYF founder Ock Soo Park gave a keynote speech explaining that what helps youths free themselves from problems is not restrictions such as “Don’t do.” Those who are stronger can help those who are weaker, therefore he asked the university presidents to help guide the youth to build up strong minds so they can overcome their desires and walk the right path. The World Education Leaders Forum, which searches for systemic and practical character education implementation methods at the college-level, will be held twice more on July 10 and 12 at Muju Taekwondo Center.","recently visited south korea ,fifth world education leaders ,south korea to discuss ,city and korea tourism ,desires university leaders worldwide","['South Korea', 'IYF', 'Busan Metropolitan City', 'Korea Tourism Organization', 'Nurimaru APEC House', 'Busan']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35935187  0.70791727

Chang Ung, a North Korean member of the International Olympic Committee who participated in the Taekwondo event, dismissed the proposal as ""funny and naive.""During the session, Gangwon Province reported to the premier that the construction of 12 stadiums for the PyeongChang Olympics and Paralympics is now 96 percent complete, while the 16 roads around the stadiums are 82 percent complete.

Aging homes transform into cafes and restaurants. Placards notifying renovation work clutter streets, with newly-opening shops, all without harming the original ambience of the area.“When looking at the Seoul City’s urban restoration projects, it is interesting how historical values or decadeslong originality of neighborhoods are preserved even after the transformation,” Kim told The Korea Herald. Kim is one of 11 curators participating in the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s public art project called “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens.” A total of 105 Seoul citizens are part of the two-month long project that kicked off in May to find and promote the hidden artistic gems of Seoul.Throughout the project, the participants are asked to make suggestions on ways to promote Seoul’s art scenes, along with field works and lectures on public art theories.“One other thing I discovered about Seoul’s town redevelopment and gentrification is that public art can play a positive role in the city’s restoration,” said the 40-year-old industry insider.Aiming to find Seoul’s unknown charms, Kim led a group of 10 participants and held 10 rounds of field work in areas such as Ikseon-dong in Jongno-gu.Kim said Seoul is full of artistic appeal found in unexpected areas. “The recent gentrification of Ahyeon-dong was peculiar. ‘Haenghwatang,’ a public bath house which opened its door in 1950s, is a good example,” Kim said.It used to be frequented by nearby residents until that part of the region underwent rapid development, along with the construction of apartments in 2011.With a boom of clean and large sauna houses and young people averting public bathing altogether, Haenghwatang struggled to make ends meet for many years until it was transformed into one of the most unique cultural spaces in Seoul.“Many can ask what public art has to do with urban restoration. If one defines public art as something that vitalizes the community with artistic appeal, there is no boundary because art can change the purpose of buildings and space,” said Kim.The SMG’s two-month project “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” will come to an end Saturday. To wrap it up, participants will gather and give their final presentations on their discoveries at Seoul City Hall, according to the city government’s design policy division.The final presentation is open to all visitors. Those interested can join the event at Seoul City Hall’s multipurpose hall on Saturday at 4 p.m.By Kim Da-sol","in seoul urban restoration ,seoul urban restoration ,seoul urban restoration kim ,is seoul constantly changing ,plays role in seoul","['Kim Hyun - ji', 'the National Museum of Modern', 'Contemporary Art', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84200966  0.43316013

They will also engage in cultural activities including a tour to historic sites. In Malaysia, some 70 students from ASEAN member states and Korea will visit Melaka, Putrajaya, and Kuala Lumpur to get a glimpse into how environmentally-friendly cities are run. They will take part in activities such as a wetland experience in Putrajaya, tree-planting and the cleaning of a river in Melaka and visit the Melaka Green Technology cooperation and Melaka World Solar Valley.

Without fail, they have all donned Korea’s traditional dress, hanbok. First lady Kim Jung-sook has also stuck with tradition, wearing a sky blue hanbok for the official dinner at the White House on Thursday night, hosted by US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump. In her hand was a gray-blue square clutch made of nacre, or mother of pearl.The two state chiefs wore formal suits and matching blue ties, while the US first lady sported a sleeveless white dress.South Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook  heads to a dinner at the White House in Washington, DC on June 29, 2017, together with her US counterpart Melania Trump. Kim’s hanbok dress was elegant and classy, but fell short of making a fashion statement. Cheong Wa Dae, however, says the message is in the fabric. The hanbok she wore was made of material her mother gave her as a gift when she got married in 1981. Kim’s mother ran a linen shop in Gwangjang Market in central Seoul. The fabric was dyed in a traditional method, using a wooden roller and natural dyes extracted from plants. “The first lady wished that the linen market would be reinvigorated and the traditional costumes be worn more often in daily lives,” an official at the Blue House explained. This combined photo shows South Korean first lady Kim Jung-suk in various outfits during her visit to the US. The overriding theme of the first lady’s styles during this trip to the United States is “tradition meets modern fashion,” the official added. Kim’s style for photos shot on the stairs of Air Force One as the plane was bound for Washington, Wednesday, was Western formal with a white blouse and black blazer, but her shoes had traditional overtones: Their pointy toes resembled the tip of traditional Korean padded socks, curled in a round swirl. It was Kim’s idea to add a touch of Korean accessories, Cheong Wa Dae explained.

Students here from age 3 to grade 12 also attend digital courses designed to teach the dangers of digital media and engage both students and their parents in the collaborative process of responsible usership in the digital area, where the use of social media becomes increasingly prolific. “We want students to think about their online presence and behavior not as a digital footprint, but as a tattoo: no amount of scrubbing will wash away the effects of a wrong decision. It will be extremely difficult to remove, and will always leave traces,” the school’s IT Integration Specialist Frank Vink said. DSS students, a culturally-rich group with over 38 different nationalities, have secured acceptances to over 85 prestigious universities worldwide for the graduating Class of 2017, according to the school.Among the list are four distinguished Ivy League schools in the United States of America -- Columbia University, Brown University, Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania.

The North's Korean Central TV reported on May 14 that new children's traffic parks were launched in the northeastern city of Rason and the city of Kanggye in North Korea's northern Jagang Province.In a June 13 report, the Rodong Sinmun said traffic police officers in South Hwanghae Province had been mobilized for the construction of a children's traffic park.Based on the reports, the North appears to be implementing a project to construct children's traffic parks in major cities.The North's traffic park construction boom is interpreted as a result of the social phenomenon of fast-rising traffic. An increase in the number of traffic accidents caused by heavy traffic could prompt the authorities to provide children as well as adults with traffic education.Chinese and other people participating in tour programs in the North say that the number of traffic lights and CCTV for checking violations has increased in major North Korean cities due to a surge in traffic since leader Kim Jong-un took office in 2011. In Pyongyang, the word ""traffic congestion"" has even popped up.Ahn Byung-min, a senior researcher at the Seoul-based Korea Transport Institute, said the activation of markets coupled with a traffic surge has prompted vehicles to come into residential areas and alleys, giving rise to frequent traffic accidents involving children.","builds children traffic parks ,building children traffic parks ,korea builds children traffic ,new park in pyongyang ,is building children traffic","['North Korea', ""the Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'Pyongyang']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.250229    0.04227132

The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education was set to announce Wednesday the results of an assessment it conducted on five of the 29 foreign language and autonomous private schools across the city.The review was conducted with the aim of deciding whether to cancel Seoul Foreign Language High School and four other schools’ designations as special institutions.Seoul is home to nearly half of the nation’s autonomous high schools as well as many other specialized private schools, which are considered by many to provide unfair advantages. If the Seoul education office decides to push to cancel the special status of selected schools, it would be a second attempt. Seoul’s education office had decided to revoke the status of five autonomous institutions in 2015, but the move was blocked by the Ministry of Education under the previous conservative administration. Under the progressive Moon-Jae-in administration, the elite institutions are expected to face a tougher road ahead, as President Moon has pledged to shift away from elitism toward equality. “The current education system  has departed from the initial purpose of creating diversity and autonomy in education to providing training designed to enter top-tier universities,” Seoul Education Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon told Yonhap News Agency on Tuesday. The city’s upcoming decision is likely to trigger other provinces to follow suit in stripping the country’s elite private schools of their autonomous status.By Bak Se-hwan","five elite schools may ,students the seoul metropolitan ,high schools may lose ,private high schools may ,for students the seoul","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86241579  0.29914966

YonhapChang is currently visiting South Korea for this year’s World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championships in Muju, North Jeolla Province, as head of the 32-member North Korean demonstration team. “When we fielded a joint team at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, there were 22 rounds of inter-Korean talks and they took five months,” Chang was quoted as saying at a dinner reception after the opening ceremony, according to a WTF competition official. “That is the reality that we’re faced with.”On co-hosting skiing competitions in North Korea’s Masikryong, Chang said, “As an Olympics expert,  it’s a bit late.” Masikryong is the only ski resort in North Korea. It was criticized by the international community as Kim Jong-un’s showpiece when it opened in 2014. The largest world taekwondo competition to date kicked off Saturday with President Moon Jae-in’s congratulatory speech embodying his wishes to restore inter-Korean dialogue through cross-border cooperation for the upcoming winter games. In a short interview with local daily DongA Ilbo on Saturday, Chang also disagreed with Moon’s comparing of the inter-Korean exchange plans to ping-pong diplomacy between US and China in the early 1970s.“It’s inappropriate to bring the Olympics into political affairs,” Chang said. “I disagree with the saying that ping-pong diplomacy made the global community. Issues surrounding the political environment should be solved first because politics is always above sports.”Despite Chang’s series of comments that threw cold water on Seoul’s hopes for reviving ties with Pyongyang through sports, the Moon administration remains behind the idea of a joint Winter Olympics team. “If the North accepts the president’s offer, there will be many tasks to be done at the working level. We are expecting the North to  respond to Moon’s proposal,” Lee Duk-haeng, spokesman at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, said during a press briefing Monday. Rep. An Min-seok of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, who attended a luncheon meeting with Chang Ung in Muju on Saturday, also supported Seoul’s goals, but stressed time management as a crucial factor. “The Olympics won’t wait for us,” An said. “But the nature of sports talks is that once the leaderships of both Koreas make political decisions, the pace of things can really pick up and it could lead to great results.”“It could be summer or autumn, but if we do hold a new round of sports talks, we could discuss the PyeongChang Winter Olympics within that framework.”An expert in Seoul suggested taking a step back and viewing the administration’s approach as part of the bigger picture. “Forming an inter-Korean sports team is a very complicated process technically,” said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It would be wise to see this as the Moon administration’s gesture to reinstate dialogue with North Korea rather than an actual plan to achieve solid cooperation for the upcoming Olympics.”“The past cases of joint teams with table tennis and soccer was based on win-win strategies thoroughly crafted for both sides -- this time, there’s lack of time to achieve such goals.” South Korea and North Korea fielded joint teams at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship. They also marched in together for the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2004 Athens Olympics under the same name, “Korea,” but competed separately for the games.By Jung Min-kyung","winter olympics appears bleak ,doubts toward seoul culture ,his doubts toward seoul ,international taekwondo federation chief ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympics","['Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'PyeongChang', 'the North ’s International Olympic Committee', 'Chang Ung', 'north korean', 'IOC', 'International Taekwondo Federation', 'Seoul', 'Jong - hwan']",19,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.55447012  0.45395255

The rental homes will be supplied gradually during the President Moon Jae-in's five-year term that began May 10.  This undated Yonhap News TV graphic image shows Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee, a real estate contract and a pile of cash. In a move to fulfill one of the chief executive's major pledges, the government will announce a specific plan to provide share houses and other forms of rental homes to people in their 20s and 30s. The move involves transforming old public buildings into residential homes, Land, Infrastructure and Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee said. She made the comment during her visit to rental homes offered to young graduates who are residing in Dongdaemun-gu and Gwangjin-gu in eastern Seoul. Many college graduates are struggling to cope with high tuition fees and high residential costs compounded with the difficulty of landing a job, particularly in Seoul.In her inaugural speech last Friday, the minister vowed to crack down on speculative real estate investments.Pointing out it is real-estate speculation that has pushed up home prices in recent years, she said the government will show zero tolerance toward forces seeking high returns through repetitive property investments. Such actions are cited for making it harder for ordinary people to buy homes.New lending rules announced June 19 are set to take effect July 3. The stricter rules allow homebuyers to draw mortgage loans worth up to 60 percent of their property value or 50 percent of their income. The ratios were lowered from the previous 70 percent and 60 percent, respectively.","jobseekers south korea will ,300 000 rental homes ,monday the rental homes ,to jobseekers south korea ,korea will launch project","['South Korea', ""Moon Jae - in 's"", 'Yonhap News tv', 'Kim Hyun - mee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50621003  0.36364394

South Korea imported eggs from the United States for the first time in January, but stopped the process due to a bird flu breakout there.The government has been dealing with rising egg prices since it suffered the worst avian influenza outbreak last winter, which led to the culling of more than 33 million birds. It has been grappling with another outbreak since early this month. The imported eggs are likely to be priced at some 100 won  each, less than half the average price of eggs sold in the domestic market at present. Still, experts say it is unclear whether they will contribute to containing the rising egg prices with such a modest amount, considering that the country consumes about 30 million to 40 million eggs per day.","korea this week eggs ,eggs imported from thailand ,south korea on friday ,this week eggs imported ,korea this week industry","['Thailand', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53509992  0.70900387

He traveled with a delegation from the North Korea-led International Taekwondo Federation, whose demonstration team performed at the WTF event's opening ceremony.Chang crossed the tense border just days after South Korea's new sports minister, Do Jong-hwan, proposed forming a joint women's hockey team and holding skiing events at North Korea's Masikyrong resort during the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.As an IOC member, Chang has been peppered with questions about Do's ideas. According to an official with the WTF competition, Chang spoke of his doubts about the South Korean minister's suggestions.""When we fielded a join team at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, there were 22 rounds of inter-Korean talks, and they took five months,"" Chang was quoted as saying at a dinner reception Saturday, after the WTF championships' opening ceremony. ""That is the reality that we're faced with.""The PyeongChang Winter Olympics will go on from Feb. 9-25.As for moving some skiing races to Masikryong, Chang said, ""As an Olympic expert,  it's a bit late.""After Do broached the ideas, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in a congratulatory speech at the WTF opening ceremony, extended an invitation to North Korea to take part in PyeongChang 2018.PyeongChang flatly rejected the possibility of sharing events with North Korea in December 2014. Yet with liberal-minded Moon in office, PyeongChang 2018, the first Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea, has emerged as a potential platform on which to engage North Korea in sports exchanges.Earlier Sunday, Chang attended a luncheon meeting in Muju hosted by the WTF's South Korean president, Choue Chung-won.While Chang kept mum about what went on at the meeting, An Min-seok, a legislator with the ruling Democratic Party, told reporters afterward that Chang took a cautious approach on a joint Korean team. According to An, Chang said he wanted to see if North Korean athletes could qualify for PyeongChang first.North Korea, which hasn't been as successful in Winter Games as in Summer Olympics, has its one last shot in pairs figure skating.Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik just missed out on qualification at the International Skating Union World Figure Skating Championships in Helsinki, and will take one more crack at an Olympic berth at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Oberstdorf, Germany, in September. Four last spots will be up for grabs.An, who has represented South Korea in earlier inter-Korean sports talks, also said the time indeed is running out, but added there's still room for hope.""The nature of sports talks is such that, once the leaderships of both Koreas make their political decision, things can really pick up the pace and it could lead to great results,"" An said.","winter olympics south ,world taekwondo championships ,veteran north korean sports ,year winter olympics south ,world taekwondo championships which","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Chang Ung', 'the International Olympic Committee', 'South Korea', 'the World Taekwondo Federation \\ World Taekwondo Championships', 'Muju', 'Se']",19,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.50801814  0.85295635

""I think we're now at a point where we're trying to improve the quality of our discussions.""According to An, Chang is taking a wait-and-see approach and wanted to see if North Korean athletes could actually qualify for the PyeongChang Games first.

248,248,[News Focus] Moon proposes inter-Korean team for PyeongChang Olympics,"President Moon Jae-in on Saturday proposed that the two Koreas form a unified team to take part in the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang, pinning high hopes on sports as a driver to kick-start cross-border exchanges that have for years been at a standstill. 　He made the overture at the opening ceremony of the 2017 World Taekwondo Championships in Muju, North Jeolla Province, to which the North sent a rare demonstrati...","President Moon Jae-in on Saturday proposed that the two Koreas form a unified team to take part in the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang, pinning high hopes on sports as a driver to kick-start cross-border exchanges that have for years been at a standstill. He made the overture at the opening ceremony of the 2017 World Taekwondo Championships in Muju, North Jeolla Province, to which the North sent a rare demonstration team. The liberal president, who envisions a restart of dialogue for a thaw with the isolated neighbor, recalled the instance of 1991, when the two Koreas competed for the first time as one team for the World Table Tennis Championships and FIFA World Youth Championship. In 2000, athletes from the two countries marched together behind a unification flag as the Summer Games in Sydney kicked off.President Moon Jae-in  pose with taekwondo demonstrators from South Korea and North Korea after the opening ceremony of the World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championships at T1 Arena in Muju, North Jeolla Province, on June 24, 2017. “I hope our achievement in taekwondo will lead to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. I believe that if a North Korean delegation participates, it will greatly contribute to realizing the Olympic values of mankind’s harmony and world peace,” Moon said in a congratulatory address. “I wish to see the glory of 1991 again. I would like to feel the sensation of 2000 again. I hope North Korea’s cheering squad will also come along so that we could set a milestone for inter-Korean reconciliation.” The speech was closely watched by Chang Ung, the North’s sole member of the International Olympic Committee. Jang arrived here Friday, leading the 32-strong International Taekwondo Federation demonstration team, and joined by three other Pyongyang officials.Moon also requested Chang’s cooperation, stressing the significance of the ongoing event as the venue for the first cross-border sports exchange since he took office on May 10.“Once adversaries, the US, China, and Vietnam achieved peace through Ping-Pong diplomacy,” the president said. “I believe in the strength of sports that has been establishing peace.”The offer for the joint team reflects his bid to revive ties with Pyongyang starting with nonpolitical areas while floating a nuclear freeze agreement. Over the past month, the Moon administration has also granted approval for civic groups’ plans to provide humanitarian assistance and resume religious exchanges. Marking the 17th anniversary for a watershed inter-Korean peace declaration in 2000 on June 15, he said he would pursue talks with Pyongyang if it halts nuclear and missile tests. With North Korean leader Kim Jong-un having promoted sports at home as an avid fan himself, the PyeongChang Olympics to be held in Gangwon Province could mean a chance for the nascent leadership to engage the regime with relatively less political burden, analysts say. Choi Jong-kun, a professor in political science and international studies at Yonsei University who has been advising Moon since long before the campaign period, has said his administration wants to use the event as a platform to reinitiate inter-Korean talks designed to induce a moratorium on the North’s nuclear and missile tests in return for economic incentives such as a reopening of the Kaesong industrial park and Geumgangsan tours. “If we could manage to perk up the mood through the Olympics and then expand interactions, we will be able to send a meaningful signal about our intention,” Choi told The Korea Herald last month. “And if the North takes explicit steps on denuclearization, we may take our own corresponding measures, such as on Kaesong and Geumgangsan.” Given heightened tensions and the absence of communication channels, the event could “set the mood” for cross-border dialogue, said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor in North Korean studies of Dongguk University in Seoul. “The proposal was apparently intended to pursue sports exchanges regardless of, or rather to improve, the political situation, and the PyeongChang Olympics would be a key occasion,” Koh said Sunday. “Just like the Muju case, North Korean officials would come here together with the athletes’ delegation. Then there will most likely be direct and indirect talks with the South’s government during which the sides may sound out each other’s stances and explore what to do to improve the relationship going forward.”By Shin Hyon-hee  and Jung Min-kyung","2017 world taekwondo championships ,team for pyeongchang olympics ,for pyeongchang olympics president ,the 2018 winter games ,taekwondo championships in muju","['Moon Jae - in', 'Koreas', 'PyeongChang', 'Muju', 'North Jeolla Province']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12457578  0.1683348

A 36-person delegation of the North Korean-led International Taekwondo Federation will arrive in Seoul by plane via Beijing on Friday and is scheduled to stay until July 1, the ITF and the South Korea’s Ministry of Unification said Thursday. The delegation includes a total of 32 North Korean nationals, including current ITF chief Ri Young-sun and Chang Ung, the only North Korean member of the International Olympic Committee and a former ITF chief, and 12 North Korean athletes.The 2017 World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championship is to run from Saturday to Friday in Muju, some 240 kilometers south of Seoul in North Jeolla Province.This undated photo provided by the World Taekwondo Federation shows a taekwondo demonstration team of the North Korea-lead International Taekwondo Federation. The first inter-Korean taekwondo exchange in nearly a decade, the visit comes as President Moon is openly expressing hopes to re-engage the North with diplomacy and dialogue, amid Pyongyang’s relentless pursuit of nuclear and missile programs.“To resolve the issue we have to add dialogue to the current menu of sanctions and pressure,” Moon said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.The Moon administration is also drawing up plans for a possible inter-Korean sports team for the upcoming 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics to paint the event as the “Peace Olympics.” “There are plans to talk with the IOC to create an inter-Korean women’s hockey team,” Do Jong-hwan, South Korea’s new sports minister, said Tuesday. “Hopefully, we‘ll be able to thaw lingering tensions as we try to bring North Korea on board.” Do also added that Thomas Bach, president of the IOC and who is scheduled to attend the closing ceremony of the taekwondo championship, has plans to meet Moon on July 3, upon the president’s arrival from Seoul-Washington bilateral summit. The meeting is expected to be an opportunity for Moon to roll out his ideas for the Peace Olympics. President Moon himself also expressed hopes for the two Koreas to collaborate in the bidding process to host the 2030 World Cup. “If the neighboring countries in Northeast Asia, including North and South Korea, can host the World Cup together, it would help to create peace in North and South Korea as well as Northeast Asia,” Moon said earlier this month, according to the president’s spokesperson Park Su-hyun. The upcoming taekwondo event is expected to be the largest world championship of the sport, indigenous to Korea, to date, with a record number of 971 athletes from 183 nations registered to compete. South Korea’s Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung will attend the event with the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism overseeing the tournament, according to a Ministry of Unification official Thursday. Demonstration teams from each federation will hold a joint performance choreographed for the tournament’s opening ceremony, marking the first time it is being showcased in South Korea. The WTF, headquartered in Seoul, is a control tower for taekwondo worldwide with the IOC’s support. The ITF, although sanctioned by the North Korean regime, is headquartered in Vienna.

The subsidy amount is 500,000 won  per month for up to six months. Providing cash is the most practical and effective way to help underprivileged youth to escape long-term unemployment, Seoul officials said. The recipients consist of 2,629 women and 2,371 men who were unemployed for about 20 months on average. About 60 percent of them are graduates from four-year courses in universities.A banner of youth subsidy, put up by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2016. “Along with the cash subsidies, the city government plans to provide support in terms of job preparation such as mentoring services,” said Jeon Hyo-kwan, an official of the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The Seoul Metropolitan Government first brought up the idea of the youth subsidy program in November 2015, stressing that cash allowances would help jobless youth to escape “a vicious circle of having to earn money first in order to study to land jobs.” The program, however, was opposed by the previous conservative Park Geun-hye administration. Nevertheless, it distributed the first cash handouts to 2,831 recipients in August last year, prompting the Ministry of Health and Welfare to issue a correction order. After the impeachment of the former president, the ministry reserved its stance on the program. Critics have raised concerns toward the program, questioning whether the money would really be spent on job searches and preparation. City officials argued that the selection process was fair and transparent and that recipients will be required to submit receipts and a report on how they used the stipend. Meanwhile, separate data from Statistics Korea showed that the number of long-term unemployed people here hit a 13-year high in May, with some 120,000 people looking for work for six months or longer.By Kim Da-sol","won 439 per month ,subsidy amount is 500 ,500 000 won 439 ,six months providing cash ,term unemployment seoul officials","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39239293  0.01633859

So there’s no doubt I’ve taken a somewhat easier path by “only” going pescatarian, which means while eschewing other meat, I still eat seafood. That guarantees finding something to eat at almost any restaurant I go to in Korea. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll just say I don’t eat meat. But even that hasn’t been so simple. The most commonly offered food after saying so? Chicken. I don’t clarify that someone who eats chicken but not other meat -- including seafood -- would be a pollotarian, or that someone who is OK with either would be a pollo-pescatarian. I’ve had to go through this vocabulary lesson myself. It can be a bit cumbersome. But let’s try. Here’s the short version: What is mostly thought of as “vegetarianism” would specifically be ovo-lacto vegetarianism. That means not eating meat, but still consuming dairy and eggs. Ovo vegetarians eat eggs and not dairy and lacto vegetarians eat dairy and not eggs. Vegans, on the other hand, eat no meat and nothing that comes from an animal -- no dairy, no eggs -- or perhaps nothing that has ever touched an animal, which takes most bottles of wine off the table. Then there are the fruitarians -- the ranks of which included Apple co-founder Steve Jobs -- who also avoid most vegetables and primarily eat fruit, seeds and nuts. What this all goes to show is that vegetarianism need not be thought of as all or nothing. As concerns over global warming increase and the link between meat and its negative environmental impacts become clearer, there’s been a stronger push for “flexitarianism” -- being primarily vegetarian, but occasionally indulging in meat -- and weekend or part-time vegetarianism. In 2009, noted celebrity vegan Paul McCartney launched nonprofit group Meat-Free Monday to encourage people to devote a day a week to swearing off meat. The group cites a conservative estimate from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that pins 14.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions on livestock production, while other estimates have ranged as high as 51 percent. Environmental concern was a key driver that led me to what began as an experiment. I was also motivated by wanting to see a change in my health and by the viral Matt Cutts TED Talk video “Try Something New for 30 Days” -- yes, I know I’ve overshot the mark. As for health, I discovered it was no sweat eating poorly without meat. Convenience store pastries and copious amounts of peanut butter and cheese were things I had to learn to be careful of.But after 30 days I also discovered it was no big deal to keep it going. Maybe I would stop in the summer. After, I could make it to Christmas. Later, I may as well go past a full year. Then, two years. Now it’s been three years, three months, three weeks and two days. And I guess I’ll keep going a while.

We will allow no more unfortunate accidents,” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said via radio.  On May 30, a 32-year-old man from Kazakhstan jumped from the 17-meter high Seoullo 7017 in an apparent suicide, crossing over the 1.4-meter-high safety walls erected to prevent a fall. The incident occurred just 10 days after the elevated park opened on May 20. It has sparked concerns that the capital’s newest landmark might become a site for suicide attempts in a country with one of the world’s highest suicide rates. Fears of secondary accidents also surfaced, as the park is above a high traffic area near Seoul Station. To prevent suicide attempts, Seoul Metropolitan Government plans to increase the number of guards for the park from the current 16 to 31 officers. At least 10 guards will man the overpass-turned-pedestrian park around the clock from July. The city government, however, decided against raising the height of the existing walls, considering structural safety issues, such as the total weight of the elevated walkway and wind pressure. Instead, safety hand rails will be augmented. Modeled after New York’s iconic High Line, Seoullo 7017 was a project involving the renovation of a 40-year-old highway into a public park.The city government said an average of 100,000 to 120,000 people have visited the park on weekends and 40,000 to 70,000 on weekdays.

Because by talking about it, they can take the meaning of art to the next level, like ‘Shoes Tree’ in front of Seoul Station,” Shim told The Korea Herald.“Shoes Tree,” an art installation made of 30,000 worn-out shoes near Seoul Station, elicited mixed reviews after its unveiling last month.Some called it a giant pile of garbage. But others, refraining from premature judgment, expressed curiosity about its artistic intention and meaning.Although the city government is providing a variety of cultural programs to appreciate public art like through municipal art lectures, providing a platform for citizens to appraise and discuss about Seoul’s public art is important in improving public art, according to Yim. Shim So-mi, an independent curator with a 14-year experience in the industry, echoed the view.  Shim So-mi talks with citizens during their excursion to public art in Seoul. “When it comes to public art, citizens should participate from the early stage of planning to removal. Citizens, instead of institutions or building owners, are the main appreciators of public art with responsibility to provide their opinion,” Shim said. As such an example, the curator referred to Taiwan’s Treasure Hill, an illegal settlement-turned-artist village where residents there reinvented the area into a sustainable urban community in Taipei. “I personally believe that Treasure Hill shows the best example of what citizen participation can attribute to society through art. The community’s effort to give a new life to the existing village proves that citizens can lead to the discovery of art that can be enjoyed by many.”By Kim Da-sol","supervisors for seoul city ,year old freelance curator ,the supervisors for seoul ,art on seoul streets ,supervisors for seoul","['Yim Na - re', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Citizens']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23956808 -0.08606429

For the visitors, the market provides a chance to get a taste of life outside Korea, in the heart of Seoul. However, the market is more than a simple market where people gather to sell and buy goods.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Thursday that it would introduce fare exemptions for bus and subway users during commuting hours -- from the first train or bus to 9 a.m. and from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. -- on days when the daily average concentration of ultra fine dust is above 50 micrograms per cubic meter. The same will apply when the fine dust concentration is forecast to be above 80 micrograms per cubic meter on the following day.“This measure is to boost citizen participation in the odd-even license plate number program,” said Jung Mi-seon, a Seoul City official in charge of air quality management division. The system is a voluntary program that encourages drivers to leave their cars on days designated according to the last number of their license plate. In a public debate last week, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon vowed that he will prioritize concerns for citizens over costs in battling air pollution. The debate, held in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, had brought some 3,000 citizens and experts together to help solve the fine dust problem.“Seoul may suffer 25 billion won  in financial losses a year when public transportation is offered for free, based on last year’s record of fine dust levels rising to ‘serious’ seven times,” said Park during a talk with citizens.“But the value of human beings is far greater than that of money.”Calling the fine dust situation a disaster, the city government said it would implement a revised ordinance and new advisory system to protect the vulnerable, such as elderly and children, from air pollutants and related health risks. The city will inject 2.9 billion won to install air purifiers at 6,284 child care centers and 488 child welfare institutions. Another 13 billion won will be allocated to providing face masks for the vulnerable when the fine dust advisory is issued. Both plans will start from July, the city government said.In addition, traffic will be restricted in the center of the city.If the Transport Ministry approves the plan, the roughly 17 square kilometers within Seoul’s city walls will be off limits to vehicles with poor emissions ratings. The city said it would introduce this new traffic policy as early as next year, along with measures to install CCTV systems and charge penalties to those who drive in the designated area.By Kim Da-sol","seoul will provide free ,dust from july seoul ,city to offer free ,july seoul will provide ,subway users during commuting","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3401624   0.18530633

This undated file photo shows the Iron Flagpole of the 918-1392 Goryeo Dynasty, known as ""Cheol Danggan"" in Korean, in Cheongju, central South Korea. The Cheongju municipal government and an association of merchants at the Seongan Road Market had requested the Cultural Heritage Administration grant permission for the implementation of the project as part of efforts to draw more customers and tourists to the market.In March, the administration in charge of construction projects involving cultural properties greenlighted the 200 million-won  project after the business group pledged to preserve the plaza's original form and have experts supervise it.The project called for the recreation of the plaza as a lively rendezvous for young people in their teens and 20s, highlighting the medieval flagpole.Among the plans is using optical fiber and light-emitting diodes  to illuminate the plaza and the flagpole, respectively.Other measures being considered include LED ad boards, digital signs and a nighttime laser show.A business group official said, ""We hope we will make good use of Cheol Danggan as a splendid attraction, adding the improvement of the plaza through the project will boost projects aimed at improving business at traditional markets in the city.""The ""Cheol Danggan"" Iron Flagpole, which is located at the entrance of the now-demolished Yongdu Temple site, was built in 962, during the reign of King Gwangjo, the fourth monarch of the Goryeo period. Danggan, which means flagpole in Korean, was used to affix a flag called ""Dang"" to pay tribute to the virtues of Buddha and Bodhisattva or to expel evil spirits, when Buddhist ceremonies were performed at temples.The only iron flagpole remaining in South Korea that has inscriptions detailing the time of the erection has 20 iron tubes put together up right, with each iron tube measuring 43 centimeters in diameter and 65 centimeters in hight. It also has two pillars supporting the pole.It was designated as National Treasure No. 41 in 1962 after being named as a treasure in 1936 by Japan, which ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45.Prior to the designation of the national treasure, the flagpole had been poorly protected due to the lack of understanding the importance of its value as a cultural property and budgetary constraints, among others.","flagpole in korean city ,state run korea tourism ,flagpole from korea medieval ,plaza renovation project to ,medieval flagpole in korean","[""Korea Tourism Organization 's"", 'Cheongju', 'South Korea', 'Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12468942  0.18158057

Vincent K. Brooks, commander of the US Forces Korea said. ""And being mindful of our stewardship of that gift, we must ensure that the price paid was not done so without our recognition of the cost."" He was speaking at the honor guard ceremony held at Knight Field of the Yongsan Garrison in Seoul. It was attended by around 100 USFK solders, their families and representatives from the South Korean Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.Memorial Day, an American holiday, is formally observed on the last Monday of May, but the USFK hosted the event in advance.The US dispatched 1.79 million service members to fend off North Korea's invasion in the 1950-53 Korean War and more than 33,870 of them were killed in action with nearly 8,200 others missing in action, according to official data.Brooks also recalled the sacrifices of US and South Korean soldiers after the conflict, with the two Koreas technically at war as it ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.He introduced some related stories, including the 1968 capture of the USS Pueblo by the North and the 1976 ax-murder incident at Panmunjom.The Panmunjom tragedy gave him a rather personal and emotional experience.As a West Point cadet at that time, Brooks stood on the prayer field to honor Capt. Arthur Bonifas as his body returned home. Bonifas was one of two American soldiers brutally killed by ax-wielding North Korean soldiers in the incident that pushed Korea to the brink of another war. The other is Lt. Mark Barrett.""It was an earlier reminder for me of the sacrifice and patriots in Korea,"" Brooks said.The commander also told the story about six South Korean sailors who lost their lives in the 2002 naval skirmish with the North near Yeonpyeong Island close to the tense western sea border.His speech was followed by a ""21-gun salute"" in remembrance of those who perished while serving in the armed forces, with the ""Books of Remembrance"" displayed on the table through the ceremony.It lists all Americans who died in action during the Korean War.","usfk honors fallen soldiers ,fallen soldiers in yongsan ,honors fallen soldiers ,honors fallen soldiers in ,soldiers in yongsan ceremony","['american', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'Vincent K.

A work of garden designer and environmental artist Hwang Ji-hae, Shoes Tree is cascading tree bushes made up of worn-out shoes, plants and flowers. “The idea of recycling worn-out materials is creative, but since it was created as public art, whose artistic meaning is to be appreciated by citizens, I personally think Shoes Tree is not serving its purpose correctly,” a local freelance art journalist Cho Sook-hyun said.Meanwhile, some pointed to the true definition of art.“Since art doesn’t have to look beautiful all the time, I think Shoes Tree, as art itself, can portray different perspectives of appreciating art,” said freelance artist surnamed Kim. Artist Hwang explained to the Korea Herald that she wanted to throw a question about our consumption-oriented lifestyle, by giving a new life and meaning to dumped shoes. It was also meant to remember the historical significance of the Yeomcheon-gyo handmade shoes street near Seoul Station. “Through shoes, something we wear every day and an easy material to get, I wanted to show people that everyday material can also become part of art,” she said. A partipant of the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” takes a photo of installation art Shoes Tree in Seoul Station on Saturday.

Some called it a giant pile of garbage. Others, refraining from premature judgment, expressed curiosity over its artistic intention and meaning. The artist, Hwang Ji-hae, sat down with The Korea Herald on Monday, two days after its unveiling Saturday, to discuss her work.Hwang Ji-hae, garden designer and environmental artist, stands in front of her installation art Shoes Tree in front of Seoul Station on Monday. “Each of these shoes, whether they are high heels, baby shoes, sandals or running shoes, carry different stories, memories and meanings of those who wore them. “And we all wear shoes,” said the 39-year-old artist. Nearly 30,000 shoes form cascading tree bushes, decorated with plants and flowers, just outside Seoul Station, in celebration of the grand opening of Seoullo 7017, an old overpass-turned-public park. It was a pro-bono work by Hwang, an internationally recognized garden designer and environmental artist. In 2012, she won the gold medal at the 2012 Chelsea Flower Show with her work “Quiet Time: DMZ Forbidden Garden.” A year before, she won the same award by turning a traditional Korean bathroom into a garden, called “Hae-woo-so.”Her previous works featured naturalized planting, old military shoes, sand mold for casting metals and a bunch of twigs, Hwang said. “But on top of that, my favorite material to work with is bolt nuts. They are cheap and easily found.”The reason why Hwang specifically picked shoes this time was to highlight the meaning of urban restoration to visitors of Seoullo 7017.“Both ‘Shoes Tree’ and Seoullo 7017 are given new life with new meanings, reborn as a creative upcycling art and a unique park, respectively.”She added that using shoes to create a tree was to remember the historical significance of the Yeomcheon-gyo handmade shoes street, located behind Seoullo 7017.A partipant of the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” takes a photo of installation art Shoes Tree in Seoul Station on Saturday. But her selection of shoes for art material was primarily because she believed shoes reflected the connection between herself, her art and the public.“Through shoes, something we wear every day and an easy material to get, I wanted to show people that everyday material can also become part of art.”From the early stage of installation, however, Shoes Tree was at the center of controversy. “At first, I thought it was a pile of garbage,” said 49-year-old Kim Gui-ri. “Looking at it up close, it is surely a garbage mountain and smells really bad,” Kim said. Cho Sook-hyun, a local freelance art journalist, said that “the idea of recycling worn-out materials is creative, but since it was created as public art, which must at first give joy and have a healing effect on citizens, I personally think ‘Shoes Tree’ does not serve its purpose correctly.”There are also many who appreciate it as a creative artwork.“Since art is not something that must be always beautiful or contain an aesthetic side, I think ‘Shoes Tree,’ as a work of art itself, can portray a different perspective of appreciating art,” said freelance artist surnamed Kim.Hwang expressed regret about people’s negative reviews because it was made of untidy, worn-out shoes and didn’t help Seoul look prettier. “Many probably felt unfamiliar and uncomfortable looking at ‘Shoes Tree,’ because they have never thought that shoes could be part of art. I understand people appreciate art in different ways,” Hwang said.The artist stressed that she wanted to make a strong impression on viewers with the artwork. “Since Shoes Tree will be removed after nine days, I wanted to make it strong and impressive during a short period of time. I hope Shoes Tree speaks for who I am as an artist,” Hwang said. “I could have used golden bars to lure the public and make a good impression, don’t you think? My art is always an attempt to communicate with the public.”By Kim Da-sol","korea herald on monday ,after its unveiling saturday ,controversial shoes tree talks ,artist behind controversial shoes ,unveiling saturday","['Seoul Station', 'Hwang Ji - hae', 'the Korea Herald']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27477652  0.31194949

Seoul`s new high rise park dubbed ""Seoullo 7017"" At that time, Park revealed a plan to transform the old Seoul Station elevated road built in 1970 into a new landmark public park both for residents and visitors, instead of its dismantlement.The 1,024-meter-long and 10.3-meter-wide elevated road, which was used by vehicles visiting Seoul Station for 45 years, has been converted into a park full of green trees and flowers, officials at the Seoul Metropolitan Government said.The government said the new park, dubbed ""Seoullo 7017"" for its completion in 1970 and rebirth in 2017, opened to the public at 10 a.m. Saturday, with a formal opening ceremony slated for 8 p.m. the same day. Visitors dip their feet in a mini pool at the newly opened park on Saturday. It noted that about 24,000 flower and tree pots have been installed along the elevated park, while restaurants, flower shops, a library, marionette theater, benches and other facilities will provide convenience to citizens and tourists.Particularly for the convenience of foreign tourists, the so-called ""Seoullo Tourist Cafe"" will offer various tourism information and luggage storage services. Tourists can also use copying, scanning and fax machines at the cafe.A man looks into ""Shoes Tree,"" a public art installation made of 30,000 pairs of shoes. Seoullo 7017 is also connected to many tourist attractions, including Namdaemun Market, ancient fortress walls and a renowned cathedral, via elevators and escalators, officials said, adding a variety of performances, exhibitions, experience programs and parties will take place throughout the year.After sunset, the elevated park will turn into a kind of Milky Way due to colorful lights emitted from 555 LED lamps and another 551 lamps attached to the flower pots, they explained.""We wish for Seoullo 7017 to be a new urban rest area that will be loved by many citizens and tourists,"" said a Seoul official.

And it has added yet another reason for people to explore the city, especially at night.   The K Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened last December, has became the first museum in Korea that runs as late as 11 p.m.    ""I thought enjoying art should feel as easy as going to the cinema,"" said Kim Yeon-jin, director of K Museum, during an interview with Yonhap News Agency Friday.   She opened the museum in Sinsa-dong, an area mostly known for its shopping and food scene in southern Seoul, not necessarily for high art and sophisticated culture. She chose the location because it is only a few minutes from the nearby subway station with a lot of foot traffic from office workers who she thought might need some solace in art.   On Friday, the museum unveiled the next -- and the last -- lineup of its current exhibition, ""Everyone is an Artist and Everything is Art,"" with two Korean artists Gwon O-sang and Dongi.They are credited for lowering the high bar that art laymen may feel contemporary art has, explained the museum.   Exploring new materials and formats in sculpture, Gwon pushes the boundaries of sculpture and photography. In his signature artwork ""Deodorant Type,"" he creates a Styrofoam sculpture covered with thousands of photo images.    Best known for ""Atomouse,"" a character that combines Atom from Japanese animation and Mickey Mouse from Disney's, Lee tries to redefine fine art by borrowing images from mass media and culture and putting what has been considered low art on par with high art by reenacting pop culture in a traditional painting.     The selection of the two artists and the display of their artwork in an unconventional way are meant to make visitors feel more comfortable with contemporary art, said the director.   ""I've intentionally destroyed the tension among art pieces on display even though it might not be the most sophisticated way of displaying artwork,"" she said.   Indeed, some of the paintings are hung above others, a display rarely seen in traditional art museums.    ""In most museums, artwork is sacred. You aren't supposed to touch it. You should feel the work is something special. I wanted to twist conventional wisdom and make people feel at ease in enjoying artwork and the museum environment.""   In Part 1 of the exhibition, Numen/For Use, a globally well-known conceptual and installation artist group, has created ""Tape Seoul,"" a giant participatory structure made entirely out of clear plastic tape. Visitors can even crawl inside the gigantic suspended structure still installed in the six-meter-high lobby.   ""The work is meant to have direct contact with visitors. Only when people go inside and feel it does it become a meaningful art piece,"" she said.    The exhibition runs until Sept. 1.","art at 10 seoul ,first museum in korea ,10 seoul is pulsating ,in seoul enjoy contemporary ,opened last december","['Seoul', 'the K Museum of Contemporary Art', 'Korea', 'Kim Yeon - jin', 'K Museum']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26348802  0.25316304

""South Korea will welcome North Korea and when they decide to come, the South Korean government will allow them to come by road,"" Lee was quoted by Reuters as saying. ""And when they have supporting teams, the  Korean government will allow them to come by ship. All nations are very welcome, including North Korea and Russia . We want it to be the peace games.""Typically, North Korean athletes competing in the South have flown in via Beijing. The Korean Peninsula has remained divided since 1953, with the demilitarized zone, a 4km-wide buffer zone, guarded on either side by troops.According to an official with the organizing committee, President Moon Jae-in, before taking office, had spoken of possibly opening the land route for the North Korean Olympic delegation in his January meeting with Gangwon Province Governor Choi Moon-soon. PyeongChang is located in the eastern province.Tension lingers in the area with a string of missile launches by North Korea, the threat of an imminent nuclear test, and virtually all inter-Korean exchanges have been put on hold.Yet athletes from either side made cross-border trips for competitions last month. The South Korean women's football team went to Pyongyang for the Asian Football Confederation Women's Asian Cup qualifying matches. Around the same time, the North Korean women's hockey team came to Gangneung, Gangwon Province, for the International Ice Hockey Federation Women's World Championship Division II Group A.During the hockey team's visit, a North Korean sports official told Governor Choi that North Korea will try to send ""as many athletes as possible"" to PyeongChang.Moon is expected to adopt a more conciliatory approach toward North Korea, though his hands appear to be tied by Pyongyang's continued push with its nuclear and missile programs.","2018 pyeongchang winter games ,the 2018 winter olympics ,winter olympics in south ,2018 winter olympics in ,2018 winter olympics","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'London', 'Lee Hee - beom', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Lee']",19,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.4542276   0.23046039

The measure, still under discussion at related ministries, would be a follow-up to President Moon Jae-in’s surprise directive last week to temporarily close down old coal-fired power plants to combat the country’s worsening air quality. An official at the Education Ministry confirmed to The Korea Herald on Wednesday that it is currently reviewing the budget. If the measure gets the green light, at least 160,000 day cares, kindergartens, elementary schools and nursing homes for the elderly nationwide will have an air purifier in every room. As many as 1 million South Koreans are expected to benefit.An image of air purifier While the shutdown of outdated coal-powered plants is part of fundamental controls on dust emissions, installing air purifiers in classrooms and other places would help reduce the damage, the ministry official explained.President Moon, who was sworn in a week ago, said during a visit to an elementary school on Monday that the government would “inject some 60 billion won  to complete installing dust-measuring devices at some 11,000 elementary to high schools across the nation to constantly monitor air quality.” Moon also added he would make sure classrooms and gyms at schools are equipped with air purifying devices so students can enjoy activities any time they want.The Seoul Metropolitan Government welcomed the move.The capital city said it will work hand in hand with the central government’s plan to protect the vulnerable from air pollutants and related health risks. In line with the government’s efforts to combat fine dust, Seoul City said it plans to restrict traffic volume in the center of the city.If the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport approves the plan, some 17 square kilometers surrounded by Seoul’s four main gates -- Namdaemun, Changuimun, Hyehwamun and Heunginjimun -- will be off limits to vehicles. The city said it will introduce this new traffic policy as early as next year, along with measures of installing CCTV systems and charging penalties to those who drive in the designated area. “In the so-called ‘green zone,’ all vehicles will be restricted, considering the increased traffic volume, environment issues and, most importantly, to reduce fine dust levels,” said Lee Sang-hun, the city government’s transportation policy head. But when there is traffic congestion during rush hours, officials said it may adopt a plan B, such as only allowing preregistered vehicles and ecofriendly tour buses in the green driving zone. Based on government data that showed outdated diesel cars are one of the main causes of air pollution here, the Seoul Metropolitan Government banned in April some 1.4 million diesel cars that were registered before 2005 from its roads.By Kim Da-sol","seoul to distribute free ,power plants to combat ,day cares nursing homes ,seniors south korea ,week to temporarily close","['South Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Education Ministry']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19881283  0.45703217

Flower seeds have been planted inside each shoe. “We invited Hwang to install Shoes Tree to give a meaning of urban restoration to visitors of Seoullo 7017,” said Choi Kwang-bin, the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s city gardening department.“Both Shoes Tree and Seoullo 7017 are given new life with new meaning, reborn as a creative upcycling art and a unique park, respectively.”The reason Hwang used shoes to create a tree was to remember the historical significance of the Yeomcheon-gyo handmade shoes street, located behind Seoullo 7017, the artist was quoted as saying.Workers hang worn-out shoes on Shoes Tree on Seoullo 7017, Seoul’s soon-to-open pedestrian-friendly park, near Seoul Station on Tuesday. The city restoration project of Seoullo 7017 began four years ago to make use of an old overpass that once served as a major road connecting western and central Seoul. Public calls for its removal had mounted after a safety assessment classified the outdated overpass as dangerous in 2006. The “70” in the name Seoullo 7017 refers to 1970, when the Seoul Station flyover was constructed, while 17 is a reference to the number of walkways connected to it and 2017, when its construction was completed.Workers hang worn-out shoes on Shoes Tree on Seoullo 7017, Seoul’s soon-to-open pedestrian-friendly park, near Seoul Station on Tuesday.

History mingles with a bustling metropolis here. Society’s top elites share the space with protests of all kinds and tourists. It is also here that South Koreans witnessed the massive grassroots movement that unseated former President Park Geun-hye and brought in a new leader, President Moon Jae-in, this week.  An aerial view of Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul Millions of South Koreans relentlessly took to the streets of Gwanghwamun, calling for former President Park’s ouster over a corruption scandal, just a few kilometers away from the presidential palace. “The square has been where pain and joy coexist. For me, it is a symbol of defiance and victory,” said Cho Mi-ran, who joined the anti-Park rallies almost every weekend for months. Professor Choi Chang-ryul of Yong In University sees Gwanghwamun as a symbol of the country’s vibrant democracy. “The square is a crucial part of direct democracy and a reminder that the owner of this country is the people,” he said. The area’s name Gwanghwamun derives from the namesake gate of Gyeongbok Palace, built in 1395 during the Joseon Dynasty and reconstructed several times. Stretching from the gate, the 557-meter-long Gwanghwamun Square in the middle of the 10-lane thoroughfare opened to the public in 2009, after yearslong restoration. Before then, it was mostly a busy office district for elite workers in the central government and finance industry. Now, the square is bustling with tourists as it features statues of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and King Sejong the Great -- two of the county’s most respected ancestors -- with an exhibition hall and a museum underground. The area also has the nation’s biggest bookstore, the US embassy and a concert hall. And almost every day, someone is protesting against something here. A unionized worker accuses his employer for the abuse of basic labor rights; a minority group demands an end to social discrimination against them; a disabled person calls for better access to public transport. Last summer, even two Britons held protests here to urge South Koreans to stop slaughtering dogs for meat. Various groups also put up performances and flash mobs -- sometimes drawing hundreds of participants, in order to make their voices heard. In summer of 2014, when Pope Francis held an open-air mass here, the area had virtually turned into a giant outdoor cathedral. Earlier that year, the square witnessed an outpouring of sorrow as the nation mourned the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. A joint alter was erected for the 304 people who lost their lives in the tragic sinking -- mostly students on a field trip. The openness of Gwanghwamun is a microcosm of the history of the relationship between the ruler and the ruled that traces back to Joseon Dynasty , says Kim Baek-young, one of co-authors of a book “Seoul Sociology.”When the kings and queens came out of Gyeongbok Palace, at the northern end of the area, ordinary people played musical instruments to capture attention and let their hardships known, he explained. During the Japanese colonial rule of Korea, the area witnessed a mass civilian uprising for independence in 1919. The April Revolution of 1960 and the June Democratic Uprising of 1987 also occurred here. “The events triggered by a burst of fierce public energy embody Korean society’s tradition of strong political awareness and engagement,” the author said. However, the significance of Gwanghwamun as a center for democracy has somewhat weakened with the arrival of a modern representative democracy in South Korea in 1987. That changed with the anti-Park protests of the last winter. Candlelight rallies against the former leader began at Gwanghwamun in October and soon spread to major cities nationwide in what some later described as the “candle revolution.” A cumulative 1.7 million people had joined 23 rallies at Gwanghwamun, and more in elsewhere, according to the rally organizers. The massive peaceful movement eventually led to Park’s parliamentary impeachment, which the Constitutional Court upheld in March this year. “The rallies were for the citizens to get back their square from those abusing power bestowed by the public,” Nam Jeong-su, a spokesperson for an association of 1,500 civic groups that organized the anti-Park rallies.Professor Lee Na-young of Chung-Ang University said the experience has taught many South Koreans how to do democracy. “While protesting for the same cause to condemn the government’s wrongdoings, minorities raised their voices and people stood in solidarity. Koreans learned how to do democracy in everyday lives,” the sociology professor said. Under the new Moon Jae-in administration, Gwanghwamun is likely to gain more significance as a social and political center stage. Moon, who began and ended his election campaign at the square, has vowed to usher in the “era of Gwanghwamun presidency.” He wants to move his work office from Cheong Wa Dae to the area. The president earlier announced the launch of two committees to handle the project to relocate the presidential office and overhaul the center of Seoul to be more citizen-friendly. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon also unveiled his plan to restructure the square to downsize the current 10-lane road, expand the square’s size and re-enact Yukjo street, the main street of old Seoul, to restore a historic meaning to the area.Meanwhile, Nam, the organizer of the candlelight rallies against Park, vows to keep a close watch on how the government is run and voice their opinions at the square. “We will gather again at the square as we always have if we think the government goes the wrong way,” he said.

278,278,[Exclusive] Seoul seeks inter-Korean talks at PyeongChang Olympics: Moon adviser,"With South Korea hosting the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, the Moon Jae-in government is seeking to use the event as a platform to kick-start dialogue with the North and set the tone for a nuclear moratorium in return for a restart of economic cooperation, a presidential adviser told The Korea Herald.But Choi Jong-kun, a professor in political science and international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, em...","With South Korea hosting the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, the Moon Jae-in government is seeking to use the event as a platform to kick-start dialogue with the North and set the tone for a nuclear moratorium in return for a restart of economic cooperation, a presidential adviser told The Korea Herald.But Choi Jong-kun, a professor in political science and international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, emphasized that any thaw in relations with Pyongyang should be premised on its “explicit steps” toward denuclearization such as a halt in further nuclear and missile tests, as well as public consensus at home. “How to use the PyeongChang Olympics is extremely important for us. It’s held in Gangwon Province and  the first major international event to be hosted by the new government, and there’s less burden because of its non-political nature and the Olympic spirit,” he said in an interview, referring to a region that shares a border with North Korea. “It could serve as a crucial platform for us to start talks with the North.”South Korean President Moon Jae-in Given heightened tension and the absence of cross-border communication channels, the event could set the stage for Seoul to sound out Pyongyang’s willingness to engage in negotiations. The plan is to increase exchanges, such as through reunions of separated families, and then extract the moratorium in exchange for “corresponding” measures such as on the Kaesong and Kumkangsan projects, Choi said.  Mindful of potential diplomatic and domestic backlash, the Moon administration will take the measures only after Pyongyang does its part and reverse them if it backpedals on its promises. The initiative would also require consultations with the US and other neighbors given controversy over whether the projects infringe upon the UN Security Council resolutions and independent sanctions adopted by past Seoul governments and Washington, he noted. “If we could manage to perk up the mood through the Olympics and then expand interactions, we will be able to send a meaningful signal about our intention,” Choi said. “And if the North takes explicit steps on denuclearization, we may take our own regarding Kaesong and Kumkangsan.” Yet the president will not be bent on rushing talks for the sake of talks, he said, adding there are “lots of procedures to undergo, and nationwide consensus should be built before we get there.” The professor has been working with Moon since long before he launched his second presidential bid. His name is currently being floated for top diplomatic jobs including foreign minister. The president, who served in ranking posts in the Roh Moo-hyun administration, is widely expected to carry on with the late liberal leader’s strategy of pursuing greater political and economic cooperation with the North. On the campaign trail, Moon had pledged to revive the Kaesong district and Kumkangsan tours. During his formal oath of office Wednesday, he said he would visit Pyongyang under the “right conditions” to negotiate on the nuclear issues. That approach is kindling concerns over potential friction with the US’ Donald Trump administration, which has recently settled on its North Korea policy focusing on “maximum pressure and engagement.” Choi ditched the view, saying the Moon government would never defy UNSC resolutions for its own political interests nor create a crack in international coordination on the nuclear program, though it may give more weight to negotiations than its predecessors. “The new government will begin its own policy review after house cleaning and a buildup for a couple of months, but I assume it will no longer apply strict reciprocity as previous ones did,” he said. “Yes, the possibility and resolve for dialogue is higher than before, and the signal should be sent to the North.“Our aim is to take the lead in one of the two prongs of international cooperation -- negotiations and contact -- while the UNSC continues to steer the other. Otherwise, there won’t be any breakthrough to foster peace and stability on the peninsula.” Despite skepticism over leader Kim Jong-un’s unruliness and will for denuclearization, dialogue is all the more necessary now than ever to comprehend the precise situation, he said. “North Korea under Kim Jong-il and North Korea under Kim Jong-un are quite different. Since we haven’t have any access to Pyongyang for the past decade, we don’t know who they are and they don’t know who we are, which is why there are sustained doubts,” Choi said. “What the Moon government wants to do is conduct empirical research, getting to know about their vision for denuclearization, how they want to resolve the situation, and how big and broad the gap is between ours and theirs. With that, we can only figure out whether we should talk or sanction or completely isolate them.”By Shin Hyon-hee  and Yeo Jun-suk","pyeongchang olympics moon adviser ,talks at pyeongchang olympics ,winter olympics in pyeongchang ,at pyeongchang olympics moon ,korea hosting the 2018","['South Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'the Korea Herald', 'Choi Jong - kun', 'Yonsei University', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61192971  0.59472388

An Hee-jung made a bold move to kiss South Korea’s president-elect at Gwanghwamun Square on Tuesday, with photos of the smooch instantly going viral. An, representing South Chungcheong Province, suddenly found himself in the midst of intense public attention, including from foreign newspapers and social media users, thanks to his somewhat passionate congratulatory kiss on Moon Jae-in’s cheek. While some Korean users on social media questioned whether the An-Moon smooch was appropriate, An has gone a step further noticing the potential of the powerful image. On Thursday, An graced his Facebook page with a cartoon version of the kiss photo. In the photo, a speech bubble drawn next to An’s head says, “It’s Day One” in Korean. Korean couples often count the number of days they date and celebrate the 100th day. When a couple decide to confirm the start of their relationship, they call it “Day One.”In this case, An appears to mean it for Moon’s first day as the 19th President of South Korea.

Animal rights groups, pet lovers and a local newspaper Hankyoreh are demanding President Moon Jae-in make good on his promise to adopt Tory, a 4-year-old dog, from an animal shelter in Seoul. Tory, a 4-year-old mix-breed dog Moon was sworn in at noon Wednesday after winning the election the previous day. During his 60-day electioneering, the liberal politician, who has one dog and two cats, met with fellow pet lovers and supporters of animal rights groups, vowing to make Korea a better place not just for humans but also animals. Since being saved from slaughter two years ago, Tory has stayed at the shelter, as he was unpopular with would-be adopters. During the meeting, Moon was asked to be its new owner and he had promised then to take it to the presidential residence, if elected. “My family and I anticipate the day to welcome Tory as a new family member and will make sure he adjusts well to the new environment,” Moon said via his camp last week. Moon Jae-in talks with pet owners and supporters of animal rights groups at an animal park in Seoul on April 15. His election pledges on animal welfare included the construction of more playgrounds for pets and feeding facilities for stray cats. On the dog meat trade, however, he stopped short of pledging an immediate and complete ban, saying it should be phased out. Moon’s predecessor Park Geun-hye had kept Korean indigenous Jindo dogs at the presidential residence. She had been criticized for abandoning them when she moved out hurriedly from Cheong Wa Dae following the historical impeachment ruling that removed her from office. After facing criticism, Cheong Wa Dae said it had found new owners for Park’s nine pet dogs.By Kim Da-sol","become korea first dog ,korea first dog mixed ,animal shelter in seoul ,korea first dog ,first dog mixed breed","['South Korea ’s', 'Hankyoreh', 'Moon Jae -', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53788894  0.51260555

Taking a cue from the special occasions, major presidential candidates have set out child-, senior- and family-friendly pledges. Front-runner Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea has vowed to make children happier, emphasizing the importance of play in a country where private education starts years before entering the school system.  Moon Jae-in “ children’s welfare is the first step towards building the welfare of the nation,” the liberal candidate wrote via Facebook. “Children should be able to play freely and safely and grow up happily under the next administration.” Notable among his child-friendly pledges is the once-a-month “no-class days” at elementary and middle schools. On this day, schools are envisioned to hold cultural, arts and outdoor activity programs instead of regular classes. Separately, underprivileged students are to be provided with vouchers for theaters and arts activities. Last month, Moon, who has two adult children, pledged to expand the number of state-run day care centers and kindergartens to account for 40 percent of total children enrolled in such facilities. As for senior-friendly policies, Moon promised to make Parents’ Day a national holiday so that children have time to visit their parents. Moon’s pledges for the elderly include a hike in monthly basic pension payments of 250,000 won , from the current 206,050 won, for those aged 65 or older and in the bottom 70 percent income group by 2020, and 300,000 won from 2021. He also promised to cover 90 percent of medical costs of dementia treatment with the state-run health insurance and reduce the financial burden of dental implants by half.  Ahn Cheol-soo Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party, meanwhile, has promised more state support during the period of pregnancy, delivery and early child care. While, like Moon, promising to expand the public daycare centers, the centrist candidate also envisions monthly cash support of 100,000 won per child for families belonging to the bottom 80 percent income bracket until the child reaches age 11. Earlier in the race, the candidate had put forward a radical education reform plan that envisioned the nation’s mandatory education starting at age 6, one year earlier than currently. Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party has promised a twofold increase in monthly cash benefits for those on parental leave. Currently, parents on child care leave receive 40 percent of their salary with an upper limit set at 1 million won. Hong’s idea is to raise the limits to 80 percent and 2 million won. The candidate also promises a one-time childbirth bonus of 10 million won for families for the second child and doubling the current monthly child care allowances for families with three children.

If you don’t vote, shy-shy-shy.” The familiar tune from K-pop girl group Twice blares from a loudspeaker atop a remodeled truck in a Seoul street, apparently being used for the campaign of presidential candidate Moon. The verse has been rewritten to encourage voters to support the liberal aspirant. A bigger truck, with a makeshift stage, is parked in the middle of a wide street in Uijeongbu, north of Seoul, with a large crowd gathered in front. On the stage, Moon, the candidate for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, gives a speech in a thundering voice. Citizens watch Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea giving a speech on a makeshift stage truck in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, Monday.  The two scenes represent a typical Korean election campaign, not confined to just the particular candidate or this presidential race. And again, many seem to be asking the same question: “What is the point of outdoor canvassing? Is someone actually persuaded by this?”For foreign residents and visitors, in particular, the typical scenes of Korean electioneering appear quite different to those of their home countries, they said.  “I have never seen anything like this before,” Peter Dudek, an English teacher told The Korea Herald on Monday, while taking a video of Moon addressing the citizens of Uijeongbu, north of Seoul, from a campaign truck. His truck speech drew a large crowd of about 15,000 citizens and supporters, creating a scene of a street literally filled with people. “You can never imagine this with a presidential candidate so close on a random street with random crowds in the United States,” Dudek said. Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea bows to his supporters at a canvassing in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. The American, who has lived in Korea for about a year, explained that election campaigns are much more chaotic in the US, with security being of the utmost concern for camps in outdoor canvassing. “The presidential hopefuls usually hold a rally in concert venues and stadiums, with heightened security.”After Moon’s speech, cheerleaders came onto the stage, dancing to familiar and addictive tunes of popular songs to appease the crowd. The April 26 canvassing of Yoo Seong-min, candidate for the conservative splinter Bareun Party, in Seoul’s Hongdae also started off with dances and performances on a remodeled truck, intended to grab the attention of passersby. Yoo Seong-min of splinter conservative Bareun Party campaigns in front of Hongik University subway station in Seoul on Thursday. “The dances are ridiculous,” quipped Paul Venhaus, a tourist from Germany, before asking how the dances and performances were related to the candidates and their elections. “I thought trucks were some kind of an advertisement for a TV program.”“In Germany, election campaigns are usually very dry,” the 24-year-old added, taking a video of Yoo speaking from the truck stage. Nineteen-year-old university student Samantha Cavagnaro said she was surprised to see a presidential candidate waiting to shake hands with passersby near her school entrance. “These people  are so close to the people, it is different from where I come from, New York,” she said. But as for the electioneering trucks with promotional advertisements on them or playing songs with changed lyrics repetitively, she was skeptical if they were effective. Trucks are the favorite choice of campaign vehicles for their great mobility and accessibility to even narrow residential streets, camp officials explained. With just a few days left to the election, the presidential aspirants are on a hectic schedule of electioneering, sometimes visiting more than half of the country’s nine provinces, including the southern Jeju Island, inside 24 hours. A 1-ton truck with light-emitting diode screens costs an average of 30 million won , but expensive ones can cost as much as 100 million won, people familiar with the industry said. Moon reportedly has rented some 300 trucks, while candidate Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party has some 270. For minor candidates, the trucks can pose a financial burden. Yoo, polling last among the five mainstream party-backed candidates, launched a bicycle team to run a cost-effective campaign on their planned budget of 9 billion won.Some Koreans complain that canvassing with trucks, loud music and crowds gathering on busy streets is a nuisance. An average of 200 noise complaints have been made daily to police since the official campaign period begin on April 17. Hong Joon-pyo of conservative Liberty Korea Party appeals for support in Daegu on Wednesday. “It is good that the politicians are trying to reach out to people and communicate, but how they are blocking the road and making such noises is really disturbing,” Lee Hye-jin, 31, said as she walked past an election campaign blocking a crowded subway station exit. “This way of delivering their messages would only arouse antipathy among those who do not support the candidate.” While the current way of outdoor stumping has proved effective in the past, the candidates should come up with new ways to reach out to the voters, in tandem with changing times, according to some pundits. “The truck campaigning is an old style. But I see new approaches this year, with more online content and fresh events being churned out by campaigns,” Sung Youl-hong, an advertising and public relations professor at Hongik University, said.

About 101 Seoul residents gathered at Dongdaemun Design Plaza on Saturday to embark on a mission to find and promote the hidden artistic gems of Seoul.In its second year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens,” will run from April through June.Participants of “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” pose for a photo in Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul, Saturday. The program is part of the municipal government’s efforts to promote lesser-known public art and landmarks in the capital. “This program will be able to enhance the city’s artistic appeal through a greater variety of culture, architecture and street art,” said Byun Seo-yeon, Seoul City’s design policy division head.Participants, ranging from high school students to those in their 70s and with various occupations, presented their plans for promoting the city’s public art. Kim Min-yeob, 32, a freelancer in the art industry, said his group would go out to the streets to discover less charming public art.“There are a number of art pieces considered to be eyesores. Some are randomly installed in the middle of the street without clear context or description. Our group will try to find such pieces and suggest improvements,” said Kim.Another group said it would try to find lesser-known art districts in the capital.“A compound near Hongik University has long been considered an art cluster. But due to gentrification, many of the artists have moved out to settle in adjacent areas like Yeonnam-dong,” said Jeon Ha-rim, a 29-year-old office worker.“Like that, our team would like to discover newly rising artistic areas in the neighborhood so ordinary citizens do not have to travel to enjoy art,” Jeon added.Eleven groups comprising the selected 101 participants are to be joined by field experts and art connoisseurs. Their discoveries are to be shared via the city’s official social media channels.Ahn Kyu-chul, a sculpture and installation artist who also heads consultation for the city’s public art programs, speaks during the starting ceremony of “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” held at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul, Saturday.

They came almost two weeks after a similar phenomenon was reported, the first this year. This photo, taken on April 27, 2017, shows iridescent clouds hanging above Jeju International Airport on South Korea's largest resort island of Jeju. Iridescent clouds are formed by tiny ice crystals or water droplets in the air that cause light to be diffracted ? spread out ? creating a rainbow-like effect. The term comes from Iris, the Greek personification of a rainbow.Iridescence is usually seen in high and mid-level clouds including thin cirrostratus, cirrocumulus and altocumulus clouds.On the island, the fairly uncommon phenomenon was observed for 25 minutes on June 16, 2001, marking its first advent since Jan. 24, 1959, when it was previously spotted.The island had four cases of the phenomenon in 2011, three in 2012, and four in 2013 before it was sighted for 10 minutes on Nov. 19, 2014, and for one hour on April 12 this year.","light was spotted thursday ,jeju island 2nd time ,year jeju spectacular display ,rare rainbow cloud phenomenon ,thursday in the sky","['JEJU', ""South Korea 's"", 'Jeju', 'the Jeju Meteorological Administration']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46853703  0.68584251

The group handed over one of its properties to the Korean military so it can be used as the site for THAAD.Beijing has strenuously opposed the deployment, arguing THAAD's powerful radar could be used to spy on its military and thus would undermine its strategic security interests. Seoul and Washington contend that THAAD only targets a provocative Pyongyang."" visited  to offer encouragement  as we have felt sorry that the group is suffering large damage due to its decision to cooperate with the government's security policy,"" an aide to Hwang told Yonhap News Agency, declining to be named.Hwang toured the building's observation deck and its disaster prevention center.The acting president asked Lotte officials to ensure the safety of visitors and voiced his hopes that the building will emerge as a world-renowned tourist attraction.The country's tallest skyscraper opened to the public on April 3.

Emil Kapaun, a Czech-American war hero who died in captivity during the 1950-53 Korean War Born in a small hamlet in Kansas, Emil Kapaun served as a US military chaplain during the war.In August 1950, Kapaun was awarded the Bronze Star, one of the highest combat decorations in the US military, for rescuing wounded soldiers amidst intense enemy fire.After refusing to leave fellow wounded soldiers, he was captured by Chinese soldiers and died of malnutrition and pneumonia at a North Korean prisoner-of-war camp in May 1951. In 2013, US President Barack Obama decorated Kapaun with a posthumous Medal of Honor, the highest US military award, for his heroism in the three-year conflict. In 1993, Kapaun was declared a ""servant of God"" by the Catholic Church, the first stage on the path to canonization.","korean war berlin music ,tuesday south korean ambassador ,chaplain in korean war ,war berlin music concert ,kapaun czech american priest","['BERLIN', 'Czech', 'Emil Kapaun', 'czech', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'Prague', 'south korean', 'the Czech Republic Moon', 'Olomouc', 'Emil Kapaun', 'Czech']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05545961  0.3614271

Opening part of the “Seoullo 7017” on Tuesday, ahead of the official opening in May, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon on Tuesday described the urban sky park as a place where “nature and humans can live side by side.”Pictured is the Seoul Road 7017 in front of Seoul Station, an overpass that is receiving the final touches for its opening set for May 20, 2017. “ will not only restore the overpass, but become a catalyst for the revival and regeneration of neighboring regions through the high number of visitors,” Seoul Mayor Park said.The pedestrian-friendly park will stretch for about a kilometer and link seven surrounding areas including Seoul Station and Namdaemun Market to 12 pedestrian walkways.Touted as a rival to New York’s High Line Park, the city government said it will feature over 24,085 plants representing 228 species of trees, shrubs and flowers found in and outside Korea.Complementing the plants will be cafes, street markets, flower shops and performance stages, the city said.Officials said the park will provide not only a stretch of greenery, but also a botanical education, allowing citizens to have a closer look at the labeled plants arranged in alphabetical order. The project began four years ago to make use of an old overpass that once served as a major road connecting western and central Seoul. Public calls for its removal had mounted after a safety assessment classified the outdated overpass as dangerous in 2006.The “70” in the name Seoullo 7017 refers to the year 1970 when the Seoul Station flyover was constructed, while 17 is a reference to the number of walkways connected to it and the year 2017 when its construction is to be completed.Pictured is the Seoul Road 7017 in front of Seoul Station, an overpass that is receiving the final touches for its opening set for May 20, 2017. Putting safety as a top priority, about 40 percent of the 59 billion won  of construction cost was put into securing the earthquake-proof structure, the city said. “The elevated urban park was constructed to stand up to a magnitude 6.5 earthquake, and to allow over 50,000 people to walk on the park at once,” said Seoul City official Kim Kwon-ki.A total of 29 surveillance cameras will be installed around the park to enhance security for citizens, he added.The official opening of the Seoullo 7017 is slated for May 20. The lighting ceremony and the celebration chorus will begin at 7 p.m.A variety of events involving citizen participation will take place at Seoullo 7017 and continue until June 18, the city said.

The following is the third installment on Seoul, the nation’s capital. -- Ed.Nearly half of the nation’s 50 million population resides in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province and the number of votes up for grabs here is proportionally great -- roughly 17 million. Like other metropolitan cities of the world, the “greater Seoul area” also boasts diverse communities. Many residents here came from all over the country -- some even from outside the country. For this reason, the regions have often held the deciding vote in elections, with much of the rest of South Korea divided between the liberal west and conservative east. With two weeks left to the May 9 presidential election, it wasn’t easy to see which way this region will vote. Voters that The Korea Herald spoke to were almost evenly divided between Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo, the two front-runners from the liberal and centrist camps. The two front-runners from the centrist and liberal camps, Ahn Cheol-soo and Moon Jae-in Recent regional polls show that Moon of the Democratic Party of Korea has the lead over Ahn of the People’s Party, while Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party is at a distant third place, in line with nationwide results. In the latest Gallup Korea survey, Moon garnered 38 percent of support against Ahn’s 34 percent and Hong’s 9 percent. His nationwide rating was 41 percent, while that of Ahn and Hong were 30 percent and 9 percent, respectively. “I think Moon is the most eligible person to get rid of society’s past wrongdoings and return this country to normal,” said Kim In-pyo who introduced himself as a 26-year-old company worker. Seoul was the hotbed of monthslong anti-government rallies sparked by the sweeping corruption scandal involving former conservative President Park Geun-hye. Kim and many other Moon supporters had joined the massive candlelight protests against Park and now seem to see Moon as the only candidate who can push for a new social paradigm. “Park Geun-hye should strictly be punished and the wrongdoings of the past should be cleared out with a new regime,” Um Joo-yeon, 28, a Yoga teacher living in Seongdong-gu in east Seoul said. “Moon knows it and has the anger needed to lead such action, but Ahn lacks that factor.” More moderate voters, however, showed interest in Ahn, a centrist seeking to appeal to a wider spectrum of voters, even the conservatives. A taxi driver, Park Yoon-sang, 60, said he seeks for a leader who relies less on ideology and more on administering state affairs. “Ahn seems to be an upright and clean figure. I think people want a leader who does not carry a strong political tint,” Park said. “We do not want those with vested rights to take back power. We need a new political paradigm. A fresh new figure should be able to govern the country.”A 70-year-old retiree, who wanted to be identified only by his surname Oh, echoed the view, adding that he wants a “rational” president. Hong Kyung-hee, 57, who voted for Park in the last election, also backed Ahn as a new figure in politics. Her friend who refused to give her name agreed, but pointed out that Ahn also has a weak image.“Though I prefer Ahn  than Moon, I am not so sure about his leadership. I am worried he may be controlled by others,” the Seodaemun-gu resident said. The anti-sentiment against conservative candidates was widely prevalent. Hong and other conservative candidates are far behind Moon and Ahn, polls show. “I support Hong for his conservative policies,” said 26-year-old Lee Won-yul who moved to Seoul from his hometown in Daegu, a conservative stronghold. “He holds strong opinions on national security and he has the highest understanding of market liberalism. He also has the power to restrain the strong labor unions.”Seoul and metropolitan areas have had slightly left-leaning turnouts in past elections -- particularly those held under conservative administrations -- as the busy urban communities have a tendency to seek change, Jun Kye-wan, a political commentator said. “In the past when the race was mainly between liberals and conservatives, it was easier to predict which way voters would vote in this region. Now, it is harder for anyone to say anything about the results since the race is between liberal Moon and centrist Ahn,” Jun explained.By Jo He-rim","election 2017 seoul voters ,seoul voters weigh moon ,2017 seoul voters weigh ,third installment on seoul ,2017 seoul voters","['the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17471191  0.22741613

This photo, released by the Incheon municipal government on April 25, 2017, shows a 17th-century cannon, called ""bullanggi"" and used during the 1392-1910 Joseon Dynasty. The cannon, believed to date back to the dynasty in 1680, has been discovered in the Geonpyeong Fortification on Ganghwa Island, in which repair work was underway. The inscription on the cannon, which is 1.05 meters long and has a caliber of 0.04 meter, revealed that it was one of the 150 bullanggi deployed on the island in February 1680.Bullanggi, introduced to Joseon via China from Europe in the 16th century, quickly became a favorite of the Korean military and stayed that way for a long time. This kind of cannon was much easier to load and fire than the artillery Korea had used up to that point. The fortification was one of 54 that had been built to defend the island in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty since China's Qing Dynasty troops' invasion of Korea in 1636.","century bullanggi cannon unearthed ,incheon municipality said tuesday ,incheon 17th century cannon ,17th century bullanggi cannon ,tuesday the first time","['INCHEON', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Geonpy']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17269145  0.94919646

Hong Joon-pyo , the presidential candidate of the conservative Liberty Korea Party, speaks during a press conference in Wonju, 132 kilometers east of Seoul. His election pledges for the mountainous region focused on enhancing overland, maritime and air transportation infrastructure, which he said will help bolster its tourism and ensure sustainable growth.Hong said he would make the best use of an airport in Yangyang County, some 215 kilometers east of Seoul, to open air travel routes linking the region to China, Japan and Russia. He also proposed promoting a cruise tour program connecting Sokcho in the province to Ulleung Island.The former prosecutor, in addition, pledged to develop maritime leisure programs capitalizing on key tourist attractions such as those in Sokcho, Donghae and Samcheok, and build a national industrial complex specializing in the production of cutting-edge medical equipment.In a message to military draftees and local residents living close to the heavily fortified inter-Korean border, Hong vowed to improve their living conditions by pushing for special legislation specifically designed for them.Hong has ranked a distant third in recent opinion polls with his support ratings boxed in woeful single digits.

Those who participated in the study sessions will be eligible to become the selected 150 participants to run the program.In groups of 10, participants will be joined by field experts and art connoisseurs. Their discoveries will be shared via the city’s official social media channels.Once the field work is complete, the participants will present on their discovery of Seoul’s less known public are and also announce their suggestions on ways to promote Seoul’s art scene.Groups with the most number of public art discoveries or the most innovative idea to improve the public art policies will be awarded. Compared to cities famous for iconic and popular landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty in Manhattan and the 3-ton bronze sculpture Charging Bull on Wall Street, Seoul lacks memorable art and landmarks, city officials say.By Kim Da-sol","seoul city said sunday ,seoul the study sessions ,artistic gems of seoul ,seoul design foundation head ,public art seoul city","['Seoul City', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Kyu - chul', 'Seoul Design Foundation', 'Park Sam - chul', 'Kim Hae - k']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26688367 -0.17701514

Under the slogan ""Fly to Korea,"" the campaign will entail a massive promotion event, including discounts and gift vouchers, to attract individual travelers from Hong Kong, the Korea Tourism Organization said in a statement. The campaign will start March 20, running through the end of June. With about a dozen airlines taking part in the promotion, visitors from Hong Kong who plan to come to Korea between May and September of this year will be given a variety of discount benefits for things that travelers need to rent or buy during a trip, such as Wi-Fi eggs and train passes, it said. Other special treats will include some free accommodation vouchers and complimentary tour bus tickets. The move by the state tourism agency comes amid growing concerns over a rapid fall in Chinese tourists, who accounted for about half of last year's inbound foreigners, after diplomatic relations with China frayed over Seoul's deployment of a US anti-missile system, known as THAAD. South Korea has seen the tally on Chinese visitors drop by more than 30 percent since March 15, when travel agencies in the mainland stopped selling trips to Korea at the behest of the Beijing authorities.In efforts to stave off the sharp drop in Chinese travelers, the local government and related industries have stepped up to secure more individual tourists from Southeast Asia and other neighboring countries. The KTO said it plans to visit Hong Kong later this month to meet with local travel agencies and media there to host a promotion event for Jeju, the country's resort island located off the southern tip, as part of the campaign. Some 92,000 visitors from Hong Kong came to Korea in the first two months of this year, up 11.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the KTO.","south korea state tourism ,tourism agency said wednesday ,woo hong kong tourists ,kong tourists south korea ,promotion event including discounts","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hong Kong', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Hong Kong', 'the Korea Tourism Organization']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36558816  0.44389382

North Korea stages a massive military parade on Oct. 10, 2015, to mark the 70th founding anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea in this photo provided by Japan's Kyodo news service. There have been indications of the North's preparations for a parade ahead of key political events.The communist nation is to celebrate the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, its late founding leader and grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un, on Saturday. North Koreans call the anniversary the Day of Sun.It is also scheduled to commemorate the 85th anniversary of the founding of its army on April 25.""We are keeping close tabs on the possibility of North Korea holding a military parade to mark such an upcoming anniversary,"" Army Col. Roh Jae-cheon, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters.The secretive North has not announced any schedule for a massive parade, which it uses to show off its military prowess and unveil what it claims to be newly developed missiles or other advanced weapons.The North last held its military parade on Oct. 10, 2015, the 70th founding anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.It staged a similar event in 2012 to mark the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth.""It's the only time that North Korea staged a military parade on Kim Il-sung's birth anniversary,"" another South Korean defense official said. ""I think it's more likely to hold such an event this time as a celebration related to the military.""However, the North may be tempted to demonstrate its firepower to the US as early as possible, especially as the US has deployed a host of strategic military assets near the Korean Peninsula.A naval strike group, led by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, is sailing toward Korea.""Whatever comes from the US, we will cope with it. We are fully prepared to handle it,""  North Korea's vice foreign minister Han Song-ryol was quoted as saying in an interview with the Associated Press in Pyongyang.He accused the US of having become ""more viciously aggressive"" under the Donald Trump administration.He warned that the North stands ready to conduct a nuclear test anytime upon the leadership's decision.","pyongyang for military parade ,for massive military parade ,massive military parade under ,massive military parade ,large scale military parade","['North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.39184254  0.68413174

Chinese investors are also big clients in Jeju's property market.South Korea's decision to host a US anti-missile defense system, however, had afflicted the China-led boom, with Beijing forbidding group tour packages to South Korea. The island's tourism business was further hurt by the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014 that killed more than 300 people. Most of the victims were high school students who were on a school trip to Jeju.More than 600,000 students had come to Jeju in 2011 on school trips. The number stayed above 500,000 until the Sewol sinking, after which it dropped to 170,200 in 2014. It picked up somewhat to 257,300 in 2015 and to 242,900 last year.The association said it expects this year's number of student visitors to meet the 2015 level.The tour bus business was already showing signs of recovery, association officials said, with 60 to 70 percent of the buses now in operation. The reservation rate is up more than 20 percent compared to same period last year, they said.Reservation rates at large lodging facilities were also increasing, reaching 50 to 65 percent, officials said.""We have been participating at city and provincial school workshops across the country to promote Jeju and induce school trips,"" an official said.

Selected tigers at the Seoul Zoo will be relocated to a 48,000-square-meter forest designed to simulate a wild tiger habitat. The area, called “Tiger Forest,” is part of the ministry’s 220.1 billion won  project to build Asia’s largest arboretum in North Gyeongsang Province, set to officially open to the public this year.A Siberian tiger residing at Seoul Zoo in Gwacheon Province stares out from a cage. The government plans to pick two or three tigers, including at least one female, for the move, but the exact number, male-to-female ratio and their moving-out date has yet to be announced. A series of medical tests will be conducted on tigers within the zoo to select a healthy batch for the project. The procedure includes a blood test run by animal experts, along with in-depth screening. The supervisors of the process are being extra cautious with the medical test after controversy that followed the death of a male tiger relocated to the reserve from a zoo in Daejeon in April. According to a government report, the animal suffered from a chronic disease that developed into uremia due to the stress of the relocation process three months prior to its death. During the transfer the tigers will be provided a car designed to respect their highly sensitive nature. Temperature and humidity will be controlled inside the cage and the car will travel at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour. After arriving at the forest, the tigers will be given an adjustment period of two to three months and released by the time of the official arboretum’s opening, scheduled to be in either September or October. Safety fences will be installed around the forest for public viewing. Siberian tigers are considered extinct in South Korea, with the last sighting dating back to 1921 in the mountains of North Gyeongsang Province.

The possible test is also likely to be the last before Pyongyang sophisticates its nuclear capability, according to Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute. This photo unveiled by the communist country's Korean Central News Agency on Feb. 13, 2017, shows North Korea's launch of a new type of intermediate-range missile, also known as the Pukguksong-2. ""The possibility of North Korea pushing ahead with a nuclear test before the  anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army on April 25 cannot be ruled out,"" Cheong said in a forum in Seoul.""It is assumed that North Korea would finish sophisticating its nuclear capabilities through the last nuclear test ahead of the launch of a new administration in the South before seeking to mend the fence with the new administration using a nuclear test freeze as a negotiating card,"" he noted. South Korean officials believe North Korea is ready to conduct its sixth nuclear test at any time upon its leader's decision. Since 2006, North Korea has carried out a total of five nuclear tests. Experts said the country may be just a few tests away from achieving a complete nuclear weapon system.On May 9, South Korea will hold an early election to pick a president who will succeed Park Geun-hye after her ouster in March over a massive corruption scandal.Cheong said North Korea may launch a satellite rocket first and then attempt a nuclear test or an intercontinental ballistic missile launch in protest of likely international sanctions and condemnation on the satellite launch.","nuclear test before key ,upgraded nuclear test before ,new gov in seoul ,nuclear test before ,test before key anniversary","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'communist']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.46608904  0.37324455

Despite the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s repeated requests to vacate the space, about 40 pro-Park tents remain clustered in one-third of the area, refusing to yield both to government orders and the Constitutional Court’s decision to expel Park from power.Pro-Park protest tents are pitched on Seoul Plaza in front of City Hall. When The Korea Herald visited the square Friday, the grass in the area had withered and several protesters -- mostly middle-aged or older -- were found in the camp, discussing the “bleak” future of South Korea while eating instant ramen and drinking soju. A loudspeaker announcement claiming Park’s innocence and wishing for her return pierced through the air.“We have slapped the pro-Park protest tents with a fine of 30.3 million won ,” said Chung Sang-taek, chief of general affairs at the Seoul Metropolitan Government, adding that the illegal occupiers have paid just a portion of that fine -- 9.2 million won. “So far they have clearly expressed their reluctance to remove the tents, but we are trying to solve this problem as peacefully as we can.”Located in front of Seoul City Hall, Seoul Plaza is a 6,294-square-meter grassy area frequented by Seoul citizens and tourists due to its proximity to tourist attractions such as Gyeongbokgung and the Myeong-dong district. It is also a venue for major festivals such as the annual Queer Culture Festival in June, South Korea’s largest LGBT parade. A notice has been posted on the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s website, saying that the square is unavailable for use until April 30 due to “unauthorized occupation by some groups.” So far, a total of nine annual spring festivals -- including the Spring Flower Market, Joint Worship for Easter Sunday and Earth Day Festival -- have been canceled, and five festival committees have retracted their applications to hold events there, according to the city officials. Preschoolers take a stroll around the pro-Park protest tents at Seoul Plaza. The problem also extends to issues related to lawn maintenance, as seed sowing in the area has been delayed indefinitely since March 1. Still, Hyun Yoo-jin, a woman in her sixties, who was volunteering as a receptionist for the group of tents, was adamant at remaining in the spot. “We will move out once the tents related to the Sewol ferry are removed,” she told The Korea Herald, referring to a similar tent zone in Gwanghwamun Square, just a few blocks away. “We have a mission to steer the country in the right direction.”A view of Seoul Plaza The Gwanghwamun tent zone, set up shortly after the tragic sinking of the ferry Sewol, considered the worst peacetime maritime disaster in South Korean history, also remains, as of Friday. The government said that out of the 14 tents in the square, only three tents are unregistered and have been regularly paying fines since 2014. The 11 registered tents are being funded by the government upon the request of the Sewol victims’ families. The situation is also drawing complaints from parents and teachers who take children around the area for daily strolls. “A lot of children come out to play around here, but the current environment has cut back the number of visits to the plaza for a lot of schools in the area --  doesn’t seem to have a healthy influence on a child’s mind,” said Choi Eun-young, a 29-year-old teacher at a local preschool in Junggu district, who was chaperoning a group of 10 children Friday.By Jung Min-kyung","40 pro park tents ,about 40 pro park ,annual spring festival lineup ,seoul plaza is illegally ,pro park campers the","['Seoul', 'Seoul Plaza', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'pro - park']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38873687  0.55858207

As a result, the number was dramatically slashed to 38. It remained around 40 throughout the 1970s. In 1980, it dipped again to 29 as the then Chun Doo-hwan government, who succeeded Park through a military coup, put a tighter grip on the media. He merged newspapers critical of his rule. With the democratization in 1987, the freedom of press started taking off, and the number rose again. In 1988, it increased to 65.Online-only newspapers in the country, meanwhile, are estimated to stand at 6,360 as of the end of last year.The data was released to mark Newspaper Day in South Korea.

She said that boosting inter-Korean exchanges will be the first step toward building trust between the rival Koreas.Former President Park Geun-hye unveils a package of proposals calling for bolstering exchanges with North Korea in the German city of Dresden, commonly called ""the Dresden Declaration."" But her proposals aimed at laying the groundwork for unification have lost the limelight as North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile development programs.South Korea's unification ministry said that now is the time to focus on making North Korea reverse the course of pursuing provocative acts by applying strong sanctions and pressure on Pyongyang.""But the government believed that the policy direction sought by the Dresden Declaration is still valid as the proposals called for efforts to boost inter-Korean exchanges and restore national unity,"" a ministry official said.The official expressed regret that inter-Korean exchanges remained tepid due to heightened tensions sparked by North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations.""It is regrettable that the government's efforts to boost exchanges with the North could not bear fruit because of North Korea's two nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches,"" she added.Seoul has suspended almost all civilian inter-Korean exchanges in response to Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in early 2016.North Korea has condemned Park's proposals, saying that they are a push to reunify the countries by force.Park's Dresden speech came under spotlight last year as television network JTBC reported that her long-time confidante Choi Soon-sil allegedly had received and edited drafts of presidential speeches before they were publicly delivered.The ministry rejected the speculation, saying that the main ideas contained in the speech were discussed among officials at the office of foreign affairs and security aides.""They were reported to Park through the usual process of writing a presidential speech,"" the official said.Chang Si-ho, Choi's niece who is also standing trial over the scandal, claimed that Choi also coined Park's iconic phrase about unification.Park made strong pitches for unification, saying that inter-Korean unification would be an economic ""bonanza"" for the two Koreas and a blessing for neighboring countries as it will bring about the chance of massive investments in North Korea.Jailed Chang told a TV program that Choi made the catchphrase with the idea of Park serving as the president of both Koreas after unification.The ministry official rejected Chang's claim, adding that the phrase was picked from the title of a book written by Shinn Chang-min, honorary professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.The scandal led Park to be removed from the presidency in early March.","south korea said tuesday ,third anniversary of park ,2014 proposals on reunification ,city of dresden tuesday ,anniversary of park unveiling","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun', 'german', 'Dresden', 'Park', 'North Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0646049   0.6222927

The structure comes with the new name “Seoullo 7017,” combining the year 1970 when it was first built and 2017 -- when it was remodeled to be a pedestrian-friendly road.The overpass had been used as a major driveway connecting Mapo-gu, western Seoul, and Jung-gu, central Seoul, for 40 years. However, as it deteriorated in the 1990s, citizens strongly called for its removal. In 2006, a safety assessment classified the outdated overpass as dangerous.In 2014, the city of Seoul came up with a basic plan to develop the road into a public park. The next year, it announced the “Seoul Station 7017 Project.”Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon plans to turn the 1.15-kilometer overpass into a rest area and tourist attraction. The city met with local residents and merchants more than 600 times to hear opinions on the renewal of the overpass. It also held an international design competition to receive proposals from the world’s leading designers. The final winner was a Dutch architect named Winy Maas, who put forward a design titled “Seoul Arboretum.”Seoul finalized the design of the project early last year. It kicked off construction in earnest in March last year, repairing existing bridges and roofs and installing trails and landscape facilities.The revamped overpass largely consists of a main and link roads connected to Toegye-ro and Malli-dong Square. A total of 17 newly built pedestrian walkways will lead citizens to major areas of Seoul, such as Yongsan-gu, Jung-gu, Namsan Park and Seoul Station.Seoullo 7017 will be pedestrian-only for all sections, becoming the first car-free street to be constructed on a permanent basis in Seoul.The city plans to designate the overpass as “special pedestrian zone,” covering the 1.7 square kilometer area in Malli-dong and Hoehyeon-dong near Seoul Station. The city plans to remove illegal advertisements and install facilities to slow down passing cars for those who want to walk in the area. The city also expects the refurbished overpass will lead to urban regeneration in underdeveloped areas around Seoul Station.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it aims to build a “walkable community” through the new overpass and surrounding infrastructure in a way that helps the people enjoy walking through all the major historical and cultural attractions. Seoullo 7017 is expected to help Seoul become a more pedestrian-friendly city.By Byun Hee-jin","the newly renovated overpass ,new name seoullo 7017 ,brand new citizen park ,newly renovated overpass ,newly renovated overpass will","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14323805  0.12580454

There are only a handful of such labs currently operating in the world, the center said. At least 24 billion won  has been injected for the new lab project, which officials said would enhance the country’s preparedness for deadly diseases and help local firms’ research for vaccines. In the envisioned lab, experiments on about 20 of the most deadly kinds of human viruses, including Ebola and Lassa fever, will be carried out. Scientists still do not know much about how these diseases spread and have so far failed to develop vaccines. The risk group 4 viruses can kill up to 90 percent of those who contract them and can be passed along by close contact with bodily fluids, perhaps even by a sneeze. Only a handful of doctorate-level scientists, who are trained at BL-4 laboratories in other countries, will have access to the lab to conduct tests, the KCDC said. Cocooned within a submarine-like airtight facility, each room inside the laboratory is equipped with state-of-the art air and sound pressure infrastructure to prevent the spread of virus. Currently, Korea only operates BL-3 labs that handle pathogens in risk group 3, which usually cause serious human or animal disease but do not easily spread by casual contact. The Middle East respiratory syndrome that struck Korea in 2015 belongs to this group. In 2014, a local pharmaceutical company developed an Ebola treatment substance, but had to seek separate research in a US-based lab, due to the lack of facilities here.The authorities, however, have yet to finalize the opening of the lab, as it requires a review of the risks that taking deadly viruses into the country could pose to public safety.By Kim Da-sol","first deadly virus biosafety ,biosafety laboratory south korea ,open first deadly virus ,deadliest of human viruses ,korea to open first","['South Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Osong', 'North Chungcheong Province']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09156999  0.23100546

Since South Korea agreed to host the system last year, China has denounced the move, saying its high-power radar will be used to spy on its military. Lee Hee-beom , president of the organizing committee for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, speaks during a press conference following meetings with the International Olympic Committee's Coordination Commission, chaired by Gunilla Lindberg , on March 15. On Lee's watch, PyeongChang and Beijing, along with Tokyo, host of the 2020 Summer Games, have formed a tripartite cooperative network. At a press conference following the meetings of the International Olympic Committee's Coordination Commission on PyeongChang, Lee said the diplomatic situation hasn't influenced the two's sports cooperation.""I believe the Olympic Games should be operated purely in accordance with the Olympic spirits,"" Lee said at Alpensia Convention Centre in PyeongChang, some 180 kilometers east of Seoul. ""And I think the Olympic Games shouldn't be affected by any external factors.""Lee noted that Beijing has sent ""a large number of delegates to PyeongChang"" during an ongoing series of Olympic test events, so that they could study Winter Games venues closely and learn more about organization and operations of winter sports events. Lee has previously spoken about using some of PyeongChang's Olympic venues as training facilities for those competing at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.""The organizing committees of PyeongChang and Beijing are closely cooperating with each other,"" Lee added. ""And discussions for further bilateral exchanges in the areas of sports and culture are ongoing. I believe many Chinese tourists will visit PyeongChang in 2018.""Aside from the THAAD row, PyeongChang has also had to deal with the political uncertainty at home, in light of the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye.Gunilla Lindberg, head of the IOC's Coordination Commission, said she has been reassured by South Korean political leaders that parties will put aside their differences to fully support the PyeongChang Games. Lindberg has met with Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun during her visit.""All of them assured that independent of what's happening on the political side in Korea, they will fully support PyeongChang 2018,"" she said. ""We have the assurance from the political side and we have trust in Korean politicians.""Lee pointed to the National Assembly's resolutions on PyeongChang, drafted late last year, as evidence of the political parties' willingness to back the first Winter Games in the country.He also said stability will be restored following the presidential election on May 9.""Under the new president, I believe we will have a more stable system in place,"" he said. ""And I believe the PyeongChang Winter Olympics will unite our people again.""Lindberg said PyeongChang will have to ""clarify"" its transportation system and improve its accommodations, but added she's otherwise pleased with the host city's progress.""I am pleased to report that fans and athletes from around the world can expect a unique Winter Olympic experience in PyeongChang,"" she said. ""From the fans' point of view, the Olympics will be mixed with cultural activities. And athletes can expect top-quality venues and fields of play on both snow and ice.""Lindberg said the support of the South Korean public will be ""very important"" for the success of the Olympics, and it's crucial for PyeongChang's organizers to reach out and engage the people.Lee admitted the organizing committee still has work to do to create more excitement about the Olympics, and Lindberg predicted the situation will improve soon once plans for the Olympic torch relay are finalized.""The Olympic torch and the torchbearers' uniforms were unveiled last month, with the torchbearer selection process expected to be launched in the coming months,"" she said.

Following the district office’s redevelopment plan, announced in December, the removal of brothels resumed earlier this month. By 2020, four 65-story luxury residential-commercial complexes and a 42-story shopping mall are to be erected in the 41,586 square meters area, just five minutes’ walk from Cheongnyangni Station. The abandoned houses are left with shattered windows and large red letters spelling out “demolition” written on broken walls. Most sex workers and pimps have already left. Most of the 156 brothels are closed, and now the abandoned houses are left with shattered windows and large red letters spelling out “demolition” written on broken walls. Still, eight shops were in business, refusing to move out, when The Korea Herald visited the area last week. Although only one or two women were sitting in front of the large window doors to attract customers, a stream of middle-aged men approached them. Only few went inside. According to the Dongdaemun District Office, 85 percent of 716 households in the area, including regular shops and residential houses near the red-light street, have completed moving out.The rest are still in negotiation for compensation, the district office said. Cheongnyangni 588 has long been a major cause of complaints for residents and businesses in the neighboring residential and commercial areas, as Cheongnyangni Station develops into a major shopping center. “There is much room for growth because Cheongnyangni Station has served as one of the transportation hubs for Seoul by connecting major bus, railway and subway lines,” a real estate agent near Cheongnyangni Station told The Korea Herald.The redevelopment committee, representing about 130 property owners and tenants, ruled out the possibility of negotiation, saying they have already gone through real estate appraisals for compensation of the land.Developers already started the demolition process in the neighborhood earlier this month, after receiving a court order that allowed them to demolish and evict the defiant tenants and sex workers.Some developers even installed surveillance cameras in the neighborhood to drive the sex business out of the area. Sex trade is illegal in South Korea, with sex workers, their clients and pimps all subject to punishment. A long-time resident and now evictee, surnamed Kim, told The Korea Herald that not enough financial compensation was offered to cover relocation costs. This file photo shows the once thriving brothels in the Cheongnyangni 588 red-light district in Seoul. “The district office and the development committee only agreed to provide 1 million to 1.5 million won  for tenants. But you know, we are paying at least 3 million won per month for rent,” said Kim, who is also a member of the association for the evicted or relocated residents. Yoo Deok-yeol, head of the Dongdaemun District Office, said that there will be “no forced removal“ of tenants and sex workers before the redevelopment construction takes place.Cheongnyangni 588 enjoyed its heyday in the 1980s and ‘90s, hosting over 1,000 sex workers. It was one of the three largest red-light districts in Seoul, along with one in Cheonho-dong in eastern Seoul and Miari in northern Seoul. There are two major theories about where the number 588 came from. Some say it came from the street number of the district, Jeonnong-dong 588, while others point to the number of a bus that passes by the district. But in 2004, an anti-prostitution law made these red-light districts illegal. Since then, the sex business has become more discreet and moved online, reducing demand for brothels like those at Cheongnyangni.According to statistics last year, there are officially 44 red-light districts in Korea. But the numbers are rapidly falling now.Doors of brothels are marked with an “X,” marking it for demolition in the coming months. The Cheongnyangni 588 red-light district is located in Jeonnong-dong, Seoul. In 2010, a brothel area around Yongsan Station in central Seoul was removed for a redevelopment project led by Samsung. Another at Miari in northern Seoul has turned residential. Ones in Cheonho-dong in southeastern Seoul and Yeongdeungpo in southwestern Seoul are rapidly losing customers.Industry workers say the demolition of red-light districts cannot completely root out sex business. “Many sex workers have already left Cheongnyangni 588, but no one really knows where the evicted sex workers have gone,” said an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous.“I heard some went to red-light districts in other parts of the country. Others probably went to find jobs at room salons, karaoke bars and massage parlors that receive reservations only online,” she added.By Kim Da-sol","42 story shopping mall ,northeastern seoul is counting ,2020 four 65 story ,korea infamous red light ,removal of brothels resumed","['Seoul', 'Cheongnya']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40669426  0.31639126

There could arise complex situations in terms of administrative affairs on the South Korean government side,"" Pellerin said of potential impact of the impeachment of Park Geun-hye on the Pyeongchang Olympics. ""But I think it will be successfully hosted as many people are working enthusiastically. South Korean people are hoping for the smooth hosting,"" she said in a press conference at the French Embassy in Seoul. ""Two years ago, Brazil was in the same situation, but hosted its Olympics successfully. Part of my mission is to contribute to the successfully holding of the PyeongChang Olympics,"" she said. In January, Pellerin was named as ""Grand Temoin"" for the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, an international association of 57 French-speaking countries, to oversee the use of the French language and represent the association during the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games.  A major part of her duties as Grand Temoin includes providing support for the translation of PyeongChang Olympics booklets and guidebooks into French as well as hosting cultural events to promote the francophonic society during the Olympics.It is the first time the OIF would sent its Grand Temoin to an Olympics event in South Korea since the organization was established in 2004. ""What is notable is that the Korean experience will become lessons for future Olympics planned in Japan and China ... I think I will be serving the role to bridge between France and Korea,"" the former minister of Korean origin said. Back in France, there has been a sharp increase in French people wanting to study the Korean language thanks to the popularity of Korean pop music and drama, she stressed. ""Last year the number of people studying Korean exceeded the number of those studying Japanese in France,"" she said.The Korean language has also recently been included as one of the foreign language tests for baccalaureat, the French college entrance exam, she said. ""It is really a big change,"" she noted.","2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,pyeongchang winter olympics successfully ,host the 2018 pyeongchang ,success of pyeongchang olympics ,winter olympics successfully regardless","['South Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'French', 'Fleur Pellerin', 'French', 'Fleur Pellerin', 'PyeongChang']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68317497  0.5580793

Students oppose the school's plan to build a new campus in Siheung, south of Seoul. SNU has been embroiled in a fierce in-campus fight since the school signed a contract with the municipal government of Siheung on Aug. 22, 2016, to build a new campus in the Gyeonggi Province city, south of Seoul.SNU officials say the construction of Siheung campus is necessary to house international studies departments and research facilities. But students oppose the project, saying they were not fully consulted.On Saturday, a group of 30 students were forcibly dispersed by school officials and professors after staging a sit-in at the university's headquarters for 150 days in protest of the Siheung campus plan.""The professor who advises the University Newspaper's editorial section demanded minimal coverage of the student protesters' occupation of the school headquarters in the March 13 edition.Instead, he asked for extended coverage of the school's anniversary-related issues,"" a student reporter said.""We protested, but the professor who has strong power over the paper's budget and other operations stepped up pressure.""","page amid campus feud ,seoul student reporters ,university newspaper the student ,feud the university newspaper ,of seoul student reporters","['the University Newspaper', 'Seoul National University', ""South Korea 's"", 'SNU', 'Seoul', 'Korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46292746  0.44871163

With the first ever Winter Olympics in South Korea less than a year away, the Constitutional Court in Seoul unanimously upheld the parliamentary impeachment of Park and permanently removed her from office after a 92-day leadership crisis.This file photo taken on Feb. 5, 2017, shows the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, Gangwon Province. Despite the national challenges, officials at the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games said their only focus is to successfully host the world's biggest winter sports festival next year. ""Even during the impeachment crisis, we were just busy to prepare for the test events and to check our readiness for the PyeongChang Olympics,"" a POCOG official said on the condition of anonymity. ""Regardless of political state, we will just focus on making the Winter Games a success.""The POCOG has been suffering from a corruption scandal involving Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil. Suspicions have persisted that Choi and her relatives have sought to win lucrative contracts related to the Olympics by exploiting her close ties to the president. The scandal hasn't just affected PyeongChang's image. The business community has also been reluctant to open its collective wallet to support the Olympics, with the nation's major corporations also implicated in the scandal. However, as uncertainties clear away, POCOG hopes the new president to give a bump to the Olympics that will be staged in PyeongChang and its nearby sub-host cities, Gangneung and Jeongseon, in Gangwon Province from Feb. 9 to 25 next year. Under the law, South Korea must hold a presidential by-election within two months of the historic verdict, and many expect it to fall on May 9. The Winter Games will be the first major sporting event for the new president to greet sports leaders around the world. The new South Korean president can now take part in both the opening and closing ceremonies of the PyeongChang Olympics. If not impeached, Park could have declared the opening of the Winter Games, as her term ends on Feb. 24, 2018, but that honor will go to her successor. ""We believe that the country's next president will pay more attention to the PyeongChang Olympics,"" a POCOG official said.

In the last few months, many parts of Myeong-dong have been engulfed in the eerie atmosphere. At the height of the tourism boom, the district was filled with foreign tourists, many of whom came from China. The number of Chinese travelers, however, has dropped, stoking fear among shop owners in the posh shopping area, whose rents are the highest in the country. The business community in Myeong-dong and other popular tourist sites in Seoul are bracing for another blast, something worse than a mere drop in the number of Chinese tourists. In retaliation for the deployment of the THAAD system in Korea, the Chinese authorities ordered its travel agencies to stop offering packages to Seoul and other Korean destinations, and the ban is set to take effect on March 15. The staff of cosmetics stores stand idle at the shopping district in Myeong-dong, downtown Seoul. “I’m losing my job, completely out of the blue,” Uhm Sung-won, who worked as a tour guide for Chinese tour groups for five years, told The Korea Herald. “All reservations in March are already canceled. And I’m not prepared to leave.”The current woes in Myeong-dong, sparked by the THAAD deployment, are leaving shop owners with few options while Korea’s political and diplomatic leadership has been crippled with the impeachment trial of President Park Geun-hye over the influence-peddling scandal linked to her confidante Choi Soon-sil and the Samsung Group.The number of Chinese visitors to Korea began to increase in 2013, when it outnumbered visitors from Japan for the first time in history. A wide range of businesses rode the dramatic boom, serving Chinese tourists, encompassing street stalls, lodging facilities, apparel shops, cosmetic stores, restaurants and duty-free shops. But the bubble burst in the second half of 2016, and a severe downdraft is set to hit the district again in a week. “There is no alternative left for us,” said Yoo Ho-ja, who works at a guest house near Myeong-dong subway station. More than 70 percent of visitors to the lodging facility, established in 2014, came from China. Yoo pointed at an abandoned white building in the same block out of a window from her office and said a new hotel is about to appear in the worn-out building. “Although customers are on the decline , more and more hotels are sprouting up around this place,” Yoo said. “If this trend continues, it will be a big concern.”An owner of a Korean barbecue eatery stand, who declined to be identified, said that group travelers from China have been crucial for his business. “Seven out of 10 customers are from the Chinese tour groups,” he said. “And we are about to lose them.”A Lotte duty-free store in Myeong-dong appears emptier than usual. It is usually one of the most crowded spots in the central Seoul shopping zone. It is also feared that the travel ban will impact the duty-free shops in Myeong-dong. Some 70 percent of Lotte Duty Free’s income, the nation’s top duty-free shop operator, is estimated to come from Chinese travelers. Especially in the main branch in Myeong-dong, more than 80 percent of its 3.16 trillion won  of annual sales came from Chinese tourists.“We would have to watch the market for at least a month, since the travel ban has not been implemented yet,” Choi Ji-hyun, PR official of Lotte Duty Free, told The Korea Herald. “But we have to say that we are worried.”Some shop owners in Myeong-dong said their income halved over the past few months. Since mid-2016, the Korean government and the media have denounced China’s action to curb cultural exchanges between the two nations, calling it “retaliation” against the deployment of THAAD in Korea.Gwangjang Market, another spot frequented by Chinese tourists located in Dongdaemun, Seoul, is also bracing for a knock-on effect from China’s travel ban.“Since issues regarding THAAD deployment splashed the headline, things here were quite bad,” Kim Sun-ja, who has been running a Korean blood sausage restaurant for 30 years in Gwangjang Market. “We are losing daytime customers.”“Our sales dropped by half, but it is fair enough for now,” said Ji Young-joon, owner of a nut shop, 80 percent of whose customers are from China. “Still, I am concerned about the future.”Chinese visitors to South Korea at the tourist sites had mixed feelings about the THAAD row. Yi Ling, a Chinese student at Kyung Hee University spotted in Gwangjang Market, said that the THAAD deployment is a “sensitive issue,” but said that travels and the THAAD issue are separate matters.A Chinese part-time employee at a street stand in Myeong-dong, who identified himself only by his surname Liu, said China’s action is normal in terms of seeking national interest. “Every country seeks for its own interest,” Liu said. “China is imposing a travel ban to protect itself. Korea would do the same if it was the other way around.”Life-size figures of the members of boy band EXO are displayed at a shopping alley in Myeong-dong. As China ratchets up its retaliation against Korea over the missile defense system, uncertainty is likely to increase for shop operators. But some owners remain optimistic. “I hope the pain would not last long, because I believe the government will tackle this issue soon,” Yoo at the lodging facility said.Other shop operators said the bitter relationship between Korea and China would soon settle down, as the tourist attraction has weathered a series of troubles over the past decades.“We are not planning to lay off clerks speaking Chinese nor change business tactics,” said Lim Myeong-sun, a shop manager at clothing brand Teenie Weenie that suffered a 40 percent cut in sales recently in Myeong-dong. “Remember, here we are in Myeong-dong.”Kim Hong-chul, selling octopus barbecue at a snack stall in Myeong-dong, is one of those who seeks alternatives on their own. Kim said he began learning new languages to draw more tourists. “I’ve been recently studying languages from Southeastern Asia,” said the 40-something seller, who saw a rapid decline in the number of Chinese customers in the wake of the Lunar New Year’s Day this year. “Customers are changing, so I have to study to prepare for it.”Fewer people are using the information kiosks at the currency exchange desks in Myeong-dong these days, with the number of users dropping sharply. Korea’s central and regional governments vowed to reduce the local tourism industry’s overdependence on Chinese tourists by reaching out to neighboring Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In an emergency meeting held at Seoul City Hall on Tuesday, the Korea Tourism Organization and other tourism-affiliated industries discussed countermeasures against China’s ban on travel to Korea. At the meeting, officials discussed ways to increase the number of Japanese tourists, from 1.2 million last year to 3.5 million this year. In addition, they would focus on drawing in more individual Chinese tourists to fill in the void left by the absence of Chinese group tours. But whether individual Chinese tourists would come remains uncertain, and shop owners are well aware of such uncertainty. “It seems individual Chinese tourists would also refrain from visiting Seoul out of fear that they might be given a penalty,” the tour guide Uhm said.

Residents of Seoul, regardless of their nationality, are eligible to apply for the “Arts on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens” project, which will run from April through June. Participants of last year’s “Arts on Seoul’s streets Found by Citizens” project pose for a photo at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul. The selected 150 participants will undergo mandatory weekly education on public art theories before embarking on a mission to find and promote the hidden artistic gems of Seoul in groups of 10. Each group will be joined by field experts and art connoisseurs. Their discoveries will be shared via the city’s official social media channels.Once the field work is complete, the participants will vote for the most beautiful public art item and will be asked to make suggestions on ways to promote Seoul’s art scene. In its second year, the project is part of the municipal government’s efforts to enhance the city’s artistic appeal through a greater variety of culture, architecture and street art. “We hope Seoul will serve as an artistic city for tourists,” said Byun Tae-soon, Seoul City’s design policy division head. Compared to cities famous for iconic and popular landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty in Manhattan and the 3-ton bronze sculpture Charging Bull on Wall Street, Seoul lacks memorable art and landmarks, city officials say. In 2015, the Seoul Metropolitan Government allocated about 700 million won  to increase the city’s public art assets to make them on par with those around the world. It recently announced a plan to build more landmarks in Seoul, starting with the April opening of an urban sky garden dubbed “Seoul-lo 7017.”Those interested in the Arts on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens project can sign up at http://sculture.seoul.go.kr/archives/78014.

Lee was arrested earlier in the month for alleged bribery related to the merger of two of Samsung's affiliates involving impeached President Park Geun-hye. Lee was indicted Tuesday on a string of charges, including bribery and embezzlement. He has been in custody since last month. The special probe team suspects that Lee gave or promised some 43.3 billion won  in kickbacks to Park's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the government's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. The business merger was seen as critical to the smooth management succession of the group from ailing Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.Four other senior executives at Samsung -- Vice Chairman Choi Gee-sung and President Chang Choong-ki from the group's future planning headquarters and President Park Sang-jin and senior executive Hwang Sung-soo from the electronics giant -- will also undergo trial without detention.It is unclear whether the defendants will appear in court, as it is not mandatory for them to attend a preparatory hearing.","next week seoul court ,trial of samsung heir ,samsung electronics co thursday ,next week seoul ,corruption scandal involving president","['Seoul', ""Samsung Group 's"", 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Electronics Co.']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40597838  0.44120258

Historians estimate there were up to 200,000 victims, mostly from Korea. This photo shows the girl statue outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. In April, the district council of Jongno will seek to pass an amendment to an ordinance to allow the district to designate monuments like the girl statue as public property. Under the amendment, local authorities will have direct control over managing the statue, including repairs.The revision is also expected to make it more difficult to remove the statue at a later date.""To relocate or remove the girl statue, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan will first have to be informed as the main group behind its construction, after which the district's urban space art committee will have to deliberate on it,"" an official said, referring to a civic group that advocates the rights and interests of Koreans victimized by Japan in the early half of the 20th century.Seoul and Tokyo have long locked horns over the sex slavery issue. In 2015, they struck a deal involving an apology from the Japanese government and monetary compensation for the victims, but it was widely rejected by the public.In January, Tokyo recalled its ambassador to Seoul in protest over another girl statue that was erected in front of the Japanese consulate in the southeastern city of Busan.

The city government said it was part of Seoul’s efforts to reduce the number of civil complaints about bad smells by 30 percent by 2018.In June last year, the city government vowed to inject 170 million won  to install malodor reduction devices.Malodor reduction devices, similar to air purification systems, work by injecting oxygen to prevent gas stored inside septic tanks from being released through manholes or inlets on streets. It costs approximately 2 million won to install such a device in a five-story building.By the end of last year, the city government completed installing the devices in areas frequented by visitors and tourists including Gwanghwamun and Myeong-dong.  YonhapMalodor is a major bugbear in metropolitan cities and considered a major form of pollution, along with light and noise.“We aim to continuously work on reducing bad smells in Seoul and create a pleasant living environment for all citizens,” said Kwon Ki-wook from Seoul City Hall’s Water Circulation Safety Bureau.The city will also create a so-called odor pollution city map to allow citizens to view the status of malodor complaints and installation of malodor reduction devices in the capital, Kwon added.In 2003, the government enacted the Malodor Prevention Act and defined malodor as “any odor that causes displeasure and disgust to people by stimulating their olfactory sense with hydrogen sulfide, mercaptane, amines, or other pungent substances.”Facilities that emit malodor can be legally required to pay for the cost of operating public malodor treatment facilities.","seoul steps up battle ,bad smells the seoul ,170 million won 153 ,smells the seoul metropolitan ,battle against bad smells","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52822512  0.29930222

There will be a firework festival in Gangneung this weekend.In August and February next year, concerts by large number of people are scheduled to take place to encourage more public participation. For two months from April, there will be another participatory event, this time with paintings.The ministry also said it will make full use of existing festivals, concerts and exhibitions for the country's cause, including Ansan Street Arts Festival , the World DJ Festival  and the Seoul Street Arts Festival . It plans to ask organizers to showcase Olympics-related themes.Meanwhile, visitors can enjoy and explore Korea's advanced technology in VR  zones and at K-pop hologram concert halls set up in the host city which will open this month and run through March next year. The ministry will work on making it easier for overseas visitors to enjoy Korean art exhibitions and performances during the Olympics period.","korea first winter games ,pyeongchang olympics supporting committee ,pyeongchang cultural olympiad during ,announced thursday detailed plans ,the pyeongchang olympics supporting","[""South Korea 's"", 'PyeongChang', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports', 'the "" PyeongChang Cultural Olympiad', 'the PyeongChang Olympics Supporting Committee', 'Hwang Ky']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32060739  0.47542387

Closing ceremony at the Rio Olympics in Brazil In February last year, the North Korean women's football team was also allowed to travel to Japan for the Olympic qualifying tournament.Japan has imposed the entry ban in light of North Korea's nuclear tests and long-range ballistic missile launches.According to Kyodo's report, the Japanese government will require all North Korean officials accompanying the athletes to submit valid proof of identity and check for any connection with the North Korean military or its ruling Workers' Party.A Japanese foreign ministry official told Kyodo that politics and sports should be kept separate.About 20 athletes and officials have signed up for the Asian Winter Games, according to the Japanese government and the competition organizers.North Korea's joining of the upcoming Asian Winter Games may raise the possibility that Pyongyang could send its athletes to the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea.The South will host the Winter Games in PyeongChang, 180 kilometers east of Seoul and its sub-cities, in February next year.North Korea has yet to express its intent to take part in the upcoming Olympics, but the games' top organizer has said that South Korea will welcome North Korean participation.South Korea's unification ministry said that individual North Korean athletes should first qualify for the Olympics.""Basically, whether North Korea would take part in the games will be handled in accordance with international practices, relevant regulations and procedures,"" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, said at a regular press briefing.""But North Korean athletes will first have to qualify for the Olympics,"" he added.North Korea did not send its athletes to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. In 2010, Pyongyang sent two players in the figure and speed skating competitions to the Winter Games in Vancouver, but failed to win medals.Experts said that North Korea's possible participation in the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics would help ease long-frayed inter-Korean tension which was sparked by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests.With ""Peace Olympics"" being one of the four main pillars for the event, North Korea's possible attendance at the Winter Games would well meet PyeongChang's stated targets, they said.","winter games report japan ,for asian winter games ,let north koreans compete ,asian winter games report ,winter games in sapporo","['Japan', 'north korean', 'Kyodo News', 'Japan', 'North Koreans', 'Sapporo', 'Japan', 'north korean']",19,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.56139296  0.57256567

Vehicles will be banned in such areas and the city government can fine those who drive there -- a first in the country.Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon “ will not only restore the overpass, but become a catalyst for the revival and regeneration of neighboring regions through the high number of visitors,” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said. In 2012, Park pledged to transform the old overpass into a pedestrian park and create more pedestrian-friendly streets in the city, with the aim of boosting neighboring markets and preserving decades-old heritage. Since then, the city has so far established 20 crosswalks, 42 pedestrian-only streets and formed eight pedestrian-only zones, such as Yonsei-ro and Dehak-ro. Eight overpasses are awaiting removal starting this year. Touted as a rival to New York’s High Line Park, the green pedestrian park-turned-overpass Seoul-lo 7017 will stretch for about a kilometer and link seven surrounding areas including Seoul Station, Namdaemun Market and neighboring buildings to some 17 pedestrian walkways that feature 254 types of trees, shrubs and flowers from inside and outside Korea. There will also be performance stages, cafes, a library of plants, flower shops and street markets.The “70” in the name Seoul-lo 7017 refers to the year 1970 when the Seoul Station flyover was constructed, while 17 is a reference to the number of walkways connected to it and the year 2017 when its construction is to be completed.City officials also said it will complete construction in Jongno to extend bus-only lanes and reorganize walkways by the latter half of this year.When this is completed, nearly 2.8 kilometers of road in Jongno will have at least 10 meter-wide bus-only lanes. Ventilation openings and other installations will also be removed from the pedestrian zone.“By building more bus-only lanes and reorganizing the environment for crosswalks, it will be able to provide joy to people who walk in the area and keep traffic convenient for citizens, along with a cleaner townscape,” said Kim Jun-ki, an official from Seoul City’s public safety division.By Kim Da-sol","new garden dubbed seoul ,seoul station flyover ,seoul metropolitan government announced ,planned for seoul ,seoul station flyover to","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul Station', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Jongno']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36174574  0.27615285

Nearly half of all confirmed MERS cases were traced to the SMC. “We organized and presented our opinion to the ministry, but it does not mean that we agree or disagree with the ministry’s order,” the SMC official told the Korea Herald.President Park Geun-hye visits a medical facility during the MERS outbreak in May 2015 A ministry official, however, said a vast part of the documents appear to be intended at refuting the ministry’s view and defending the medical center’s response to the epidemic. The SMC was at the epicenter of the MERS outbreak in 2015. Out of a total of 186 MERS patients in South Korea that year, nearly half were infected either directly or indirectly via the SMC. Some 6,000 people were quarantined nationwide until the nation was declared MERS-free at the end of the year, almost eight months after the first case was reported.   According to the ministry, a patient, later found to be a “super-spreader” of the virus, transmitted the disease to at least 80 people at the SMC, before being diagnosed and quarantined. Critics, however, say both sides are to blame.  “The SMC, which detected the first case, made a serious mistake and failed to prevent the spread of the virus. But it was the ministry’s decision not to reveal to the public the list of hospitals with MERS cases,” said a medical industry insider who wished to be unnamed. During the early stages of the outbreak, the ministry blocked the Korean Hospital Association’s disclosure of a list of hospitals that treated MERS patients, including the SMC, for no clear reason. The ministry later explained that it was to prevent unnecessary public confusion. The SMC is known as one of the finest medical facilities in the country led by a former head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases.The Chairman of Samsung Group Lee Kun-hee has been hospitalized at the SMC, in a 20th-floor VIP room, since he suffered a heart attack in 2014.By Kim Da-sol","virus in 2015 samsung ,korea most prestigious hospital ,in seoul on tuesday ,deadly virus in 2015 ,2015 samsung medical center","['South Korea ’s', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Medical Center', 'Seoul']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03323678  0.47212383

The subjects of the survey -- the first of its kind here -- are 15-year-olds or 16-year-olds who enter eight science high schools here this year. The study will run through 2041 until they reach 40 or 41. “We have analyzed short-term data on the effect of special education for talented students, but have never conducted a follow-up survey for such a long period,” Cho Eui-jung, an administrative official of the Ministry of Education told The Korea Herald.  The Ministry of Education building in Sejong City, South KoreaWith the envisioned research, the ministry aims to analyze the effectiveness of the country’s specialized education programs and how their beneficiaries contribute to the society, she said. Korea introduced special education programs for talented students in 2002, amid growing calls to systematically train and nurture them from the early stage of education. In the first year, the number of students who qualified for special education was about 10,000, 1 percent of all primary, middle and high school students. But the figure had risen tenfold to 109,900 by 2015, according to the ministry data. The special education programs are also under scrutiny, with some saying it promotes private education spending on children by parents who wish to send their kids to the institutes. Others point out that many of the graduates from the programs end up pursuing lucrative jobs rather than further developing their respective special gifts, with many of them entering medical colleges. Among the eight schools subject to the government body’s upcoming long-term survey are the Seoul Science High School and Korea Science Academy of KAIST, an affiliate school of the country’s leading science and engineering university, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The participants of the research will be surveyed for the next 25 years under the consent of their parents, on the development process of their specific talents, external influences that affect the process, their academic achievements in higher education and their careers after college.

And it does not have to be expensive. For Kim Ji-hyon, a 29-year-old office worker, growing a small garden on a windowsill at home has become a crucial part of her life over the past year. “When I water the plants and take care of them, it gives my brain a time-out from stressful office life,” said Kim, who visits wholesale flower markets almost every weekend. “It gives me a sense of achievement and stability that I am successfully growing something.”But there are more practical reasons to turn to indoor gardening, as houseplants make a fantastic addition to almost any interior at affordable prices.“I first bought plants to decorate my house last year. There is nothing like using houseplants as quick decorating tools,” said Kim, who now has some 15 big and small houseplants at home. Health-conscious Koreans are seeking to grow houseplants amid mounting worries over air pollution inside and outside homes, eyeing those that can clean the air indoors, raise the humidity level or reduce harmful effects of radio waves emitted by electronic devices. Lee Sun-mi, a 38-year-old teacher, is one of them.She began to grow plants at home in 2008 after she moved into a house located in front of a garbage incineration facility. Instead of buying electronic air purifiers, she put houseplants in her house to cleanse the air of pollutants, dusts and allergen in sealed environments.The home of Lee Sun-mi “As I have gotten more plants at home, I am less worried about the sick building syndrome and my nasal inflammation got much better, too,” said Lee, who has spent more than 1 million won so far creating her own indoor garden. “By looking at the plants bud and bloom, I also get mentally more stable.”The sick building syndrome is a phenomenon that affects building occupants who claim to experience acute health effects apparently linked to time spent indoors. Air pollution indoors is also known to heighten the risks of heart diseases, cancer and breathing problems, and numerous studies show the benefits of growing plants for human health. According to a 1989 Clean Air Study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, plants are effective at removing toxins from the air and alleviating the sick building syndrome associated with new, energy-efficient buildings. “The plant root-soil zone appears to be the most effective area for removing volatile organic chemicals. Therefore, maximizing air exposure to the plant root-soil area should be considered when placing plants in buildings for best air filtration,” the study said. Reflecting the health-conscious trend, Sanseveria Stuckyi and tillandsia, known to remove indoor pollutants, have been best-selling items for the past year in the country, a flower shop owner said.  Namdaemun Flower Market in central Seoul “As many Koreans keep their doors shut and live with indoor pollutants, they come to buy plants that can clean the air without much effort,” said Bang Min-hwa, who is in her 50s and runs the shop in Namdaemun Flower Market in central Seoul. “The plants are popular particularly among the young generation. Most of them seek houseplants that are hard to kill, easy to grow indoors and are not in need of much sunlight or water,” she added. A culture critic, Ha Jae-keun, said the growing trend of indoor gardening is attributed to Koreans in search of relaxation from the competitive urban life and rising interest in pursuing an eco-friendly life. “South Koreans started to rediscover the value of nature in search of healing and consolation as they got busier and mentally exhausted,” he said. “The increasing number of single households also contributes to the trend as they take more interest in doing something inside their homes such as decorating their homes and sharing such tips with others online.”By Ock Hyun-ju","life indoor gardening connects ,old office worker growing ,gardening connects city dwellers ,indoor gardening connects city ,city life indoor gardening",['Kim Ji - hyon'],19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3700155   0.03406157

They are almost identical, risk-free to a degree that it is almost no fun and they are not as often used as they should be by their target audience -- kids. “Children not only have the right to learn. They also have right to play,” the 57-year-old play advocate stressed during an interview with The Korea Herald. Pyun Hae-moon sits on a giant slide created with wooden boards by his children in front of his house in Andong. Aside from the problems of playground design, Korean kids are too busy to play, spending more time being transported by yellow minibuses from one hagwon to another until their parents get home in the evening. They are also more interested in computer games and mobile phone chatting than outdoor play, Pyun lamented. Korean kids do lead a busy life, a recent survey showed. More than 83 percent of 5-year-olds and 36 percent of 2-year-olds in South Korea receive private education, either by going to a hagwon or home tutoring. In some cases, 5-year-olds receive up to four hours of extra classes a day after their regular kindergarten program, revealed data released earlier this week by the Korea Institute of Child Care. A children’s book author and child education expert, Pyun has studied for the past 20 years the importance of play for children’s development and to create an ideal playground for them. To look for ideas, he traveled to many cities including Berlin, London and Tokyo. In his opinion, a playground should be a place where children have fun, learn how to make friends and freely explore the world. “Adults, specifically public officials, design and construct playgrounds in towns without a single chance of hearing children’s opinions. Isn’t it ironical that the main users of playgrounds are not ever heard?” Pyun asked.He also pointed out the problem of playground standardization in Korea. “Playgrounds should be for all children from kindergarten age to elementary school age. But as you can see, playgrounds in Korea look like they are just for kindergarten kids,” he said.In May last year, he made the maiden step toward his long-held goal of presenting kids with an alternative playground.His first “Miracle Playground,” in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, bears no similarity to the ones already existing. It has no swings, seesaws or slides. Instead of rubber turf, which has become almost a norm for Korean playgrounds, the ground is filled with sand or covered with grass. Tree trunks and stones resemble how they would look in the wild. Children can climb and jump on them, strip a bark off a tree or even just roll down a grassy hill.An artist’s rendering of the Miracle Playground in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province. Since its opening, an average of 2,000 children and parents have visited the playground each week. In October, it was given an award for the country’s best public construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, for its creative and eco-friendly design.“Miracle Playground serves to allow children to play creatively and nurture the spirit of adventure, unlike normal playgrounds which all look the same,” said Pyun.He plans to build 10 more of them over the next five years. No risk, no fun When Pyun visited Northern European countries, he found that playgrounds there not only had varying designs and different kinds and sizes of play equipment, but they are frequented by fathers who bring their children out to play.“These fathers are called ‘Latte Papa,’ as they bring a cup of coffee and just wait until their children are done with playing, unlike in South Korea where mothers stick to their kids to teach them how to use the slide and where to step on the climbing wall,” he said. Pyun criticized many Korean parents as overly protective. Without realizing it, they often block their kids from any chance of exploring their world freely and nurturing an adventurous spirit. “Korean parents are typically very worried about all sorts of potential risks outside. But public playgrounds are the best place for children to learn about risks, like how to detect and overcome risks,” he said, stressing that children grow by experiencing healthy risks. Risks are different from hazards, he went on. “Risks are like passing through a shaking bridge and hazards are broken glass pieces on the ground. But parents sometimes mistake the two.” By crossing shaky bridges at playgrounds, children can learn to ask themselves, “Will it be safe to cross this bridge?” and learn to hold onto something that is stable. In European countries, such as the UK, playgrounds are required to include pre-designed “risk items,” Pyun said. The boom in such playgrounds started in the mid-1940s in Europe and 1970s in Japan, while the number of adventurous playgrounds around the globe has surged to over 1,300, mostly in Europe.Following the trend growing outside Korea, the Seoul Metropolitan Government for the first time in Seoul began test operating a new type of public playground called Adventure Park -- filled with wooden poles and hills -- in a Northeastern town in Dobong-gu last week.Just let them play freely Korean parents also need to redefine children’s play, said Pyun who has authored books on the topic including “Play is Food for Children.” Quoting Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, he said that parents should not approach children’s play with a certain purpose. Letting children play is not about helping them release mental stress or becoming smarter, more creative or any certain type of person. “It is rather a concept of freedom for children,” said Pyun, who is himself a father of two children. Many young parents trying to be “good parents” feel obliged to take their kids out to fun places and allow them to have educational experiences, such as amusement parks, exhibition halls and aquariums. “Remember that children do not find it fun only when they visit amusement parks or theme parks. Parents do not need to visit or create special spaces for playing, as children simply mimicking their mother’s cooking in the kitchen could become a good play activity for them.” The No. 1 virtue for parents in Korea is a sense of balance, not to be easily tempted to buy expensive new toys for their kids or send them to hagwon, simply because many others parents do. “Children learn at each and every stage of life what joy is and what fun is. It is important for parents to let them fully experience all these stages through unstructured play, especially when they are young.” Pyun’s wife Park Bo-young, who was also present at the interview, added, “As a mother, I also find myself controlling my children from A to Z. I think it is partly because I never got to know the freedom of play when I was a child.” “Now I am a parent, but I am still learning how to communicate with children, nurture inner balance in them and help them experience freedom through play,” the cartoonist added.By Kim Da-sol","abundant supply korean playgrounds ,korean playgrounds have major ,60 000 playgrounds for ,over 60 000 playgrounds ,000 24 hour retailers","['North Gyeongsang Province', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3990598   0.45376617

Paekdu bloodline in the reclusive country, which helps reinforce the legitimacy of the family's three-generation succession. Kim Jong-un assumed power in late 2011 after the sudden death of his father who ruled the regime for nearly 20 years since 1994.  Kim Jong-un North Korea is set to celebrate key anniversaries that could highlight the personality cult of the three Kims. The 105th anniversary of the late founder's birthday falls on April 15 and late former leader Kim Jong-il's 75th birthday is Feb. 16. This year also marks the fifth anniversary of the current leader's election to the heads of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea and the now-defunct state organ National Defense Commission. Pyongyang watchers said the North's projects appear to be aimed at elevating the current leader to a level on par with his late father and grandfather to maximize his idolization. Last year, Kim Jong-un reaffirmed his unfettered rule by holding a rare party congress and a key parliamentary meeting. At the gatherings, he was elected as the WPK's chairman and chairman of the newly-created State Affairs Commission.","announced on sunday ,late founder kim il ,2017 to extol kim ,sung family at mount ,was announced on sunday","['North Korea', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'Kor']",19,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.16641141  0.91344017

365,365,Korea calls for 'wisdom' on appropriate site for girl statue,"South Korea on Tuesday urged relevant parties to gather ""wisdom"" to find an appropriate site for a statue recently erected before Japan's consulate despite strong opposition from Tokyo. Last month, a civic group placed the girl's statue symbolizing Japan's wartime sexual slavery in front of its consulate in the country's southern port city of Busan.

A local district office had rejected the civic group's request to place the statue but later allowed its installment in the face of a strong public outcry. The statue, the second of its kind that stands near Japan's missions in Korea, has prompted a serious diplomatic row. Demanding its immediate removal, Tokyo recently recalled its ambassador and consul general in Busan, a rare move aimed at voicing its strong displeasure.  `Comfort women` statue in front of the Japanese Consulate building in Busan ""We hope that the government, municipality and civic officials gather wisdom on an appropriate site that can protect the diplomatic mission, reflect international courtesy and practices while at the same time making the comfort women issue a valuable historic lesson,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told reporters.  ""Our stance is that it's important to respect the purpose and spirit of the deal reached between the two countries late in 2015... and fully implement what was agreed upon. The government, for its part, is making efforts in that sense,"" he added.  Japan's enslavement of women in front-line brothels during World War II has been a major source of a long-standing diplomatic rift between the two neighboring countries. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops. In December 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a deal and promised to resolve the issue once and for all. Under the deal, Tokyo expressed an apology and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation aimed at supporting its surviving victims, euphemistically called comfort women. Tokyo has claimed that removing a comfort women statue standing in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul is part of the deal and that installing yet another in Busan is a violation of the agreement.  Seoul has said that it will make efforts to produce a ""proper resolution"" on the matter but noted that it doesn't have any authority to remove the statues, which were built by civic groups.  Some politicians, potential presidential candidates, civic groups and victims are demanding renegotiation of the deal as they see it as insufficient and lacking public consensus when it was reached.","south korea on tuesday ,girl statue south korea ,tokyo last month civic ,girl statue symbolizing japan ,korea on tuesday urged","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Busan']",19,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01935404 0.35724074 0.00571406],KH디지털2,Foreign  Affairs,1,2017,"south korea on tuesday urged ,opposition from tokyo last month ,girl statue symbolizing japan wartime ,tokyo last month civic group ,south korea on tuesday","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Busan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Busan', 'Busan', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Cho June - hyuck', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Seoul']",2,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01935404 0.35724074 0.00571406]
366,366,Seoul faces dilemma over ‘comfort women’ statue in Busan,"Seoul’s dilemma is intensifying over a newly installed “comfort women” statue in Busan, as government efforts to relocate it stumbled amid citizens’ frenzied resistance while Tokyo stages a strong protest. The memorial was initially put up on Dec. 28 on a sidewalk near the Japanese consulate in the port city, in a display of resistance toward a settlement on the sex slavery dispute reached precisely one year ago...","Seoul’s dilemma is intensifying over a newly installed “comfort women” statue in Busan, as government efforts to relocate it stumbled amid citizens’ frenzied resistance while Tokyo stages a strong protest. The memorial was initially put up on Dec. 28 on a sidewalk near the Japanese consulate in the port city, in a display of resistance toward a settlement on the sex slavery dispute reached precisely one year ago.  `Comfort women` statue installed near Japanese consulate in Busan The police removed the statue after a local district office raised issue with the organizers’ failure to seek permission. Yet as images and videos of authorities taking down the bronze, life-size sculpture of a girl in a traditional hanbok dress spread over social networks, the office was swamped with visits and calls from angry residents and other citizens across the country. Its website was paralyzed within a few hours.   Caving to pressure, District Mayor Park Sam-seok held a news conference two days later, allowing the monument’s reinstatement and apologizing for the withdrawal and aggressive dispersion of the activists. Youth Make Peace, a civic group that leads the campaign, put it back in place and held an official launch ceremony Saturday. “This is an affair between the two countries, but as head of a local government, it’s become too much for me to handle,” Park said. The consulate lodged a strong complaint and requested a removal to the Busan city government. In Tokyo, Vice Foreign Minister Shinsuke Sugiyama reportedly phoned South Korea’s Ambassador Lee Joon-gyu, calling the statue’s erection “extremely regrettable” and urging its immediate elimination. Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Yasumasa Nagamine also protested Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam. The girl statue has been a perennial source of contention between the two countries. The Busan memorial is the second to be installed in front of a Japanese diplomatic mission, following the one near the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, and there are 37 others around the country. Tokyo argues the statue’s erection breaches the 1961 Vienna Convention that defines the framework of diplomatic relations. It calls for host countries to take “all appropriate steps” to protect the premises of diplomatic missions “against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity.” Under the Dec. 28, 2015 settlement, Seoul promised to work to “properly resolve” the issue through consultations with related organizations. With the steadfast Busan district office and citizens, the Foreign Ministry is struggling to find a solution, prompting criticism for passing the buck to local governments. “This is basically an issue that should be dealt with by related institutions according to law,” ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said at a news briefing Tuesday. “However, our position is that it needs a prudent decision from the aspect of international protocol and customs regarding the protection of diplomatic relations.” The issue may have greater implications ahead of a presidential election in South Korea this year.  After years of historical tension, the two old foes have been mending their forces since the accord, building on momentum to clinch another sensitive pact on sharing military intelligence last month. Yet many citizens and opposition parties remain resistant to the sex slavery deal, due to the government’s failure to consult in advance with the victims and the controversial clause on the statue.Presidential contenders -- both from the conservative and opposition camps -- see the initiative as President Park Geun-hye’s legacy, seeking to overturn or renegotiate it in the new government. In a Dec. 28 poll by Realmeter, about 59 percent of the 525 respondents said the agreement should be revoked, whereas 25.5 percent said it needs to be sustained. “Given the Vienna Convention’s broad interpretations, it’s a matter of implementation, and depends more on domestic law and local government ordinances,” a ministry official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. “We’re not against the statue’s existence -- it is part of history that must be remembered and preserved -- but we see that it can stay in a better environment with greater access, such as at a park nearby. But with the unmoving district office, we are trying to come up with other solutions.”By Shin Hyon-hee","tokyo stages strong protest ,frenzied resistance while tokyo ,seoul faces dilemma over ,resistance while tokyo stages ,women statue in busan","['Seoul', 'Busan', 'Tokyo', 'japanese']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49130744  0.09645918

We need to build a new country through political, economic and social innovations,” Park wrote via Facebook. “I have decided to follow the call of the time and devote myself to the innovation of South Korea.”A civil rights lawyer-turned-activist-turned administrator, Park has been the mayor of Seoul since 2011, a post once considered a springboard to the presidency. Previous President Lee Myung-bak was Seoul mayor before he was elected to the nation’s highest office in 2007. Park is a member of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and had last week signaled his intention to seek the party’s presidential nomination.In polls on the Democratic Party’s potential presidential candidates, he lags behind Moon Jae-in, the party’s former leader, and Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung. Neither of those two have declared their intentions. “The 2017 presidential race must be a competition among candidates who can present visions for the new era,” Park said.“I have always dreamed of a new era with people and lived a life for it. I have always showed it through actions,” he added, presenting himself as a strong candidate with ample experience.
