UNSC Resolution 2375, adopted in September, bans member countries from ship-to-ship transfer of any goods for North Korea. Resolution 2397, adopted just a week earlier allows a country to capture and look into a vessel suspected of engaging in prohibited activities with North Korea.  This composite photo of oil transfer between China and North Korea is captured from the website of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Hong Kong-flagged ship was chartered by Taiwanese company Billions Bunker Group and previously visited South Korea's Yeosu Port on Oct. 11 to load up on Japanese refined petroleum and head to its claimed destination in Taiwan four days later, the authorities noted. Instead of going to Taiwan, however, the vessel transferred the oil to a North Korean ship, the Sam Jong 2, and three other non-North Korean vessels in international waters in the East China Sea, they said. ""The actions taken will be reported to the UNSC sanctions committee on North Korea in the future,"" according to the authorities. ""This marks a typical case of North Korea shrewdly circumventing UNSC sanctions by using its illegal networks."" The officials said South Korea has shared intelligence with the US for the detection of the illegal transaction.In their search of the seized vessel, South Korean authorities secured navigation logs and testimony from the crew that the oil transaction was ordered by the Taiwanese group through the vessel's caption. But motive of the transaction with North Korea is not known, the officials noted. South Korea will be keeping the Hong Kong-flagged vessel for about six months, during which time Hong Kong is expected to file a request for the ship's release with the UNSC's sanctions committee on North Korea. The US has reportedly called on the UNSC to blacklist 10 ships for engaging in proscribed trade with North Korea although China and Russia are opposed to that. Lighthouse Winmore was reportedly one of the 10 targeted ships. The Security Council sanctions committee will make a decision on the request on Friday , according to the officials.","korean authorities after secretly transferring ,transferring oil to north korean ,seized vessel south korean authorities ,friday south korean customs authorities ,the seized vessel south korean","['Hong Kong', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'south korean', 'Lighthouse Winmore', 'north korean', 'UNSC Resolution 2375', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'the U.S. Department', 'Treasury', 'Hong Kong', 'taiwanese', 'Billions Bunker Group', ""South Korea 's"", 'japanese', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'UNSC', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'UNSC', 'South Korea', 'US', 'south korean', 'taiwanese', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Hong Kong', 'Hong Kong', 'UNSC', 'North Korea', 'US', 'UNSC', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Winmore']",14,"[ 4.          3.          4.         ... -0.4323661   0.27097607

Korea sent troops to Vietnam during its civil war in an effort to push the communists back. There have been voices, both domestic and international, calling for the Korean government to recognize and apologize for the massacres of Vietnamese civilians by its troops, during the war.  Yoon Mi-hyang, chairman of the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, stands in front of the Vietnam Embassy in Seoul, apologizing for massacres and sexual violence committed by Korean troops during the Vietnam War. A 72-year-old veteran recounted on an incident through an interview with a local media outlet No Cut News, confessing that his military unit killed local civilians, unable to differentiate them with Viet Cong guerrillas, also known as Vietnamese communists.According to his testimony, some of the soldiers were unexpectedly shot and killed while approaching a village. The surviving members called up around 20 villagers and questioned them. Unable to find the evidence nor successfully communicate with them, the platoon leader shot three male adults, out of fear that the unit might be attacked again. The veteran explained that in almost every operation, the military killed some civilians, mistaking them for the enemy. He denied any deliberate massacre. Saying that he has lived the past 50 years in regret and sorrow, the veteran argued that the Korean government must officially apologize to the people of Vietnam.

In the past five years, as many as 100 law enforcement officers have killed themselves, 27 percent more than the 79 who died while on duty during the same period. Last year alone, 26 took their own lives, up 44 percent from 18 in 2012. Nearly half of the deaths were linked to work-related stress, according to the Korean National Police Agency. Police authorities and society at large should promote better understanding of mental illnesses and provide effective ways to seek help, a police officer who attempted suicide a few years ago said. “It’s just the nature of our job that we experience traumatic events while on duty. And many police officers have or are at risk of serious mental health crisis,” the senior police officer -- who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to talk to the media -- told The Korea Herald. After responding to several suicide cases, the officer said he was haunted by the faces of the victims. In addition, a sense of failure for not preventing them from taking their lives before he arrived on the scene led to insomnia and suicidal thoughts for quite some time.“One of the suicide victims was my daughter’s age. I simply wasn’t prepared for that kind of traumatic experience, and was left with nowhere to go for emotional support,” the officer said. “It’s still hard for me to talk about it, even several years later,” he said.As of 2016, South Korea, a country of 51 million, has 114,658 police officers. There are six counseling centers serving police officers, designed to provide free medical treatment and psychological counseling. By next year, nine such centers will be in place and three additional centers are scheduled to open each year until 2021, according to the Korean National Police Agency. Apart from insufficient mental health services available for police officers, many delay or avoid treatment at the centers out of fear that they might be discriminated against or misunderstood by colleagues, according to the officer. “They say medical records are kept secret, but sooner or later we find out who received what treatment and why. The fact that one needs psychological treatment is seen as a sign of weakness in a heavily male-oriented culture. So we find a way to get expensive therapy elsewhere at private hospitals and pay out of our own pocket,” he said. Hope for changeIn June, the police reform committee, an independent body of civilian experts, was launched. Several months later, the committee recommended the establishment of a labor union-like workplace council in police stations to help guarantee the basic labor rights of lower-level officers. By law, police are banned from forming a labor union.Separately, the National Assembly increased next year’s budget for police welfare by 3.6 percent. In October, the committee announced a set of reform proposals for the police force, including the improvement of working conditions, such as frequent day-night shifts. It highlighted that the average lifespan of police officers is much shorter than those of people with other jobs.“Around 80 percent of police officers overwork, along with working on night shifts, while most work more than 40 hours a week on average,” the committee said in a report.A legislative bill pending at the National Assembly would allow law enforcement officers and firefighters to establish a workplace council, one of President Moon Jae-in’s pledges. During the annual Police Day ceremony in October, Moon said that police officers “should not be forced to make sacrifices.” He promised to hire 20,000 additional police officers before his five-year term ends in May 2022, as well as increase state support and improve working conditions. The workplace council will not immediately alleviate work-related stress. But it would create a safe place for low-ranking officers to talk about topics previously taboo in the highly hierarchical police force, experts predict. Not everyone is sympathetic toward the country’s police force, as the police are often deemed overly politicized and associated with the excessive use of force. On Nov. 14, 2015, police fired a water cannon toward the public during a street protest against former President Park Geun-hye. Activist farmer Baek Nam-ki was struck by the blast and died of a cerebral hemorrhage after 10 months in a comatose state.Baek’s death prompted a public outcry. Shortly after Moon took office, the head of the National Police Agency Lee Cheol-seong apologized for Baek’s death, promising to restrict the use of water cannons and ensure the right to peaceful assembly.Sweeping reform is necessary from the top down to ensure a democratic police system and regain public trust, experts say.“Police authorities and society should make sure that the police can continue to play a central role in the law enforcement system, which is to serve the public’s best interests. And the responsibility should not only be on police officers alone,” Kwack Dae-gyung, a professor of police administration at Dongguk University, told The Korea Herald.By Bak Se-hwan","hire 20 000 additional police ,several suicide cases the officer ,percent of police officers overwork ,officers have killed themselves 27 ,14 2015 police fired water","['the Korean National Police Agency', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Korea', 'the Korean National Police Agency', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Park Geun', 'Baek Nam - ki', 'Moon', 'the National Police Agency', 'Lee Cheol - seong', 'Baek ’s', 'Kwack Dae - gyung', 'Dongguk University', 'the Korea Herald', 'Bak Se - hwan']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26467687  0.2655986

Song Shin-do died at the age of 95, in Tokyo Prefecture, the Seoul-based foundation that deals with the issue said. Song, originally from South Chungcheong Province, was forcibly taken to China by the Japanese military to serve at a brothel during the World War II in 1938, when she was 16.  This photo dated Aug. 13, 2011, shows Song Shin-do, a Korean victim of Japan`s wartime sexual slavery. After the war ended, she moved to Japan in 1946 with a Japanese soldier with whom she was in a relationship, but the man left her later, according to the foundation. She has since lived in Japan with her Korean-Japanese partner. She is known for her active legal fight against the Japanese government over the wartime crime. She was the first and only victim so far living in Japan who has filed a damages suit against the Japanese government, although her decade-long court battle ended up in a loss at the highest court.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during wartime.In December 2015, Seoul and Tokyo reached a deal to resolve the issue, in which Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation aimed at supporting the victims.But critics in Seoul called for the repeal of the deal citing the lack of consensus from the victims and Japan's refusal to recognize its legal responsibility for their forced mobilization.","elderly korean victim of japan ,slavery passed away on saturday ,japan wartime sexual slavery passed ,japan wartime sexual slavery after ,wartime in december 2015 seoul","['korean', 'Japan', 'Song Shin - do', 'Tokyo Prefecture', 'Seoul', 'song', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'China', 'japanese', 'Song Shin - do', 'korean', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'korean - japanese', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73315495  0.25256151

Perhaps, some still remember a breathtaking triumph of a Ukrainian athlete Sehii Bubka at 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Those into football probably know Andrii Shevchenko, a “Golden Ball” winner and legendary striker for Milan and Chelsea. Some Koreans probably think of Ukraine as a mysterious country in Europe, with the most beautiful women in the world. Of course, there is a lot more to Ukraine waiting for Korean people to discover. Take, for example, Ukrainians’ constant aspirations to reach far beyond Earth. Starting with George Gamow, born in Odesa, who proposed a physical model of the Universe origins known as the “Big Bang,” and continuing with a first turbo-jet engine that was developed by a Ukrainian scientist Arkhip Lyulka from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Ukraine has always been at the forefront of the world’s most cutting-edge airplane and space program efforts. Everyone in the world knows about a titanic Antonov‑225 Mriya airplane, originally developed for the space program. The airplane can lift record-breaking 253,800 kg and is nowadays used for super heavy cargo transportation.Another Ukrainian who truly deserves recognition as a front-runner of human space exploration is Sergei Korolev. Born and grew up in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, Korolev is sometimes referred to as the “father of modern astronautics.” He engineered and made possible the launch of the first satellite Sputnik, as well as the first human being in space.Down on Earth, Ukrainians worked hard to advance humanity into technological era. Numerous fundamental discoveries in physics, mathematics, medicine, electronics have been made by Ukrainian scientists. Ukrainians have pioneered in computers industry, both hardware and software. MESM, the first computer in Europe, was built in Kyiv in 1948. As computers became more popular, Ukrainians made technology more accessible for people. For example, Ukrainian company PocketBook is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of electronic readers based on the E Ink  technology. World-famous software companies, such as PayPal and WhatsApp, and many others, have Ukraine-born founders.But what if we turn around, and explore what does an average Ukrainian know about Korea? One of Four Asian Tigers, the Miracle on Han River, the home of world-famous innovators such as Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and global events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup and Winter Olympics 2018. Perhaps, considering that Ukraine’s national football team did not qualify for 2018 FIFA World Cup, many Ukrainians will cheer for the Korean national team. Ukrainians welcome and enjoy Korean traditional culture, its food, music, fashion and architecture. Popular Korean restaurants in Kyiv serve authentic Korean food and drinks. K-Pop stars visit Kyiv for concerts, gathering huge crowds. Ukrainian TV channels broadcast Korean drama for Ukraine’s 45 million strong audience. Kyiv residents spend their weekends at a recently opened Korean traditional garden, immersing themselves into a Korean spirit.Ukrainians know that the advances of Korean society are hard-earned. Thanks to the unbreakable spirit of the Korean people, the country could fight Japanese occupation and communists, rising from the ashes of Korean War into one of the most developed countries in the world. Ukrainian people can relate to Korea, because they also suffered from occupation by its powerful neighbor. Korean media have echoed the news from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. The government of the Republic of Korea expressed serious concerns over these developments in Ukraine, and stated that Korea will not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea .Clearly, in the age of information technology warfare, the so-called “hybrid wars,” it requires insurmountable amount of efforts and collective stand up to the aggressor. Take, for example, the spread of “fake news.”Everybody knows that Yuzhnoye design office and Yuzhmash, world’s leading manufacturers of space rockets, are in a full compliance with the Missile Technology Control Regime. The companies have a long standing and well-documented history of directly supporting the US government efforts in non-proliferation since the 90’s. Also, the European Vega light-class launch vehicle was made in Ukraine, and was successfully launched from the Kourou Space Centre  on Aug. 2 delivering two satellites for the Israel Aerospace Industries into orbits. Since the Vega program began, Ukraine has helped deliver 25 satellites into space, for 19 customers. In fact, just on Nov. 12, Yuzhnoye and Yuzhmash helped launch a modernized launcher “Antares” from the Space Flight Facility on the Wallops Island, Virginia, successfully delivering cargo to the International Space Station. Twenty-five years ago, in 1992, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea was opened in Kyiv. Soon after, the Embassy of Ukraine began its activities in Seoul. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our states, we have made considerable efforts to build deep cooperation in areas of mutual interest.Air and SpaceAs already mentioned, Ukraine is famous for its aerospace engineering industry, as it possesses a full cycle of aerospace hardware engineering and production. At the same time, Korea aspires to become a space nation, and recently succeeded in its advance into space. In fact, Korea Aerospace Research Institute and Yuzhnoye design office have already cooperated on the launch services: From 2013-2015, Dnepr rockets successfully delivered Korean satellites to orbit. Another legendary Ukrainian airspace company is Antonov. The company has designed over 100 passenger, cargo and special purpose airplanes, with over 22,000 of them used by 55 countries around the world. With more than 70 years of experience in airplane design, engineering, manufacturing, sales and even operation, it is ready to work with Korean partners to open a new era in aviation. Co-developing a brand-new NATO-compliant An-148 marine patrol airplane, and even delivery of super large cargo using record-breaking An-124 “Ruslan” and An-225 “Mriya” -- all of these opportunities are fully available to Korea. In addition, in order to fully replace Russia-produced parts of its An-148, An-158, An-132 and An-70 airplanes, Antonov is open to consider Korean-manufactured parts and systems for its products.For over 70 years Ivchenko-Progress design bureau is developing and manufacturing aviation gas turbine engines for a wide range of purposes and applications, such as ground use or aviation. The scientific and technical potential and experimental research complex of Ivchenko-Progress SE allows developing turbo-jet engines of various types with a thrust of 500-50,000 kilonewtons and a power of 300-15,000 horsepower. The company is open to cooperation with Korean partners who are interested in turbine engines. AgricultureUkraine has long been called the “breadbasket of Europe” for its fertile black soil, perfect climate and landscapes for agriculture. Korean companies are actively participating in development of Ukraine’s agricultural potential. For example, Posco Daewoo and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food will jointly upgrade agricultural machines in Ukraine for small and medium farms. The company will also construct grain elevators in Ukrainian ports, as grain exports continue to be a very popular commodity in international markets. The potential of Ukraine’s agriculture, however, is far from being fulfilled, so Korean agritech and agriculture companies are more than welcome to explore possibilities in Ukraine and take advantage of world’s most fertile soils.TechnologyKorean companies are successfully developing and selling their products in Ukraine. For example, Samsung Electronics operates an R&D; center that employs more than 1,000 Ukrainians. Ukraine, on the other hand, is a leading software engineering country, with total market value over $2 billion. Ukrainian software engineers are among the best in the world. This year, Korean National IT Promotion Agency selected Ukrainian-founded Cards out of over 1,500 worldwide for “K-Startup Grand Challenge 2017,” a governmental support program. Cards is developing “andCards,” a software service that helps foster networking culture and build community at coworking centers.The time has never been better to invest into Ukraine, and to cooperate with the Ukrainian companies. Asian investors have already been actively investing into Ukraine. For example, Japanese electric equipment manufacturer Fujikura is already opening its second factory in Ukraine. Chinese construction companies are building ports and metro lines all around Ukraine. Various Chinese companies already invested over $7 billion into Ukraine.

The journalists were trying to cover Moon’s attendance of a trade event, and the Chinese guards blocked them and assaulted them when they protested. A petition posted on the website of the presidential office on Thursday called for minimizing the number of journalists stationed at Cheong Wa Dae, and scrapping the traveling press corps system. “The behavior of the traveling press corps during the president’s visits to the US and China showed that they were incapable of living up to the values sought by Cheong Wa Dae,” the post reads. The writer of the post accused the press corps of “causing an accident by ignoring instructions” at a critical time for diplomacy between South Korea and China, and demanded that the press corps no longer travel abroad with the president.Close to 45,000 people had joined the online petition as of Monday morning. If a petition on the Cheong Wa Dae website gathers more than 200,000 signatures within 30 days, the government is supposed to announce its position on the matter.The security guards that assaulted the journalists belonged to a firm set up by retired officers of China’s Ministry of Public Security, according to Rep. Lee Chan-yeol of the opposition People’s Party.Citing documents he received from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, which hosted the trade event, Rep. Lee said KOTRA hired the security firm as they were told to by the Chinese state enterprise that ran the event venue. An organization affiliated with the Ministry of Public Security was in charge of security personnel, he said. KOTRA had initially agreed to hire 50 security personnel and 30 safety inspection personnel from the firm, but ended up hiring 190 after signing an additional contract without knowing how much more they would have to pay, Lee said.By Kim So-hyun","injured two south korean photojournalists ,china last thursday the journalists ,week chinese security guards beat ,last week chinese security guards ,koreans joined an online petition","['South Koreans', 'Blue House', 'chinese', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'Moon', 'China', 'Moon ’s', 'chinese', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'US', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Ministry of Public Security', 'Lee Chan - yeol', 'People ’s Party', 'the Korea Trade - Investment Promotion Agency', 'Lee', 'KOTRA', 'chinese', 'the Ministry of Public Security', 'KOTRA', 'Lee', 'Kim So - hyun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41778865  0.45416692

But the government denied the request, saying they are unlikely to face persecution even if sent back to the African country. The girl filed a lawsuit against the decision, arguing that she could be forced to undergo circumcision. Both a district and an appeals court ruled against her, saying circumcision is a crime perpetrated privately and she could expect protection from the government as the country's political situation is stable.The highest court, however, struck down the ruling and sent the case back to the Seoul High Court, saying circumcision constitutes an act of persecution and the lower court didn't look sufficiently into whether Liberia is making enough efforts to eradicate the practice.""Circumcision, which inflicts an injury on a key part of a woman's body, is an act that is performed not for medical but for traditional, cultural and religious reasons.

But they often struggle to make a living in the capitalist South and sometimes fail to adjust to their new lives.Dressmaker Kim Ryon-Hui arrived seven years ago but has since has made several desperate attempts to return to her family -- including forging a passport, for which she was imprisoned, and falsely confessing to espionage in the hope she would be expelled.""I'm a citizen of Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea,"" Kim told dozens of reporters at a briefing in Seoul by Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN's Special Rapporteur on human rights in the North. ""I have been forcefully detained in the South for seven years,"" she added.Kim accused Seoul of violating her human rights, saying it had prevented her from going back to her aging parents and daughter.""A mother is someone who can't be apart from her daughter for even a moment, but seven years just hurts too much,"" she said, her voice trembling, adding she had attempted suicide.Most North Korean defectors are issued a South Korean passport six months after arrival, but Kim still has not received one and said the South's intelligence services had told her she ""might escape to the North"".South Koreans need government permission -- which is only granted in exceptional circumstances -- to go to the North, with which the country is technically still at war.Pyongyang repeatedly cites Kim's case and has said it will not allow any more reunions of relatives divided by the Korean War until she -- and 12 North Korean waitresses who it says were kidnapped from a restaurant in China -- are returned.The divided families are one of the most emotive outcomes of the conflict, which saw the peninsula partitioned in 1953, with around 60,000 increasingly elderly South Koreans still hoping to meet their relatives again.Quintana said the case was an example of the ""absurd cost of division"".The North is accused by the UN and many other countries of widespread human rights violations and Quintana said social and economic structures that fulfil ordinary people's rights and needs had largely ""disappeared"".""What remains intact is the comprehensive system of control and surveillance over the population,"" he said.There was also a ""widening gap in living standards between Pyongyang residents and the majority of the population"". ""It is alarming that this situation occurs in a country that is devoting a vast proportion of its resources to its defence budget and strengthening its border controls in unprecedented ways,"" he added.""The order of priorities in the DPRK requires a major shift that recognises the urgency to fulfil the basic needs of the population.","suicide most north korean defectors ,attempted suicide most north korean ,seoul on thursday to plead ,suicide most north korean ,korean defector interrupted united nations","['north korean', 'United Nations', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Koreans', 'Kim Ryon - Hui', 'Pyongyang', 'the Democratic Republic of Korea', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Tomas Ojea Quintana', 'UN', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'South Koreans', 'pyongyang', 'Kim', 'north Korean', 'China', 'South Koreans', 'Quintana', 'UN', 'Quintana', 'Pyongyang']",0,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.34652922  0.47623616

""The South Korean government plans to start with contact  to achieve those specific tasks in the process of seeking a more meaningful inter-Korean relationship,"" said the foreign minister.North Korea's participation in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea would be ""a favorable opportunity"" in that vein, she also noted.  Kang said the issue of North Korea's nuclear weapons development entered ""a new stage"" with its long-range ballistic missile launch on Nov. 29 and its declaration of its completion of the state nuclear force. ""North Korea's nuclear  and missiles have now become a direct threat to the whole world, not just a limited threat to the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia."" She said the international community will never tolerate North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons and will strengthen diplomacy and pressure to bring the country to the negotiating table.At the core of South Korea's policy toward North Korea is ""a solid South Korea-US  alliance,"" she stressed. The allies are currently in close consultation on ways to increase the frequency of the deployment of US strategic military assets on the Korean Peninsula and beef up South Korea's high-tech defense capabilities, Kang also noted.Colin Powell, a former US secretary of state, also called for continued diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.""I am all for using diplomatic and peaceful means to get rid of nuclear weapons throughout the world, especially with respect to North Korea,"" he told the forum. Powell analyzed that the survival of its regime seemed to be ""the most valuable thing"" in its development of nuclear weapons. ""They will do whatever is necessary to make sure the regime is sustained and this really is part of the background for solving the problem of nuclear weapons.""""But to use such weapons against the US or against our friends and allies, if we suspect that such weapons are about to be used, we need to make sure Kim Jong-un understands that will be the destruction of his regime, beginning the very next day. ...

""I think they have the ability to turn it off,"" he said, calling for a more active role by China in isolating the regime.Lee Do-hoon, South Korea's top envoy in negotiating North Korea's denuclearization, later said in the forum that the country will continue to seek opportunities for dialogue as it pursues a peaceful way out of the current nuclear deadlock.""We will not forget that the ultimate purpose of the sanctions and pressure is to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. Under the dire circumstances, we will continue to seek opportunities for dialogue,"" Lee said. ""Considering the current situation in which North Korea has justified its nuclear and missile development with its security concerns, North Korean nuclear issues cannot be resolved based on sanctions and pressure alone.

The man-made disaster was carried out under the order of Joseph Stalin, who saw a nationwide famine as instrumental in forestalling a Ukrainian independence movement, according to scholars. It is also known as the “terror famine,” “famine genocide,” or the “Ukrainian genocide of 1932-33.” “Eighty-five years ago, the Ukrainian nation faced a disaster that should not have happened on our fertile land,” said Ukrainian Ambassador to Korea Olexander Horin on Wednesday at the National Assembly in Seoul, where a photo exhibition on Holodomor was held for two days. From left: Georgian Ambassador to Korea Otar Berdzenishvili; spouse of the Ukrainian ambassador Nataliia Tymoshenko; Rep. Cho Jeong-sik, member of the National Assembly and chairman of the Ukraine-Korea Friendship Association; Ukrainian Ambassador to Korea Olexander Horin; Ukrainian Honorary Consul in Korea Lee Woo-jong; and businessman Lee Young-chae “It is important to tell the story of Holodomor, since there is no certainty that such an event will not repeat itself in today’s world. On the contrary, signs of genocide are seen in our modern world, and we should learn Holodomor’s lessons to avoid such crimes in the future and confront those who plan and organize them.”Ukraine has recognized the event as genocide, and the Ukrainian parliament has urged its international partners to acknowledge it as the crime of genocide, the embassy told The Korea Herald. Holodomor was the result of a “well-planned Kremlin policy,” the diplomatic mission said, adding the Soviet government confiscated all food from Ukrainian villages en masse, followed by isolating them and forbidding people to leave the country. “Collective farms and villages were surrounded by armed militias and Soviet Special Forces. All food stocks were taken, and trade and import of any goods were prohibited. It was a death sentence for residents,” the envoy said.Furthermore, the Soviet Union’s People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs deliberately blocked information about Holodomor across the vast expanse of the communist union, while at the same time blockading foreign aid. It was done to suppress national desires for independence, which grew among Ukraine’s economically independent peasants and educated intelligentsia.Holodomor is officially considered as genocide by 16 countries around the world, a criminal act of the Soviet Union by six countries and a tragedy or crime against humanity by five international organizations. Aside from Ukraine, it is remembered in Canada, the United States, Poland and other countries through various annual commemorations organized by community groups and religious institutions.

Thai citizens from all walks of life gather together to show their “profound respect” for the monarch who passed away over a year ago, said Thai Ambassador to Korea Sarun Charoensuwan. He added that Bhumibol  worked tirelessly to uplift Thai people’s lives, particularly those on the bottom rungs of society, after he ascended to the throne in 1946.“Through thousands of development projects he initiated over his lifetime, his majesty oversaw a period of profound social, economic and developmental transformations across Thailand. He helped the rural people become self-reliant and escape their poverty,” the envoy said in a speech at a reception in Seoul on Friday. “His majesty developed the philosophy of ‘sufficiency economy,’ which underlines the middle path as an overriding principle of appropriate conduct, moderation and wisdom.”Thai Ambassador to Korea Sarun Charoensuwan The philosophy -- prioritizing the pursuit of all national stakeholders’ interests over a long time span -- has been elaborated upon by Thai academics, promoted by the government and applied to over 23,000 villages throughout the country. Bangkok has utilized the philosophy over the last 40 years to overcome various national crises and advance in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, the envoy explained. Nothing that the late monarch’s birthday also coincides with the UN-designated World Soil Day -- designed to raise awareness on soil’s importance in agriculture, development, nutrition and food security around the world -- Charoensuwan said Thailand remembers Bhumibol’s dedication to national agricultural development and agrarian livelihood as the economy’s backbone. “With the passing of our late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand now has His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, the late king’s son who assumed his throne on Dec. 1 last year,” the diplomat said. “The monarchy will remain an important and inseparable part of our country and people, and continue to serve as an institution keeping them together.” Turning to relations with Korea, he said “our strong bond was forged through heroic sacrifices of our brave servicemen and women who fought side by side with Korean troops during the Korean War.” When North Korea invaded the South in 1950 with the aim of communizing it, Thailand was one of 21 countries that responded to the United Nations’ call to send troops to the peninsula. Thailand -- under the reign of King Bhumibol -- was the second after the United States to declare its participation, said Rep. Park Joo-sun, deputy speaker of the National Assembly, in a speech. Thai Ambassador to Korea Sarun Charoensuwan  and Rep. Park Joo-sun “It is my belief that his majesty’s resolution and the noble sacrifices of Thai soldiers served as a foundation on which my country achieved its rapid industrialization and democratization,” Park stressed, adding he attended the late king’s cremation ceremony in Bangkok on Oct. 26 as Korean President Moon Jae-in’s special envoy. The Royal Thai Expeditionary Forces to Korea, the 21st Combined Regiment, dispatched 11,786 troops to the war, with 136 dying as casualties. They, together with the Royal Thai Navy and Air Force, engaged in major battles that helped determine the fratricidal conflict’s outcome, including the battle of the Pork Chop Hill and Third Battle of Seoul. “What had started as a military and security cooperation between our countries quickly expanded to encompass all-inclusive ties, eventually maturing into a strategic partnership,” said Charoensuwan. “Thailand will continue its role helping maintain peace and security in the Korean Peninsula by strictly implementing relevant UN Security Council resolutions.” On the trade side, Korea continues to be one of Thailand’s top trading partners, underscored the ambassador. The bilateral trade turnover reached $10 billion from January through October, a 14 percent on-year uptick. Korea is the sixth-largest foreign investor in Thailand, led by global conglomerates like Samsung, LG and Posco that have plowed vast capital into Thailand’s manufacturing industry.Foreign ambassadors at the Father's Day reception organized by the Royal Thai Embassy in Seoul on Dec. 1 Highlighting that Seoul and Bangkok are stepping up collaboration in railway and water management, the envoy said Thailand will progressively contribute to regional integration through various infrastructure, logistics and social connectivity projects. Bangkok has embarked on a policy of nationwide economic overhaul known as “Thailand 4.0,” aiming at injecting innovation, knowledge, technology and creativity into its economy and escaping the “middle income trap.” “To realize all this, we hope to learn from Korea’s expertise and best practices in developing its infrastructure, smart cities, and innovative research and development capacities, especially the digital technology, information communications technology, Internet of Things and biotech,” according to the diplomat. On the tourism front, nearly 1.7 million Koreans are expected to travel to Thailand this year, while nearly 500,000 Thai tourists are forecast to visit Korea. The two nations will celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations next year. President Moon’s pivot toward the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as envisioned in his “New South Policy,” will give an additional impetus to the prospering two-way ties, underlined Charoensuwan.

He was admitted to the intensive care unit at first, but is now reportedly in a stable condition after regaining consciousness, officials at the hospital said Friday. The loudspeaker messages, which have reportedly influenced North Korean soldiers to defect in the past, have been deemed “psychological warfare” by the South Korean military. A North Korean soldier who crossed the MDL in June 2016 reportedly said that it pushed him to make the decision. Although Oh has yet to issue a similar statement, he has expressed familiarity with South Korean culture, including K-pop girl groups. Sunday’s broadcasts mentioned severe malnutrition among Korean soldiers, based on Oh’s medical records here. He was suffering from pneumonia and Hepatitis B, and dozens of fully grown parasitic worms were found in his ruptured small intestine, some as long as 27 centimeters, during surgery. Pyongyang has yet to issue a direct comment on the matter, but the North Korean army dug a trench and planted trees near the Demilitarized Zone in an apparent move to prevent its soldiers from following Oh’s actions. “he North Koreans have planted two trees and are digging a trench at the spot where their soldier crossed the MDL,” Marc Knapper, acting US ambassador to South Korea, tweeted Wednesday. The remark was accompanied by a photo of several North Korean men carrying out the work while North Korean soldiers surrounded them. Oh drove a jeep at about 70 kph before the vehicle got stuck in a ditch north of the Military Demarcation Line, the de facto border between the two Koreas. He was forced to abandon the vehicle and make a 50-meter dash for freedom. A South Korean lawmaker acknowledged the spot in the photo as an area linked to Oh’s defection. “I’m certain that’s the same spot where the soldier defected,” Kim Young-woo, chairman of the National Assembly’s defense committee in Seoul, said Friday. “North Koreans appear to be digging a trench in an attempt to prevent others soldiers from defecting to South Korea,” he said. Kim also added that the North had replaced most of its troops dispatched at the JSA, likely due to their failure at preventing Oh’s defection. “It was obviously part of punishment for failing their mission to deter the North Korean soldier’s escape. North Korea has always punished those responsible for similar failures,” he added. The United Nations Command said that the North Korean soldiers who fired gunshots at their former compatriot clearly violated the 1953 armistice agreement. The agreement that halted the 1950-1953 Korean War stipulates that any person -- military or civilian -- is prohibited from crossing the Military Demarcation Line unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.In line with recent events, a senior US diplomat referred to Oh’s defection to the South as an event that showcases North Korea’s human rights abuses, in a weekend op-ed published in the New York Times. “This defector’s plight is a window onto North Korean life,” Brian Hook, director of policy planning and senior policy adviser at the State Department wrote. Hook lambasted the current North Korean regime for spending money on its weapons program, monuments honoring its leader Kim Jong-un and his family, and bribes for elites in Pyongyang, while its soldiers suffer from malnourishment. A “vast majority” of North Korean citizens are subject to even worse treatment, Hook said. He also criticized the Chinese government for repatriating North Korean defectors found within its borders, and called on China and Russia to halt its “slave labor” made up of North Korean workers. Hiring North Koreans makes $230 million a year for the North Korean regime, he said. Hook said that the US would not “sit idly” while the regime in Pyongyang “lawlessly pursues” North Korean defectors and urged other members of the international community to join in the movement to bring about the North’s denuclearization.

He was shot five times and some of the gunshots flew over the MDL.

According to security camera footage, four North Korean soldiers armed with guns and rifles aimed shots at the defecting soldier, with one of them doing so in a prone position. They continued shooting even after he crossed the Military Demarcation Line, the de facto border between the two Koreas.Another violation occurred when one of the chasing soldiers, who appeared to carry an AK-47 assault rifle, temporarily crossed the borderline for a few seconds before turning back to the North’s territory inside the Joint Security Area, the UNC added. “The armistice agreement was challenged, but it remains in place,” said UNC Commander Vincent K. Brooks, who doubles as commander of the United States Forces in South Korea and Combined Forces Command between the US and South Korea. The armistice agreement that halted the 1950-153 Korean War stipulates that any person -- military or civilian -- is prohibited from crossing the Military Demarcation Line or MDL unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.A North Korean soldier, who chased his former compatriot defecting to South Korea, turned back to the North’s territory inside the Joint Security Area after temporarily crossing the borderline for a few seconds. YonhapAs it is in charge of operational control inside the JSA, the UNC said it had notified the North Korean People’s Army of these violations and requested a meeting to discuss the investigation results and measures to prevent future violations. But the prospect of holding such talks remains unclear, military officials said, as North Korea has shut down its communication channels with the UNC and South Korea. Cross-border military talks have been halted since 2009. North Korea had yet to respond to the request as of Wednesday afternoon. “The measure will be dealt with through relevant international regulations and legal proceedings,” said South Korea’s Unification Ministry spokesman Baek Tae-hyun during a press briefing, without elaborating on the procedures. Based on an analysis of CCTV footage and satellite images, the North Korean solider is thought to have driven his jeep at about 70 kph before running more than 50 meters toward the South while being chased by fellow soldiers. Appearing to be caught off guard, the North Korean soldiers came from guard towers -- some from Panmungak inside the JSA --- and ran toward the location of the vehicle, which was stuck in a ditch north of the MDL. The wounded soldier jumped out of the jeep and started running toward the South while four North Korean soldiers started shooting at him. The wounded soldier was found by a building near the Freedom House inside the South Korea-controlled part of the Joint Security Area in the Demilitarized Zone. Lying against a wall on a pile of leaves, the defector was rescued by three South Korean soldiers who crawled to him. One of them was identified as the South Korean deputy JSA commander, while two of them were noncommissioned officers. The US commander was directing overall rescue efforts, the UNC said. The rescue efforts demonstrated “considerable courage and self-discipline” during the urgent situation in a volatile area where small-scale skirmish can escalate into major conflicts, said US Army Col. Chad Carroll, the UNC’s public affairs chief, during the briefing.  “The action taken by  battalion was in a manner that is consistent with  armistice agreement,” he said “ demonstrated appropriate, self-disciplined and sound decision making at a time when the situation on the ground was not nearly as clear as we can see on the video.”By Yeo Jun-suk","north korean soldiers started shooting ,korean soldiers started shooting at ,korean soldier defecting to south ,korean soldiers started shooting ,the chasing north korean soldiers","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'the United Nations Command', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'North ’s', 'the Joint Security Area', 'UNC', 'UNC', 'Vincent K.

It's also unclear whether the North's troops actually crossed the MDL, even for seconds, during the hunt.He was recovered by South Korean and US soldiers later Monday and transported to a hospital south of Seoul,He underwent a surgery at Ajou University Hospital in Suwon and is still unconscious.He's in critical condition, and it's unclear whether he will live, given the seriousness of the wound, according to Lee Cook-jong, a doctor at the hospital. "" will have to ride out the crucial moments  over the next 10 days,"" he told reporters.The JCS confirmed that the North Korean man approached the JSA by car at around 3:15 p.m. Monday.The car sped towards a guard post but its wheels fell into a nearby drain, the JCS spokesman Army Col.

At the time of the defection, the soldier was clad in the Korean People's Army uniform and had no weapon, he added.""We closely monitored the situation with a surveillance system,"" Roh said.

""At 3:31 p.m., we detected one defector who fell to the ground among fallen leaves 50 meters from the MDL,"" he added.At the same session, Defense Minister Song Young-moo said the incident marked the first time the North had fired shots into the South Korean side of the JSA.Song simply answered, ""Yes,"" when Liberty Korea Party Rep. Chung Jin-suk asked him if this was indeed the first such case.JCS officials said later there's a bullet mark on the southern side but an additional probe is needed to confirm whether it's associated with the latest firing incident at the JSA.As for the South Korean military's response, Song said, ""I think our military minimized the damage and handled the defected soldier well in such a short period of time.""When pressed if North Korea had violated the terms of the armistice, Song said he would ask the UNC's Military Armistice Committee to take appropriate measures.""If our request is not met, then we'll have no choice but to take legal steps and release a statement, among other measures,"" Song added.There was no report of any exchange of fire between the two Koreas.A North Korean soldier defected to the South via the JSA in 1998 and another in 2007.The UNCMAC is looking into the incident.The commission notified the North's military that the individual is being medically treated at this time.

Doctors can consult via live, online video conferencing, and lectures at prestigious Kim Il-sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes. People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones. In the wallets of the privileged are ""Jonsong"" or ""Narae"" cards for e-shopping and online banking. Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web.  It's just not the World Wide Web. This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium-sized company might use for its employees.  The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes, and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea, North Korea is still the least Internet-friendly country on Earth. Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable. Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn’t shared, and the price for trying to get around the government‘s rules can be severe.  But for Kim Jong-un, the country’s first leader to come of age with the Internet, the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive. It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology -- and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of. It also allows for the possibility of cyber-attacks on the West.  Pyongyang's solution is a two-tiered system where the trusted elite can surf the Internet with relative freedom while the masses are kept inside the national intranet, painstakingly sealed off from the outside world, meticulously surveilled and built in no small part on pilfered software.  The regime created, in other words, an online version of North Korea itself.  Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea Surfing the intranet Rising from Ssuk Island in the Taedong River, which divides Pyongyang east and west, is a building shaped like a colossal atom.  The ""knowledge sector"" is a key priority for Kim Jong-un, and the sprawling, glassy Sci-Tech Complex, a center for the dissemination of science-related information throughout the country, is one of his signature development projects. It houses North Korea’s biggest e-library, with more than 3,000 terminals where factory workers participate in tele-learning, kids in their bright red scarves watch cartoons and university students do research.  Pak Sung-jin, a 30-year-old postgraduate in chemistry, came to work on an essay. It‘s a weekday and the e-library is crowded.  Unlike most North Koreans, Pak has some experience with the Internet, though on a supervised, need-only basis. If Pak needs anything from the Internet, accredited university officials will find it for him. As a scholar and a scientist, Pak says, it’s his patriotic duty to be on top of the most up-to-date research.  He echoes the official condemnation that the Internet has been poisoned by the American imperialists and their stooges. ""There ought to be a basic acceptance the Internet should be used peacefully,"" he says.  Today, he is relying on the Internet‘s North Korean alter ego, the national intranet.  Below a red label that states his black ""Ullim"" desktop computer was donated by Dear Respected Leader Kim Jong-un, what’s on Pak's screen is for North Korean eyes only. The IP address, 10.76.1.11, indicates he’s on the walled-off network North Koreans call ""Kwangmyong,"" which means brightness or light.  Using the ""Naenara"" browser -- the name means ""my country"" but it's a modified version of FireFox -- Pak visits a restaurant page, his university website, and cooking and online shopping sites.  There are very few actual sites on Kwangmyong. An official at the Sci-Tech Center said they number 168.  They are spread across separate networks for government agencies, schools and libraries, and companies. It’s all domestically run, though government-approved content culled from the Internet can be posted by administrators, primarily for researchers like Pak.  North Korea's national intranet concept is unique and extreme even when compared with other information-wary countries. China and Cuba, for example, are well known for the extent of control the government exerts over what citizens can see. But that is done primarily through censorship and blocking, not complete separation.  Like most North Korean computers, the desktops at the Sci-Tech Complex run on the ""Red Star"" operating system, which was developed by the Korea Computer Center from Linux open-source coding.  Red Star 3.0 has the usual widgets: the Naenara browser, email, a calendar and time zone settings, even ""kPhoto"" . Older versions featured a Windows XP user interface but it now it has a Mac design, right down to the ""spinning beach ball"" wait icon.  Versions of Red Star that have made it out of North Korea and into the hands of foreign coding experts also reveal some rather sinister, and for most users invisible, features.  Any attempt to change its core functions or disable virus checkers results in an automatic reboot cycle. Files downloaded from USBs are watermarked so that authorities can identify and trace criminal or subversive activity, a security measure that takes aim at the spread of unauthorized content from South Korea, China and elsewhere.  Red Star also uses a trace viewer that takes regular screenshots of what is being displayed. The screenshots can’t be deleted or accessed by the typical user but are available for checking if a trained government official decides to take a look.  Outside North Korea, Android phones have a similar trace-viewer feature, noted Will Scott, who taught computer science at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in 2013 and is now a doctoral student at the University of Washington. But the Red Star version reflects the regime‘s very specific surveillance and violation-busting priorities. It doesn’t collect much more than the Android would; however, it is designed to make getting at that information easier for a local authority who isn‘t an expert programmer.  Scott said the North has been ""very effective"" in using such technology to serve its goals.  Nat Kretchun, deputy director of the Open Technology Fund, said the kinds of censorship and surveillance software in Red Star and the mobile operating systems of phones and tablets reveal a new information control strategy.  Under Kim Jong-un’s predecessors, the flow of information was primarily controlled through a resource-intensive human network -- the State Security Ministry's ""thought police,"" for example, or Pyongyang’s iconic traffic controllers -- that kept tabs on what people were up to. But the advent of the Internet and advances in communication technology poked holes in that strategy, particularly among the better educated, younger and more affluent, the very segment of society that could be most likely to pose a political threat.  So, while maintaining its old school tactics on the ground and enforcing the blackout of the global Internet, North Korean officials have learned to adapt by using the online devices themselves as yet another tool for surveillance.  ""In North Korea cell phones and intranet-enabled devices are on balance pro-surveillance and control,"" said Kretchun, who has been studying North Korea‘s relationship to the Internet for years.  The Azalea smart phone and the Ryonghung iPadThe most common online experience for North Koreans isn’t on a laptop or desktop. It‘s on a smart phone.  A decade ago, only a small cadre of select regime and military officials had access to smart phones. Now, according to the main provider’s most recent financial reports, there are an estimated 2.5-3 million mobile phones in North Korea, a country of 25 million.  The rapid spread of mobile phones is one of the biggest success stories of the Kim Jong Un era. After a couple of false starts, the North‘s foray into mobile telecoms began in earnest in 2008 under Kim Jong Il. But it has truly blossomed over the past five years with the introduction of 3G services, thanks in large part to two foreign investors -- Loxley Pacific of Thailand and Egypt’s Orascom Telecom Media and Technology.  Like the walled-off intranet, North Korea‘s phones deny access to the outside world.  Local phones allow North Koreans to call and text each other, play games, surf the domestic intranet and access some other services. Users have hundreds of ring tones to choose from, and can get weather updates, look words up in dictionaries and snap selfies. But they cannot receive or place calls to numbers outside that network -- the rest of the world, in other words.  It’s easy enough for North Koreans to buy phones, though the phones must be registered and approved. A good ""Pyongyang"" or ""Arirang"" model smart phone costs from $200 to $400. More basic phones go for much less, especially if the phone is second-hand.  On the second floor of the Pottonggang IT center, a clerk stands behind a glass display cabinet filled with tablets and USB flash drives. Signs on the wall behind her advertise anti-virus software and apps to put on mobile phones, which they can do by Bluetooth at the store. One of the most popular apps is a role playing game based on ``Boy General,‘’ a locally created hit anime series. It costs $1.80.  Foreigners in North Korea are relegated to a different network and cannot make calls to, or receive calls from, local numbers. They can buy local phones if they want, but the devices will be stripped of the apps and features that they normally carry and securely coded so that the apps can‘t be added on later. Wi-fi use is banned for North Koreans, and tightly restricted and monitored to block surreptitious piggybacking on foreigners’ signals.  North Korea undoubtedly imports and rebrands some of its IT products. But over the past few months, two companies have generated quite a stir among Apple fans with products billed to be wholly domestic: the ""Jindallae  III"" mobile phone and the ""Ryonghung iPad."" The gadgets‘ insouciant similarity to Apple products, and the flat-out appropriation of the ``iPad’‘ name, isn’t especially surprising. Kim Jong Un likes Apple products _ he has been photographed with a MacBook Pro on his private jet, and even had a 21-inch iMac on the desk beside him when state media showed him reviewing a nuclear ""U.S. mainland strike plan"" four years ago.  It seems North Korean coders have also lifted some ideas from Apple.  Outside experts believe a program similar to what Apple uses in its OS X and iOS is believed to be the basis of the booby-trap that thwarts attempts to disable security functions in Red Star. It‘s now a staple on North Korean phones. And by 2014, all mobile phone operating systems had been updated to include the watermarking system to reject apps or media that don’t carry a government signature of approval.  It‘s the same mechanism used by Apple to block unauthorized applications from the App Store, but in North Korea’s case serves instead to control access to information.  ""The stakes are infinitely higher in North Korea, where communications are monitored and being caught talking about the wrong thing could land you in a political prison camp,"" Kretchun noted.  Wired elites and cybersoldiersWhile blocking off the masses, North Korea allows more Internet access to a small segment of society, including the country‘s elite and its cybersoldiers.  To create a snapshot of the online behavior of the elite, US-based cyber threat intelligence company Recorded Future and Team Cymru, a non-profit Internet security group, analyzed activity in IP ranges believed to be used by North Korea from April to July this year. They found that the limited number of North Koreans with access to the Internet are much more active and engaged in the world and with contemporary services and technologies than many outsiders had previously thought, according to Priscilla Moriuchi, Recorded Future’s director of strategic threat development and a former NSA agent.  ""North Korean leaders are not disconnected from the world and the consequences of their actions,"" she said.  How deep the access goes isn‘t known. Recorded Future and Team Cymru officials contacted by The AP refused to comment on details of their dataset, including how many ""elite"" users were observed and how foreign tourists or residents in the North were excluded.  Even so, it stands to reason at least some members of the North Korean leadership have the access they need to keep up on world events and that specialist agents are allowed to monitor and cull intelligence from the internet.  There is also strong evidence that North Korea allows people involved in hacking or cyber operations the access necessary for a deep engagement in cyberattacks and cybercrime.  According to the FBI, the North’s bigger hacks include the recent WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in May and crippled parts of Britain‘s National Health Service. It has been linked to attacks on the Bangladeshi central bank last year and on banks in South Korea going back to 2013. There was also the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures over the release of the ""Interview,"" a black comedy that graphically portrayed Kim Jong Un being killed. U.S. authorities recently dubbed North Korea’s cyber presence ""Hidden Cobra.""  Weaponizing cyberspace is a logical option for the North because it can be done at relatively low cost and at the same time denied, according to a Congressional report submitted in August.  Pyongyang has denied hacking allegations, but the ability to carry out sophisticated cyber operations is a powerful military weapon in the hands of a state. Just as assuredly as North Korea is developing its nuclear and missile capabilities, most experts assume, it‘s honing its cyber warfare tool box.  Beau Woods, the deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, cautioned of a ""preponderance of question marks"" regarding North Korea’s cyber skills. But he warned of how potentially devastating a more cyber-active North Korea could be.  Those concerns are turned on their head back at the Sci-Tech Center in Pyongyang.  Pak, the chemist, supports the official line in North Korea that the increasing danger of cyberattacks and slanderous Internet propaganda comes from the U.S. against Pyongyang.

32,32,‘Time to apologize for Korea’s own war crimes in Vietnam’,"For many South Koreans, the Vietnam War is remembered in terms of the sacrifice of thousands of South Korean soldiers fighting alongside US troops against communism in the country.

Vietnam War veterans are hailed here as patriotic heroes who helped propel Korea’s rise in the 1960s and ’70s. But many Vietnamese remember it differently. It is not well known here, but South Korean soldiers are accused of brutally killing Vietnamese civilians, including many women and children, during Korea’s 1964-73 involvement there. Civic groups put the total killed in these massacres at 9,000. For history teacher Moon Yong-po, it is something South Korea should study, apologize for and teach its children about. Moon and his 11 students flew to Seoul from Jeju Island last week to join a rally in front of Cheong Wa Dae, calling on President Moon Jae-in to apologize. Kim Ji-ho holds a board reading ""I am sorry, Vietnam. Apology to Vietnam, Justice to the future generation, Peace to Asia! “We demand an apology from the Japanese government for what it did to us in the past. I think our offering an apology to Vietnam would serve as a good example for Japan,” Kim Ji-ho, 13, one of the teacher’s pupils, told The Korea Herald outside Cheong Wa Dae on Nov. 2.The Nov. 2 rally was part of a relay of one-person protests timed for the president’s scheduled visit to Vietnam later this week. President Moon, currently in Indonesia as part of a three-nation tour, is to touch down on Saturday in Danang, Vietnam, to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Under the military-backed authoritarian Park Chung-hee administration, South Korea sent over 300,000 soldiers to Vietnam to support the US in the fight against communism in Vietnam. No official figures are available for the number of Vietnamese civilians killed at the hands of Korean soldiers in villages including Phong Nhi, Phong Nhat and Ha My in Quang Nam Province. Former liberal President Kim Dae-jung expressed his regret in 1998 during his visit to Vietnam, saying, “I am sorry that Korea participated in an unfortunate war and inflicted suffering on Vietnamese people.” President Roh Moo-hyun also said in 2004 that Korea had a “debt” to repay while paying tribute to Vietnam’s communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh. But South Korea has never formally acknowledged civilian massacres by its troops or officially investigated any related allegations. Vietnam has also not asked for an apology from the Korean government, seeking to leave the past behind and instead look to the future. Now, South Korea and Vietnam share close ties. Korea is Vietnam’s biggest foreign investor and second-biggest donor in official development assistance. Vietnam is one of Korea’s largest trading partners. “I wanted to teach my students the meaning of peace. Peace can be made when we know our own wrongdoings and ask for forgiveness,” history teacher Moon said. “It is not the crime I or my students committed, but history will only repeat itself if we forget about our own wrongdoings.” “I wanted to teach them that the future generation should develop relations of peace, aware of past mistakes.” Moon and his pupils, holding boards reading “I am sorry, Vietnam,” caught the attention of Vietnamese tourists who happened to pass by the presidential office. Students hold art-works and boards that read ""I am sorry, Vietnam"" in front of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in central Seoul on Nov. 2 After, they approached the protesters, read the information on when and where the massacres by the Korean troops took place, and took pictures with them.“I don’t hate Korea. They made a mistake in the past. But it is meaningful that they want to show that they are really sorry about what happened,” said Thao Nguyen, a 19-year-old Vietnamese tourist. Vietnamese tourists take a picture with Korean protesters holding up a placard reading ""I am sorry, Vietnam"" in front of the presidential office on Nov. 2 A war veteran who fought alongside the US forces in Vietnam in 1967 told The Korea Herald that he had witnessed his own troops massacring Vietnamese civilians. “I still cannot forget the moment I saw dead bodies of Vietnamese people lying on both sides of the road I was patroling every morning,” Ryu Jin-seong claimed. “It was a wrong war that should have not taken place. We went there because we were told to do so.”“If needed, we should make an apology.” Seok Mi-hwa, secretary-general of Korea-Vietnam Peace Foundation, urged President Moon to deliver a message of peace to Vietnam by recognizing its own wartime atrocities during the Vietnam War.“The South Korean government should investigate the Korean troops’ massacre of Vietnamese civilians and, if confirmed, it should take responsibility for their wartime atrocities,” Seok said. On this year’s Memorial Day on June 6, President Moon addressed the country’s Vietnam War veterans, declaring that Korea’s economic takeoff was thanks to their dedication and sacrifice in Vietnam.His remarks prompted the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry to release an official statement asking Seoul to “refrain from statements and actions that hurt the Vietnamese people and have a negative impact on friendship and cooperation between the two countries.” But above all, apologizing for Korea’s wartime crimes is in the interest of the Korean people, Seok said. “Whether it is a history of being assailant or victim, it should be reflected upon so that something like this will never happen again,” she said. “It is not Vietnam’s problem. It is a problem of our own.” By Ock Hyun-ju","korean troops massacre of vietnamese ,of brutally killing vietnamese civilians ,south korean soldiers fighting alongside ,investigate the korean troops massacre ,massacres by the korean troops","['South Koreans', 'south korean', 'US', 'Korea ’s', 'Vietnamese', 'south korean', 'vietnamese', 'Korea', 'Moon Yong - po', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Ji - ho', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Justice', 'japanese', 'Vietnam', 'Japan', 'Kim Ji - ho', 'the Korea Herald', 'Cheong', 'Vietnam', 'Moon', 'Indonesia', 'Danang', 'Vietnam', 'Park Chung - hee', 'South Korea', 'Vietnam', 'US', 'Vietnam', 'vietnamese', 'korean', 'Phong Nhi', 'Phong Nhat', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'vietnamese', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Ho Chi Minh', 'South Korea', 'Vietnam', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Vietnam', 'vietnamese', 'Vietnam', 'Cheong', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Thao Nguyen', 'vietnamese', 'vietnamese', 'korean', 'Vietnam', 'US', 'Vietnam', 'the Korea Herald', 'vietnamese', 'vietnamese', 'Ryu Jin - seong', 'Seok Mi - hwa', 'Korea', 'Vietnam Peace Foundation', 'Moon', 'Vietnam', 'south korean', 'korean', 'vietnamese', 'Seok', 'Moon', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry', 'Seoul', 'vietnamese', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Seok', 'Vietnam', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",19,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.32223231  0.02903224

Each room is about 4.91 square meters, about one third of the minimum housing space stated in the Housing Act, which is 12.28 square meters. Living in such a crowded and confined space is not just inhumane but it could also pose trainees at risk of various contagious illnesses, the lawmaker pointed out. South Korean squadrooms typically have no bed and trainees sleep on the floor.   The government data showed that at least 460 army trainees suffered pneumonia last year. So far this year, 545 people were diagnosed with pneumonia while in training. About 35 percent of the 462 adenovirus - causative virus for pneumonia - infection cases reported in the military occurred at these training centers, separate data showed.","typical army trainee shares squadroom ,460 army trainees suffered pneumonia ,army trainee shares squadroom with ,army trainee shares squadroom ,democratic party typical army trainee","['South Korea ’s', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Lee Chul - hee', 'Democratic Party', 'south korean']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37046343  0.13053046

Kim Tae-nyeon, chief policymaker of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, said Tuesday that his party will push to revise the Animal Protection Act to punish owners in pet attack cases. He also spoke of the possible addition of clauses calling for mandatory education for owners and the training of misbehaving dogs. “By thoroughly reviewing cases abroad and public sentiment, the ruling party will establish a legal framework for pet attack cases and revise the Animal Protection Act so that it ensures the safety of both animals and humans,” said Rep. Kim. At the moment, four bills that intend to reinforce the responsibility of the owners of fierce dogs and the punishment of owners in the event of dog attacks are pending at the National Assembly. Similar bills were proposed before, but discarded in 2006 and 2012.On Monday, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs also said it would push to add specific dog bite clauses to the same law. The ministry said it would seek to raise fines for owners caught not putting their dogs on leash in public to 200,000 won  for the first-time offense, and 300,000 won and 500,000 won for second- and third-time violations, respectively. The current law imposes a penalty of 50,000 won, 70,000 won and 100,000 won, respectively. Also, more breeds of dangerous dogs will become subject to stricter management, under the ministry’s plan. Currently, there are only five breeds under the category that must be leashed and muzzled in public: American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, Rottweilers, Tosa dogs and their mixed breeds. Officials said they would consider any type of breed that is highly likely to attack and injure humans under the category of dangerous dogs and set specific examples of such dogs in the revised law. The ministry also unveiled a plan to give out rewards to those who report negligent dog owners who do not leash or muzzle their dogs in public in violation of the law. About 10 to 20 percent of the levied fine in the reported cases will be given as reward money. The ministry, however, remained cautious about the possible euthanasia of dogs involved in fatal attacks, citing possible opposition from animal rights group.“, we should first set principles in the revised law so that the owners of dogs and their pets are not treated like potential criminals in our society,” said ministry official Park Byung-hong during a briefing. Earlier this month, the owner of a famous Korean restaurant chain died six days after being bitten by a French bulldog, which was later revealed to be owned by popular singer and actor Choi Si-won. But Choi’s father wrote on his personal social media account that investigations showed that she died of blood poisoning and that it was “difficult to determine the exact cause of her death due to a possibility of problems in the process of hospital treatment or secondary infection,” worsening the public’s anger toward his irresponsible attitude over the case. As of Tuesday, over 800 people had flocked to the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae’s online petition webpage to call for stronger legal measures to urge compulsory leashing and muzzling of dogs in public. According to the Korea Consumer Agency, a total of 1,019 dog bite accidents occurred here last year, more than quadrupling from 245 in 2011.By Kim Da-sol","dog bite cases raised public ,punish owners in pet attack ,more breeds of dangerous dogs ,the ministry also unveiled plan ,dog attacks are pending","['South Korea', 'YonhapRep', 'Kim Tae - nyeon', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'american', 'American Staffordshire', 'Staffordshire', 'Park Byung - hong', 'korean', 'french', 'Choi Si - won', 'Choi ’s', 'Cheong', 'the Korea Consumer Agency', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61048633  0.20461772

Gil Won-ok ""I may have realized my dream at 90, but I guess it's not the same as realizing it at a young age,"" she said.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were mobilized to work in frontline brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910-45.The issue of the ""comfort women,"" Japan's euphemism for the sex slaves, has long been a thorn in the two countries' ties.In 2015, the two sides struck a deal to resolve the issue once and for all through a Japanese government apology and reparations to the South Korean victims. But many of the survivors and civic groups rejected the agreement over what they perceived as Tokyo's lack of sincerity and violations of the spirit of the deal.In Washington, Gil was supposed to attend the unveiling of a girl statue symbolizing the victims at Salisbury University, Maryland.But the plan was abruptly canceled due to what Korean activists said was likely opposition from the Japanese government.""I think it's fair to say that installing such statues is hope for your future,"" Gil said.She will still visit the university on Thursday at the request of the professors who had pushed for the project. The professors, the activists said, have promised to keep trying.Asked if she would come back if the statue is placed, Gil said, ""Wherever a girl statue is erected, I go to visit because I want to see it, but also because I have to meet her.""Tokyo has bristled at the erection of such figures, one of which is a rallying point outside the former Japanese embassy building in Seoul. Earlier this year Tokyo recalled its ambassador to Seoul to protest the installation of another statue outside its consulate in Busan, South Korea's second largest city.""History is not something that can be erased because you want it to be erased,"" Gil said.

Abe visited Yasukuni war shrine in a move sure to infuriate China and South Korea. The visit to the shrine, which honors 2.5 million war dead including convicted class A war criminals, appears to be a departure from Abe`s pragmatic approach to foreign policy, in which he tried to avoid alienating neighboring countries. It was the first visit by a sitting prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi went to mark the end of World War II in 2006. ""Japan should demonstrate humble soul-searching and repentance through sincere behavior based on the appropriate recognition of history,"" he added. According to local media reports, Abe, along with other senior politicians, sent ritual offerings to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo to mark its annual autumn festival. The shrine honors around 2.4 million of Japan's war dead, including 14 Class-A war criminals.

The online community offered mainly voyeur photographs and videos of so-called revenge porn. Most of the content circulated through the website was considered likely to have been taken or uploaded without the consent of the women appearing in them. But the crackdown on Soranet has done little to address the wider problem, with the number of such crimes -- taking illicit videos without consent and distributing them online -- continuing to rise. According to the National Police Agency, the number of cases leading to arrest came to 2,400 in 2012, but jumped to reach 7,623 three years later. As of August this year, 3,914 offenses have been reported. Aware of the gravity of the situation, President Moon Jae-in has called for comprehensive measures to curb “hidden camera crimes.”“We need to come up with stronger punishment against the criminals and come up with special arrangement for the victims,” he said in a Cabinet meeting on Aug. 8. On Sept. 27, the government announced a set of plans to prevent and punish such digital sex crimes, which include conducting regular inspections of public facilities and stronger regulations to stop import, sale and possession of cameras modified for illegal purposes.The measure also includes stronger punishment for those spreading revenge pornography, including imprisonment of up to five years. Circulating videos without consent will also be punishable with up to seven years in prison. Despite the government’s resolve to take on the issue, experts say it will not be an easy fight.Technology has made hidden cameras more difficult to identify, with miniaturized devices now coming in all shapes and sizes. They are designed to resemble car keys, pens, spectacles and watches, among other things.For the victims, the matter becomes much more serious once videos are posted online. After they are uploaded it becomes almost impossible to stop them from spreading. A lawmaker called for a special investigation system to be introduced for the victims to prevent secondary damage.“The government said it would provide funds to remove such videos, but the internet makes redistribution too easy,” Rep. Song Hee-kyoung of Liberty Korea Party said. According to government data revealed by the first-term legislator, the Korea Communications Commission has received more than 15,000 requests to have such videos removed from online during the past three years. But only 3.7 percent, 570, were erased. The average number of days it took for them to be deleted was also 10.9 days. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency conducted a monthlong crackdown in September to detect hidden cameras in 1,474 public facilities. But they announced on Saturday they had not found a single camera.The inspection areas include 290 subway and train stations, five bus terminals 660 public toilets and 90 universities.""We received the budget to buy devices to detect such hidden cameras only this year, and bought 92 of them,” Han Ye-ri at the National Police Agency told The Korea Herald. “The 92 detectors are not enough for the whole nation. While it would be good if we can actually catch the cameras, we aim for our efforts and inspections to reassure citizens and possibly prevent further crimes.”When asked about future plans to make regular the inspections, she said it was likely but nothing had been decided yet. Lee Su-jeong, a professor of criminal psychology at Kyonggi University stressed that a fundamental solution can only come when society changes. “The hidden camera crime trend now is not a matter to be dealt with as psychological voyeurism. There are already illegal routes to distribute illicit footage and it is not too much to say it has formed an industry,” she told The Korea Herald.“Society should openly discuss and draw a conclusion that it is not okay to sell such illicit videos. Without a comprehensive view change, the government’s countermeasures would only have a temporary effect.”By Jo He-rim","many south korean women fear ,korean women fear that there ,south korean women fear that ,south korean women fear ,korean women fear that","['south korean', 'Hwang Seul - gi', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Ria Ma', 'video', 'the National Police Agency', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Cabinet', 'Song Hee - kyoung', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'the Korea Communications Commission', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Han', 'the National Police Agency', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee Su - jeong', 'Kyonggi University', 'the Korea Herald', '“society', 'Jo He - rim']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49106663  0.40597224

Indonesia declared its right to sovereign rule on the day in 1945, marking the start of diplomatic and armed resistance against forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians, who officially acknowledged the country’s independence in 1949. “August 17 is an important day for Indonesia, when all our people were freed from the bondage of a foreign occupation,” said Indonesian Ambassador to Korea Umar Hadi in a speech at Lotte Hotel on Thursday. “This declaration conveyed a strong message that colonialism had no place in the world. The spirit of independence has also inspired decolonization efforts all around the globe.”Indonesia’s constitution explicitly mandates the nation’s commitment to fully participating in and contributing to a world order based on freedom, peace and social justice, he stressed, adding that his country has actively taken part in various peacekeeping operations of the United Nations since 1957. Indonesian Ambassador to Korea Umar Hadi  poses with Indonesian diplomats and embassy staff at a National Day reception marking the proclamation of independence on Thursday. Currently, there are some 2,800 Indonesian military, police and civilian personnel on UN peacekeeping missions and the number is expected to reach over 4,000 by 2019, according to the envoy. “This commitment to freedom, peace and social justice is the underlying pillar of our foreign policy,” Hadi stressed. “Indonesia is also a strong proponent of moderation and tolerance. We are living proof that democracy, Islam and modernity can flourish together.”Touching on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where Indonesia is the largest country in terms of economy and population size -- over $1 trillion and 261 million people -- the ambassador argued that ASEAN has become an influential regional organization promoting peace and prosperity “not by accident, but by design,” on the basis of a collective responsible leadership.The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands spanning three time zones has the world’s seventh-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, according to the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook. One of the world’s leading emerging markets, the PriceWaterhouseCoopers has projected its economy to reach the status of the world’s fourth-largest by 2030. Hadi said Indonesia’s economic growth cannot continue without investing in various infrastructures, equally distributing wealth and weeding out corruption and promoting good governance -- top policy priorities of the current government under Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. Indonesian artists at the National Day reception at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Thursday marking the proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945. “The Republic of Korea is one of our most important economic partners,” the ambassador highlighted, noting “significant improvements” have been made across almost all sectors, particularly after the two countries became strategic partners in 2006. Jakarta and Seoul established diplomatic ties in 1973. The bilateral trade volume reached nearly $15 billion last year, with Indonesia being Korea’s 14th largest trade partner and Korea being Indonesia’s sixth largest trade partner. “In light of dynamic changes taking place around the world, our two countries bear the responsibility to play a greater role in promoting sustainable peace and development on regional and global levels,” he asserted. “To this end, our strategic partnership, based on action-oriented, forward-looking objectives, is poised to advance further over the coming decades.”CJ Co-chairman Sohn Kyung-shik, who spoke at the event, said Indonesia is “a country of great potential, with its rich natural resources and a large population.” “Indonesia is turning its potential into remarkable achievements, and beginning to make vigorous strides to become an economic powerhouse in Asia,” he said. “Indonesia is also a good country to do business. The government encourages foreign investment and maintains political stability.” There are many Korean enterprises operating in the Indonesian market, Sohn pointed out, mentioning that the CJ Group has successfully expanded operations into biotechnology, animal feed, cinema, franchise and logistics since launching business there in 1988.By Joel Lee Indonesian artists at the National Day reception at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Thursday marking the proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945.","country independence last week commemorating ,celebrating indonesia proclamation of independence ,embassy marked the 72nd anniversary ,hotel in seoul on thursday ,independence last week commemorating the","['the Indonesian Embassy', 'South Korea', 'Indonesia', 'Netherlands', 'the Korea Herald', 'Indonesia', 'Netherlands', 'pro - dutch', 'Indonesia', 'indonesian', 'Korea', 'Umar Hadi', 'Lotte Hotel', 'the United Nations', 'indonesian', 'Korea', 'Umar Hadi', 'indonesian', 'indonesian', 'UN', 'Hadi', 'Indonesia', 'Islam', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'Indonesia', 'ASEAN', 'the International Monetary Fund ’s World Economic Outlook', 'Hadi', 'Indonesia', 'indonesian', 'Lotte Hotel', 'Seoul', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Jakarta', 'Seoul', 'Indonesia', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Indonesia', 'Sohn Kyung - shik', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia', 'korean', 'indonesian', 'Sohn', 'the CJ Group', 'Joel Lee indonesian', 'Lotte Hotel', 'Seoul']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24945155  0.75131947

54,54,[Feature] Consumers concerned about excessive packaging for Chuseok gifts,"For Kim Mi-hee, a 55-year-old housewife, it has become a routine recently for her to pick up Chuseok gift parcels from her doorstep, un pack them, and then lug cardboard boxes full of packing materials to her Seoul apartment block’s trash recycling area. “I try my best to dutifully separate the recyclables from the garbage, but I did not know this much bubble wrap and Styrofoam was used in gift sets,” Kim said, a...","For Kim Mi-hee, a 55-year-old housewife, it has become a routine recently for her to pick up Chuseok gift parcels from her doorstep, un pack them, and then lug cardboard boxes full of packing materials to her Seoul apartment block’s trash recycling area. “I try my best to dutifully separate the recyclables from the garbage, but I did not know this much bubble wrap and Styrofoam was used in gift sets,” Kim said, adding that she often felt a sense of guilt and frustration when she opened the boxes.Photo: YonhapWith Chuseok, or Lunar Thanksgiving, just around the corner, post offices and parcel service centers are at their busiest, with soaring delivery workloads for Korea’s second biggest national holiday. For Chuseok holidays, people exchange gifts, mostly food, such as premium oils, dried fish sets, premium beef sets and health supplements, all going toward a family feast of traditional food.Often taking up more than half of a product’s unit volume, data from the Korea Zero Waste Movement Network shows that product packaging accounted for nearly 60 percent of all household waste in 2014, almost double the equivalent figure of 35 percent in 2011. Kim described receiving a Russian doll-type arrangement of boxes within boxes to protect a shampoo and conditioner set, with the bottles individually coddled in bubble wrap.  Photo: Yonhap“For me,  are not welcome. It rather means a hard work of removing paper, wrapping and plastic from the gift.” Under regulations by the Environment Ministry, gift sets specially on sale for holiday season are recommended to be packaged twice at most. Packing materials, such as plastic covers, polystyrene and bubble wrap must fill less than 25 percent of the package. Those who infringe the regulation can be fined up to 3 million won. Department store operators say it costs at least 200 won  to wrap each apple in a gift set box, while a typical box costs about 10,000 won. Photo: YonhapConsidering a gift box of apples is sold at 50,000 to 70,000 won at a department store, packaging costs account for 14-20 percent of the final price of the gift set. Each year, the Environment Ministry and local governments launch campaigns at retail stores and distribution markets to prevent excessive packaging, but it is difficult to crack down on gift sets while they are on the shelf. “Unless they unpack the wrapped gift sets, I think it will be hard for them to see the packaging,” said a housewife in her 40s who said she recently bought several boxes of anchovies for her husband’s employees.Experts and civic groups say the government’s effort to crack down on excessive packaging should lead to actual legislation on curbing excessive packaging. “Packaging materials, which are mostly plastic, aluminum and Styrofoam, which cannot be recycled, do greater than expected harm to the environment. That’s why simple, powerful solutions for reducing packaging waste are needed,” Ahn Seong-joon, an official from the Korea Environment Corp., told The Korea Herald.What may be more necessary is the consumer’s voluntary efforts to oppose the culture of excess packaging.“Moving away from excessive packaging doesn’t have to undermine convenience or the ability to maintain product freshness, particularly for food,” said Choi Hong-sik, an official from Seoul Metropolitan Government’s recycling bureau. “Consumers should also put pressure on companies to reduce their environmental impact and go green, moving away from products made with unsustainable packaging practices.”By Kim Da-sol","her seoul apartment block trash ,she recently bought several boxes ,said housewife in her 40s ,gift parcels from her doorstep ,packing materials to her seoul","['Kim Mi - hee', 'Chuseok', 'Seoul', 'Styrofoam', 'Kim', 'YonhapWith Chuseok', 'Korea', 'the Korea Zero Waste Movement Network', 'Kim', 'russian', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Styrofoam', 'Ahn seong - joon', 'the Korea Environment Corp.', 'the Korea Herald', 'Choi Hong - sik', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50287724  0.14707235

Regardless of its outcome, they are convinced any armed conflict here would end with millions of casualties and the complete devastation of the South’s flourishing economy. Such worries are shaped by the notion that Seoul and its surrounding provinces, home to some 25 million Koreans and well within the range of the communist North’s artillery and ballistic missiles, would be reduced to ashes if attacked. Although Seoul is within the North’s striking range, it is not as vulnerable as many seem to believe, said Shin Won-shik, a retired Army three-star general who has overseen numerous computerized military exercises simulating all-out war with North Korea. The North will not have “unlimited freedom” in attacking the South, he added.  “Exaggerating North Korea’s threat or minimizing it -- both harm our national security,” Shin, who served as commander of the Capital Defense Command and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before leaving the Army in 2016, said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “It seems like all South Korean people are treating North Korea as if they are facing their own death. Since they are so afraid to face death, they choose to turn away from it. It’s time for a reality check on what we are really facing.” Shin Won-shik, a retired army three-star general who served as a top operational strategist at South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, poses during an interview with The Korea Herald. Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldThe defense of South Korea and US forces stationed here focus on denying the North the chance to launch those rockets and other weapons, he continued. “Usually, one TEL  carries one missile, and others are placed in storage sites. If we destroy the storage, we only have to deal with the weapons mounted on TELs. And if we take out the communication centers, the TEL becomes useless because it can’t receive an order for launch,” he said.Then the question comes down to taking out the TELs and those weapons already mounted on them. If they are not destroyed near storage sites, they could be at launch sites or on their way to them. “The route is a fixed target like a tunnel or a bridge. So we can detect and destroy it,” Shin said. “Then the TELs will end up at exposed launch sites. By concentrating on reconnaissance and airstrike assets, we can neutralize the remaining TELs.”However, if some TELs manage to survive and launch missiles, the missile shield should shoot down incoming missiles, which is more difficult than eliminating them before their launch. But the chance of interception will be dramatically increased if South Korea completes the building of a multilayered missile defense system by 2020 as planned, Shin said. North Korea released a computerized footage of Hwasong-14 missile launches in August. YonhapSimilar tactics -- destroying operational links to the weapon system before the launch -- can be applied to North Korea’s artillery cannons and rocket launchers, Shin said. North Korea has a massive artillery force deployed along the border, which it claims could turn Seoul into a “sea of fire.” The North’s 240-mm multiple rocket launchers are considered to be capable of raining up to 10,000 rounds during the first hour of such a conflict.But Shin said the North’s artillery shells are not powerful enough to penetrate the concrete structures of Seoul, and South Korea can minimize its civilian casualties by taking precautionary measures before the shells hit the ground.Evidence of this can be found in the North’s shelling of Yeonpyeongdo in 2010. Pyongyang launched an artillery barrage at the island, but it only scratched houses and facilities there. Four people died, but they were outside and without cover. Those who stayed indoors survived. “Our counterfire radar will detect incoming artillery shells and can figure out where they would come down. As long as people can find shelter in concrete structures and underground shelters when the siren goes off, they will survive,” he said.Of course, there is no “100 percent guarantee.” Unlike simulation exercises, in a real wartime situation, things can go wrong in unanticipated ways. He also warned against the growing asymmetry between the two Koreas, as the North develops nuclear weapons.  Still, Shin believes that South Koreans are overly pessimistic about their chances of surviving a North Korean attack and this could make North Korean leader Kim Jong-un think that he has a trump card in that the South would never risk a war.  “South Korea’s insensitivity to national security takes on a very negative form. It is built upon extreme fear, not self-confidence. We have to constantly signal to Kim Jong-un that any provocation would cost his life,” he stressed. “The military has been reluctant to share such information due to operational security. But that is the very reason why we are left to do nothing and turn North Korea into an invincible monster that we can never defeat.”   North Korea stages a massive rally at Pyongyang to support the regime`s missile and nuclear program. YonhapShin said one of the most efficient ways to boost deterrence against North Korea is the development of a “decapitation plan,” a clandestine operation designed to assassinate Kim, possibly with bunker-busting cruise missiles or the dispatch of special warfare elite units. It is crucial to restore the “balance of terror” with the nuclear-armed North, as the North is likely to place more value on the life of its supreme leader Kim than the millions living in Pyongyang. “The balance of terror between the two Koreas can be better achieved by putting Kim Jong-un’s life at risk,” said Shin.  “The South having the ability to take out the North’s leadership at any time would be extremely stressful not only to Kim, but his inner circle. It definitely can make them reluctant to use a nuclear weapon.” Despite Kim’s relentless pursuit of nuclear capabilities and his bellicose rhetoric for nuclear warfare, Shin said it is extremely unlikely for him to use a nuclear weapon as a pre-emptive strike because he has no death wish. “North Korea develops nuclear weapons for survival. I don’t think they will use it. ... If they drop a nuclear weapon on US territory -- or even Seoul, they know they will be wiped off the map,” he saidBy Yeo Jun-suk","defeat north korea stages massive ,most south koreans war with ,most south koreans war ,end with millions of casualties ,for most south koreans war","['South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'Shin Won - shik', 'Army', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Capital Defense Command', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Army', 'the Korea Herald', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Shin Won - shik', 'South Korea ’s', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'HeraldThe', 'South Korea', 'US', 'TEL', 'TEL', 'South Korea', 'Shin', 'North Korea', 'yonhapsimilar', 'North Korea ’s', 'Shin', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Shin', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Yeonpyeongdo', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'Shin', 'South Koreans', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'YonhapShin', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Shin', 'North ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim ’s', 'Shin', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",18,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.8255012   0.07805952

North Korea’s state media Korean Central News Agency claimed on Monday that the North Korean ruling party and parliament sent open letters to political parties and parliaments of various nations calling on them to join the “anti-US movement.”North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. YonhapThe letters justified North Korea’s nuclear program as being a deterrence against US aggression, and claimed that US President Donald Trump was pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war. The North’s state media, however, did not clarify whether the letters have been sent and did not specify the recipients of the letters. “Justice and truth are being crushed in the international stage due to the self-righteousness and abuse of authority, nuclear threat from the likes of Trump,” the Workers’ Party of Korea said, referring to the US president as a “degenerate, main culprit in destruction of peace.”The statement went on to claim that the sovereignty of nations, and the rights of the people were being violated, and called on political parties of various nations to work together against the US.“ calls on the parties of the countries that value sovereignty, justice and peace to join the anti-US movement, the anti-US front as one, to destroy the US’s reckless scheme to push the world into a nuclear disaster.”North Korea’s Supreme People’s Assembly also issued a letter repeating such claims. The letter claimed that the purpose of North Korea’s nuclear program was to “defend the sovereignty, and rights to exist and develop the country and the people against the nuclear threat and blackmail of the US.”The alleged letters come two days after the US flew bombers and fighter jets in international airspace close to North Korea in a show of force on Saturday. Although the maneuver did not involve South Korea’s military, South Korea’s presidential office has since stated that concerned authorities in Seoul were closely informed.North Korea has responded harshly to Trump’s UN address in which he lambasted Pyongyang and its leader Kim Jong-un in a typically colorful and direct manner. Saying that Kim was on a “suicide mission,” Trump said that the price of an attack against the US or its allies would be complete destruction. In response, North Korea warned of retaliation of the “highest measure,” which according to Pyongyang’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho could take the form of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific. As for the US travel ban, North Koreans were added to the list of those subjected to new restrictions in entering the US.The measures, implemented under a proclamation signed by the US president, apply to individuals from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. The restrictions, varying to some degree depending on the nationality, will go into effect on Oct. 18.Under the new measures, North Koreans will no longer be eligible for immigration and non-immigration visas. The latter includes business and tourism visas. “Making America safe is my number one priority.

The Central American country renounced its military in 1949, and has since spearheaded a path of peace and development in a region perennially engrossed in conflict and violence. According to Costa Rican Ambassador to Korea Rodolfo Solano Quiros, the pursuit of pacifism and dialogue as a national strategy has enabled channeling resources to education, health care and the environment instead, tangibly improving people’s lives.As Costa Rica and Korea mark the 55th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year, the two countries can join hands in international cooperation and laws for global peace and security, the envoy said in an interview. “We have only two armies to defend our right to live in peace and democracy -- those of our teachers and diplomats,” he told The Korea Herald last week. At a time of exacerbating tensions in and around the Korean Peninsula, “The perseverance of these common values will bring our nations closer together and forge new partnerships and collaboration in the future.”  Costa Rican Ambassador to Korea Rodolfo Solano Quiros At $12,000, Costa Rica has the second-highest per capita gross domestic product in Central America. Its politics, economy and society are stable by many estimates, and it is home to numerous global companies in advanced manufacturing, life sciences and agri-food industries, among others. Dubbed the “Switzerland of Central America,” Costa Rica frequently scores high on global happiness rankings, and last year topped the Happy Planet Index that measures welfare, life expectancy, social equality, ecological environment and other factors. Oscar Arias Sanchez, Costa Rican president from 1986 to 1990 and 2006 to 2010, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to end the Central American crisis.“One of the key factors that make us the happiest nation on earth has been our decision to abolish our military, which undoubtedly facilitated our national development,” he stressed. “The money that would otherwise go to purchasing and maintaining weapons are redirected to causes promoting people’s prosperity. For three generations since the historic decision 68 years ago, our children have not seen a single Costa Rican soldier, warplane or combat tank on our land.”In place of the military, law enforcement agencies maintain public security, and people put their faith in democracy, the rule of law, human rights and social justice, Solano Quiros said. Pointing to the popular expression “pura vida” -- meaning “pure life” -- he said his countrypeople live the good life of enjoying hot springs, beaches, golf, ecotourism and various healthful outdoor activities. Costa Rica's natural landscape “Our solidarity with our future generations also extends to our commitment to nature and sustainable development,” said the ambassador, adding Costa Rica has identified ecotourism as a vital means of increasing national wealth. Located between the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, Costa Rica is among the world’s leading ecological destinations, with more than 25 percent of its territory devoted to national parks, covering rain forests, inactive and active volcanoes, hot springs, islands, beaches, caves, river canyons and waterfalls. Over 52 percent of its land is covered by forests home to rich wildlife and vegetation. Costa Rica is also harnessing its medical and wellness tourism by drawing on its cutting-edge medical technology, professional expertise and facilities, including 29 internationally accredited hospitals. The country received 3 million tourists last year, with some 5,000 Koreans among them. The embassy in Seoul has identified companies that will provide multidestination packages for Korean travelers, said Solano Quiros.“Costa Rica’s transfer of knowledge and sharing of best practices in sustainable tourism constitutes one of the main areas of collaboration with Korea,” he said, citing the Certification for Sustainable Tourism introduced in 1997 by the Costa Rica Tourism Board, which awards entrepreneurs for their environment-conscious practices in tourism. Other initiatives in conservation and sustainable development include the government’s funding of the Environmental Services Program and the recently established Environmental Bank Foundation, designed to foster public-private partnerships involving local and micro entrepreneurs. Costa Rica is a founding member of the Global Green Growth Institute and a board member of the Green Climate Fund in Songdo, Incheon. Costa Rica's natural landscape Solano Quiros also said Costa Rica is keen to learn from Korea’s successful practices in wastewater management and public infrastructure. By drawing on renewable energy from its rich natural resources, Costa Rica is heavily committed to being a carbon-neutral economy by 2021, the year of its 200th anniversary of independence, he said. The country produces over 95 percent of its electricity from hydroelectric, geothermal and wind power, and last year had more than 150 days powered by renewable energy sources. Marking the bicentennial celebration, the Costa Rican government has sent 200 of the country’s best and brightest students to leading universities worldwide on scholarships. It also launched the Green Peace Spanish Learning Initiative through which 75 students are studying Spanish in Costa Rica’s ecological, peaceful environment. Turning to bilateral relations, Solano Quiros said the high point of the last 55 years of diplomacy was Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis Rivera’s visit to Korea in October last year. His visit culminated in the Comprehensive Strategic Cooperation Partnership between the two countries, offering a road map to strengthen ties within bilateral and multilateral settings. Key areas of cooperation in the future lie in trade and investment; environmental preservation and sustainable development; transport infrastructure; education and technical training; health care; citizen security; science, technology and innovation; good governance in public administration; gender equality; administrative decentralization; and culture, tourism and sports, according to the diplomat.  Costa Rica's natural landscape During the eighth ministerial meeting of the Forum for East Asia-Latin American Cooperation in Busan in late August, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Manuel Gonzalez Sanz came to Korea and reiterated the importance of revitalizing the interregional organization. “Under the slogan ‘two regions, one vision,’ we are taking a leap forward toward the institution’s 20th anniversary in 2019, and working to create synergies among our members, international organizations and financial institutions,” the envoy explained. The FEALAC Fund has been launched, and various working groups are enhancing collaboration in politics, sustainable development, commerce, tourism, small and medium-sized enterprises, culture, youth, gender and sports, science and technology and education and innovation. Korea and Central American countries are also awaiting the formal signing of a free trade agreement after negotiations were completed on both sides. Following parliamentary or congressional ratifications, the deal will expand trade and investment manifold from current levels, the ambassador forecast. In terms of bilateral commerce, trade between Costa Rica and Korea reached nearly $400 million last year, a 42 percent increase from the year before. Costa Rica exports to Korea electrical components, biomedical devices and components, intellectual services, coffee, pineapples, bananas and other organically grown foods. Solano Quiros said his country offers an ideal environment for foreign investors on the back of its strategic location linking Central and South Americas and abundant ecological resources. In recent years there has been a rising interest in the country’s biomedical, aerospace, renewable energy and ecotourism sectors, he added.

Despite the war six decades ago and occasional military conflicts with it thereafter, North Koreans were always “brethren” who share the same history, culture and language. Even at the height of inter-Korean tensions, there were always people in the South who sympathized with the sufferings of those across the border. This complex sentiment toward North Korea is now giving way to a more hawkish one, as the communist regime, under the young third-generation leader Kim Jong-un, has been stepping up military provocations. Many interviewed by The Korea Herald expressed anger and frustration at how a peace-loving nation, which has abided by rules and stayed away from nuclear weapons, has become more vulnerable, while a defiant, rogue regime made headway toward becoming a formidable military power. “Now that North Korea appears to be equipped with nuclear arms, I believe we also need to have the same power to stop the North,” Yu Young-eun, an office worker, told The Korea Herald. “We are the weakest country here now, and I think we also need to let neighboring and related countries know that we should be in charge of the North Korean issues.”A recent poll by Gallup Korea, conducted from Sept. 5, after the Sept. 3 nuclear weapons test by the North, shows a clear sign of hardening attitudes among South Koreans. Of 1,004 respondents, 76 percent considered the sixth atomic detonation as a threat to security. But when asked if they thought the North would initiate a war, only 37 percent answered it was possible, while 58 percent responded that that was little to no chance of such an outcome. However, 60 percent approved of South Korea rearming with nuclear weapons to respond to the North Korean threat, while 35 percent opposed the idea. US tactical nuclear weapons were withdrawn from South Korea in 1991, when the two Koreas signed an agreement on denuclearization, non-aggression and reconciliation. While the South has clung to the principle of a neclear-free Korean Peninsula, the North has abandoned it, conducting six nuclear tests so far.While nuclear rearmanent is mainly pushed by conservatives that pursue tougher policies against the North, more liberal voters also appeared to be in support of the idea, the data showed. Of the 353 respondents who viewed themselves as liberals, 47 percent approved of stationing nuclear weapons here, while 48 percent of the group opposed the idea. What is more surprising perhaps is that more Koreans even said that humanitarian aid should be cut if the North does not give up its nuclear program. In 2013, a Gallup poll showed that 47 percent of South Koreans said that humanitarian aid should continue even if North Korea continues its nuclear program. In the latest poll, the figure dropped to 32 percent, while the proportion of South Koreans opposed to the idea rose to 65 percent. Left-leaning respondents were also skeptical of offering any kind of humanitarian aid, with 52 percent of them calling for a halt. Experts viewed that the change in public sentiment reflects disappointment toward North Korea, which South Koreans considered their “northern brother” after the painful separation.“The liberals, who were thought to be relatively more friendly toward the North, are now turning their backs, as they see their northern neighbor is not so brotherly anymore,” a Gallup Korea researcher said. “Despite President Moon Jae-in’s suggestions for dialogue and peaceful approaches, the North is not taking the kindness and has only become a threat.”The researcher, who declined to reveal his name, also explained that there have been actual cases of attacks against South Korea. “One of the prime cases would be North Korea’s attack on Yeongpyeong Island. There, Koreans witnessed that, however we treat them, they can actually attack us,” he said.In November 2010, North Korea shelled the island located 80 kilometers west of Incheon, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians, and wounding 18. Another reason behind the shift in attitude may be Kim Jong-un, the North's leader who inherited power from his father and is now reinforcing his authority in such provocative ways, he added. “The way the communist state continues to show enmity toward the international society is childish. It does not know what is good for them, and we see that our kindness is not returned with kindness but ignorance and hostility,” Yang Jin-young, a 26-year old student, told The Korea Herald. Other members of the public say that the apparent irrationality of the North Korean leader seems to be the biggest threat. “I heard Kim is very impulsive and I believe that he may really launch a nuclear bomb. We should never let that happen, and I wish all concerned nations would just ignore North Korea,” said Kim Su-jin, a 30-year-old office worker. There also seems to be concerns about the changes in the way Pyongyang deals with Seoul and its allies. “What the North is demanding from the South and the international society has changed. In the past, it was just financial aid to its poor economy, but now it is calling for the ouster of the US armed forces in South Korea,” said Yeo Young-soo, a 60-year-old business owner. “What is more serious is that the North is now ignoring the South.”By Jo He-rim","north koreans were always brethren ,north korean issues recent poll ,koreans were always brethren who ,thereafter north koreans were always ,brotherly anymore gallup korea researcher","['South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Korea Herald', 'North Korea', 'Yu Young - eun', 'the Korea Herald', 'north korean', 'Gallup Korea', 'South Koreans', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Koreas', 'Koreans', 'Gallup', 'South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Gallup Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'North Korea', 'Incheon', 'south korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Yang Jin - young', 'the Korea Herald', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'Kim Su - jin', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Yeo Young', 'Jo He - rim']",18,"[ 0.          1.          3.         ... -0.78855699  1.34982133

Setia claimed the Korean man was rude, “being so racist to us without any reason.” “They let my friends, who hold Korean nationality, in easily. And when it comes to me and my Indonesian friend, he made it difficult ” Setia told The Korea Herald.When she saw her friend, another Indonesian who only gave her first name Gabrielle, was pushed down by the bouncer and had her ID card thrown on the pavement, she pushed the bouncer, Setia said.A fight ensued and she had her mouth punched by the bouncer several times until her lips were torn and bleeding. She was taken to a hospital and given eight stitches in her lips. Gabrielle said that the ordeal was linked to her ethnicity based on her experience in general in Korea. “I am used to people looking down on Indonesians. I thought that he did not like foreigners so he might have been rude to us especially because we were not white Caucasians,” she said. “When we got upset and showed it to him, I think it made him angry.” Jessica Setia says she was beaten by a male bouncer of the Busan club Groove. The club told The Korea Herald that there had been no discrimination based on ethnicity or gender that night, expressing regret over criticism of the establishment due to her “one-sided” argument. “Our club checks identities of all customers, regardless of their ethnicities, through the same procedure. There is no racial discrimination at all,” the club said in a statement.It was Setia who first used curse words and shook her fist at the bouncer and the bouncer's action to defend himself led to the injury on her lips, the club added.Busan Seomyeon Police Station said that an investigation was underway, with those involved to be called in again to testify. “The man argues that it was a two-way assault. Due to the fight, the left side of his cheek became swollen, according to our investigation. We are going to further investigate the case on Monday,” said a police officer from the team in charge of the initial investigation into the case. Setia’s experience at the club went viral on social media after her friend Joshua Irwin wrote a post that describes what happened to Setia and him that night, along with a picture of her bleeding in her mouth. The post received more than 1,000 likes, 650 shares and 200 comments as of Sunday afternoon after it was first published on Saturday morning. Many of the comments made by foreign residents in Korea showed support for Setia and rage at what they view as discriminative action. They also shared similar treatment they had experienced here.Behind the reason that such a “small” provocation could lead to such brutal treatment is the “outdated” and “misogynistic” belief that men are superior to women, Irwin said.“This idea is endemic in many societies . This altercation happened because within this way of thinking, if woman doesn’t follow protocols and by doing so disrespects a man then she needs to be checked and punished,” he said. “Furthermore, being a white foreigner is unquestionably more influential than being a foreigner who doesn’t look white or is from another Asian country,” Irwin said. “Had it been a Korean woman, or a white woman, or a male then I am sure this would not have escalated as quickly as it had.”Amanda Bastos, an American citizen who has lived here for seven years, also talked about foreigners’ distrust toward the police. “Most likely, it happened because she was a foreigner and he knew that no one would do anything about it. Also, I think there is very little accountability when violence happens towards foreigners.”It is not the first time that foreigners in Korea have said that clubs and bars discriminate against them based on their ethnicity. In early June, Kislay Kumar, a 25-year-old Indian national, was denied entry to a bar in Itaewon, multicultural district in Seoul, because of his nationality. He was told “No Indian” by a bouncer, according to a video footage. His friends from other countries were allowed entry. South Korea, one of the most homogenous countries in Asia, lags behind in international standards in terms of racism and diversity, experts say. The United Nations special rapporteur on racism, Mutuma Ruteere, urged South Korea in 2014 to enact an anti-discrimination law to curb racism and xenophobia, given the country’s history of ethnic and cultural homogeneity. According to a 2015 survey of 4,000 adults by the Ministry of Gender and Family Affairs, 25.7 percent of respondents said that they did not want people of different races as neighbors.

McCain.   He said Malaysian authorities, involved in the three-nation air and sea search for the sailors, had also found a body and it was being transferred to the US Navy for identification. USS John S. McCain. Yonhap   Apart from the missing, five sailors were injured.     The latest accident happened before dawn Monday in busy shipping lanes around the Strait of Singapore, with water flooding into the vessel after the huge hole was torn in the hull.   It was the second fatal collision in two months -- after the USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship off Japan in June and left seven sailors dead -- and the fourth accident in the Pacific this year involving an American warship.   The incidents have sparked concerns that the US Navy could be overstretched in Asia -- both ships were from the Japan-based Seventh Fleet -- as they tackle China's rising assertiveness and North Korea's nuclear ambitions.   The McCain had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a ""freedom of navigation operation"" in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August, sparking a furious response from Beijing.   On Monday the Chief of US Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered commanders within a week to set aside time, perhaps ""one or two days"", for crews to sit down together for discussions.   A ""comprehensive review"" of practices would also begin.    ""As you know, this is the second collision in three months and the last of a series of incidents in the Pacific theatre,"" Richardson said.   ""This trend demands more forceful action. As such, I have directed an operational pause be taken in all of our fleets around the world.""   The admiral did not rule out some kind of outside interference or a cyber-attack being behind the latest collision, but said he did not want to prejudge the inquiry. His broader remarks suggested a focus on ""how we do business on the bridge.""   The damaged vessel is named after US Senator John McCain's father and grandfather, who were both admirals in the US navy.   The tanker involved in the collision, which was used for transporting oil and chemicals and weighed over 30,000 gross tonnes, sustained some damage but no crew were injured, and Singapore said there was no oil pollution.","divers searching for 10 missing ,searching for 10 missing sailors ,following the latest deadly warship ,sailors had also found body ,the latest deadly warship collision","['US', 'Singapore', 'the US Pacific Fleet', 'the US Navy', 'Scott Swift', 'USS John S.

But the June photo showed none of the vehicles remained except for a truck parked there. This file photo, taken Aug. 11, 2017, from the Dora Observatory in Paju, north of Seoul, shows the now-shuttered South Korean industrial park  in the North Korean city of Kaesong. The missing vehicles, which were used by many South Korean companies, were reportedly gathered at the apparels company's spacious parking lot after the complex's shutdown.VOA said it looked at other companies' premises but failed to locate any of the vehicles.There is speculation that the North's authorities may have moved the vehicles out of the complex to liquidate the South's assets there.Shortly after Seoul decided to shut down the complex, the North deported South Korean workers from the complex and one month later said it would liquidate all of the assets held by the South.Opened in 2004, the factory zone had housed 124 South Korean firms hiring more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.South Korea's unification ministry said it has no information to verify whether the VOA report is true but made clear that North Korea's possible use of those vehicles is an illegal act that violates local firms' property rights.""Cars and other property at the Kaesong complex belong to South Korean firms. , North Korea should immediately stop as they don't have our authorization,"" a ministry official said.","february 2016 when seoul shut ,100 south korean owned cars ,2016 when seoul shut down ,shuttered south korean industrial park ,north deported south korean workers","['south korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kaesong', 'Voice of America', 'US', 'Digital Globe Inc.', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Paju', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Kaesong', 'south korean', 'VOA', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'VOA', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kaesong', 'south korean', 'North Korea']",0,"[ 0.          6.          3.         ... -0.26672545  0.44094771

Opened in 2004, the factory zone had housed 124 South Korean firms hiring more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.Another photo taken by Digital Globe on May 19 showed two to three buses, which were believed to be commuter buses for the complex's workers, running in the downtown of the North Korean city.","15 commuter buses were missing ,korean owned commuter buses left ,february 2016 when seoul shut ,2016 when seoul shut down ,korean workers from their houses","['south Korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kaesong', 'Voice of America', 'US', 'Digital Globe Inc.', 'US', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'VOA', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'VOA', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Digital Globe', 'north korean']",0,"[ 0.          1.          5.         ... -0.31661424  0.60412985

They have discussed the establishment of a 50-member committee and recently agreed to push to appoint former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik as the head of the committee and first lady Kim Jung-sook as its honorary head.On Monday Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon relayed the proposal to the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, which gave a positive response, the officials said.The prime minister, a former South Jeolla governor, has shown keen interest in the two nuns.Lee asked Kim Youn-joon, a priest of the cathedral on the island, to show a documentary about their life to government officials.After graduating from the nursing college of the University of Innsbruck, the two women came to the island in 1962 and 1966, separately, upon hearing that the colony was in need of nurses. They resided on the island for more than 40 years to work at the National Sorok Island Hospital before returning to their home country in 2005.Despite their long years of duty, the two, often called ""the Angels of Sorok Island,"" did not receive any remuneration for their service and only devoted themselves to caring for leprosy patients there.According to the officials who met them in Austria in June this year, the two are currently in a healthier condition than worried, though Marianne developed cancer a few years ago and Margaeta is suffering a mild case of dementia.The government presented them with medals in 1972, 1983 and 1996 for their contributions to the country and awarded them certificates of honorary South Korean citizenship in June this year.The Sorok colony was founded on the small island in 1916 during Japan's colonial rule of Korea , as they attempted to quarantine patients with leprosy. Infected people were rounded up and taken to the island for isolation and treatment. The South Korean government forced them to remain there until 1963, nearly two decades after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Hundreds of people who suffered from the disease still reside on the island even after having been cured.","marianne developed cancer few years ,recommend two austrian nuns who ,the nobel peace prize officials ,aug 2017 sister marianne stoeger ,recommend two austrian nuns","[""South Korea 's"", 'austrian', 'Marianne Stoeger', 'Margareta Pissar', ""South Korea 's"", 'Sorok Island', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Goheung', 'Marianne Stoeger', 'Austria', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party', 'south korean', 'Kim Hwang', 'Kim Jung - sook', 'Lee Nak - yon', 'Cheong', 'South Jeolla', 'Lee', 'Kim Youn - joon', 'the University of Innsbruck', 'the National Sorok Island Hospital', 'Austria', 'Marianne', 'Margaeta', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Korea', 'japanese']",0,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.83258355  0.8173542

The leaflet campaign is one of the main sources of tension between the two Koreas.South Korea's unification ministry said that the government reviewed how to handle it as a follow-up to President Moon Jae-in's peace initiative unveiled in Berlin last month. ""Sending leaflets near the border could spark unnecessary military tensions, including a possible accidental conflict. It also poses a real threat to the safety of border-area residents,"" Baek Tai-hyun, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.But the spokesman added that the issue has complexity amid conflicting views that the leaflet campaign is within the realm of freedom of expression, while the move does little good in improving inter-Korean relations.""We believe that in handling the issue, various factors, including inter-Korean ties and public sentiments, should be taken into account,"" he added.President Moon Jae-in ordered government officials to find ways to stop the anti-North Korea propaganda leaflets from being sent, a presidential official said last week.The government under Moon's predecessor said that the government cannot curb the leaflet launch as it is a matter of freedom of speech but added the move should not pose serious threats to residents living near the border.In October 2014, the North fired machine guns at balloons launched by activists. Some bullets landed in the South's territory, but no one was hurt.The two Koreas agreed in June 2004 to end propaganda campaigns, including border broadcasts and sending leaflets, under the liberal government of late former President Roh Moo-hyun. But civic activists kept sending balloons carrying leaflets, inviting North Korea's backlash.At that time, all Seoul could do was to call on activists to stop their leaflet dispatches, because the government cannot ban such activities, though the move violated the inter-Korean agreement, according to officials.","leaflets inviting north korea backlash ,korean border officials said monday ,inviting north korea backlash at ,korean defector activists move to ,berlin last month sending leaflets","['South Korea', 'anti - pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'Koreas', ""South Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'Berlin', 'Baek Tai - hyun', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'north Korea', 'Moon', 'Koreas', 'Roh Moo - hyun', ""North Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'inter - korean']",0,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.31035775  0.50896913

Gathering here at an assistance center in Nowon, northeastern Seoul, were defectors from North Korea training for basic job skills to help them survive in the capitalistic world that is South Korea.  Senior North Korean defectors learn how to pack envelopes in plastic wrappings at a Korea Hana Foundation assistance center in Seoul. But chances for them to land a decent job, or even the menial, low-paying jobs that most defectors end up with, are not very high. About 40 percent of the defector population of 30,000 in South Korea are jobless, said Kim Hee-bong, manager of the Korea Hana Foundation’ defector self-reliance support team. Senior defectors are perhaps the least privileged group in the country’s fiercely competitive job market. On top of the many handicaps that usually comes with the tag of being a North Korean defector, such as language barrier, cultural differences, and social discrimination, older ones have age and health issues and tend to be slow learners.  “Most of them suffer from some form of illness -- it’s mainly due to malnutrition in the North, and disabilities they suffered while crossing the inter-Korean border,” said Kim. To alleviate the issue, state-run defector aid agencies such as Hanawon and Kim’s Hana Foundation are running facilities and programs to help them lead a financially independent life. The Nowon assistance center is one such facility.  Seo Yoo-jung, the chief manager of the center who is a defector herself, said defectors face hardships in adjusting to a capitalist economy. Seo supervised the first senior job training program at the center when it opened in July.  “In North Korea, we are told what to do -- work there doesn’t require as much creative thinking as it does here,” Seo said.  “The language is also different here, which is why defectors experience difficulties even while serving in restaurants. It’s challenging to communicate with customers here.” According to Seo, most defectors lack office skills, which forces them to take basic jobs in the service sector, such as restaurant servers. Also, they believe office work here is too rigorous and competitive by their standards.  A male defector in his 60s participating in the job program in Nowon was forced to accept the harsh reality, but stressed that being jobless was not what he aimed for. “The work culture in South Korea took a toll on me both physically and mentally,” a defector surnamed Han said. “But staying at home  was much worse.” To bring down the barrier, Hanawon has been providing funds to defectors willing to enter and complete its 500-hour job training program since 2005. Women, especially single mothers who risked their lives to bring their children to the South with them, are also suffering from the lack of jobs here. Government data shows that 70 percent of the defector population are women. “I came to South Korea eight years ago with my daughter and son,” said a female defector in her 40s, who requested anonymity. “Foreigners who work here have the freedom to visit their motherland, but we don’t. I find companionship at the center where I can talk with my fellow defectors from my home country,” she tearfully said. North Korean defectors earn an average of 1.5 million won  a month, which amounts to just about 67 percent of South Korea’s average monthly wage of 2.3 million won, according to data released by the National Assembly Budget Office in 2016. Financial hardships are among the biggest difficulties they face here. In a 2015 government survey of 12,000 defectors, 20.9 percent of the group had suicidal thoughts at least once after their arrival in South Korea, 6.8 percentage points higher than South Koreans. About 30 percent stated financial hardships as the main reason.

The North apparently points to North Korean female defectors who were arrested and repatriated to the country after fleeing.The report was submitted to the UN committee ahead of a country review session slated for early November.The North said that a majority of those women were found to illegally cross the border with China as they suffered from economic difficulties or were lured by human trafficking groups.""Therefore, they were not subjected to any legal punishment, and are now enjoying stabilized life thanks to the all-embracing, benevolent politics of the state,"" the report said.It said that 33 women were sentenced to punishment for grave crimes, such as drug trafficking and attempted murder, while staying abroad without valid travel permits in the cited period.North Korea's claim is not seen as true as Pyongyang is notorious for its widespread human rights violations. The North does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.The report said that a legal fund was set up and a bank opened under the Korean Bar Association to offer financial support to women who had been trafficked abroad or filed suits against alleged abductors before courts in foreign countries.The move may indicate that North Korea seeks to crack down on activities of brokers who help North Koreans escape the repressive regime.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is believed to have ordered tightened surveillance of his people since he assumed power in late 2011.Since the second half of 2015, North Korea is known to have bolstered border control and set up high-tension wires around the Tumen River, which flows between the North and China, to curb North Koreans' defections.","473 north korean women returned ,north korean female defectors ,north korean female defectors who ,to north korean female defectors ,korean female defectors who","['North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'the UN Committee on the Elimination of discrimination against Women', 'north korean', 'UN', 'North', 'China', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'the Korean Bar Association', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'China', ""North Koreans '""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.48726171  0.63765985

The scholar, Kim Moon-gil, a Japanese language professor at Busan University of Foreign Studies, donated the clothes to the National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation in 2016, and the museum asked the National Archives in February this year to conduct preservation treatment on them before putting them on public display.In the course of the treatment, the National Archives traced where the clothes were made, and confirmed they were produced and distributed by Japan's army. That represents proof that Japan's government operated military brothels, Kim said.The National Archives said it has completed preservation treatment of the clothes for five months and returned them to the museum. The museum in the southern city of Busan plans to put the clothes on display on Liberation Day on Aug. 15.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.

The discovery came amid Japan's repeated sovereignty claims to South Korea's easternmost islets.The manuscript owned by a Japanese national is estimated to have been created between 1864 and 1889, Nam said. It used to belong to a library in Pyongyang, North Korea, and it is unknown how it was brought to Japan, Nam added. Inside the map remained the library's serial number and the date it was obtained -- Aug. 30, 1932.The discovery resulted from cooperation among Nam, Yukio Fujimoto, honorary professor at University of Toyama, and professor Kim Seong-su from Cheongju University in North Chungcheong Province. The image provided by Prof. Nam Kwon-hee shows the handwritten version of the Korean map Daedongyeojido created by Kim Jeong-ho. The National Diet Library of Japan is believed to possess one copy of the handwritten Daedongyeojido with Dokdo on it and the Research Institute for Korean Studies has another copy, the registered cultural property No. 638.The handwritten Daedongyeojido is an improvement of cartographer Kim's orginal woodprint version, which didn't include Dokdo. ""On a colored  map that Kim Jeong-ho completed in 1834, Dokdo was marked on the right side of Ulleungdo, but on Daedongyeojido created later than this didn't have Dokdo on it,"" Nam said. ""We think Kim added Dokdo to Daedongyeojido when producing the handwritten version.""The newly found map also contains an additional 2,000 pieces of geographical, architectural and historic data absent from the woodprint version.","19th century korean map which ,19th century korean map ,century korean map ,korean map made by cartographer ,century korean map which marks","['korean', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Nam Kwon - hee', 'Kyungpook National University', 'Daedongyeojido', 'korean', 'Kim Jeong - ho', 'Japan', 'Japan', ""South Korea 's"", 'japanese', 'Nam', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Nam', 'Nam', 'Yukio Fujimoto', 'University of Toyama', 'Kim Seong - su', 'Cheongju University', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Nam Kwon - hee', 'korean', 'Daedongyeojido', 'Kim Jeong - ho', 'the National Diet Library of', 'Japan', 'Daedongyeojido', 'the Research Institute', 'Korean Studies', 'Daedongyeojido', 'Kim', 'Kim Jeong - ho', 'Ulleungdo', 'Daedongyeojido', 'Kim', 'Daedongyeojido']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43856379  0.83344173

A combination of photos carried by North Korea`s main newspaper Rodong Sinmun on July 28, 2017, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visiting the Fatherland Liberation War Martyrs Cemetery a day earlier to mark the 64th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice Agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.  The armistice anniversary passed without any provocative act despite speculation that the country may be preparing to launch another missile around Thursday following its test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4.Kim resumed his public appearances after 15 days by visiting the cemetery in Pyongyang, raising speculation that the repressive regime may delay its missile launch.The armistice was signed on July 27, 1953, leaving South and North Korea technically in a state of war. The North has designated the date as Victory Day to celebrate what it claims is its victory against the United States during the war.The North has claimed that it is developing nuclear weapons as a deterrent to what it called Washington's hostile policy toward it.The repressive regime's possible provocation could deal a blow to President Moon Jae-in's push for engagement with the North at a time when the US is trying to tighten sanctions on Pyongyang.Seoul had offered to hold inter-military talks Thursday to ease border tensions, and has proposed Red Cross talks on Tuesday to resume reunions of families torn apart by the war.

The meeting comes as the government and the ruling party push for a tax hike on “super large companies” and high income individuals in its drive to reduce economic polarization. The meeting took place in the gardens of the presidential office, with the president and the business leaders partaking in craft beer produced by a local small business.President Moon Jae-in enjoys a beer with Korea’s corporate tycoons in the gardens of the Blue House in Seoul, Thursday. From right: Moon, Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman Park Yong-maan, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Chung Eui-sun, Hanwha Group Vice Chairman Keum Choon-soo, Doosan Group Chairman Park Jeong-won and Presidential Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok. Moon and the business leaders then retreated into a meeting to discuss the new government’s policy direction, as well as outstanding economic issues. At the meeting, Moon elaborated on his vision of “income led growth” and his ideas for job creation. Job creation has been one of Moon’s key agendas since the election campaign, and he has since installed a monitor displaying labor market figures in Cheong Wa Dae. According to Cheong Wa Dae, the meeting lasted more than two hours, going far over the initially planned 50 minutes, with the president and attending businessmen freely exchanging views. The meeting called together the chiefs and vice chiefs of some of the largest conglomerates, and Ottogi, a South Korean food company. The business leaders present at Thursday’s meeting were vice chairmen Chung Eui-sun of Hyundai Motor, Koo Bon-joon of LG Group, Keum Choon-soo of Hanwha Group, Chung Yong-jin of Shinsegae Group, and chairmen Kwon Oh-joon of Posco, Park Jeong-won of Doosan Group, Sohn Kyung-shik of CJ Group and Ham Young-joon of Ottogi.  LG Group Vice Chairman Koo Bon-joon  and Posco Chairman Kwon Oh-joon  Ottogi Chairman Ham Young-joon and Shinsegae Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin At the meeting, the Hyundai Motor vice chairman also touched on China‘s economic reprisal over Seoul’s decision to deploy US missile defense system THAAD was cutting the company‘s sales in China. He added that the company would seek to cooperate with Korean startups.According to Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun, Doosan’s Park Jeong-won expressed concerns for difficulties arising from the Moon administration‘s nuclear free policy, which may put an end to Shin-Kori 5 and 6 reactors’ construction, but that the company will seek new revenue chanels overseas. Although Ottogi ranks far below the other groups represented at the event, the food maker’s chief was invited in consideration of its efforts for providing equal opportunity to its workers. Alongside its ramen business, the company gained fame in recent years for its charitable activities and for hiring almost all of its workers on regular contracts. Of the company’s employees, about 1.1 percent are on irregular contracts. Along with the business leaders, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Paik Un-gyu and Chairman of the Financial Services Commission Choi Jong-ku attended the meeting.  President Moon with a group of business leaders at Cheong Wa Dae Along with Moon administration’s top economic policy makers, Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission Kim Sang-jo, often referred to by the Korean media as the “chaebol sniper” was in attendance.

But in South Korea, people just see her as a “fat woman” unfit to be a fashion model. “In Korean society, there are categories for only ‘normal’ or ‘average’ people. The rest don’t belong anywhere, and fat people are just mocked. They consider being fat as lazy, disgusting and unhealthy,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “It is not true and it is none of others’ business,” said Kim, 31, who is a US size 14 and 165 centimeters tall. “It has been a long time since I’ve shopped in Korea because there are not many sizes here I can try on.” Kim, who debuted as a model in the US in 2010, now owns magazine 66110. It runs articles on fashion issues for plus-size women and sells clothes for them as part of efforts to fight against the country’s long-held beauty norm.“Being fat is not a problem just like being slim, having short or long hair isn’t a problem.”Women’s rights activists protest the lack of size-range and biased depiction of women in the Korean fashion industry in Myeong-dong, Seoul, Wednesday. On Wednesday, an association of six women’s rights groups criticized clothing companies for using mannequins idealizing too-thin figures and making only limited sizes in clothing, which they said solidifies an unrealistic beauty standard. According to the report by the Korea Women’s Environmental Network on 31 clothing companies, including FOREVER21, H&M;, Uniqulo and MIXXO, 74.2 percent of them failed to offer various sizes -- only retaining three sizes. Of those, 95.5 percent were local brands. Only 25 percent of the surveyed retailers had an XS size and 30.1 percent had an XL. In terms of sleeveless shirts, only 11 of 31 brands had an XL size and only seven brands had an XS. As for short skirts, out of 26 brands, six retailers had an XS size or smaller, and only two brands had an XL size and bigger, it said.  Women’s rights activists protest the lack of size-range and biased depiction of women in the Korean fashion industry in Myeong-dong, Seoul, Wednesday. They have called for varied body sizes of mannequins and clothing to be showcased by retailers, as well as an act demanding retailers to denote retouched images in their advertisements.A standard mannequin in South Korea is 175 to 180 centimeters tall, has a waist measurement of 24 inches and a hip measurement of 89 centimeters. But the average woman aged 20 to 24 in the country is 160 centimeters tall and has a waist size of 28 inches and hip size of 92.7 centimeters, according to the Korea Agency for Technology and Standards in 2015. Women’s rights activists protest the lack of size-range and biased depiction of women in the Korean fashion industry in Myeong-dong, Seoul, Wednesday. “It is common to see women who say they could not find items available in their sizes, especially feminine items like skirts,” Ko Kum-sook from KWEN said. “Limited sizes not only spread a distorted standard for beauty, but also make women think that it is their fault to be too heavy.”“Many women are constantly on a diet, suffering from mental distress and eating disorders,” she said. “More sizes mean women’s health rights better protected.”In a 2013 study by Samyook University in Seoul that surveyed 233 female university students only 11.5 percent said that they were satisfied with their bodies. On the other hand, 93.5 percent of 154 students who are in the normal range said that they were unhappy with their bodies.  “I used to think about losing weight all the time. When I saw women looking perfect in their clothes in advertising, I tried it on. But when I didn’t look like it, I got disappointed,” said Kim Ah-yeong, a women’s rights activist at Bulggot Femi Action.Both women and men cannot avoid facing lookism, but it places a heavier burden on women, she said. “Many men also take interest in taking care of their appearance, but doing that is almost a must for women. It seems like there are stereotypes for women’s looks, such as thin arms and legs, muscular thighs and big breasts.” Though beauty standards vary all over the world, many other countries also place an emphasis on being skinny. But it is especially pronounced here, a scholar said. “Limited options for sizes are linked to Korean society putting too much stress on having certain types of looks, which can be seen in many Koreans going under the knife,” said Seol Dong-hoon, sociology professor at Jeonbuk University. According to a survey on 459 men and women in their 20s by Univ 20 magazine and Banobagi Plastic Surgery in 2016, 46.4 percent of them said they had received plastic surgery. Of them, 44.5 percent said they had done so because they had been envious of others’ looks. In 2007, legislation was introduced in Korea to make it mandatory for clothing manufacturers to make various sizes including big ones, but failed to pass through the National Assembly. In 2015, France enforced a law prohibiting unhealthy models on its runways and requiring advertisers to indicate in text in cases where images of models were digitally retouched. The US proposed a similar bill this year.By Ock Hyun-ju","fat woman unfit to be ,233 female university students only ,fat woman unfit ,fat woman unfit to ,unfit to be fashion model","['the United States', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Gee - yang', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'US', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'US', 'korean', 'Myeong - dong', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Women ’s Environmental Network', 'H&M', 'Uniqulo', 'MIXXO', 'XL', 'XL', 'XL', 'korean', 'Myeong - dong', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Agency for Technology', 'korean', 'Myeong - dong', 'Seoul', 'Ko Kum - sook', 'Samyook University', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ah - yeong', 'Bulggot Femi Action', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Seol Dong - hoon', 'Jeonbuk University', 'Univ 20', 'Banobagi Plastic Surgery', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'France', 'US', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78237396  0.47914815

It would make pregnant women entitled to use them. The law, in effect since 2003, compels public parking lots to set aside space exclusively for the disabled. “A revision is needed to support women who decide to bear a baby in the era of low pregnancy rate,” Rep. Kim said. The amendment bill also intends to raise the penalty on violations to 500,000 won  from the current 200,000 won. In the TV show, the citizen claimed that pregnant women experience difficulty and also dizziness when they try to park in regular parking lots, since they cannot move freely with their stomachs hitting the steering wheel.

YonhapThe Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency is looking into the route Lim used to re-enter North Korea by analyzing data including her personal phone and financial transaction records, said police on Wednesday,Lim appeared in an online propaganda video released by North Korea’s state-run website Uriminzokkiri on Sunday. She said she had “returned on her own will” and was forced to slander the communist regime during her time in the South. In the clip, she was introduced as Jeon Hye-sung. “Lim Ji-hyun” is believed to be an alias given to her as part of Seoul’s defector protection program. “I thought I could eat well and make a lot of money in South Korea, but every day was like hell there,” Lim said in the video clip. She also urged other defectors in South Korea to return to the North.“Let’s return to our motherland and see our parents’ faces before we die,” she said. Lim was a TV personality in the South. She starred in reality show programs including “South Korean Men and North Korean Women” and “Moranbong Club.”The reality TV star defected to South Korea in January 2014 after spending three years in China. She left for China in April for unknown reasons and stated in the video clip she had crossed the North Korean border in June. Despite Lim’s claims that she volunteered to return to the North, her friends and acquaintances have raised doubts, saying all her belongings in her residence in Gangnam had remained after her departure. “Experts are carefully suggesting that Lim had become a target of the North Korean State Security Department,” Rep. Cheong Yang-seog, deputy floor leader of the conservative Bareun Party, said during a general meeting Tuesday. “If she went back voluntarily, she would have taken care of her assets here, but most of it seems untouched.”An unnamed source told Joongang Ilbo that Lim had not been classified as a “subject of concern” by Hanawon, meaning she was not experiencing major difficulties in adjusting to life in the South. Hanawon is a state-run agency in charge of offering settlement support to defectors. Another source close to Lim suggested she might have traveled to China to bring her family members in North Korea to the South. Lim said in Sunday’s broadcast that she is currently living with her parents in Anju, South Pyongan Province. Police reports also showed that Lim had a Chinese spouse whom she left in China when she defected. She reportedly frequently visited China to see her husband. The pair had no children together. It is not uncommon for defectors in the South to hire brokers to reunite them with their North Korean family members at the North Korea-China border and return to South Korea with them. It is, however, a risky move, as such areas are under heavy surveillance by North Korean agents. Lee So-yul, a fellow defector and online broadcaster, defended Lim after her denunciation by the South Korean government Tuesday, saying, “She probably had no choice in order to survive in the North.”Defector Lee then raised the possibility of torture and threats, saying Lim’s facial expression in the video was that of a person “begging to stay alive.”The number of North Korean defectors dropped 20.8 percent in the first half of 2017 on-year, data from South Korea’s Ministry of Unification has showed. It is believed that North Korean strong man Kim Jong-un has been toughening border controls and punishments for escape attempts since he rose to power in 2011.

The Korea Herald has interviewed nine former teachers from the Canadian British Columbia International School in eastern Seoul, which shut down in May after 14 teachers and the dean were deported, and other English immersion institutions currently under investigation. Two former employees from CBIS are taking legal action against the Korea Immigration Service and are fighting their deportation. An empty science room at now-disbanded Canadian British Columbia International School in eastern Seoul. According to their claim, the teachers were wrongly advised to apply for a visa type valid only for language instructors, when they were to teach regular school subjects such as math and science. The immigration service, which should have known this as it reviewed their employment contract, granted the applicants the wrong visa. E-2 visa holders are limited to teaching language conversation classes only. “The immigration office should nullify the departure order and one-year entry prohibition against our clients as they had rightly obtained the visa to work as teachers,” said Pete J. Rhee from Rhee’s Law Office who represents Robert Flower and Kristen Hendricks. Employment contracts which the two submitted to immigration for a visa, and which have been seen by The Korea Herald, clearly state details about their teaching duties, including the subjects. Alex Hebb, another former teacher at CBIS, had his E-2 visa extended by one year after submitting the updated work contract that included his teaching duties. He left South Korea in May, following a departure order. “It doesn’t make sense that Korean immigration would punish us so harshly. They had all of the information they needed and approved our E-2 visas,” said Hebb. “They suddenly decided that we shouldn’t be approved. There was no other way to communicate to us that we should switch visas,” he claimed. Seoul Immigration Office, a branch office in Seoul at the helm of the clampdown, refused to comment on these claims. It, however, said that the investigation into foreign residents teaching subjects other than their native language on E-2 visas is “still open and ongoing” in a written response. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official at Korea Immigration Service explained the review process of E-2 visa applications tends to be loose, as its applicants are thought to be highly educated and less likely to commit crimes. “The process is supposed to include a thorough review of applicants’ work contracts under which students will be taught,” the source said. The current visa dispute involves foreign education institutions operating in a legal gray area. For instance, the now-closed CBIS was an alternative school certified by the Canadian province of British Columbia, but not authorized as a school by the Korean education office. Since it was operating under a hagwon license, it was unable to sponsor E-7 visas for school teachers. There are scores of other global academies, registered as hagwon here but in reality operate as international schools. Laura Murray, who taught at one such institution in Seoul and is now facing deportation, said teachers are suffering from the errors made by their employers, education offices that allowed them to operate and immigration. “Although I understand this was practiced by other schools in the past and was viewed as falling under a legal gray area, the reality is it is illegal. The foreign teachers trusted our employers to do their jobs well and assumed everything was legal. “I blame the education office for issuing the hagwon license without a thorough review,” she said. No one is offering to take any responsibility for all the damage, from the cost of a flight back home to the impact that the deportation and the one-year re-entry ban would have on her relationship with her Korean boyfriend, she claimed. An anonymous teacher who taught at Canada Maple International School, which is certified by the Province of Manitoba in Canada to deliver the Manitoba curriculum, said it is in the best interest of future foreign teachers here to “know exactly what kind of visa they are getting and what they are allowed to teach under said visa” before accepting a job offer.“There are about 22 teachers at CMIS; about half of them are leaving the country. We were lied to at the beginning of our contracts. We were told that CMIS was an international school and that we were accredited as such. It wasn’t until later in my contract that I discovered that we are a hagwon and that some teachers here are working under the wrong visa. Because some of us teach core subjects such as science and history, an E-2 visa is inappropriate for our work,” the teacher said.By Bak Se-hwan","ongoing deportations of foreign teachers ,deported teachers claimed the korea ,the government body deported teachers ,government body deported teachers ,deportations of foreign teachers","['south korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'canadian', 'British Columbia International School', 'Seoul', 'CBIS', 'the Korea Immigration Service', 'canadian', 'British Columbia International School', 'Seoul', 'Pete J.

The Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of a Chinese woman who asked the court to cancel the Justice Ministry’s decision not to allow her to become a naturalized Korean citizen. The ruling came after the Justice Ministry disapproved the 47-year-old woman’s application for Korean citizenship last October, citing that she was responsible for the divorce.According to the Nationality Act, foreign residents who have lived in Korea for more than five years can apply for Korean citizenship. Migrant spouses who are unable to meet this condition for reasons they are not responsible for -- such as divorce due to domestic violence -- can still seek to be naturalized if approved by the Justice Ministry. “The plaintiff qualifies to be naturalized as a Korean citizen as she has lived here for more than five years from 2008 to October 2016,” the court said. The Chinese woman stayed in South Korea on a marriage-based F-2-1 visa since November 2008. She married a Korean man in September that year. Her husband subjected her to constant physical abuse, including burning her with a cigarette. She ran away from home and filed for divorce in July 2011, which was finalized in May 2012. She then applied for Korean nationality in 2014. The Justice Ministry turned down the application, saying she was responsible for the divorce because she fled from her home and husband. The ministry also cited that she was not able to make a living for herself here. The court ruled that the ministry “abused” its authority, acknowledging that she could not continue the marriage due to the violence from her husband. It also viewed that she is able to make a living in Korea, given she has paid for insurance coverage since May 2009.By Ock Hyun-ju","old woman application for korean ,woman application for korean citizenship ,filed for divorce in july ,migrant woman whose marriage ended ,november 2008 she married korean","['korean', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'chinese', 'the Justice Ministry ’s', 'korean', 'the Justice Ministry', 'korean', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Justice Ministry', 'korean', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'f-2', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70838398  0.15063749

Equipped with a Sony digital camera, the drone reportedly had more than 250 pictures, mostly of forest and villages. The pictures of Seongju were clear enough to make out two THAAD launchers and its radar installed, the official added.The incident could be a staged show with the deliberate intention to provoke the allies, rather than a real spy activity, the JCS official said, adding that the drone appears to be lacking the technology to transmit the imagery back to the North. “We are trying to figure out whether the North intended to provoke  as it did in 2014,” said the official, adding that the military is currently trying to find out whether there are additional drones sent from the North. North Korea has flown spy drones before. In 2014, one of them was found to have spied on the presidential residence of Cheong Wa Dae. At that time, the South Korean defense ministry concluded that the drone did not pose “a direct threat” to national security. Nevertheless, the military has ramped up vigilance against North Korean spying activities, establishing what they call an “integrated system” between the Army and the Air Force to detect and intercept the drones. But there are still challenges to exactly locate and intercept small-size drones with current surveillance and anti-missile capability, particularly in the border region where battle area is spread out across the Military Demarcation Line, the official added. “Given that the border region is so broad, it takes time to develop advanced radars and anti-air artilleries fit for the region,” said another JCS official. “We have forward-deployed some anti-missile assets. Although there is a challenge, we did our best.”The drone, discovered last week, is thought to have traveled more than 500 kilometers before crashing down on a mountain near Injae, Gangwon Provicne. The THAAD battery in Seongju is located about 270 kilometers from the crash site. The device is bigger than the one that the South has recovered in 2014, the JCS said. It also employs a twin engine, not a single engine used by the previous model, the military added.By Yeo Jun-suk","korea has flown spy drones ,the drone discovered last week ,north korean drone an analysis ,spy drones before in 2014 ,north korean drone was found","['north korean', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Seongju', 'Seongju', 'JCS', 'Sony', 'Seongju', 'JCS', 'North Korea', 'Cheong', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Army', 'the Air Force', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'JCS', 'Injae', 'Seongju', 'JCS', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",0,"[ 0.          1.          3.         ... -0.36647493  0.87080115

According to a survey conducted on 1,004 adults by Gallup Korea, 34 percent of the respondents supported same-sex marriages, while 58 percent of them opposed it. Some 8 percent reserved their answers. The findings showed a huge generational gap on the issue: The older they were the more likely they were to hold a negative view.A majority of 20-something people, or 66 percent, were in favor of legalizing the same-sex union, while 52 percent of those in their 30s opposed it. The percentage of people holding a negative view stood at 54 percent for the 40-49 age group, 70 percent for the 50-59 group and 76 percent among those over 60. The proportion of Koreans in favor of same-sex marriage stood at 35 percent in 2014 and 17 percent in 2001, the pollster said. Nearly 6 in 10 people  responded that homosexuality was a type of love, while 35 percent disagreed. Some 28 percent said that sexual minorities were born that way, while 49 percent said that their sexual identities were affected by their upbringing or social environment.A majority of Koreans, whether or not they were positive toward homosexuality, advocated equal opportunities for sexual minorities.Ninety percent of those surveyed said sexual minorities should be given the same job opportunities and 81 percent said dismissal due to sexual orientation is wrong. The poll, conducted between May 30 and June 1, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. While homosexuality is not banned in South Korea, LGBT people -- lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender -- live largely on the fringes of society, as the majority of Koreans remain either indifferent to or intolerant of homosexuality.President Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer, also said that he is against the legalization of same-sex marriage on the presidential election campaign trail, though he also said he opposed any kind of discrimination against sexual minorities. Last month, the military court sentenced a gay soldier to six months in jail, suspended for a year, for having consensual sex with a same-sex soldier in a private place, on charges of violating the Military Criminal Act.

These everyday heroes, however, have long been among the groups most neglected by policymakers in South Korea. Career firefighters, despite facing life-threatening dangers in the line of duty, have suffered a chronic shortage of manpower, budget and, perhaps most importantly, a collective sense of being valued. But finally, a change may be coming. Firefighters try to put out a fire in a building in central Seoul. President Moon Jae-in, who during his election campaign vowed to empower and improve working conditions of them, is seeking to establish an independent agency for the national and provincial fire service. It is currently under the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. Simultaneously, the new administration is seeking to hire 1,500 new firefighters this year, along with policemen, teachers and social workers. “It is heartening,” a firefighter stationed in Seoul told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. “We’re hoping for a greater role and greater autonomy,” he added. Both plans require parliamentary approval, as they are included in the broader reorganization of the government and a project for 15,000 new jobs envisioned to be bankrolled by a supplementary budget. The public, as well as many parliamentarians, appear to be in support of better treatment, at least, of the country’s firefighters. A legislative bill, currently pending at the National Assembly, is also brightening the mood in firehouses. Billed by the ruling Democratic Party of Korea lawmakers as “a law that would wipe away the tears of firefighters,” the proposal intends to take in all firefighters as central government employees, such that any spending on them, including salaries and safety gear purchases, comes from central fiscal coffers, not local coffers that vary greatly. That firefighters are not hired by the state itself is linked to many difficulties they are facing now, according to Kong Ha-sung, professor of the Department of Fire Safety at Kyungil University.“Even if the Ministry  sets the guideline for new recruits, that doesn’t materialize in cash-short cities and provinces because it is ultimately the rural authorities that pay their salaries,” he explained. “Changing the employment status of firemen is not about their working conditions. It is about ensuring the country’s fire service is equal and  across the country,” he stressed. As of December last year, South Korea, a country of 51 million, had 43,510 firefighters. Of them just about 1 percent were employed by the central government. The data also reveals that South Korea has a far lower firefighter-to-citizen ratio than comparable countries: One full-time firefighter is in charge of the safety of some 1,200 citizens here, compared to 1,075 in the United States and 820 in Japan. The fatality rate, according to data from 2011, is much higher for South Korean firefighters as well, with 1.85 deaths per 10,000 on duty, while the figures for US and Japan stood at 1.01 and 0.7, respectively. In some areas where the rural government’s fiscal condition is in bad shape, firefighters are replacing worn-out fire-proof gloves and boots with privately purchased gear, an online post purportedly by a firefighter’s wife claimed in 2014. But alleviating the chronic manpower and budget shortages are only basic tasks. There is more that needs to be done to better protect them, critics have pointed out. The lack of medical support to address work-related injuries and symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder, is a crucial but still neglected issue, they said.According to a survey released by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, 43.2 percent of 8,256 firefighters stationed nationwide said they have sleep disorders. Some 25 percent complained of hearing difficulties, while 19.4 percent said they had experienced depression and anxiety disorders. Professor Kong also backed these findings. “Individual firefighters’ medical data and history are to be reported to superiors. That discourages many firefighters from seeking professional help ,” he stressed.By Bak Se-hwan","heartening firefighter stationed in seoul ,superiors that discourages many firefighters ,firefighters despite facing life threatening ,korea career firefighters despite facing ,hire 500 new firefighters","['South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'the National Assembly', 'Democratic Party', 'Korea', 'Kong Ha - sung', 'the Department of Fire Safety', 'Kyungil University', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'US', 'Japan', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'Kong', 'Bak Se - hwan']",0,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41366103  0.42825174

The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules. Patrol aircraft from India, Germany and Japan were also searching the area, the Foreign Ministry said.  The Navy`s 4,400-ton destroyer Daejoyoung carrying the 24th batch of the 300-strong Cheonghae Unit departs its Fleet Command in Busan on May 2 for the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia for its mission. South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered related government agencies and the military to ""invest full efforts into the rescue operations, while putting the protection of lives first,"" the ministry said.  The fishing vessel that went out of contact was registered in Mongolia and owned by an ethnic Korean businessman living in South Africa. The vessel's captain, chief engineer and boatswain were South Korean nationals, the Foreign Ministry said.  Crews from South Korean fishing vessels and cargo ships have often been targets of Somali pirates.  Recent weeks have seen a resurgence of piracy off Somalia's coast after five years of inactivity. The piracy was once a serious threat to the global shipping industry but lessened in recent years after an international effort to patrol off the coast.  Some Somali fishermen, including former pirates, say foreign ships illegally fishing in local waters are forcing them to return to piracy to make money.  The 300-member Cheonghae Unit, led by a 4,400-ton destroyer, has been taking part in anti-piracy operations in the Horn of Africa since 2009.  In 2011, sailors and marines from the same unit raided a South Korean-operated cargo ship that had been hijacked by Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea, rescuing all 21 crew members and killing eight pirates and capturing five others.

It’s not because society has become more caring and does not produce them anymore. “It is more that a serial of murders are prevented from the beginning. A murderer would be caught before they killed again,” said Kwon Il-yong, the nation’s first criminal profiler who recently retired. But South Korea has in the past had some notorious serial killers. Kwon explained that these “monsters” were born from suppressed anger. “Everybody reacts differently in a situation. A monster is born when a person’s genetic factors meet with a bad environment,” Kwon said. “Serial killers have a skewed self-regard and sense of superiority as they take people’s lives.”The Korea Herald looked into some of the nation’s infamous serial killers. Kim Dae-doo  Kim Dae-doo can be described as the nation’s first known serial killer. For 55 days from August to October in 1975, Kim murdered 17 citizens including elders and an infant. He was Korea’s most prolific serial killer until Yoo Young-chul broke the record it in 2004. As an ex-convict, Kim came out of jail and tried to get a job but was “treated coldly.” His hostility toward society reached its peak and he killed random citizens, regardless of their gender and age. “Everyone, even my family, treated me coldly after I was released from jail. I wanted to earn money just like the others,” he had confessed. “I killed adults because they would remember my face and a child because the crying sound was annoying.”A laundryman reported him to the police after receiving Kim’s bloody jeans and upon his arrest, the then 26-year-old meekly admitted his crimes. During an on-the-spot inspection of the crime scene, he was seen smiling and chewing a gum. Before he was executed in December 1976, he is said to have repented for his sins. “I am regretful of my sins. I hope society changes to embrace ex-convicts.”Yoo Young-chulYoo Young-chul murdered 20 people across Seoul from 2003 to 2004 and said after being caught that he would have killed a hundred more if he had not been nabbed. His killing spree began when he broke into the house of a university professor to kill him and his wife in January 2003. Harboring enmity toward wealthy people, he planned his crime meticulously.After being rejected by an escort girl, his targets switched from rich senior citizens to prostitutes and women. His hatred against women began after he was divorced in 2002. In a media interview after he was caught, he said he hoped the case would serve as a lesson to women and rich people.“Women should not be sluts and the rich should know what they have done.”As the police investigation expanded into a series of murders Yoo committed against the elderly, with most of them bludgeoned to death with a self-made hammer, he changed his killing method. Yoo was merciless and vicious in his demeanor, dismembering and mutilating the bodies. He also confessed that he ate the organs of his victims. He received the death sentence in 2005 and is currently in jail. Korea has effectively abolished the death penalty as it has not proceeded with executions since 1997. During sentencing, Yoo said he felt sorry for his victims, but would kill a hundred more if he was released.While in jail he sent letters to a reporter who later published them. There, he confessed that the most fearsome moment was when his 4-year-old son made a phone call while he was mutilating a body.“The scariest moment was not when a decapitated head fell off from a hanger or when a headless body came running to me. It was when my son called to ask if I still have a cold,” it read. A movie, “The Chaser,” that reflected his story, was a box office hit in 2008. Jeong Nam-gyuWhile many criminals come from deprived backgrounds, Jeong Nam-gyu was an outcast for a different reason. Jeong had confessed that he was molested by a man when he was 10 and was ostracized for most of his teen years. From 2004 to April 2006, he killed 15 people and wounded 19. As if to take revenge, he first killed two elementary school boys after sexually assaulting them. Jeong had always hated rich men for having what he does not, he told the police then. His targets, however, were always those who were physically weaker than him -- minors and women. He meticulously planned a “perfect crime” to not leave traces behind. Police explained that Jeong had run 10 kilometers every two days to develop physical strength and avoid being chased. He mainly used a knife to kill people, but changed to blunt weapons out of fear that using a consistent method would help police catch him.In his first attempt to kill an adult man in a house in 2006, he was caught as the victim and his father fought back.During his trial, he testified that he was not sorry to the victims and that he was proud to have killed so many people. “I am unlucky to have been arrested. If I had not be caught, I would kill more,” he said. Jeong was sentenced to death in 2007 and hung himself in his cell two years later with a rope he made by tying plastic bags together. The Jijon clique There was a crime group that systematically murdered people as well.Kim Ki-hwan, 25 at the time, organized the group dubbed the “Jijon clique” in July, 1993. All in their 20s, they had hated the rich and decided to “act out.” Their first target was a 23-year-old factory worker, who they raped and killed in 1994. They also set up a makeshift jail and incineration facility in a basement of the leader’s house in South Jeolla Province.While it all started from their frustration against the rich and the economic polarization in society, their targeted victims were not always wealthy. One of the five people they killed was also one of their members, Song Bong-eun, who tried to secede from the group. In September, 1994, they kidnapped four people and killed three of them in the most brutal ways. One victim, after being tortured, escaped to report the gang to the police. The six members were finally caught and were executed in November the same year. In their testimony, one of the members revealed that they had practiced cannibalism, because they “gave up on being human.”By Jo He-rim","serial killers have skewed self ,police after receiving kim bloody ,killed adults because they ,korea most prolific serial killer ,said serial killers have skewed","['Kwon Il - yong', 'South Korea', 'Kwon', 'Kwon', 'Korea Herald', 'Kim Dae - doo', 'Kim Dae - doo', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Yoo Young', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Young - chulYoo', 'Seoul', 'Yoo', 'Korea', 'Yoo', 'Jeong Nam - gyuWhile', 'Jeong Nam - gyu', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Jijon', 'Kim Ki - hwan', 'Jijon', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Song Bong - eun', 'Jo He - rim']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40265232  0.58376247

It’s not because the society has become more caring and does not produce them anymore. “It is more that serial of murders are prevented from the beginning. A murderer would be caught before they killed again,” said Kwon Il-yong, the nation’s first criminal profiler who recently retired. But South Korea has in the past had some notorious serial killers. Kwon explained that these “monsters” are born from suppressed anger. “Everybody reacts differently in a situation. A monster is born when a person’s genetic factors meet with a bad environment,” Kwon said. “Serial killers have a skewed self-regard and sense of superiority as they take people’s lives.”The Korea Herald looked into some of the nation’s infamous serial killers who have once gripped the nation.Kim Dae-doo Kim Dae-dooKim Dae-doo can be described as the nation’s first known serial killer. For 55 days from August to October in 1975, Kim murdered 17 citizens including elders and an infant. He was Korea’s most prolific serial killer until Yoo Young-chul broke it in 2004. As an ex-convict, Kim came out of jail and tried to get a job but was “treated coldly.” His hostility toward society reached its peak and he killed random citizens, regardless of their genders and ages. “Everyone, even my family, treated me coldly after I was released from jail. I wanted to earn money just like the others,” he had confessed. “I killed adults because they would remember my face and a child because the crying sound was annoying.”A laundryman reported him to police after receiving Kim’s bloody jeans and upon his arrest, the then 26-year-old meekly admitted his crimes. During an on-the-spot inspection of the crime scene, he was seen smiling and chewing a gum. Before he was executed in December 1976, he is said to have repented for his sins. “I am regretful of my sins. I hope the society changes to embrace ex-convicts.”Yoo Young-chulYoo Young-chul murdered 20 people across Seoul from 2003 to 2004 and said after being caught that he would have killed a hundred more if he wasn’t. His killing spree began as he broke into the house of a university professor to kill him and his wife in January 2003. Harboring an enmity toward wealthy people, he planned his crime meticulously.After being rejected by an escort girl, his targets switched from rich senior citizens to prostitutes and women. His hatred against women began after he was divorced in 2002. In a media interview after he was caught, he said he hoped the case would serve as a lesson to women and rich people.“Women should not be sluts, and the rich should know what they have done.”As the police investigation expanded into a series of murders Yoo committed against the elderly, with most of them bludgeoned to death with a self-made hammer, he changed his killing method. Yoo was merciless and vicious in his demeanor, dismembering and mutilating the bodies. He also confessed that he ate the organs of his victims. He received the death sentence in 2005 and is currently in jail. Korea has effectively abolished death penalty as it has not proceeded with an actual execution since 1997. During sentencing, Yoo said he felt sorry for his victims, but would kill a hundred more if he was released.While in jail he sent letters to a reporter who later published them. There, he confessed that the most fearsome moment was when his 4-year-old son made a phone call while he was mutilating a body.“The scariest moment was not when a decapitated head fell off from a hanger or when a headless body came running to me. It was when my son called to ask if I still have cold,” it read. A movie, “The Chaser,” that reflected his story, was a box office hit in 2008.

Radio Free Asia made the report, citing a photo taken on Dec. 9 by DigitalGlobe, an American commercial space imagery vendor, and recently made public on Google Earth.  Vehicles pass through an inter-Korean immigration office in Paju, north of Seoul, on Feb. 11, 2016, returning from the North's Kaesong Industrial Complex after Seoul's decision to shut down it was annunced the previous day. In February last year, the South Korean government completely shut down the Kaesong Industrial Complex in response to the North's fourth nuclear and long-range missile tests. The North, in turn, responded to the punitive step with the deportation of all South Koreans there. Launched in 2004, the factory park is a combination of 124 South Korean companies and 54,000 North Korean workers.In the photo, an 11-meter white vehicle is being operated inside the complex and another similarly sized vehicle is outside the complex, the broadcaster said. The car in the question is similar to a 22- to 25-ton wing body truck, whose cargo box door is installed on one side, the broadcaster said. The period when the photo was taken coincides with a period when the North attempted to pilfer and sell some of the products, including electric rice cookers, from the complex to China, the broadcaster said. ""All the vehicles inside the complex belong to South Korea, and the North's use of the vehicles without a permit is a clear-cut violation of South Korean businesses' property rights, and should be immediately stopped,"" the broadcaster quoted an official at South Korea's Unification Ministry, which is in charge of inter-Korean affairs, as saying.","deportation of all south koreans ,seoul on feb 11 2016 ,closed inter korean industrial park ,south korean government completely shut ,after seoul decision to shut","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kaesong', 'US', 'Radio Free Asia', 'DigitalGlobe', 'american', 'inter - korean', 'Paju', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'South Koreans', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'China', 'South Korea', 'south korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'Unification Ministry', 'inter - korean']",0,"[ 0.          4.          2.         ... -0.35344061  0.02573148

South Korea has suffered from fine dust particles covering the nation’s sky for most days in spring, with the exact sources of the dust still unknown. Dust from China’s coal plants and domestic smog are widely believed to be the causes. In the lawsuit, pending at the Seoul Central District Court, they accuse the Chinese government of failing to perform its duty as a member of the international community to manage pollutants and criticized the Korean government for failing to take measures. “The purpose of this suit is to lay the groundwork for Korea and China, which are to lead Asia in a new era through mutual efforts and to find the exact cause of the fine dust,” the plaintiffs said in the petition, adding that they plan to donate the compensation money to a charity if they win the case.By Ock Hyun-ju","more south koreans joined lawsuit ,seoul and beijing seeking compensation ,south koreans joined lawsuit against ,the korean government for failing ,88 plaintiffs each demanding million","['South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Choi Yeol', 'the Korea Green Foundation', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.04731242  0.41843441

The first couple’s love story has captivated the people, although theirs was not an easy romance.President-elect Moon Jae-in and his wife Kim Jung-sook enter the National Assembly to attend the inauguration ceremony in Seoul on Wednesday. Moon, then a pro-democracy student activist, was detained several times for leading protests against the Park Chung-hee regime, and later was forcibly enlisted in the elite special forces by authorities.Kim was by Moon’s side when he sat for the bar exam while serving time in prison for protesting against the Chun Doo-hwan regime, became a human rights lawyer and embarked on a political career after the death in 2009 of his close ally, President Roh Moo-hyun. During this year’s short but intense 60-day presidential campaign, Kim was widely credited with having boosted support for Moon among undecided voters in Gwangju and the North and South Jeolla provinces, also known as Honam. There, she earned the nickname “jolly lady” for her likable and easy-to-talk-to personality. Perhaps thanks in party to her popularity, Moon scored a landslide victory with 61.6 percent and 62.3 percent of votes there, respectively, beating his rivals Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party and Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party.The Korea Herald had the opportunity to ask Kim about her role as a first lady. Her responses came several hours before the landslide win by her husband late Tuesday.South Korea's new first lady Kim Jung-sook  holds newly elected president Moon Jae-in's hand. KH: Since last fall, you have visited Gwangju every week, often staying overnight. Is there any particular reason you chose to concentrate on the region during the campaign? Kim: In the 18th presidential election in December 2012, nearly 92 percent of Gwangju residents voted for Moon . Their backing was truly overwhelming. However, despite their faith and earnest support,  lost the race. We had caused them great pain. After losing the election, I went to Gwangju and I couldn’t help but feel despair and grief in the city. I wanted to apologize as well as thank those who had trust in Moon. And, frankly, I wanted to receive some words of consolation from the citizens. The defeat was a huge letdown for us as well. So as not to disappoint them again, we gave all our body and soul until the very end to win the election this time.KH: Michelle Obama set a new standard as a first lady during her time in the White House. What do you think of your role compared to that of Mrs. Obama? Kim: I aim to be just myself, as I have always been. A first lady who can communicate with people, like anybody else, in what I call Kim Jung-sook-style. I am willing to contribute to building a society where no single person falls victim to injustice or discrimination, but where everyone can have a voice and be respected as much as any other. My husband once said he aims to be a president who can head to Gwanghwamun on his way home from work to have some soju with the people. Like him, I would like to go shopping for groceries at Namdaemun Market . Going around the country from corner to corner since the 2012 election, I have listened to the concerns and advice of local residents. I have and will always keep myself close to the ordinary citizens as first lady.KH: You are the wife of a politician, but also a mother of two. What would you say about the difficulties people have bringing up children here? Kim: I, too, have heard a lot about the concerns, and it’s really an unfortunate reality. It is every parent’s greatest pleasure to watch their children grow up. Moon has pledged to support parents in child care. That means it is the responsibility of the nation to ensure that the parents can take care of their children properly. One of the related pledges is the “10-to-4 policy,” a dual child care system for working parents. Within a maximum 24-month period, working parents with children aged below 8 can have flexible working hours between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. without reductions to their wages. Another pledge is expanding the number of state-run or public day care centers and kindergartens to account for 40 percent of all children enrolled in such facilities.

But in elections, the voices of the small, but growing group of multiethnic voters continue to be muted or ignored.  Multicultural families attend a program organized by the Seoul election commission about the coming Korean presidential election last month. The forthcoming presidential election is no exception.  Facing tight schedules to the May 9 snap vote, candidates have all staked out their election pledges, but few have provided a clear vision on how to make Korea a more open and inclusive society for immigrants. A look at the manifestos of five mainstream party-backed contenders, including front-runner Moon Jae-in, reveals their lack of concrete ideas on multiculturalism. All five promises increased support for multicultural families, but their focus is limited to such agendas like how to tackle domestic violence within multicultural families or reduce school dropout rates of multicultural students. The presidential aspirants’ lack of vision for multicultural society is, in a way, a reflection of the reality, experts say. Multicultural families -- there are 890,000 members of multicultural families, including 145,000 marriage migrants, 150,000 naturalized citizens and 560,000 who were born here, according to Statistics Korea -- remain “outsiders,” rarely voicing their opinions, they point out. What candidates say about multiculturalism  Moon Jae-in  of Democratic Party of Korea claps next to a Vietnamese immigrant  in an election campaign in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province on Monday. Front-runner Moon of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, who is bidding for the presidency for the second time, has actually proposed a reduced manifesto for multicultural families. In the manifesto booklet for this year’s election, he addresses the plans to reduce the number of student dropouts with one-on-one customized tutoring programs, establish a “comprehensive support system” for married immigrants and educate citizens to be more flexible towards different cultures. Still, he is the only candidate who has a special campaigning team targeting multicultural voters. Consisting of some 20 naturalized citizens from 10 countries including Russia and Nepal, the “Rainbow Campaign” team tours areas with high immigrant populations to enlist their support for Moon.The campaign team was established soon after 50 naturalized citizens from 16 countries declared their support for the candidate, in a rare press conference on April 22.   Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party promotes “Open Nationalism,” a perspective that he said encompasses “overseas Koreans and domestic multicultural families” into the concept of Korean nationals. Appearing on a local multicultural broadcasting system, “tvM,” he talked of the need for an assimilation policy, while also stressing the need to respect the different cultural backgrounds of the multicultural families. “To those coming to Korea to earn money, we also have a past in which our citizens went out to work in other countries. If I am elected, I will embrace citizens of multicultural families,” Hong said on tvM. Centrist Ahn Cheol-soo of People’s Party, who has given out a drastic reform plan to start elementary education a year earlier at six years old, says he will expand the national budget set aside to help multicultural children. “The dropout rate for multicultural students is rising every year but the related budget is always going down,” Ahn said. His election pledge includes a special afterschool program to help the students to adapt to the school environment.In his manifesto booklet, Ahn criticizes the Gender Equality and Family Ministry for only dealing with “multicultural families” and failing to specifically deal with the problems female immigrants face.“Foreign women take up 46 percent of the total foreigners staying in the country. Among them, 14 percent are women who have come to Korea marrying Korean men,” it reads.Of the top five candidates, the minor conservative candidate Yoo Seong-min appears to be the least interested in the issue.His election manifesto points at providing support for the married immigrant women who are exposed to domestic violence by increasing the number of shelters for them, among a few other things.    Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive minor Justice Party has some detailed election pledges covering “minorities” in the society when compared to others. With her manifesto stressing the idea of “respecting diverse lifestyles,” she says she will initiate “World Citizen Education” for all to foster respect for diverse families.  Why the lack of interest? Many people with multicultural backgrounds are shut out of national elections, as the country only grants suffrage to Korean nationals, not those with permanent staying permits. “Most of the immigrants and naturalized citizens are adjusting to the country, which makes it hard for them to out speak about their rights,” said Lim Won-sun, the chief of Korean Academy of Multicultural Family, told The Korea Herald. Zhao Hongyan, a Chinese mother living in Korea for 10 years now, holds no ballot to cast in the May 9 election, but she sincerely hopes that the next leader pays more attention to multicultural families. “I came to study here in Korea and was treated fine for five years before I got married to my Korean husband to earn the title of ‘married immigrant,’” Zhao . “The society seems to have prejudice against us. Even with my master’s degree, they would not take a second look at my resume.”She also criticized aspects of the “assimilation-focused” approach of the Korean government. “Difficulties and disputes occur in relationships because of the different cultural backgrounds, but all the culture classes teach Korean culture. They do not teach Korean spouses or others to respect my culture.”One the demands made by civic groups in the field is for the government to establish an “Immigration Services” bureau that devises and implements policies for supporting the multicultural families. “Each government body such as the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family does works of its own, and a lot of them overlaps. It is not very effective,” Lim said. By Jo He-rim","the coming korean presidential election ,korean presidential election last month ,coming korean presidential election ,coming korean presidential election last ,election pledge includes special afterschool","['south korean', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Statistics Korea', 'Democratic Party', 'Korea', 'Vietnamese', 'Uijeongbu', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Korea', 'Russia', 'Nepal', 'the "" Rainbow Campaign', 'Moon', 'Hong', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Hong', 'Centrist', 'People ’s Party', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Sim Sang - jeung', 'Justice Party', 'korean', 'Lim Won - sun', 'Korean Academy of Multicultural Family', 'the Korea Herald', 'Zhao Hongyan', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'Lim', 'Jo He - rim']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.18300849  0.35455915

From left are Sim Sang-jeung, Hong Joon-pyo, Yoo Seong-min, Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo. On Tuesday, Uriminzokkiri, a North Korean propaganda website targeting South Koreans, claimed the conservatives were scheming to extend their rule by backing Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party over Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party. It called Ahn the ""lesser evil"" and dismissed the other contenders from the conservative camp as ""minnows"" neglected and cursed by the public.Ahn, who is in a duel with Moon ahead of the May 9 election, seized the opportunity to rally the conservative vote. On the stump in Daegu, a conservative stronghold, the former software mogul claimed the North Korean regime of Kim Jong-un was ""afraid"" he would take power because of his strong commitment to national defense.The following day, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the North's ruling Workers' Party, called on South Koreans to rise up against the conservatives to achieve independence, democracy and inter-Korean reunification. The conservative forces including supporters of ousted conservative leader Park Geun-hye cannot be allowed to take power again, it argued. Minju Joson, the organ of the North's cabinet, issued a similar commentary claiming South Koreans will never be able to leave the shadows of U.S. control if they let the conservatives rule.Inter-Korean relations deteriorated to their worst level in years under the successive administrations of former Presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park. Lee slapped comprehensive sanctions on the unruly regime following the North's deadly sinking of a South Korean warship and attack on a border island in 2010. Park shut down a joint industrial complex in the North's border city of Kaesong, which served as the last remaining symbol of cross-border reconciliation.South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which handles inter-Korean affairs, urged Pyongyang to stop intervening in the election, saying the communist nation has been trying to drive a wedge among voters.""It is nothing new that North Korea is trying to interfere in South Korean politics,"" Lee Duk-haeng, a ministry spokesman, said Wednesday. ""North Korea should stop its anachronistic behavior.""Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the private think tank Sejong Institute, noted that while Pyongyang's smear campaigns go back a while, the snap election on May 9 has become a new focus for the regime's propaganda machine.""When there is a presidential election, North Korea naturally criticizes conservative candidates in an attempt to get a figure who is friendly or relatively less hostile to the North elected,"" he said.But the regime will never openly support a candidate.""For North Korea, it goes against their logic and system of absolute power to encourage support for anyone other than Kim Jong-un,"" he said.Yoo Dong-ryul, head of the private far-right Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy, claimed in a press conference this week that the North has mobilized some 160 pro-North websites to intervene in the election.The communist state uses both offline and online channels to give orders to pro-North forces in South Korea to manipulate voter sentiment. It also posts on social networking services such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, he said.Cheong expressed doubt that it had its intended effect.""I can't say it has no effect, but I can say it's insignificant,"" he said.","korea presidential election this week ,south korea leading presidential candidates ,korean organizations attacked conservative political ,their second tv debate at ,in south korea presidential election","['North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', ""South Korea 's"", 'KBS', 'Sim Sang - jeung', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Uriminzokkiri', 'north korean', 'South Koreans', 'Ahn Cheol', ""People 's Party"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Daegu', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Rodong Sinmun', ""Workers ' Party"", 'South Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'Park Geun', 'Minju Joson', 'South Koreans', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park', 'Lee', 'south korean', 'Kaesong', ""South Korea 's"", 'Ministry of Unification', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Lee Duk - haeng', 'North Korea', 'Sejong Institute', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Yoo Dong - ryul', 'Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy', 'South Korea', 'YouTube', 'Cheong']",18,"[ 0.          2.          3.         ... -0.79137033  0.41241947

They have become a source of diplomatic friction between Seoul and Tokyo, leading Japan to recall its ambassador to South Korea early this year.“If Japan aspires after political power, it should not evade the demand of the international community but keep pace with international trend for justice and peace,” KCNA quoted the commentary as saying.The paper noted Japan’s failed attempt to remove a girl statue installed in Glendale, California.“Under the present situation that girl statues for peace are erecting in all parts of the world, it is necessary for Japan to come to itself,” it said, according to KCNA. “Japan’s ambition to become political power while evading the past liquidation is no more than foolish act to become gentlemen before having a bath.”","brothels for japanese soldiers korea ,sexual slavery for japanese troops ,line brothels for japanese soldiers ,into sexual slavery for japanese ,at japan thursday for trying","['North Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'North Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'the North ’s Korean Central News Agency', '“japan ’s', 'KCNA', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Glendale', 'California', 'Japan', 'KCNA', 'Japan']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26110455 -0.09780478

About 12 percent had experienced psychiatric illnesses in the past year. The study noted that an increasing number of people are diagnosed with depression and the disease is more prevalent among women.About 5 percent of those surveyed had suffered from depression at least once. The proportion is higher among women at 6.9 percent compared to 3 percent for men. One in 10 female respondents had experienced postpartum depression, the study showed. As for schizophrenia, about 1.8 percent had the disorder at least once in their life and 0.5 percent within the past year.The survey also showed that 75 percent of those who had attempted suicide and 68 percent of those who had planned to do so had experienced a metal disorder. The survey results come after a recent shocking case involving a schizophrenic teenager kidnapping and killing an 8-year-old girl in Incheon. The incident shed light on the country’s failure to cope with the growing prevalence of mental disorders.Experts suggested the government should create an environment where patients of mental disorders can receive timely care and treatment, without fear of being sent to hospitals against their will.Professor Hong Jin-pyo of Samsung Medical Center, who participated in the survey, said “the overall prevalence rate of mental illnesses among Koreans is decreasing compared to previous years,” adding that a growing number of psychiatric treatments at clinics may help reduce the rate. “But compared to developed countries, South Korea still lacks governmental policies to raise awareness and provide treatment for mentally ill people,” Hong said. The government has been conducting a nationwide in-depth survey into the mental health of Koreans since 2001.

In three months this year, the country has seen 85 ultrafine dust advisories issued, more than double in the same period last year, which had 41. With ominously gray skies, low visibility and warnings about the health effects of airborne dust, South Koreans have become increasingly anxious.A high-rise building in downtown Seoul is shrouded in fine dust on April 3. This has given rise to a breed of citizens raging their own battles against air pollution -- checking air quality with personal devices, staying indoors where air purifiers are never off-duty and stocking up on masks in case they have to step outside. Lee Jung-mi, a mother of two daughters, is among them. She begins her day by checking the air outside with a dust-measuring device, uses two air purifiers at home and grows plants with proven air cleansing properties.“I purchased the particulate monitoring device to know the exact concentration level of harmful particles in the area I live,” said Lee. As a member of an online community of about 44,000, she also shares information and useful tips on fighting fine dust. Information shared there include do-it-yourself guides on how to improvise air cleaners with ordinary fans and ultrafine dust filters, or to build cut-and-fit window filters. Lee has followed many of the tips, but feels it’s not enough. “I do as much as I can at home, but when my kids are at school, there’s nothing I can do. Windows are open, even when the dust level is high, and there is no air purifier in the classroom. Not many teachers pay attention to air quality,” she said. Her online community on Korea’s largest web portal Naver has organized three street rallies so far to urge immediate action from authorities and raise public awareness. “We cannot trust the government on the fine dust issue anymore. We need to start acting on our own to return blue skies and clean air to our children,” read one post.  Mask-wearing protestors demand the Korean government to come up with measures to reduce air pollution in a rally held in central Seoul on April 2. Many believe that while South Korea has had its own air problem, the recent sharp deterioration is mainly due to China, the world’s biggest polluter. This belief has led to the first civil lawsuit filed by South Korean citizens against the governments of both Korea and China.Choi Yul, an environmental activist and president of the Korea Green Foundation, and attorney Ahn Kyung-jae filed the suit Wednesday with the Seoul Central District Court, seeking 3 million won  each in compensation. The data on how much of the airborne pollutants in Korea are from China is not seen as reliable.The Comprehensive Plan on Fine Particulate Matter compiled by several government bodies put the figure at 30-50 percent.Such figures are estimated based on data from Baengnyeongdo, a remote western island. However, a report from the Munhwa Ilbo uncovered that the decimal point on the Baengnyeongdo data had been put in the wrong place over the past two years, giving much lower readings than was the case. Officials say they used the correct data in their calculations, and had therefore not underestimated China's influence, but are coy about releasing the data.A study leaked from the Ministry of Environment estimated that 86 percent of ultrafine dust particles in Seoul and its surrounding cities on March 21, when the entire country was choked with high dust concentrations, was of Chinese origin. The ministry confirmed that figure, but has been reluctant to reveal more data on the China factor, claiming a significant portion of the pollutants originate here. While the central government has been moving slowly, some municipalities have taken action. Based on government data that outdated diesel cars are one of the main causes of air pollution here, the Seoul Metropolitan Government is moving to ban some 1.4 million diesel cars that were registered before 2005 from its roads. The city also plans to spend 264 billion won to replace those diesel-power vehicles with electric cars. “Tackling vehicle emissions is a priority if you are to tackle air pollution in your city,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, at an international conference on air pollution held in London in March. Seoul City is aiming to reduce its annual fine dust emissions to 1,071 tons by 2020, just over a quarter of the current 3,769 tons. Seoul’s fight against dust extends to deploying 75 dust-collecting trucks on the road, 30 of which have been newly purchased this year. “Seoul is in the process of switching its  cleaning method from water washing to dust absorbing,” said a city official in charge of environmental policy, adding that such a method will further enhance efficiency of city cleaning overall.According to the city, cleaning with a dust collector can vacuum up 98.2 percent of ultrafine particles and 98.3 percent of fine dust on the road, without having to use water at all. Meanwhile, Gyeonggi Province is experimenting with rain. While artificial rain technology is usually studied to fight drought, the provincial government is considering using it to wash away dust and clean the air. To reduce 6 percent of fine dust particles in the air, at least 2 millimeters of precipitation is required. To reduce it by 20 percent, 6 mm of rainfall is needed, a previous study showed. Gyeonggi Province plans to hold three rainmaking experiments this year, with a budget of approximately 25 million won  per instance. Incheon and western cities in Gyeonggi Province are the first to be hit by toxic air from China. “Korea cannot root out the fine dust problem if we do not do anything to air pollutants blowing from outside of the country,” said Nam Kyung-pil, Gyeonggi Province governor. “We will try a variety of high-tech measures to fight the fine dust,” Nam added.By Kim Da-sol","current 769 tons seoul fight ,three rainmaking experiments this year ,china the world biggest polluter ,online community on korea largest ,769 tons seoul fight against","['South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jung - mi', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Naver', 'mask', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'south korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'Choi Yul', 'the Korea Green Foundation', 'Ahn Kyung - jae', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Korea', 'China', 'Baengnyeongdo', 'Munhwa Ilbo', 'Baengnyeongdo', 'China', 'the Ministry of Environment', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'China', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'London', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'China', 'Korea', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Nam', 'Kim Da - sol']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.42003992  0.52036059

Prosecutor Han Woong-jae led the interrogation from 10 a.m. to 8:40 p.m. at a makeshift investigation room at Seoul Detention Center south of Seoul, where she has been jailed since Friday. The session took place inside the facility at Park’s request. It was the first questioing since she was detained Friday. Former President Park Geun-hye is taken to a detention house in Uiwang on Friday morning. Two of Park’s lawyers, Yoo Young-ha and Chae Myung-sung, were present. The investigation was not recorded by video.Outside the prison, some 50 supporters for Park rallied, calling for her immediate release. Some of them burst into tears and others shouting “Give me back our president,” waving the national and US flags. Park faces a total of 13 criminal charges, but Tuesday’s interrogation was said to have focused on Park’s alleged collusion with her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to coerce donations from local firms including Samsung Group. Choi and Samsung Group’s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong are also in custody at the same detention facility.Park is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won  from local firms, including Samsung Group, for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. An independent counsel team, which ended its 70-day probe into the scandal on Feb. 28, concluded that part of Samsung’s donations had been bribes made in return for political favors. Samsung’s Lee is standing trial for offering or promising to offer bribes to Park and Choi.If convicted of bribery, which carries the heaviest punishment among all the charges, Park could be sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of at least 10 years.Park has flatly denied all the charges, saying local firms voluntarily made donations for the foundations. But her denial is one of the reasons the prosecution saw the possibility of Park destroying evidence and sought an arrest warrant to detain her. It remains to be seen whether Park and Choi will sit down together to go through a cross interrogation. The prosecution ruled out the possibility during a briefing Monday. Choi also sternly denied her involvement in the bribery scheme during the first hearing on her bribery case Tuesday.“The independent counsel set me up in a bribery frame when I don’t know anything about Samsung Group’s managing structure,” Choi said during the hearing. “Park’s arrest results from my wrong judgment and behavior. I am also sorry to Samsung Group  out of good will.”The independent counsel suspects Park and Choi of sharing economic benefits. At the hearing, the prosecution revealed statements by staff members who had worked at a dress shop that manufactured some of Park’s clothing. According to their statements, Choi directly paid them in cash for Park’s clothing, rental fees for the shop and their salary until late last year. Park’s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against artists with liberal views.As Park lost her presidential immunity after being expelled from power on March 10, she was summoned for questioning on March 21 for the first time and was grilled at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office for some 11 hours. The arrest warrant for Park is valid until April 19. The prosecution is expected to file charges against her by mid-April to minimize the impact Park’s arrest will have on the May 9 presidential election.The prosecution is also speeding up a probe into Woo Byung-woo, the former presidential secretary for civil affairs, by summoning him for questioning scheduled for Thursday. He is suspected of assisting or condoning Choi’s meddling in state affairs.

Woo, 50, who served Park as a senior secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016, is being asked to present himself at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at 10 a.m. Thursday, according to an official from the prosecution’s special investigation unit.Woo Byung-woo, a key aide of ousted President Park Geun-hye The summoning signals the shifting focus of the investigation to Park’s former aide, who has remained largely unscathed so far despite having the nickname of “emperor” for his influence within the Park administration. Woo has been questioned twice since the scandal involving the former president broke out in late 2016 -- once by state prosecutors and then by an independent counsel.Special counsel Park Young-soo, whose 70-day investigation ended on Feb. 28, had seen Woo as a key figure in the corruption and influence-peddling scandal, suspecting that he may have abetted irregularities committed by Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Woo, however, has avoided legal action due to the special counsel’s limited investigation period, though a total of 30, including Choi, Samsung Group’s de-facto chief Lee Jae-yong and many of Park’s former aides, have been indicted. Key allegations against him include one that he used his influence to block a prosecutorial probe into failed rescue efforts during the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry. On Monday, prosecutors reportedly secured statements from a senior prosecutor at the Gwangju District Prosecutors’ Office who had led the investigation into the ferry tragedy, saying that Woo had interfered in the probe. Woo is denying the allegation, although he admits to making a phone call to the prosecutor “to check on the status of the investigation.” Former President Park’s inept response to the national tragedy was among the reasons behind the parliamentary vote to impeach her on Dec. 9. On March 10, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment, saying she had undermined democracy and the Constitution by allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs and using her presidential authority to aid Choi’s private interests.But it dismissed the charge regarding the ferry disaster, saying a lack of diligence was not grounds for impeachment.Park was taken into custody Friday, 21 days after she was removed from office.By Bak Se-hwan","south korean prosecutors said tuesday ,korean prosecutors said tuesday that ,korean prosecutors said tuesday ,prosecutors office at 10 thursday ,investigation former president park inept","['south korean', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Park Young - soo', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Samsung Group ’s de - facto', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Woo', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Bak Se - hwan']",0,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33222267  0.61676329

But as they grow and more people have access to them, those unfamiliar with the concept are relying on them for studies and reports.The result is fake information jumping past the border of wiki sites and into mainstream media.  NamuwikiA casual internet search using Google Scholar yielded dozens of studies citing Namuwiki as a source for their papers. These are not just papers submitted by desperate college students scraping the internet for something to fill their word counts; they include academic journals published by legitimate organizations like the Institute for EU Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“It’s ironic because not even the heavy users themselves would think of it as an encyclopedia” said Park Byung-ho, a professor at KAIST’s graduate school of information and media management. “But the people who accessed the pages by searching the internet may think, ‘Well that’s pretty useful ’.” It’s not difficult to see a Korean youngster browsing through wiki pages, lost in a sea of information that is easy to access. Within a page is a word highlighted in blue -- indicating a direct link to another page -- and before you know it, you can spend hours browsing through various pages.“Mostly, it’s because it’s fun. When I’m by myself and have nothing to do, I can always access the Namuwiki and look at the pages,” said 30-year-old office worker Kim Han-ho.Most of the people adding information are people like Kim who, while well educated, are not professionals. Phrases like “It is a popular belief,” “Many believe,” “It is common sense to say,” are used to convey one’s personal belief.What is and is not edited out is decided by how popular it is, not by the accuracy of the information.“Many times, the users get embroiled in what is called ‘editing war,’ in which people erase the information they don’t like and fill the pages with their own opinions. Whoever is tenacious enough to keep on editing wins,” said Kim.Such case is not confined to Korean wiki pages. Even Wikipedia is often subject to “editing wars” when dealing with controversial topics. Wikipedia’s “history” page on US President Donald Trump shows that the entry has been repeatedly edited to add content favorable to, or against the controversy-ridden leader.Among the most glaring problems for wiki pages is that their convenience sometimes blinds the users from realizing how groundless the information they provide can be.In one of the most bizarre incidents, an unidentified user last year on Namuwiki posted a nonexistent concept called “Equalism” -- as opposed to the general concept of equality -- that supposedly was coined in 1996 as an idea to replace feminism. What started as an under-100 word page quickly grew as other users added details like actress Emma Watson allegedly mentioning it in a speech, “10 commandments of Equalism” and how it is referred to as “Equalitarianism” in the “Western academic circles.”The truth -- that “Equalism” did not in fact exist as a concept -- was revealed in January and the “Equalism” page was substituted with one explaining the incident involving the false claim. However, inaccurate information about the so-called “Equalism” concept had already spread to numerous Namuwiki pages on gender issues.How fast the information spread without the users realizing it was fake is an alarming sign of the potential danger of online wiki pages.Professor Park said such phenomenon is common when a new type of media or information is presented to the public. “Back when email was first introduced, there was widespread sentiment that any information that one got through email was legitimate. A few years back, Q&A; section on Naver or Daum were regarded as credible even though anyone could give an answer,” he said. “The public tends to overestimate  novel methods.”Many wiki pages do not have a person who can be held accountable for their content. Namuwiki itself claims to be run by a Paraguay-run company called umanle S.R.L., about which no information is provided on Namuwiki.The operators of Namuwiki could not be reached for comment for this article as the page provided no contact information.Park stressed that it is important for the general public to realize that the wiki pages are not a credible source of information and that they have always been intended as a “playground” for sharing tidbits about pop culture.“Namuwiki and its forerunners were never intended to replace the pre-existing encyclopedias. Rather it was a form of community that the users created to just enjoy, joke and have fun among themselves,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","most popular korean wiki websites ,popular korean wiki websites ,popular korean wiki websites and ,most popular korean wiki ,the most popular korean wiki","['Korea', 'Namuwiki', 'korean', 'US', 'Google Scholar', 'Namuwiki', 'the Institute for EU Studies', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Park Byung - ho', 'KAIST ’s', 'korean', 'Namuwiki', 'Kim Han - ho', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia ’s', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Namuwiki', 'equalism', 'Emma Watson', 'equalism', 'namuwiki', 'Park', 'Daum', 'Namuwiki', 'Paraguay', 'S.R.L.', 'Namuwiki', 'Namuwiki', 'Yoon Min - sik']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71066755  0.8596251

The report stressed the need for fresh assistance to the North, while reminding that North Korean residents suffer insufficiency in food, sanitation and drinking water because of recurring natural disasters like droughts and floods.Citing the UN relief agency, another US broadcaster, Voice of America, also said on the same day that some $114 million is required to provide assistance to the North this year.","the flood devastated north korean ,north korean residents suffer insufficiency ,flood devastated north korean county ,flood devastated north korean ,north korean residents suffer","['north korean', 'US', 'UN', 'North Korea', 'the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs', 'north korean', 'Radio Free Asia', 'north korean', 'Onsong', 'North Hamkyong Province', ""the North 's Central TV Station"", 'the United Nations', 'north korean', 'UN', 'US', 'Voice of America', 'North']",1,"[ 0.          0.          4.         ... -0.43251607  0.71281523

Lotte has also become one of the main targets of China's retaliation, as it's staunchly opposed to the allies' move to beef up their capability to intercept North Korea's missiles.Military officials, however, dismissed concern about the possible vulnerability of the military's intranet, saying it's completely ""separated"" from the Internet server.They pointed out the government has already elevated the cyber terror alert level by one notch. The military also raised the stage of ""INFOCON,"" which is an information-related defense alert system.The military's intranet suffered the first known hacking attack in September last year for which the North was believed to be responsible.","44 hacking attempts were detected ,tuesday recently attempts to breach ,hacking attack in september last ,recently attempts to breach cyber ,total of 44 hacking attempts","['south korean', 'China', ""North Korea 's"", 'Moon Sang - gyun', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'the Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Lotte Group', 'Lotte', 'China', ""North Korea 's""]",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.28088319  0.20297648

The survey was conducted on 3,667 adults in June-July last year. People hold a mass rally in downtown Seoul on March 11, a day after the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. The score for 2016 was down 1.47 points from 2006, but the score for 2026 was slightly higher at 3.91 points. A number close to zero means people have little trust in Korean society.The respondents rated South Korea’s social unity at 4.18 points out of 10.In the survey, the respondents evaluated South Korean society based on five categories -- trust, tolerance, dynamism, hope and cooperation -- for 2006, 2016 and 2026.Findings showed that the respondents rated the level of social tolerance at 3.79 points for 2016, dynamism at 4.03 points, hope at 3.76 points and cooperation at 3.85 points.Many Koreans seem to pin their hopes on the improvement of social conditions in the future, as each category for 2026 scored between 0.1 to 0.5 points higher than 2016. Some of the respondents said that South Korea should put more effort into fair distribution and social mobility to develop social unity.The report also said that “the government should try more measures to secure objective conditions for improving people’s participation in social activities, including more leisure time, in order to improve South Korea’s low level of social unity.”By Kim Da-sol","worse last year than 10 ,mass rally in downtown seoul ,impeachment of president park geun ,next decade report showed wednesday ,down 47 points from 2006","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Seoul', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun - hye', 'korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Da - sol']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41495261  0.65091795

Chinese police stand guard in front of a Lotte Department Store outlet in Shenyang, China, on March 4, due to rising anti-Korean sentiment among Chinese. According to the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education, at least four of seven Daegu high schools with plans for China-bound field trips this year have changed their destinations to Taiwan and Japan.The office said it sent a letter to Daegu schools last week, asking them to take sufficient protective measures for students ahead of their field trip to ""unstable"" areas. The office also recommended that overseas school field trips be canceled or postponed to ensure the safety of students.Likewise in Busan, four out of five middle and high schools have abandoned their plans to send students to China on field trips in the first half of this year.A Busan high school, for instance, changed the destination of its field trip to Japan after consultations with parents, while three other schools replaced China with Japan or Singapore as the destination.Another Busan high school said it will also consider changing the destination of its China-bound field trip.The Busan Metropolitan Office of Education asked its schools in January to refrain from overseas field trips except for special educational purposes.On Jeju Island, two elementary schools which sent pupils to China last year said they plan to visit somewhere else this year.In South Chungcheong Province, 20 primary and secondary schools planned on a field trip to China this semester but 14 of them have already decided to forgo such plans. The other six schools are also considering changing their destinations to other countries or domestic locations.Separately, the city of Nonsan, near Daejeon, has canceled its earlier plan to send about 1,600 high school students in its district to Shanghai in several groups in the first half.Officials of Nonsan City Hall said the destination for the overseas training program will be changed to Japan or other countries, due to anti-Korean sentiment in China.","anti korean sentiment among chinese ,due to rising anti korean ,anti korean sentiment in china ,korean travelers are increasingly wary ,rising anti korean sentiment among","['south korean', 'China', 'anti - korean', 'Chinese', 'US', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'China', 'anti - korean', 'chinese', 'Lotte Department Store', 'Shenyang', 'China', 'anti - korean', 'Chinese', 'the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Daegu', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'Japan', 'Daegu', 'Busan', 'China', 'Busan', 'Japan', 'China', 'Japan', 'Singapore', 'Busan', 'China', 'the Busan Metropolitan Office of Education', 'China', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'China', 'Nonsan', 'Daejeon', 'Shanghai', 'Nonsan City Hall', 'Japan', 'anti - korean', 'China']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.18222483  0.40717322

The Harbin Symphony Orchestra will perform instead, the company added. The undated photo provided by JK & Company shows the Beijing Symphony Orchestra perform. The orchestra, founded in 1977, planned to hold a concert in Seoul and several other cities from Oct. 15 to 21 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.

China also urged its people not to visit Korea, sending shockwaves through the tourism industry. Chinese visitors make up almost half of Korea's inbound tourists. However, this is not the first time that China has apparently stopped its artists from performing in another country when diplomatic tensions were heightened.

VX is a chemical agent listed as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations and its use is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which the North is not a signatory.Eight North Koreans have been named as suspects, but the North has denied its involvement.""The specter of chemical weapons proliferation, of VX in the hands of terrorists, now looms ever larger,"" James Rubin, a former assistant secretary of state, said in an article in the Politico. ""The apparent shipment from North Korea to Malaysia of VX -- a lethal substance banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention -- is a brazen violation of international law despite the fact that North Korea is not a signatory to the convention,"" he said.Rubin also noted that China's suspension of coal imports from North Korea left Pyongyang without one of its biggest sources of hard currency while al-Qaida and other terrorist groups have worked hard to obtain weapons of mass destruction.""It was precisely this kind of frightening marriage of terrorism and WMD that the Bush administration considered a key justification for the war in Iraq. It would be reasonable to expect President Donald Trump and his team to be working overtime to prevent such a possibility. This is no partisan matter,"" he said.""While we may not have evidence of Pyongyang's intention to proliferate in the chemical weapons area, we do know they have transferred advanced missile technology and possibly the technology that allowed Syria to build a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by Israel several years ago,"" he said.Rubin said that though the North is the first foreign policy test the administration of President Donald Trump, there are no indications that Trump and his team understand the seriousness of the situation.""Every new administration has to deal with a foreign policy crisis of some type in its early days,"" he said. ""It's the proliferation risk from North Korea that should worry us. Unless the president and his team act soon, his administration is likely to fail its first test, and in doing so, fail to live up to its responsibility to protect and defend the people of the United States.""","chemical weapon to terrorist ,chemical weapon to terrorist groups ,the killing of kim jong ,such chemical weapon to terrorist ,korea was behind kim killing","['VX', 'Kim Jong - nam', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'al - Qaida', 'VX', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'VX', 'the United Nations', 'North Koreans', 'VX', 'James Rubin', 'Politico', 'North Korea', 'Malaysia', 'the Chemical Weapons Convention', 'North Korea', 'Rubin', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'al - Qaida', 'Bush', 'Iraq', 'Donald Trump', 'Pyongyang', 'Syria', 'Israel', 'Rubin', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'the United States']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34358642  0.72184235

During those meetings, Yun said he explained to them that then-Burma, now Myanmar, severed diplomatic relations with Pyongyang after the North carried out a deadly bombing attack in the Southeast Asian nation in 1983.Yun said China's recent decision to suspend coal imports from North Korea appears to be a message that not only underlines Beijing's willingness to sincerely carry out UN Security Council sanctions, but also demonstrates the change in China's perceptions of the North. Earlier in the day, Yun and the British foreign minister agreed to work closely together to cope with threats from the North based on the understanding that the North's nuclear and missile development constitutes a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions and a serious threat not only to the region, but also to the entire international community, his ministry said.Yun asked his British counterpart Boris Johnson for cooperation in strengthening sanctions and pressure on the North so as to make it realize that there is no other choice but to go nuclear-free.Johnson expressed concerns over the North's fast-evolving nuclear and missile capabilities and promised to closely work together with South Korea in faithfully implementing relevant UNSC sanctions. He also vowed to make efforts to induce tougher restrictions on Pyongyang from the EU, according to the ministry.","wednesday north korea apparent killing ,north korea apparent killing of ,north korea apparent killing ,korea apparent killing of the ,unilateral sanctions targeting north korea","['south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'Malaysia', 'british', 'Boris Johnson', 'Yun Byung - se Yun', 'the European Union', ""North Korea 's"", 'yun', 'yun', 'Myanmar', 'Pyongyang', 'southeast asian', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'UN Security Council', 'China', 'british', 'UN Security Council', 'british', 'Boris Johnson', 'Johnson', 'South Korea', 'UNSC', 'Pyongyang', 'EU']",0,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.46271059  0.71819305

It’s the perfect recipe for a thrilling cloak-and-dagger spy novel. Except some _ or possibly even all _ of this tale could be true in the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the older half brother of reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. And just like similar intriguing cases from the past, the public is hanging on to every detail because there’s just something about murder by poison that captivates. “A gun announces its mischief; poison can sneak in with a sip of champagne,” said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University. “The question isn’t why we are fascinated with this latest story, it’s why wouldn’t we be?”Still, speculation that Kim Jong-nam was killed by two young female “agents” at the busy Kuala Lumpur airport last week left even the most seasoned toxicology sleuths shaking their heads. Add in that the portly sibling was apparently sprayed in the face with a substance so potent it killed him before he could reach the hospital, and you’ve got a scene straight out of a James Bond movie. Four people, including the two women _ one Indonesian and the other traveling on a Vietnamese passport _ have been detained. Conspiracy theories and speculation abound as police scramble to unravel what really happened to Kim Jong-nam, aged 45 or 46, the son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and a mistress. After falling out of favor with the family, the son lived for years in exile and was about to catch a flight to Macau when the attack took place. He sought help at the airport clinic after suddenly falling ill and died en route to the hospital. An autopsy has been performed, but the results have not been released.If a chemical agent really was to blame, finding it may be the hardest part of all. “The more unusual, the more potent, the more volatile a poison is, the less likely it is to be detected,” said Olif Drummer, a toxicologist at Australia’s Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine who has spent 40 years in the field.Experts routinely tasked with finding answers in poisoning cases say the events at Kuala Lumpur’s budget airline terminal are bizarre, but not impossible. They wonder: What substance could have been used to kill the victim so quickly without sickening the women who apparently deployed it, along with anyone else nearby? Difficult, they say, but doable. “It’s not an agent that could be cooked up in a hotel room. It’s going to take a lot of knowledge regarding the chemical in order to facilitate an attack like this,” said Bruce Goldberger, a leading toxicologist who heads the forensic medicine division at the University of Florida. He said a nerve gas or ricin, a deadly substance found in castor beans, could be possible. A strong opioid compound could also have been used, though that would likely have incapacitated the victim immediately. “It would have to be cleverly designed in order to be applied in this fashion without hurting anyone else,” Goldberger said.  History is filled with poisoners. From jilted lovers seeking revenge to greedy spouses looking to collect on life insurance policies. Arsenic, cyanide and strychnine are often the toxins of choice used in murders, but political hits are usually a much more complicated business. Take the Cold War case of Bulgarian defector and journalist Georgi Markov. He was jabbed in the leg with an umbrella in 1978 at a bus stop in London. He died three days later, and a pellet of highly toxic ricin was found under his skin _ shot there by a gun concealed inside the umbrella.  No one was ever arrested, but Bulgarian secret police were suspected with help from the Soviet KGB. The Kremlin has been implicated in a number of high-profile cases including Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy who fled to the United Kingdom and was lethally poisoned by radioactive polonium-210 in 2006. In a report published last year, a British judge wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the assassination carried out by the country’s security service. And just this month, another loud Putin critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza, fell into a coma and was diagnosed with “acute intoxication by an unidentified substance.” The Russian nearly died from a similar unexplained poisoning two years ago.  Though the dramatic cases linked to espionage tend to make headlines, many other killings are overlooked entirely.  “To me, murder by poison is the easiest thing to get away with,” said John Trestrail, a forensic toxicologist who has examined more than 1,000 poisoning crimes. “If all those people in the cemetery who have been poisoned could raise their hands, we’d probably be shocked.”While murder using toxins is far less common than stabbings and shootings, he said his research shows that poisoners often strike more than once. “These people get away with it time and time again until somebody says, ‘Well, hell, she’s had four husbands and they all died suddenly,”‘ Trestrail said. “Then the exhumations come and: Bingo!”","female assassins crowded international airport ,shocked while murder using toxins ,brother two young female assassins ,young female assassins crowded international ,most seasoned toxicology sleuths shaking","['Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Robert Thompson', 'Syracuse University', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'James Bond', 'indonesian', 'vietnamese', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Macau', 'Olif Drummer', 'Australia', 'Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine', 'Kuala Lumpur ’s', 'Bruce Goldberger', 'the University of Florida', 'arsenic', 'bulgarian', 'Georgi Markov', 'London', 'bulgarian', 'Soviet', 'KGB', 'Kremlin', 'Alexander Litvinenko', 'russian', 'the United Kingdom', 'british', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Putin', 'Vladimir Kara - Murza', 'Russian', 'John Trestrail', 'Trestrail']",2,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.66430408  0.68432564

The request by the Korean diaspora in Japan came as bilateral relations became icy over the girl statue before Japan's consulate in Busan, which symbolizes Korean women sexually enslaved by the imperialist Japanese Army during Japan's colonial control of South Korea from 1910-45.It was the second such statue erected by South Korean civic activists in front of a Japanese diplomatic mission following the other one in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul.In December 2015, Seoul and Tokyo signed a landmark deal to end their decades-old diplomatic row over the wartime atrocity, but the fence-mending efforts hit a snag as the countries failed to reach an agreement on the fate of the statues. South Korea has long said the government has no authority to remove the statues set up by civic activists.In protest, Japan recalled its ambassador to Seoul in mid-January. Before his meeting with the foreign minister, O told reporters that he hopes for easing the ongoing diplomatic friction between the two neighbors by removing the girl statue in the southern port city of Busan. ""I would be happy if that happens,"" O told reporters when asked whether he wants the girl statue to be relocated.Asked whether the statue issue serves as a major factor in hurting Japan-South Korea relations, he said, ""I think so.""O's remarks are in line with what he said in his New Year address. He emphasized that all the Korean residents living in Japan ""share"" the hope that the statue will be removed. He and other representatives of Mindan were in Seoul to meet with Yun. The meeting was arranged at the union to deliver the ""voices"" of Koreans living in Japan.Mindan is a pro-Seoul organization which was established in 1946, a year after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, to protect the rights and interests of Koreans living in Japan.O said that the worsening ties between Japan and South Korea is making it hard for Korean compatriots to live in Japan and go about their business.In welcoming the Mindan chief ahead of the meeting, Yun promised to make necessary efforts to improve bilateral relations, while asking the union to continue to serve as a ""bridge"" between the two countries.","south korea remove girl statue ,korean women sexually enslaved ,civic activists in protest japan ,girl statue before japan consulate ,symbolizes korean women sexually enslaved","['korean', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'the Korean Residents Union', 'Yun Byung -', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'japanese', 'Busan', 'Seoul', 'yun', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Busan', 'korean', 'japanese Army', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Mindan', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'pro - seoul', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Mindan', 'Yun']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33997929 -0.42992827

The demotion of other military leaders, including former defense chief Hyon Young-chul, also followed. Ri and Hyon were executed later. The theft of a computer also hints at the leakage of military secrets. In fact, Japan's NHK obtained a some 12,000-page confidential document of the North Korean army in 2014, and released a special program in June last year, in which it reported Ri Young-ho was purged for moving a military unit without prior permission. The document is known to have been drawn up based on a hard disc that had been tampered with at a North Korean military unit.","north korean leader dismissed ri ,pyongyang civic organization said thursday ,north korean army in 2014 ,dangerous fliers north korea experts ,young north korean leader dismissed","['north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'anti - pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Third Corps', 'Army', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Square Yonhap', 'Seoul', 'North Korea Reform Committee', 'North Korea Reform Radio', 'the Third Corps', 'Nampho', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', ""Kim Jong - il 's"", 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Ri Young - ho', 'Hyon Young - chul', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Ri Young - ho', 'north korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          8.         ... -0.28920835  0.69303912
