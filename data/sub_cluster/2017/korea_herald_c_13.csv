Highly pathogenic AI refers to viruses that cause severe disease in birds and result in high death rates.South Korea has been stepping up quarantine measures in the southwestern region, including culling of over 200,000 birds, to prevent further spread of the highly contagious virus.Last year, South Korea slaughtered more than 30 million birds to contain the worst outbreak of bird flu in the country's history.","avian influenza at duck farm ,farm with 35 000 ducks ,pathogenic bird flu the h5n6 ,the h5n6 strain bird flu ,influenza at duck farm","['South Korea', 'Yeongam', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'ai', 'AI', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",14,"[ 3.          1.          1.         ... -0.49816087 -0.11412208

And we purchased the vaccines, not to prevent but to treat the disease, in case of biological terror attacks,” Park said in the statement. In 2015, potentially live lethal bacteria was “unintentionally” sent by a military laboratory in Utah in the United States to Osan Air Base in Gyeonggi Province.On Wednesday, a Japanese news outlet claimed that North Korea was testing ways to load biological weapons on its missiles. Following the report, a local media outlet said the presidential office had purchased 500 doses of anthrax vaccines for its officials and the president.Soon after the series of reports, criticism arose among the public, and more than 2,000 people signed online petitions demanding for the government to vaccinate all citizens against the fatal disease. Cheong Wa Dae said it imported 350 doses of anthrax vaccines on Nov. 2, after getting approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in July. It said it had stored them in a national army hospital.“The vaccine is much more effective for treating the infections when used with an antiviral agent. We have not performed clinical tests of the vaccines, so we will only use them to treat the disease, not for prevention,” the spokesman said. The government added that Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have anthrax vaccines for 1,000 patients prepared, in case of biological terror attacks. Regarding the news report that claimed the presidential office is to inoculate only its 500 officials against the disease, the presidential office said it will take legal action. Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis. It is known to be fatal and is called a biological weapon. In addition to the Japanese news report, US National Security Strategy on Monday said that North Korea is pursuing chemical and biological weapons that could be delivered by missiles. However, the communist regime denied the allegation. “The DPRK, as a state party to the Biological Weapons Convention, maintains its consistent stance to oppose development, manufacture, stockpiling and possession of biological weapons,” the North’s Institute for American Studies, affiliated with its Foreign Ministry, was quoted as saying by the Korean Central News Agency. Pyongyang is estimated to have 13 types of pathogens such as anthrax and clostridium botulinum that can be used as biological weapons, according to a 2016 report by the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.By Jo He-rim","imported anthrax vaccines this year ,anthrax vaccines for 000 patients ,anthrax vaccines on nov after ,anthrax vaccines this year ,of anthrax vaccines on nov","['Park Soo - hyun', 'US', 'Park', 'Utah', 'the United States', 'Osan Air Base', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'japanese', 'North Korea', 'Dae', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'japanese', 'US National Security Strategy', 'North Korea', 'the North ’s Institute for American Studies', 'Foreign Ministry', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses', 'Jo He - rim']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33313975  0.59984082

The virus discovered in Gochang on Nov. 19 was the H5N6 bird flu, which arose from the reassortment between a highly pathogenic H5N8 that spread in Europe in late 2016 and a low-pathogenic N6 virus, the APQA said.It was identical to the one found on the southern island of Jeju from Nov. 27-Dec. 2. The strain discovered in Yeongam on Dec. 10 was also H5N6, but its viral sequence had a slightly different pattern from the one in Gochang, it noted.Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a variety of viruses that cause severe disease in birds and result in high death rates, according to the World Health Organization.On Wednesday, the agriculture ministry said the H5 strain AI was newly discovered at a farm in Yeongam, which had received baby ducks from the affected farm about 40 days ago. The latest outbreak took place at a farm with 31,300 ducks, located 11 kilometers from the affected farm that had been under monitoring since last week.With the discovery, quarantine officials issued a ""standstill"" order for poultry farms to ban the movement of farmers, vehicles and equipment for 24 hours. The ministry said it plans to announce whether the latest outbreak involves a highly pathogenic strain as early as Thursday.Also, the government confirmed that it was the highly pathogenic H6N6 strain discovered in wild bird droppings on Dec. 13 in Yongin, south of Seoul. It is the fourth case discovered in bird excretions in two months. One case occured in mid-November in Jeolla Province, and two others were discovered on Jeju Island in late November. South Korea has been stepping up quarantine measures in duck farms in its southwestern region as outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird flu caused alarm in the major duck producing area.Quarantine officials culled 76,000 ducks at five duck farms located within a 3-kilometer radius of the affected site earlier this month as Jeolla Province is the nation's largest duck producing region. Last year, South Korea slaughtered more than 30 million birds to contain the worst outbreak of bird flu to have hit the country.","viruses detected at two duck ,h5n6 bird flu which arose ,noted highly pathogenic avian influenza ,the h5n6 bird flu ,the h5n6 bird flu which","[""South Korea 's"", 'Animal', 'Plant Quarantine Agency', 'Gochang', 'Yeongam', 'Jeolla Province', 'Gochang', 'apqa', 'Jeju', 'Yeongam', 'Gochang', 'the World Health Organization', 'AI', 'Yeongam', 'Yongin', 'Seoul', 'Jeolla Province', 'South Korea', 'Jeolla Province', 'South Korea']",14,"[ 3.          3.          1.         ... -0.20137516  0.51977295

The measure’s stated goal is to alleviate study burdens on young students by banning advanced learning. Currently, English is taught from third grade on.     But critics argue it would also lead to the loss of thousands of jobs of English instructors and eliminate low-income students’ access to affordable education.    “My son has received high quality English education after school, three times a week, just for 50,000 won per month. Now, I have to find him a private hagwon or a tutor because the government is axing English from next year’s after-school curriculum,” said a mother of a first grader who lives in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province.After-school teachers stage a protest in front of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education on Friday, demonstrating against the government`s decision to ban after-school English classes for first- and second-graders. Another mother of two, surnamed Lee, called the ministry’s decision “a complete nonsense.” Even preschool children are taking private English lessons nowadays, she said. “What’s the point of banning the most affordable, school-run courses when those private courses are all in tact?” Lee said. According to a survey published by the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, nearly 85 percent of 5-year-olds received private education as of last year, with English being the fourth most popular subjects after the Korean language, sports and arts. For about 7,000 after-school English instructors, mostly of them hired on temporary contracts, it is also a matter of job security. There are around 130,000 contract teachers who run after-school programs at school nationwide, teaching subjects like English, science, history, art, music and physical education. English is the most favored subject of all among parents, yet is the only subject to the prior learning ban. History is taught from fifth grade on, yet history-related after-hour classes are not subject to the ban. Kim Kyung-hee, an after-school teacher and head of the After-school Teacher Union, said the new rule threatens their jobs as well as taking away from their pupils the opportunity to learn English at a minimum cost. “The majority of the English classes at elementary school are for first and second graders. There was really no consideration whatsoever for contract teachers like ourselves in the government’s decision making, whose livelihood depends heavily on the classes they are about to shut down,” Kim said. Another teacher, surnamed Jung, who teaches first, third and sixth graders at elementary school in Jinju, some 434 kilometers south of Seoul, said her classes are one of just two English courses available outside the school in the suburb area.“There is just one private English institute near our school as far as I know, certainly not enough to accommodate all first and second graders even if their parents want to send their children there,” Jung said. The union’s teachers are planning to stage a rally in front of local education offices to protest the looming shutdown. Separately, an online petition on the website of Cheong Wa Dae protesting the ban has gathered over 18,000 signatures so far. “About 240,000 first and second grade students at over 4,800 elementary schools nationwide receive English education through the after-school programs,” the petitioner wrote in the petition, claiming the programs should be allowed to continue. An official from the Ministry of Education told The Korea Herald that the shutdown will take place as planned next March.

Together with the adjacent Naju, the area accounted for 52 percent of the entire domestic duck produce in the third quarter of this year.  The farm where the virus was detected is one that supplies breeding ducks to other farms. About 10 farms were found to have taken ducklings from this farm in recent month. The trucks that transported the baby ducks made visits to some 30 other farms over the month, raising the possibility of secondary infection.

It also plans to revise a relevant act to guarantee them overtime pay, sick leave and paid holidays.  “We will conduct an inspection on migrant workers’ lodging conditions and working conditions in the construction sector first and expand it into other sectors and set out new guidelines, if necessary, next year,” an official from the ministry told The Korea Herald. The National Human Rights Commission of Korea welcomed the decision. In June, it had asked the ministry to improve human rights protection for foreign workers exposed to poor working conditions and work accidents. According to its report on foreign construction workers published in 2015, 16 percent had not signed a written contract, and even if they did, 36.8 percent were not provided a copy of the contract. They worked 10.5 hours a day on average and 6.6 percent worked more than 12 hours, the report showed. As for housing, some 33 percent lived in temporary housing and 17.6 percent lived in cheap motels or at saunas. Some 61 percent of the housing had no kitchen or cooking facilities, 7 percent of the residences did not have locks and 6 percent had no windows. There has been criticism of the ministry’s existing guidelines, which were released in February. It allows employers to deduct up to 20 percent from foreign workers’ monthly wages in return for the lodging they offer, upon the workers’ consent. “In reality, the guideline is being exploited. Many migrant workers live in lodging facilities their employers offered -- such as container boxes or vinyl green houses -- and have their income deducted,” said Park Jin-woo, an activist for Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade, adding it is a priority to scrap the guideline first to improve living conditions for migrant workers. “Many migrant workers work overtime and until late at night, but their working hours are not officially recorded . So they end up not getting paid what they deserve,” said Park, who has given counselling to migrant workers living here. The Labor Ministry also said it will tighten monitoring of whether employers gave foreign workers in the construction sector proper training on how to prevent accidents at work and expand education on their labor rights. According to Labor Ministry data, 1,777 people died in work accidents in 2016 -- 31.2 percent of them on construction sites. The latest data showed some 4.9 million construction workers here in 2015, with foreign workers accounting for 8 percent of them. Migrant workers appear to be more exposed to work-related accidents in the construction sector. Out of 88 foreign workers who suffered workplace accidents last year, 45.5 percent were working at construction sites. A separate study on 337 foreign construction workers by IOM Migration Research & Training Center in 2015 showed that 67.9 percent of migrant workers injured on the job did not receive governmental industrial accident compensation. “Foreign workers find it difficult to receive compensation due to lack of proper equipment and language barriers. Also, employers often try to cover up work accidents and migrant workers are more exposed to dangerous work,” Park said.

YonhapThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said 20 of the 22 people had been located, with 13 of them dead. The seven others were taken to five different nearby hospitals. Two, including the captain, were still missing.None of the tanker’s four crew members were injured, officials said. Hwang Jun-hyun, chief of Incheon Maritime Police station, told the media that the rescue team brought a crane barge at around 4:40 p.m. and lifted the vessel out of the water but failed to find the missing two. “We will continue with a night search,” said Hwang during a press briefing.The rescue team arrived at the scene at 6:42 a.m., 33 minutes after the first report. Thirteen passengers were still inside the sinking vessel at that time, while seven were drifting in the water. The report was made by one of the passengers of the fishing boat at around 6:09 a.m.Officials also said the vessel was officially registered as a charter boat to receive fishing guests and had received permission from authorities to depart from Jindu Port on Yeongjongdo on Sunday morning. Authorities said the ship had not violated any maritime regulations. All passengers, including crew members, were wearing life jackets, they said. One of seven survivors told the media that “everything happened so suddenly” and that passengers were not aware of another vessel approaching because it was pitch-dark in the morning. “As soon as the captain said the vessel was going to hit , we were thrown into the sea. I held onto floating Styrofoam waiting to be rescued,” a survivor said in an interview.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said President Moon Jae-in was briefed about the incident at 7:01 a.m. and ordered maritime police and the Navy to do their best for the rescue operation.“The president ordered  to take all necessary and quick medical actions, as well as to contact families of all identified passengers,” Cheong Wa Dae said, adding that a ministerial-level meeting would be held if necessary.At least five helicopters and 19 boats were mobilized for the search and rescue operation. At least 20 rescue members from the Navy’s Ship Salvage Unit were dispatched to the site. A witness told Korean media outlet YTN that sporadic rainfall near the site may have contributed to the collision. Maritime police said there had been rain from 3 a.m. Sunday. Sea waves also rose to a height of 1.5 meters at the site, but further investigation is needed, officials said. By Kim Da-sol","vessel carrying 22 people capsized ,the capsized fishing vessel yonhapthe ,sunday morning leaving 13 dead ,carrying 22 people capsized off ,the capsized fishing vessel","['Incheon', 'Rescue', 'YonhapThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries', 'Hwang Jun - hyun', 'Incheon Maritime Police', 'Hwang', 'official', 'Styrofoam', 'Dae', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'korean', 'YTN', 'Kim Da - sol']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09966499 -0.18356389

More than 200,000 people signed on to show their support, requiring the office to issue a response. Senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Cho Kuk said the government will resume a survey next year on the number of and reasons for abortions, and start a public debate. There are no official statistics on abortion. The last announcement by the health ministry in 2005 was 342,000 cases for that year.Professor Park Myung-bae of Pai Chai University, with cooperation of the Yonsei University's Wonju College of Medicine, analyzed relevant material provided by the big data portal Data Lab from October 2007 to October 2016. The results of the analysis were published in the latest edition of the health journal Health Policy and Management.The report concluded there were no indications that the number of abortions declined during the measured period. In 2010, the health ministry said the number had nearly halved to 168,000 that year.""Some obstetricians and gynecologists estimate 700,000 to 800,000 abortions a year on average. This is far from the ministry's estimate,"" Park said in the report. ""Realistically, since most of the performed abortions are illegal, the more precise estimate would be about 500,000 a year.""The report also noted that face-to-face or phone surveys on questions like having had an abortion often solicit lies in responses, making the results unreliable.Data showed that online searches for abortion tended to increase the most in May, while they fell to the least in December and January.One of the criticisms against the current law on abortion is that it punishes only women and people who perform the procedure, while men are free from any responsibility. Men often report illegal abortions to authorities as a means of revenge against their former girlfriends or wives.","000 abortions year on average ,men often report illegal abortions ,on abortion the last announcement ,abortions year on average ,report illegal abortions to authorities","['Cheong', 'Cho Kuk', 'Park Myung - bae', 'Pai Chai University', ""the Yonsei University 's"", 'Data Lab', 'Health Policy and Management']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61512518  0.75584829

Yonhap“Despite the public giving a nod to banning public smoking, we came to review the plan as it is difficult to define what public smoking is in practice. The  place for public smoking is too broad and blurred, so instead we may designate more non-smoking areas,” said a Seoul City official in charge of the citizen’s health bureau.The city government’s anti-tobacco move was initially praised by non-smoking groups. According to a poll conducted by the city in August, almost 9 in 10 citizens agreed with the policy to completely ban smoking in public. Only 7 percent said no. At the moment, there are 17,500 public areas where smoking is prohibited, which include some 3,400 areas close to education facilities such as kindergartens and day care centers. About 6,800 bus stops, 1,700 subway exits, 1,700 parks and squares are also designated as nonsmoking areas. In addition, 57 streets in areas with heavy foot traffic, including Insa-dong and part of Gangnamdaero, are now no-smoking zones, and violators face fines of up to 100,000 won . There are also another 23,900 indoor locations -- buildings of public offices, restaurants, hospitals and some apartments -- designated as smoke-free zones. The city plans to add more non-smoking areas next year.“We will designate at least one street in each of the 25 districts in Seoul as an area forbidden for smoking, and add another 3,300 places near kindergartens as non-smoking areas,” said the Seoul Metropolitan Government. While no-smoking areas multiply, the city has been slow to introduce “safe” places to smoke. At present, there are only 43 outdoor smoking booths installed in public places across the capital.“It is outrageous how the city is only increasing non-smoking areas. It is more reasonable to build more smoking areas for smokers who do not have a place to smoke. It will become harder for smokers to find a place to smoke when the city designates all streets as non-smoking areas,” said Lee Yeon-ik, head of smokers’ group I Love Smoking in an interview with a local radio station. “All I see on the street is non-smoking areas. Even at home, there is no place for a smoker to freely light a cigarette. It’s not like we are carrying out an illegal act, right? Smokers have the right to smoke so what we’re asking is simple -- give us more official places to smoke,” said Kim Jin-gwang, who was a heavy smoker for two decades. Kim went cold turkey after his daughter was born a year ago.In contrast, anti-smoking groups argue that they have the right to refuse exposure to cigarette smoke.“I often get shocked when walking on the street with my son. I see people walking and smoking, and it’s people like us who are walking behind who get directly exposed to second-hand smoke,” said Ji Eun-hee, 30. According to Seoul City’s survey in 2015 on 2,853 citizens, 91 percent said they had negative experiences with regard to secondhand smoking in public. About 63 percent of them said they were exposed to passive smoking on streets, while another 17 percent said they had experienced it at the entrances of buildings. Cigarette smoke can travel as far as 20 meters in radius.“If you light a cigarette on the first floor of your apartment, the smoke will travel all the way up to the fifth floor. The smoke does not only influence those who live below or above,” said Lee Soo-hyun, director-general of Smoke Zero Network, an association of non-smokers here, adding that a complete ban on smoking would ease the threat of secondhand smoke. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, however, ruled out the possibility of designating a city’s streets as forbidden for smoking.“Some of the outdoor public spaces in Seoul are under personal property. It would be more realistic  to designate populated streets or public areas as non-smoking zones,” said a ministry official. In September, the World Health Organization recommended South Korea adopt more stringent regulations to ban cigarette smoking in public places and restrict tobacco advertising and promotions.South Korea was not properly implementing policies on protecting, enforcing bans and raising taxes, according to the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2017.“Subnational jurisdictions have the authority to adopt laws that ban tobacco smoking in any or all of the places mentioned above. However, no subnational laws have been reported,” the report said.By Kim Da-sol","city government anti tobacco move ,nod to banning public smoking ,the city government anti tobacco ,council to ban all smoking ,banning public smoking we came","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Council', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City', 'Gangnamdaero', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Lee Yeon - ik', 'Kim Jin - gwang', 'Kim', 'Ji Eun - hee', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Lee Soo - hyun', 'Smoke Zero Network', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Seoul', 'the World Health Organization', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'the who report', 'Kim Da - sol']",11,"[ 2.          0.          4.         ... -0.31664819  0.17390455

He then filed a complaint to the commission.The restaurant claimed that it decided to ban children for fear of accidents and causing trouble for other customers.While acknowledging the right of those who operate commercial facilities to run their business freely under Article 15 of the Constitution, the commission said such freedom was not recognized without limits. “The restaurant sells Italian food such as pasta and steak, and is not a place that is harmful for children’s physical or mental health,” the commission said.“Not all children or all people accompanying children can cause much damage to the restaurant owner or other customers.”The human rights watchdog said that business proprietors must have reasonable grounds if they wish to exclude a certain group of people from using their services. “There may be rude customers causing trouble to other people, but an all-out ban is an irrational generalization,” the commission said.By Kim So-hyun","restaurants no kids policy banning ,kids policy banning children from ,watchdog petitioner visited the restaurant ,damage to the restaurant owner ,watchdog ruled that restaurants no","['the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'Jeju', 'italian', 'Kim So - hyun']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23931257  0.14587004

Park pushed for a revision of history textbooks that she claimed were ""left-leaning."" But her version sparked backlash from opponents who said they distort modern history in a way that glorifies the dictatorial rule of ex-leader and her father Park Chung-hee. President Moon Jae-in scrapped the plan in the first month of his presidency that started in May, following Park's ouster over a corruption scandal. The probe team found that the ministry was allotted a budget of 4.38 billion won  for the textbooks from the finance ministry in 2015, which only took a day to be decided.  More than half of the amount was earmarked for promotion and marketing, which is odd considering that the budget was originally intended for research and development, the probe team said.  It discovered that several officials from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae instructed the ministry as to how to execute the budget for advertising. Evidence shows that the officials picked which advertising company and broadcasting channel the ministry should contact to make the promotion footage and air it, it said. The current law stipulates that any state-led promotion campaign must be done through a competitive bidding. The probe team also raised suspicions over misappropriation, as the marketing costs are seen to have been excessively charged. The probe team said it has requested the prosecution to investigate seven officials from Cheong Wa Dae and the then ruling Saenuri Party on possible charges of a violation of state contract law, breach of duty and abuse of power.Last month, the probe team revealed that the ministry under Park's leadership took a mission to doctor citizens' written statements to be in favor of the uniform history textbooks.","following park ouster over corruption ,scrapped state authored history textbooks ,park ouster over corruption scandal ,tuesday park pushed for revision ,internal probe team said tuesday","['Park Geun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park', 'Dae', 'Cheong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00365418  0.44359899

The amount of damage caused by elderly drivers consequently increased, from 53.8 billion won in 2006 to 304.8 billion won last year. In proportion, last year's sum came to 4.2 percent of the total, up from 1.3 percent 10 years ago. The average damage caused by senior drivers was higher than for all age groups, amounting to 1.88 million won per case compared with the overall average of 1.62 million won.The fatality rate was also the highest for elderly people who take the wheel, standing at 0.32 percent, while the average for all age groups was 0.23 percent.Experts who follow social changes say the data reflects the country's aging society.

But risk-takers willing to defy the regime reset their dials behind closed doors, trying to catch signals from the US, UK, South Korea and Japan that float across the border every night and slip past state censorship.It is illegal to listen to foreign broadcasts, and they are often jammed by North Korean authorities, but they rank as top sources of information in the country after word of mouth, according to a 2015 Broadcasting Board of Governors survey of North Korean refugees, defectors and travelers.Among a dozen overseas stations beaming into the Hermit Kingdom, US-funded Radio Free Asia, has been broadcasting in Korean to listeners in the North for the last two decades. Many North Korean defectors, including the country’s former senior diplomat Thae Yong-ho, cited the glimmer of the outside world they encountered on RFA as an influence in their decision to leave their homeland.“Our goal is to not to instigate people, but to objectively deliver what’s happening outside the isolated nation, helping them make informed decisions about their lives in North Korea,” Oh Joong-sok, RFA’s Seoul bureau chief, told the Korea Herald.Oh Joong-sok, Seoul bureau chief of Radio Free Asia RFA Korean has been filling in the information not available from state-controlled domestic media, ranging from news about government corruption, human rights abuses, food and health crises in the country, as well as the conditions of refugees in China, the lives of defectors and the labor conditions of North Korean workers abroad. RFA’s exclusive coverage of goings-on around the secluded state, which is frequently cited by South Korean and global news outlets, is made possible by around 20 North Korean defectors on staff, many of whom still communicate with their sources within the country.RFA’s reporting seems to touch the dictatorship on the raw. It has been repeatedly been the subject of incendiary denouncements from North Korean state media, which Oh deemed “circumstantial evidence that our reports are touching the regime’s sore spot.” He said, “They lambasted us as a US mouthpiece vilifying the regime, but that’s not our purpose. We report on the country’s reality as it is, and if it shakes the dictatorship, the dictatorship itself should be held liable for the unrest.” Oh added that RFA, while funded by the US congress, is an independent corporation with its own editorial board that is insulated from the burden of representing national interests in its reporting.In a bid to comprehensively present diverse aspects of the world surrounding North Korea, RFA Korean’s programming is not limited to informative news, but also includes K-pop shows, dramatised narrations of Orwell’s “Animal Farm,” and a casual talk show with a defector on the differences between everyday life in the two Koreas. On top of diversifying its radio programming, RFA Korean is eyeing video as a new medium. A series of RFA-produced documentaries on re-settled defectors were posted on YouTube in August. “The thirst for a new kind of information is growing uncontrollably among North Korean citizens. In light of such growing demands, we’ve recently launched a YouTube series, though internet access is still a distant luxury for our target audience. We are striving to be resourceful and will be possible to reach when the time is ripe,” said Oh.","north korean defectors on staff ,decades many north korean defectors ,jammed by north korean authorities ,many north korean defectors including ,incendiary denouncements from north korean","['North Korea', 'US', 'UK', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Broadcasting Board of Governors', 'north korean', 'the Hermit Kingdom', 'US', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Korean', 'north korean', 'RFA', 'North Korea', 'RFA ’s Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Radio Free Asia', 'China', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'US', 'RFA', 'US', 'North Korea', 'RFA Korean ’s', 'Orwell ’s', 'Koreas', 'RFA Korean', 'RFA', 'YouTube', 'north korean', '’ve', 'YouTube']",18,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.45695084  0.30957764

An association of civic groups and labor unions warned of the looming massive layoffs of custodians and guards at residential buildings, after conducting a survey on over 5,300 of them in Seoul. It called on the government to come up with measures to deal with the problem.  Members of civic groups advocating the rights of security guards hold a press conference in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. “The security guards suffer from harsh working conditions and low wages. They also have to experience employment instability all the time,” they said at a press briefing in front of the National Assembly. “There are no jobs for elders here. This massive layoff of security guards will become a serious social problem in this country, which ranks first in the poverty rate and suicide rate of elderly among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members.”Retired seniors and elderly often take jobs as security guards at apartments. According to the citied survey, which was conducted on 5,310 security guards working in 338 apartment blocks in Seoul from Nov. 2 to 15, 5.9 percent responded that they were already notified of their termination or that they expect it, while 41 percent said their employers do not have plans to reduce staff. Another 46 percent said it was not yet decided if they would be laid off. The total number of security guards across the nation is 35,000, the civic union said.In July, the government finalized the plan to raise the legal minimum wage by 16.4 percent to 7,530 won per hour from next year. The raise marked the biggest jump in nearly two decades. The wage hike was decided two months after President Moon Jae-in was inaugurated. He has pledged to increase the minimum wage to 10,000 won by 2020, as he seeks to stimulate the economy by boosting private consumption. Workers also pointed out their harsh working conditions, as they are often burdened with more than they can handle.“In apartment complexes that have already gone through layoffs, one security guard was given the duty of keeping watch over 13 to 14 buildings and also had to deal with recycling and pruning the branches off the trees,” the civic union said. “Some have to stay up at night in guard rooms because they are too small to fit a cot.”By Jo He-rim","wednesday the security guards suffer ,massive layoff of security guards ,assembly in seoul on wednesday ,10 000 private security guards ,security guards suffer from harsh","['Seoul', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'the National Assembly', 'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Jo He - rim']",11,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.48691455  0.24177076

They were born roughly around the time when the internet was popularized, and matured around the time smartphone and social media started taking center stage.With Generation Z who account for about 3 percent of the workforce today projected to make up 20 percent of the workforce by 2019, hospitality educators acknowledge that they need to adapt to cater to the needs of the new generation.“There are two points we need to address: First, to ensure students the best prospect on their careers and second, to ask how can we  ensure that we adapt to the new generation of students,” said Florent Rondez, chief executive officer of Swiss Education Group. “We have to move toward them.” Students of a hospitality school participate in the International Recruitment Forum at Montreux Convention Center in Switzerland from Oct. 23-24 As part of efforts to better understand the new generation, SEG recently commissioned a study led by consumer behavior specialist Alexandra Broennimann to find out more about Generation Z. Titled “Gen Z At School: Educating the Smartphone Generation,” the study conducted interviews with over 100 students, 30 lecturers, and 50 officials from the hospitality industry, along with online surveys of over 4,500 students.Those in the generation are characterized as “digital natives” who are tech-savvy to the point of perceiving smart gadgets as an extension of their bodies. Over 80 percent prefer a perfect job over a perfect relationship and 63 percent believe they can attain their dream job within five to seven years. It is also a generation relatively free from prejudice, as 9 in 10 say they do not care about the race and sexual orientation of their peers.Emmanuel D. Donhauser, chief academic officer of SEG, emphasized that the learning process for Gen Z should be different. “In the past, it was like filling empty vessels, but students now have access  information in an open source. ... It is no longer my  knowledge that dictates what the students are learning,” he said. Emmanuel D. Donhauser , chief academic officer of the Swiss Education Group, speaks during a press conference at the Inernational Recruitment forum at Montreux ConventionCenter in Switzerland from Oct. 23-24.Donhauser added that there is a difference between using digital tools in classrooms -- such as replacing books with smartphones and tablets -- and adopting technology in education. Schools under the SEG umbrella use technology and adopt new methods, such as allowing students to submit videos for projects instead of written reports, according to Donhauser. Armed with quick thinking and adaptability to technology, Gen Z appears to have huge potential. But Broennimann noted there are also adverse effects from the exponential growth of information and social media stimuli. “Because of the chemical reliance that can form, Gen Z is becoming addicted to their mobile phone screens and social media,” she noted, adding that their average attention span is eight seconds.She recommended that teachers embrace digital technology and accept that it has already begun re-modelling students’ brains. She also suggested that they should be aware of their own online reputations, educate themselves on technological developments and promote “virtual hygiene,” which ensures that students come to class prepared for learning with their brains not overworked. Other recommendations of learning strategies included letting students research online, but making sure that they learn how to transfer that information to think on paper; helping them to master offline skills such as presentation and body language; and focusing on learning that demands active engagement, not passive reaction.While Gen Z is thought to be less engaging in terms of empathy toward others, Donhauser said hospitality students have a distinct advantage in this area as their expertise naturally involves understanding and being friendly to others.Based in Switzerland, SEG is an alliance of five separate Swiss Hospitality Schools: the Swiss Hotel Management School, the Hotel Institute Montreux, Cesar Ritz Colleges, Culinary Arts Academy Switzerland, and International Hotel and Tourism Training Institute. As part of its efforts to provide internship opportunities for its students, the group hosts the biannual International Recruitment Forum at Montreux Convention Center.The recent forum held from Oct. 23-24 brought together 135 global companies and over 2,500 students from SEG-affiliated schools.

Celebrities and ordinary people around the globe are opening up about their experiences of sexual abuse on social media with the hashtag #MeToo. In South Korea, the issue is no less serious, although the campaign has not really taken off here yet. Rape against minors, sexual harassment at work and sexually-motivated murder cases are making headlines. Fear and rage against sex offenders have spiked, and more people are calling for harsher punishments. Kim Seong, head of Korea Sex Addiction Psychotherapy Association But before talking about increasing punishments for sexual predators, South Korea needs to realize that its systems are failing gravely in preventing sex addicts from turning into abusers, says Kim Seong, the head of the Korea Sex Addiction Psychotherapy Association. “I am not advocating for sex offenders, but if we do not treat them, it will just lead to repeated offenses,” Kim told The Korea Herald at his office in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province. He spoke with a sense of urgency about the need for medical treatment and education, citing the testimonies of underage perverts who committed sex crimes knowing that they would not be punished because of their age. “We are talking about some extreme level of urges here and if we do not treat them, it leads to the crimes we often hear about in society, from the hidden cameras and sexual assault to sexually motivated murders,” Kim said. According to data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, only 326 people received treatment for sexual perversion last year, when the number of sex crimes also rose to its peak of 29,414. There are conflicting views about sex addiction and perversion, but Kim believes it is a disorder that requires treatment. Like those addicted to alcohol, drugs and gambling, sex addicts cannot control themselves even if it causes physical or emotional harm to themselves and others. Sex addiction could take forms of voyeurism, pedophilia, unconsented sadomasochism or addiction to romantic relationships and obsession with a partner, he explained. Having studied sex addiction and worked as a therapist for over two decades, Kim has met and treated many people, mostly criminals. Often, they think they were just “unlucky” to be caught. “They are usually not first-time offenders and I say to them they were lucky to be caught only once,” Kim said. “These criminals do not understand that their actions were wrong and showed little sympathy for the victims.” Kim thinks that the advent of the internet era in the 1990s made access easier to pornography and the world of sexual deviation. Korean society, however, kept pretending as if nothing was happening. “We now see oppressed desires exploding through the internet, and now even criminal content, such as footage secretly taken without consent, are brazenly shared online,” he said, noting the difficulty of censoring online content without infringing on human rights. A society that is conservative on the surface keeps people who struggle with sex-related problems from seeking help, Kim said.The longstanding customs of a male-centered society also played a role in many distorted views of sexual relationships. In men’s world, sexual escort services were offered to secure contracts and build relationships, he noted. It was around the 1990s when the internet was distributed quickly in Korean society that Kim grew interested in the anonymous sexual desires manifested in random chatting on the internet.“I was studying the psychology of addiction and was also interested in computers at the time. I saw people regardless of gender and backgrounds openly expressing desires that were hidden deep inside,” he said. “It was online chats in the beginning but I observed it quickly developed into video conversations and exchanging porn, and there were no limits.”He started to work as a cyber ethics instructor and also volunteered to counsel sex offenders, studying over thousands of them since early 2000. After years of study and consultation, he opened a therapy center in 2006. Unlike other kinds of addictions, sexual perversion is directly linked to basic human desires, making it more difficult to treat the patients.“Addiction to alcohol or drugs is affected by the surrounding environment and getting rid of those external factors usually helps. Sex addiction is not like that.”But it is not hopeless, he said, when they are treated the right way. Treatment involves listening to the patients and also making them understand how their actions have hurt others and themselves. “Through proper treatment and counseling, sex addicts are given a chance to live a normal life, recover their relationships with their partners and acquaintances. It is not an easy process and not always successful, but it can prevent problems from worsening,” he added.

Among the abused women, nine suffered injuries including bruises and fractures.The study also seemed to indicate that domestic violence occurs more often to pregnant wives with advanced educational backgrounds. The research team said in a study that women with high education are more likely to report domestic violence complaints, while women with a lower level of education tend to rely more on their husbands and endure the abuse.Researchers warned that the prenatal experience of domestic violence can harm babies in the long term, addressing the importance of governmental help in preventing it.

The victims are euphemistically called ""comfort women."" They include around 2,700 kinds of documents, including court records and materials given by victims.According to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the International Advisory Committee of UNESCO made the decision in Paris early this week.The documents are considered indispensable first-hand research material in the field of comfort women studies, but their listing has apparently failed to overcome a diplomatic campaign by Japan to prevent their nomination. In this file photo, university students and citizens hold a candlelight protest outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Jan. 4, 2016, demanding a repeal of South Korea`s agreement with Japan on resolving the issue of ""comfort women."" UNESCO, however, recommended the nomination of ""Joseon Tongsinsa,"" which consists of old diplomatic records of Korean envoys to Japan, a royal seal and an investiture book collection of the Joseon Dynasty, as well as archives of the National Debt Redemption movement from 1907 to 1910. South Korea so far has 16 historical items recognized by UNESCO's Memory of the World initiative.The IAC comprised of private-sector experts makes recommendations to the chief of UNESCO, who has the final say.Though it has not been officially involved, the Seoul government has supported the civic group-led push for the listing, saying that lessons should be learned from the dark history and that efforts should also be made to let future generations know more accurately about historical facts. South Korea expressed regret over the UNESCO decision.""The government expresses our regret over the IAC's recommendation and the decision by its secretary general,"" the foreign ministry said. ""We oppose any remarks or actions that run counter to the historical truth related to the victims... We will continue possible diplomatic efforts to make the records on comfort women objectively and fairly evaluated going forward.""The Japanese, in particular, have protested to the South Korean government that pushing for a UNESCO listing of such documents might run counter to the spirit of a controversial deal reached between the two countries to address grievances on wartime atrocities committed by Japan. In December 2015, the two reached the deal under which they agreed to ""finally and irreversibly"" resolve the comfort women issue. Tokyo gave an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.Historians say more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude in front-line Japanese brothels during World War II, when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony.","sexual slavery for japanese troops ,wartime sexual slavery of women ,korean culture ministry said tuesday ,koreans forced into sexual slavery ,women mostly koreans forced into","['UNESCO', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'China', 'UNESCO', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism', 'the International Advisory Committee', 'UNESCO', 'Paris', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'South korea`s', 'Japan', 'UNESCO', 'korean', 'Japan', 'the National Debt Redemption', 'South Korea', 'UNESCO', 'IAC', 'UNESCO', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'UNESCO', 'IAC', 'Japanese', 'south korean', 'UNESCO', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'japanese']",0,"[ 3.          0.          2.         ... -0.23477817  0.50867915

Cho Hun-hyun of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party cited the Ministry of Education’s data for a parliamentary audit, which showed that the ministry’s budget for the country’s School Mental Health Resources and Research Center declined 538 million won to 1 billion won  this year from the previous year.The state-run organization provides programs for students designed to promote wellness and address mental health issues to curb the suicide rate. The budget for another suicide prevention program of the ministry that helps students overcome post-traumatic stress disorder was cut by half from 2016 to 180 million won this year, the data revealed. Although the School Health Act states that local education offices should allocate a medical expenses budget for students for medical examination and treatment, the budget gap also differs as much as tenfold, depending on cities and provinces.South Korea has marked the highest annual suicide rate among member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development since 2003.

That is about 14 times the average contamination level of toilet bowl lids in nearby restrooms, which was 951 RLU.The surface of water purifiers installed for drinking water for baby formula had the most germs -- at least 13,476 RLU. Sofas had a contamination level of 8,481 RLU, while the level for diaper switchboards was 2,877 RLU. A reading of under 500 is considered clean, while a reading above 1,000 means it is dirty. The higher the number, the more contaminated it is.

Homeless people take shelter underground at the Seoul Station subway. Bae Byung-joon, director general of the Health Industry Bureau at the Welfare Ministry, said that the ministry would swiftly carry out countermeasures to reduce the number of homeless people and help them live independently.According to the ministry’s data, there are more than 11,340 homeless people here as of 2016, including 6,192 who live in temporary dwellings. Among them, 64 percent are unemployed people whose main income came from basic livelihood security pensions.The Welfare Ministry’s move is in line with President Moon Jae-in’s pledge to address social inequality, especially among women, youths and groups deemed vulnerable. It aims to help such people live independently by providing them with free medical care through 260 designated local hospitals. Around 40 percent of the homeless said they are concerned about their health as there is limited or no medical aid available, according to the ministry. Another 30 percent said they have experienced mental health issues, including depression and alcoholism. The government is set to increase rental housing for homeless people from the current 60 housing units provided each year. The ministry’s data estimates that public shelter facilities were the most common place for the homeless to live , followed by streets .Other measures to help homeless people include providing job training programs offered by the Ministry of Employment and Labor to help them find jobs and free legal consultation at homeless facilities to prevent human rights abuse.

The ministry said an H7N7 strain of avian influenza was found in wild bird droppings that were collected in Yeongcheon, 344 kilometers southeast of Seoul on Sept. 13.  Following its discovery, health authorities issued a warning that banned local poultry farms from entering the wintering grounds of migratory birds and ordered the disinfection of farms adjacent to the site.The ministry said it will implement strengthened quarantine measures in the coming weeks, as many people are expected to take trips around the country during the Chuseok holiday, which runs from Sept. 30 to Oct. 9.   Health authorities conduct quarantine operations exercise in Cheongju, 137 kilometers south of Seoul, on Sept. 25, 2017, to protect poultry farms against aviation influenza. The National Institute of Environmental Research will further look into the dropping sample to figure out whether it is a highly pathogenic virus strain or a milder version. The results will be announced Sept. 27, the ministry said. The World Health Organization categorizes the highly pathogenic AI as a virus strain that results in a high death rate for birds.The ministry, meanwhile, said it will implement heightened quarantine measures against bird flu and foot-and-mouth disease until May to lower the probability of outbreaks in the coming sensitive months. The eight-month quarantine period, which is longer than usual, was set in consideration of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics taking place in February, it noted. The government is also planning to conduct on-site inspections of small poultry farms in Gangwon Province, which will host the winter sports extravaganza, and limit the rearing of chickens and ducks in areas that are vulnerable to outbreaks.","poultry farms against aviation influenza ,quarantine measures against bird flu ,measures against bird flu ahead ,farms against aviation influenza ,warning that banned local poultry","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'Yeongcheon', 'Seoul', 'Health', 'Cheongju', 'Seoul', 'the National Institute of Environmental Research', 'the World Health Organization', 'AI', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon Province']",6,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.12013119  0.21087712

YonhapAbout 83 percent of parents and 85 percent of school faculties said they do not see the offering of under-the-table gifts or money anymore, according to the survey conducted online earlier this month by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education on some 36,947 parents and 18,101 school faculties and teaching staff. Another 76 percent of the parents and 82 percent of the school faculties said they saw less requests for bribery-related favors after the law was introduced. Also known as chonji, meaning “a token of goodwill” in Korean, the practice of giving teachers gifts is believed to date back to the Joseon era. But in the early 1970s, the tradition changed into parents gifting cash to teachers in order to seek favoritism for their child. To prevent bribery, the “Kim Young-ran law” -- named after the former Supreme Court justice who drafted it -- states that teachers and their spouses are barred from accepting meals and gifts worth more than 30,000 won  and 50,000 won, respectively. It took effect on Sept. 28 last year.The limits on the value of meals, gifts and monetary gifts given at weddings, funerals and other major personal events affect some 4 million civil servants, journalists, teachers and their spouses here. In the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education’s survey, 95 percent of the parents said they supported the implementation of the anti-graft law.About 94 percent of school faculties said the new law did not interfere with the performance of their duties at schools, adding that the law was properly implemented and followed by those at schools. About 87 percent of parents shared the same view. For parents, the most dramatic change after the implementation of the anti-corruption law was the decreased burden of preparing gifts for teachers to express gratitude , followed by less dining with school faculty members .Respondents said other changes include the transparent process of work performance, indiscriminate treatment between teachers and increased fairness in grade assessment. A separate survey conducted last month by professor Lim Dong-kyun from University of Seoul showed that at least 89 percent of some 1,202 South Koreans said that the new law was effective. Some 45.6 percent said its impact was small, while 5.6 percent said the changes were huge.

This scene is familiar to many in South Korea with the experience of being stuck on a congested highway on weekends or major holidays. “When I was younger, it took some 10 hours to go to Mokpo where my grandparents live during the holidays. We were stuck on the clogged road for hours, moving at the speed of tortoises,” said Lee Jin-hee, a 35-year-old office worker. Rice puffs piled in Youngcheon Traditional Market “The Bbeongtuigi  sellers would walk around on the middle of the highway, and I would nag at my parents to buy me snacks. This scene would be repeated every year on holidays and it became my childhood memory.”Although not as often as in the past, these puffed rice snack sellers still pop up on jammed roads or highways, prompting many to wonder: Why do they always sell puffed rice snacks and where do these people come from? A wholesaler explained to The Korea Herald that it is because such snacks are cheap and easy to bring around due to their light weight. The traditional snack also recalls the nostalgia of old days. “We can say that puffed rice snacks are the oldest snack in Korea from the time when there was no manufactured snacks,” Choi Jeong-hwan, who has been selling various types of puffed rice snacks in Seoul’s Kyungdong traditional market for 20 years. Depending on their ingredients, the puffed rice snacks vary in shape and taste, and are puffed without oil under high temperature and pressure. They can be viewed as the Korean version of the Western popcorn. “These puffed rice snacks were the only snacks when we were poor. All you needed were grains such as rice, corn and brown rice.” Rice puffs piled in Youngcheon Traditional Market The 39-year-old Choi said steamed corn -- which are also snacks of the old days -- are sold alongside puffed rice snacks. “Back in the days, when I was young, these Bbeongtuigi sellers would come to outdoor markets and children would all gather around to watch him pop grains,” 53-year-old Kim Young-mi said. “The machine would make a loud ‘bang’ sound. In my childhood memory, it was not only a joy to eat the snacks but also to watch the event.” The owner of a truck vendor that moves around towns to sell puffed rice snacks explained how these sellers appear on the expressways and roads.“I have the popping machine in my vehicle, so I make the snacks myself. But often people buy the products from wholesale stores, gather part-timers and drop them off on roads where there is traffic jam,” said the 72-year-old retailer, who only revealed his surname Kim. Daily earnings vary for those selling the puffed rice snacks on expressways, as it depends very much on the ability of the seller and the time of year, he added. As for Kim, he said he makes a profit of half of his average earnings of 100,000 won  to 150,000 a day on village streets.The wholesale price of a bag of 10 round puffed rice snacks is 1,000 won and individual sellers sell them for double or triple the costs, he explained. “We rarely spot the snack trucks and individual sellers on express highways and roads,” said police officer Kim Sang-jin, the chief of the highway patrol team in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. “The police teams nationwide are always on patrol to watch out for dangerous situations.”The law bans pedestrians from entering the highways, he said, adding that those violating the law are subject to fines of over 300,000 won. “There is no law needed to ban selling on the highways, because it is illegal to enter the roads in the first place. Our utmost concern is safety.”As for this year’s Chuseok holidays, which falls on Oct. 4, Kim said traffic congestion would not be so serious, due to the duration of the holidays.This year, the government has designated Oct. 2 as a one-off holiday to bridge the Sept. 30 weekend with the Chuseok holidays , National Foundation Day  and Hangeul Day, which commemorates the invention of the Korean alphabet that falls on Oct. 9.By Jo He-rim","puffed rice snacks on expressways ,traffic jam on highway snack ,puffed rice snacks in seoul ,they always sell puffed rice ,always sell puffed rice snacks","['South Korea', 'Mokpo', 'Lee Jin - hee', 'Youngcheon Traditional Market', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Choi Jeong - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Kyungdong', 'korean', 'Youngcheon Traditional Market', 'Choi', 'Kim Young - mi', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Sang - jin', 'Yongin', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim', 'National Foundation Day', 'korean']",13,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.19567154  0.2488949

The Ministry of Employment and Labor concluded that Paris Baguette directly supervised jobs of the bakers employed and dispatched by partner firms, constituting illegal dispatch of workers under the local labor law. The ministry ordered Paris Baguette to directly hire all of the 5,378 bakers who are working at its 3,396 franchise stores. Noncompliance would lead to a legal punishment or fine, it said. The decision came after an on-site inspection at 68 locations, including the Paris Baguette headquarters, partner firms and chain stores.The 11 partner firms, who sent the bakers to Paris Baguette stores, are run by retirees from the bakery chain. Their only business is to manage bakers for Paris Baguette stores, the ministry said. The ministry also found wage arrears amounting to 11.1 billion won. It is not illegal for franchise store owners to outsource baking and have bakers, employed by personnel management firms, do the work at their stores. But it is illegal, if the bakers receive a direct order from the owners or headquarters. Paris Baguette expressed disappointment over the decision, saying it was not a “direct supervision” but only a part of its efforts to support its franchise store owners. “The Paris Baguette head office has duty to support and advise franchise store owners. As they asked for help in looking for and hiring bakers, the head office only matched bakers with the store owners,” an official from Paris Baguette told The Korea Herald. The illegal dispatch is considered a way for conglomerates to cut back on labor costs. The workers dispatched by partner firms or recruitment agencies, categorized as “irregular workers,” do not receive the same benefits and income as regular workers, though they often do the same job. The practice is illegal, except in certain sectors such as security and cleaning.

The case killed 73 South Koreans while affecting some 110 others here. The South Korean unit of British consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser, one of the manufacturers, is currently facing a series of criminal trials and damage suits. Environment Minister Kim Eun-kyung speaks during an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul on Sept. 17, 2017. A government-led investigation later confirmed a connection between scores of people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers. The tainted products were sold from 1994 until they were recalled by the government. Kim said the government should take responsibility for the resolution of the case, saying ""The stance of the previous government regarding the scandal was that corporations are to take responsibility since they caused it in the first place. But the government under President Moon Jae-in thinks it cannot avoid responsibility for its failure to ensure a safer management of chemical materials."" ""Up to now, we have limited the damages of toxic humidifier disinfectants to pulmonary fibrosis and excluded asthma out of the damages, but we are now treating asthma as one of medical probabilities relating to the case,"" Kim said. Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred.The government panel, which investigates and judges damages from the case, had a discussion on whether asthma is a side effect on Aug. 10, when it held its first conference, but failed to reach a conclusion due to conflicting views among its members.The panel found that a maximum 60,000 people either developed asthma from the use of such humidifier disinfectants or had their asthma worsened.The recognition would enable people to receive government support in medical, living, nursing and funeral expenses.During the interview, Kim also said the government is pushing ahead with a plan to revise the Law on Registration and Evaluation of Chemicals amid growing safety concerns about chemical products.Prior knowledge of hazards involving chemicals is key to preventing incidents like the humidifier disinfectant scandal, the minister said.""Unlike large companies which could acquire information on toxic materials through their own experiments, small and mid-size firms would have difficulty in obtaining such information,"" Kim said, adding the ministry is discussing with the SMEs and Startups Ministry ways to help the firms come by information on toxic materials.The envisaged revision, which is expected to take effect on July 1 next year, will call for the securing of information on toxic chemicals and distributing that info throughout the country at an earlier stage.

Two studies, led by Gloria Choi of MIT and husband Jun Huh of Harvard Medical School and published in Nature on Wednesday, illuminate that pregnant mice exposed to infection develop an autoimmune response which can result in neural developmental problems in their offspring. They also discovered the specific brain changes that produce these behaviors.Previous studies in humans had illustrated that viral infections during the first three months of pregnancy can heighten the risk of autism by threefold, and infections in the first six months by 40 percent. The latest studies offer clues on how the mechanism works in mice. “We identified a very discrete brain region that seems to be modulating all the behaviors associated with this particular model of neurodevelopmental disorder,” Choi, the Samuel A. Goldblith Career Development Assistant Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, told MIT News. If further validated in human studies, the findings could offer a way to reduce the risk of autism, which would involve blocking the function of certain strains of bacteria found in the maternal gut, the researchers say. According to the Nature, the studies’ findings have “one obvious implication: some pregnant woman could use diet or drugs to manipulate their microbiome to reduce the risk of harm to their baby.”""The studies do offer some intriguing leads,"" the Nature said.","wednesday illuminate that pregnant mice ,in mice that links autism ,illuminate that pregnant mice exposed ,pregnant mice exposed to infection ,mice that links autism","['korean', 'Gloria Choi', 'MIT', 'Jun Huh', 'Harvard Medical School', 'Choi', 'Samuel a.', 'Cognitive Sciences', 'MIT ’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research', 'MIT News', 'Nature', 'Nature']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64147699  0.06160563

YonhapAn association of private kindergarten operators is planning a general strike next week to demand a hike in government subsidies and protest the government’s plan to increase state-funded kindergartens. The group says over 3,600 institutions nationwide will join the three-day closure, to take place on Sept. 18, 25 and 26. Education offices are working to find out how many of them plan to strike.  Education Minister Kim Sang-kon said Tuesday at a meeting attended by city and provincial education officials that such a strike would run afoul of the Childhood Education Act and should not be tolerated.

Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for the Seoul-based Advocates for Public Interest Law, claimed that migrant fishing crews are at risk of forcible labor and human trafficking, as they are unable to seek help or leave work while at sea. An outdoor billboard carries an advertisement by an agency recruiting foreign fishermen to work on Korean-owned vessels in Manila, Philippines. “Most migrant fishermen were poor, less educated and had job insecurity in their own countries, so they sign contracts even though they are aware of appalling labor conditions,” he said during a forum jointly hosted by APIL, International Organization for Migration’s Korea office and the Human Rights Network for Migrant Fishermen. “South Korean government and ship operators are partially accountable for such abuses.”APIL and IOM recently published a report titled “Tied at Sea: Human Rights Violations of Migrant Workers on Korean Fishing Vessels,” based on their two-year investigation and interviews with some 70 migrant fishermen based in Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.The report details vulnerabilities of migrant fishermen on Korean-owned vessels in every stage of migration -- how they were lured by recruiting agencies with a promise of high wages, paid large sums of commission fees and were forced into a vicious cycle of debt and exploitation. The investigation found that migrant fishing crews in general suffer from poor living conditions, long hours of work, discriminatory pay, confiscation of their documents, verbal and physical assault, among other issues.“The process of recruiting and managing migrant fishermen is too complicated. In accordance with the size of a ship, different laws apply and different ministries oversee the recruitment system and labor conditions,” Kim said, pointing to the legal limbo which leaves foreign workers unprotected. In South Korea, migrant workers hired on ships which weigh 20 tons or over in coastal and high seas are subject to the Seafarers Act, under the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Foreign workers on boats weighing less than 20 tons are under the Employment Permit System run by the Labor Ministry. Only those under the EPS are subject to the Labor Standards Act, which stipulates working hours and labor rights, and the Minimum Wage Act, which states the minimum wage set annually by the government. The Seafarers Act does not stipulate labor rights or minimum wage for foreign fishermen. “There needs to be a single ministry and single law that manage foreign fishermen,” he said, adding that the two-way system of managing foreign fishermen results in relevant ministries shifting their responsibility to monitor the process of recruitment and working conditions. Kim and activists called on the government to play a bigger role in making the recruitment and employment process more transparent. They suggested it classify the fishing vessels into three categories to better monitor labor conditions by the categories, as well as enact laws and institutions to protect migrant fishermen’ rights. South Korea began to receive migrant fishermen in 1993 to fill the labor shortage in the fishing industry. The industry is heavily reliant on migrant fishermen amid young people’s reluctance to fill jobs in the agriculture, fishing and farming sectors. As of the end of 2016, the number of migrant fishing crew stood at 11,305, accounting for 41 percent of the total fishing crew in South Korea. The number has seen a gradual increase from 9,162 in 2010 to 11,815 in 2015. “We are managing to sustain our business by hiring foreigners because there are no Koreans willing to do the job. Human rights are of course important, but you should know that the situation has improved a lot,” said Kim Jung-su, president of a local fishing firm Sajo Industries. “And we also have our own problems such as stiff competition with foreign seafood companies.”According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Korea produced seafood worth 5.5 trillion won, ranking 13th in the world in 2014. The government officials talked about their own difficulties in improving the situation for foreign fishermen. “We are educating Korean fishing crews on human rights, set up a call center to receive complains from migrant fishermen, increase the number of officers monitoring working conditions, for example,” Seo Jin-hee from the Fisheries Ministry said. “It is not only a problem facing foreign fishermen. It is also a problem for Korean seamen as the fishing makes them leave their family and land for long,” she said. “We will put priority on protecting human rights and try to improve the situation.” Human rights abuses facing migrant fishermen first came to light in 2012 when 32 Indonesian crews on the Korea-flagged long haul fishing vessel Oyang 75 escaped it in New Zealand. They claimed that they were verbally, sexually and physically assaulted, and not paid their wages, which was confirmed by both Korean and New Zealand authorities. Since then, there have been growing calls for measures to improve the working conditions for migrant fishermen on Korean-owned vessels, but activists claimed that there had not been significant improvements. “There has been criticism that migrant fishermen were left unprotected because fishing vessels are not subjected to the government’s regulations and monitoring,” said Rep. Park Ju-min of the Democratic Party of Korea, one of the lawmakers who hosted the event. “We cannot neglect such a situation and we will make efforts to improve fishermen’s human rights in the country.”By Ock Hyun-ju","migrant workers on korean fishing ,rights abuses facing migrant fishermen ,abuses facing migrant fishermen ,manila philippines most migrant fishermen ,complains from migrant fishermen increase","['Kim Jong - chul', 'Seoul', 'Advocates for Public Interest Law', 'Korean', 'Manila', 'Philippines', 'APIL', 'International Organization for Migration ’s Korea', 'the Human Rights Network for Migrant Fishermen', 'south korean', 'IOM', 'Korean', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Indonesia', 'Philippines', 'Korean', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'the Employment Permit System', 'the Labor Ministry', 'EPS', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Kim Jung - su', 'Sajo Industries', 'the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Seo Jin - hee', 'the Fisheries Ministry', 'korean', 'indonesian', 'Korea', 'Oyang', 'New Zealand', 'korean', 'New Zealand', 'Korean', 'Park Ju - min', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 3.          0.          1.         ... -0.31005463  0.14893685

Such toxic chemicals are banned from being used on chickens in South Korea as they could possibly harm human organs when ingested.Some of them were found out to be tainted with dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, a poisonous pesticide that was banned nearly 40 years go.The tainted-egg fiasco broke at a time when the country is already suffering from rising egg prices due to a significant reduction in supply caused by the recent outbreak of avian influenza here and the subsequent massive culling of egg-laying chickens.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said it will establish a joint system with Beijing to strengthen the crackdown on illegal Chinese fishing by the end of this year.The revisions will help the two sides share information on boats that trespass the maritime boarder and fish illegally.The issue of unauthorized fishing has been a source of diplomatic tension between Seoul and Beijing as the South Korean Coast Guard has been intensifying the use of firearms against Chinese fishermen who violently resist maritime inspection and arrest.","raised poultry farms from 2018 ,introduce mandatory pasture raised poultry ,mandatory pasture raised poultry farms ,livestock husbandry in raising chickens ,crackdown on illegal chinese fishing","['South Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Sejong', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Fisheries', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'chinese']",6,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.35818392  0.32767379

The tea production system -- officially designated Japan’s Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations -- involves growing native grass between tea bushes to help enhance the soil and encourage biodiversity. A booklet explains Chagusaba, or the tea-grass integrated farming system, designated as Japan’s Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2016. Photo: Park Byung-gunThe same approach was academically studied, experimented with and introduced by Park Byung-gun, a food science professor at Gangneung Yeongdong University and vice president of the International Society of Tea Science. Park’s research, which was funded by South Korea’s Agriculture Ministry, ran from 1998 to 2000 and was published in the 2001 International Conference on O-CHA  Culture and Science, he said. The professor said he had even presented a preliminary paper in 2001 at an international conference held in Japan’s Shizuoka prefecture, the region that registered it with the FAO. Another of Park’s research papers, published in 2009 and titled “Systemization of Pure-Clean Green Tea Cultural Practice Utilizing Low Input Sustainable Agriculture System by Sod Culture,” also described the benefits of the sod culture in tea farming, ideal for areas in the Mudeung mountain region of Gwangju in particular. His research suggested that growing native grasses like rye, oat orchard grass and red clover between tea fields allows herbicide-free farming of green tea. In late fall, the grass is cut to be spread between the rows of tea bushes, adding nutrients to the soil and protecting tea plants during winter. In this way, farmers can improve the overall quality of green tea as well as support the growth of many other varieties of smaller plants, the scholar claimed. Professor Park Byung-gun poses next to a sign of a test farm for the development of clean tea farming techniques for Gwangju’s Mudeungsan in May 2000. Photo: Park Byung-gunDespite his study, the method is not widely practiced among local tea farmers.Japan’s Chagusaba, or tea-grass integrated system, designated as among the heritage systems in 2016, is essentially identical in its approach, Park said. Shizuoka prefecture describes Chagusaba as a farming method that originated in Shizuoka prefecture near Mount Fuji thousands of years ago. But Park claims this use of grass areas did not exist before he invented it.“The environmentally friendly agriculture system for tea production has been researched and developed by South Korea long before, and now it’s internationally designated as Japan’s own agricultural heritage,” Park told The Korea Herald. “The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs here should take the issue seriously and put in more effort to help our own farming technique to be recognized as such,” Park said. An official from the Agriculture Ministry said it is closely following Park’s claim and his studies, and will discuss the issue with the FAO later if necessary.By Bak Se-hwan","tea farming method that japan ,local tea farmers japan ,new tea farming method ,local tea farmers japan chagusaba ,tea farming techniques for gwangju","['Japan', 'UN', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems', 'the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations', 'Chagusaba', 'Japan', 'Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems', 'the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations', 'Park Byung - gun', 'Gangneung Yeongdong University', 'the International Society of Tea Science', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Agriculture Ministry', 'Japan', 'Shizuoka', 'FAO', 'Park ’s', 'Sod Culture', 'Park Byung - gun', 'Gwangju ’s Mudeungsan', 'Park Byung - gunDespite', 'Japan', 'Chagusaba', 'Park', 'shizuoka', 'Chagusaba', 'Shizuoka', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Park', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'Park', 'the Agriculture Ministry', 'Park ’s', 'FAO', 'Bak Se - hwan']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.66303694  0.4137997

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 15,000 expressed their intention to join the legal action, claiming that they have suffered negative effects, such as reduced menstrual bleeding, skin rashes and painful cramps after using Lilian brand pads produced by Klean Nara. A local law firm, which is currently recruiting plaintiffs, said the suit will be filed in coming days. While the government’s inspection is underway, public distrust over the safety of sanitary pads, consumer product manufacturers and government regulations reached a tipping point. “I started to use the Lilian pads in November last year and started to have horrible menstrual pain since four months ago. I just thought it was because of stress,” said Seo Ji-yeong, 24, told The Korea Herald. “After I switched to another type of pads, my pain went away. I thought the pads had been behind the problem.”She believes that the problem is not confined to the Lilian pad. “I cannot believe that the government had the Lilian pad pass its standards. I don’t think any brand is safe to use,” said Seo, who is one of the some  women seeking compensation from Klean Nara.  Members of civic group Korean Women’s Environmental Network demand the government reinforce inspections on disposable sanitary pads after a Korean-made product was found to contain toxic chemicals, at a press conference in Seoul on Thursday. The Lilian brand targeted cost-conscious consumers in a country where pad prices are among the highest in the region. It frequently offered “buy one get one free” deals at convenience stores and drug stores such as Olive Young. The sanitary pad market was worth about 297 billion won  last year, according to the Drug Ministry. Klean Nara holds the third-biggest market share, with Yuhan-Kimberly placing first and LG Unicharm second. A 31-year-old freelancer, who only gave her surname Choi, also experienced health problems. “Since I began to use the Lilian pads early this year, my period has shortened from seven days to two days. At first, I never thought it could a problem stemming from sanitary pads,” Choi said. “After I started to use organic cotton pads, the amount of menstrual blood increased,” she said. “I was just so furious at the unconscientious company as well as the government.” A women’s health advocacy group, Korean Women’s Environmental Network, on Thursday released a survey on 3,009 women who said they had experienced abnormal symptoms after using the Lilian pads. According to the survey, 65.6 percent of them said that their menstruation cycle changed. Nearly 86 percent said that the amount of menstrual blood diminished. Some 68 percent said that their menstrual pain worsened, while 55.8 percent said that their menstruation or vagina-related diseases got worse.  However, the Lilian brand passed government regulations in the latest April-May inspection. The firm initially refused to give refunds to consumers who purchased the Lilian pads, denying any links between health problems and use of its products. It said it had officially requested that the Korea Consumer Agency run a safety test on its products. But it reversed its stance and issued an apology Wednesday amid growing public outcry. Anyone who purchased the product can get a refund with a receipt whether the product was opened or not, starting on Aug. 28, it said. The country’s leading retailers -- E-mart, Homeplus and Lotte Mart -- as well as major convenience stores and drug stores pulled the Lilian sanitary products from their shelves as of Thursday. Ko Kum-sook, an activist from the Korean Women’s Environmental Network, said that the government should first find out whether the health problems are directly related to the use of pads. “Also, there should be a nationwide inspection in all sanitary pads, but not by the current standards. Currently, all sanitary pads live up to the government’s standards, but there are still women suffering from side effects,” she said. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety currently checks nine types of chemicals, such as formaldehyde and fluorescent brightening agents, to check the safety of sanitary pads. But the chemicals at the center of the controversy, volatile organic compounds, are not tested for. VOCs are not regulated in other countries either. Activists demand the government tighten its regulations by testing more types of chemicals potentially harmful to human health on sanitary pads before they are approved for sale. They also want the chemicals used in sanitary pads to be disclosed from now on. The ministry carried out on-site inspection on five sanitary pad makers Thursday including the controversial Klean Nara. But whether there are harmful levels of VOCs in the sanitary pads will not be confirmed because they are not included in the inspection. It is separately conducting a study on what impact VOCs have on human health. “We will bring forward the date of completion of the study as much as possible to relieve public concerns as it is an urgent issue,” an official from the ministry said. “If VOCs are found to be harmful to human health, we will take necessary measures. Women’s health advocacy groups have long raised concerns about the safety of sanitary pads, demanding thorough research into the safety of tampons, pads and other feminine hygiene products. In March, the Korean Women’s Environmental Network released a result of a safety test on 10 disposable sanitary pads and panty liners sold by foreign and local firms here. The study, conducted by professor Kim Man-goo of Kangwon National University, showed that all the sanitary pads contained more than 200 types of VOC, including cancer-causing benzene. VOCs, which are released from products at ordinary room temperature, include a variety of chemicals which may have short and long-term adverse health effects. Among the pads sold here, Lilian sanitary pads and panty liners were revealed to contain the highest concentration of VOCs. But the safety of sanitary pads was brought into the spotlight only recently after women began to share online complaints that their menstrual cycles were interrupted when they were using the product. Some are now turning to menstrual cups, which will be approved for sale here from September, and reusable cotton sanitary pads, instead of the possibly chemical-ridden disposable pads. But such options are still new to many Korean women. “Organic cotton pads are too expensive and menstrual cups are difficult to carry around,” Seo said. “I don’t know what to use.”According to a survey by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety released in May, some 81 percent of women use sanitary pads, and only 11 percent use tampons. Most of them, or 36.4 percent of them, considered convenience the most important factor.

The pesticide-tainted egg crisis is only a prelude to bigger threats to the food safety and public health unless the practice of cramming chickens into battery cages to maximize profits is stopped, they said. “It is a consequence of industrialized livestock production and it poses a threat to our food security,” said Jeon Jin-kyung, executive director at Korea Animal Rights Advocates, during a press briefing. “President Moon Jae-in promised to overhaul the industrial livestock production, but the question is how he will specifically do so,” she said, criticizing the past governments’ lukewarm efforts to tackle the “fundamental” problem.  Animal rights activists hold a press conference, calling for fundamental reforms of the industrial livestock industry in front of Blue House, central Seoul, Monday. The calls come amid growing fears over the distribution of eggs contaminated with insecticides, which experts say could harm human kidneys and liver if consumed in large quantities. So far, the 52 poultry farms have been revealed to have sold eggs tainted with high levels of insecticides. The farms had used eight kinds of pesticides including fipronil and flufenoxuron, which are used to kill fleas, lice and ticks on animals, according to the government’s inspection.About 1370 farms, or 94 percent of the poultry farms in the country, use battery cages that severely restrict animals’ movements and pose hygiene issues, according to government data. The floor area of a cage for each bird is about the size of a sheet of A4 paper. South Korea is not alone. Eggs containing insecticide fipronil were found in the food chain in 16 European countries and Hong Kong in August, according to the European Commission. The animal rights activists highlighted that the egg scare could have been prevented if chickens had been able to freely move around and remove ticks by cleaning themselves with sand and soil. “As five to six chickens are locked in a battery cage, their immune system weakens and diseases spread in no time. As there are no ways to get rid of ticks, farmers cannot help but spray insecticides. In such an environment, the tainted egg crisis and the outbreak of bird flu is just a natural consequence,” activists said. Intensive farming is also to blame for the outbreak and spread of the bird flu virus, they said. Until April, nearly 40 million poultry were culled due to bird flu, which was first reported in November last year. When bird flu infects a single bird on a chicken farm, the whole population is destroyed to stop the spread. The government said it would tighten regulations on the use of insecticides and ensure codes are printed on eggshells to inform consumers of when and who produced the eggs. In the long term, it will expand a system to certify eco-friendly farms with high animal welfare standards, it said. But animal welfare groups said it is not possible under the current system that lacks a comprehensive animal welfare policy and government body in charge of it. “To push for the reforms, a team currently in charge of animal welfare under the Agriculture Ministry should be expanded so that it can effectively improve animal welfare standards in the face of the livestock industry’s pursuit of their own interests,” they said. The government has received criticism for its poor response to the egg contamination scare -- including its failure to carry out a thorough inspection and lack of coordination among relevant government bodies. President Moon Jae-in apologized Monday over the scandal, vowing measures to improve the livestock farming environment.“In the wake of this case, we have to examine the entire livestock industry’s safety control system and promptly craft measures that can be trusted by citizens,” Moon said at a Cabinet meeting.By Ock Hyun-ju","the pesticide tainted egg crisis ,apologized monday over the scandal ,egg contamination scandal the pesticide ,pesticide tainted egg crisis ,the egg contamination scare","['Jeon Jin - kyung', 'Korea Animal Rights Advocates', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Blue House', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'european', 'Hong Kong', 'the European Commission', 'the Agriculture Ministry', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Cabinet', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,[1.         0.         1.         ... 0.17141941 0.41186836 0.67835754]

President Moon Jae-in on Saturday ordered a more thorough look into the problems in South Korea’s livestock industry, saying the latest food scare surrounding pesticide-tainted eggs here will remain unsolved unless the livestock industry is “fundamentally changed.” A group of animal rights activists protest in central Seoul on Friday against South Korea`s ""factory farming."" The talks of reformation has shifted attention to “factory farming,” where the livestock farms’ poor breeding condition is believed to be the main cause of global health risk. Poultry farms that adopt such systems, breed millions of birds in small cages with a floor space about the size of a sheet of A4 paper. A recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggested that the sudden June outbreak and spread of the bird flu virus here is largely due to the poor hygiene of these battery cage-facilities. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said on Sunday that the government must act immediately to restore the public’s trust. “The government must act pre-emptively and more proactively regarding the public distrust and concern about eggs. If we take action after a problem arises, that is too late,” he said in a meeting Sunday.  In line with Lee’s statement, the growing public distrust in the state inspection system is a vital task the Moon administration must work out before moving onto the next step. The current two-tier egg circulation system in South Korea has been at the center of controversy since the beginning of the crisis. The system is managed by both the agriculture ministry and the Food and Drug Safety Ministry, each overseeing the production stage and controlling the distribution and consumption, respectively. The ministries have faced public backlash for their insufficient response to the food scare and poor handling of “codes” printed on eggshells, which identifies the region and producer of the eggs. There have been voices within and without the administration calling for a unified food control tower with solid authority to supervise the entire egg circulation system. Traces of insecticides were also found in two government-approved “organic egg” products on Wednesday, which further fueled apprehension among South Korean consumers. Such products claim the hens are raised in an eco-friendly environment. Meanwhile, Seoul National University on Sunday claimed those with East Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to chemical fipronil, which can cause kidney and liver damage, said a research team led by Prof. Kim Ju-han.By analyzing a big data of receptors in 2,504 subjects from various ethnic groups, the team discovered that East Asians were more prone to genetic mutation upon contacting toxic chemicals, than any other group. They were 10 times more vulnerable than the other Asian groups, 2.5 times and 1.3 times more than Africans and North Americans respectively. The agriculture ministry on Sunday said the on-site probe into 420 poultry farms that weren’t included in the first round of inspection will be completed by Monday. It additionally revealed that it has so far found no additional signs of contaminated eggs in 194 farms as of 9 a.m. on Sunday. The news of egg contamination broke Tuesday when the Agriculture Ministry conducted inspection on 1,239 egg farms and related facilities nationwide which unveiled 29 farms had used illegal insecticides. The ministry said 37 farms were found to have above the permissible level of bifenthrin, used on agricultural crops, while eight were found to have used fipronil. Two other farms were found contaminated with flufenoxuron, while the remaining two had used etoxazole and pyridaben, according to the government.By Jung Min-kyung","latest food scare surrounding pesticide ,egg contamination broke tuesday ,activists protest in central seoul ,scare surrounding pesticide tainted eggs ,saying the latest food scare","['South Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Lee Nak - yon', 'Lee ’s', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'the Food and Drug Safety Ministry', 'south korean', 'Seoul National University', 'east asian', 'Kim Ju - han', 'East Asians', 'asian', 'Africans', 'North Americans', 'the Agriculture Ministry', 'Jung Min - kyung']",11,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.18441062  0.36212984

Quarantine officials discard pesticide-contaminated eggs at a hen farm in Yangju, north of Seoul, on Aug. 16, 2017. The latest food scare broke Tuesday when eggs from three local farms were found to have been contaminated by pesticides.The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said it has completed inspections on 1,239 egg farms and related facilities nationwide and found out that a total of 49 farms had used illegal insecticides.The ministry said 37 farms were found to have above the permissible level of bifenthrin, used on agricultural crops, while eight were found to have used fipronil. Two other farms were found contaminated with flufenoxuron, while the remaining two had used etoxazole and pyridaben, according to the government. Fipronil, flufenoxuron, etoxazole and pyridaben are banned from being used on chickens in South Korea as they could possibly harm human organs when ingested.Of the farms that have produced pesticide-tainted eggs, 31 were certified for producing ""eco-friendly"" eggs, which are strictly prohibited from using any pesticides at all.As of Friday, 1,190 farms passed the government-led inspection and were allowed to resume supplying eggs. They are able to supply 95.7 percent of the estimated 43 million eggs consumed every day in South Korea.The agriculture ministry said it will introduce a new nationwide system to trace the entire history of egg circulation and sale.Despite the government's swift measures to quell public health concerns, the authorities have been criticized for failing to thoroughly carry out the inspection. The minister said Thursday that 121 farms are being re-examined after their samples were tested without due procedures.The tainted-egg fiasco broke at a time when the country is already suffering from rising egg prices due to a significant reduction in supply caused by the recent outbreak of avian influenza here and the subsequent massive culling of egg-laying chickens.","latest food scare broke tuesday ,officials discard pesticide contaminated eggs ,food scare broke tuesday when ,eggs contaminated with illegal insecticides ,food scare broke tuesday","['Kim Yung - rok', 'Sejong', 'Seoul', 'Yangju', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'fipronil', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",14,"[ 2.          0.          2.         ... -0.03215064  0.42408517

Eggs from two more farms, in Naju and Cheonan, were also found to have contained over a permissible level of bifenthrin, a restricted-use pesticide, raising the number of contaminated farms to six in total so far. Workers from the agriculture ministry are seen collecting egg samples from a farm in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, on Aug. 15, 2017.

The association suit filing came one day ahead of an anniversary marking the liberation of Korea from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. A group of forced labor victims and their families attend a press conference in Seoul on Aug. 14, 2017, as they launch a damages suit against the government to seek to get back funds that Japan provided to South Korea under a 1965 agreement on their diplomatic normalization. During its negotiation with the Japanese side, the government under then-President Park Chung-hee promised to take responsibility for compensating individual victims of Japan's colonial rule. But it injected the money into the country's economic development, it said.The association has filed damage suits against the Japanese government and companies, but Japan maintains that individual rights to damages were covered by the 1965 treaty on resolving colonial-era issues.As the funds were meant for economic cooperation between the countries, the forced labor victims have yet to receive an apology from Japan, they said.The association said it will recruit as many as 1,000 people to form a group of plaintiffs down the road, launch a nationwide campaign to gain the funds and put former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil on trial, as he played a major role in completing the deal.  The former prime minister issued a statement through one of his aides, Kim Sang-yoon, that defended the deal. ""In the early 1960s, our country was one of the world's poorest and badly needed the funds for its economic reconstruction.""Critics say the South Korean government failed to compensate the forced labor victims and used most of it to build infrastructure, including a steel plant in Pohang and an expressway linking Seoul and Busan.Kim also said the government and South Korean companies, which had benefited from the use of the funds in the course of the country's economic leap into one of the world's top powerhouses, should come up with measures to support the victims and their bereaved families.","families on monday launched damages ,damage suits against the japanese ,monday launched damages suit against ,conference in seoul on aug ,government give back 300 million","['Japan', 'South Korea', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'japanese', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Kim Sang - yoon', 'south korean', 'Pohang', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Kim', 'south korean']",11,"[ 3.          0.          2.         ... -0.17114037  0.43205595

Recently, two bills have been recently submitted to the National Assembly, both intending to revise the labor law to stop employers and managers from giving work-related orders, directly and indirectly via mobile messengers, phone calls and other forms of social network services. “Many South Koreans complain of a stressful work environment, saying they are on call 24 hours a day because of work-related messages popping up any time after office hours,” said Rep. Lee Yong-ho of the minor opposition People’s Party who led the drafting of one of the two bills. The other bill was proposed by Rep. Son Kum-ju of the same party. “It does not matter whether such acts are done by a senior to a junior worker or a junior to a senior worker. We need to change the practices of bothering each other after work hours,” Rep. Lee said.With more than 90 percent of the population having smartphones -- one of the highest penetration rates in the world -- and the onerous working conditions with the longest working hours among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, complaints are mounting among employees over the extra work they receive via social network services. Kakaotalk, mobile messenger “When something occurs on weekends, I would get messages from my bosses directing me to do something about it,” Sally Chang, a 26-year-old office worker told The Korea Herald.“I was so frustrated once on a Sunday, because they would keep texting me on KakaoTalk. I had to hang onto my phone all day and wait to see if they want me to come to the workplace to fix things.” KakaoTalk is a mobile messenger app which counts 42 million of South Korea’s 51.4 million population as its subscribers. A secretary working for a lawmaker at the National Assembly was criticized by her boss when she could not be reached via her smartphone on a Saturday.“I was at the hospital when they called and messaged on a Saturday when it is the only time I can go during their open hours,” the 30-year-old who refused to give her name said. “I do not think it should be regarded as normal for bosses to think that employees should take their calls anytime, anywhere. It is sad that a legislative measure has to come in to enforce what should be social etiquette.”As she explained that the parliament is a workplace with frequent overtime working, she had doubts about whether the legislative proposals would really become law. “I will watch whether the lawmakers who motioned the bills follow the law, .” According to a report by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry conducted last year, 74 percent of 1,000 employees from 500 companies said they received work orders and requests after office hours and, among them, 60 percent said they suffer from serious stress levels.A separate 2015 report by the Korea Labor Institute revealed that the average amount of time a person spends using a smartphone for extra work is 11.3 hours per week. It surveyed 2,402 laborers in the manufacturing and service industry.The idea of prohibiting contact to employees via social media networks after regular work hours is not new. Rep. Shin Kyoung-min of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea proposed a bill last June. The bill has since been sitting idle at the parliamentary labor committee. The idea was also picked up by President Moon Jae-in and Yoo Seong-min of splinter conservative Bareun Party when they were presidential candidates for the May 9 election. Compared to the previous bill by Rep. Shin, the new bills of the two People’s Party lawmakers managed to expand the discussion to implementation. Rep. Lee suggests the company pay over half of the normal salary when it violates the law to give extra work orders, counting it as overtime work, while Rep. Son’s proposal seeks to impose a fee upon the companies when violations occur.While the public sentiment appears to be positive, many say the plans are unrealistic in a country where workers are still putting in extra hours without being paid and the statutory 52-hour workweek is not strictly enforced. In fact, the biggest issue in labor now is whether to plug a regulatory loophole that has allowed the extension of the weekly work limit to 68 hours.  “It would be too difficult for the company to systematically and transparently give us overtime allowance for receiving a message or an email. The solution to the problem is to really respect the right to disconnect from work and replenish,” an office worker surnamed Kang in Gwanghwamun, Seoul said. Rep. Shin echoed this opinion, explaining that it is too difficult to set an objective standard on how such messages can be quantified and converted into extra work and how the company can compensate the extra time financially.While receiving both support and criticism, his bill from last year is still pending at the parliamentary committee for environment and labor, after it had been disputed on its viability.“That is why I believe that such a ban should first come as an administrative guidance, rather than an empty piece of legislation. The Labor Ministry also sees it the same way,” the two-term lawmaker added. The Ministry of Employment and Labor on Thursday revealed that it was looking into ways to improve working conditions, specifically by limiting the use of social network services to give work orders to employees after work. The ministry is also studying overseas cases in France and Germany. “The working environment and ethic between Korea and European countries are very different. For us, we should take it step by step to change the grueling work ethic in this country,” Rep. Shin said.

Changes were not made to the newly established clergy taxation clause, which goes into effect starting January 2018.""If it's not included in the announcement, then that means the taxing on clerical workers will begin next year as scheduled,"" a senior finance ministry official said. The bill is part of the government-led efforts to establish equal taxation. Religious figures have been exempted from paying income taxes for decades, given that their work is regarded as a spiritual service, not labor.The Presbyterian Church of Korea's Tonghap branch, one of the country's largest religious groups, has agreed on the taxation from early on, having held seminars and education programs for its members since last year. Last month, the group held a meeting with the finance ministry and the National Tax Service to exchange views on the pending taxation plan. In this file photo, a group of activists from the Korea Taxpayers` Association hold a protest rally in front of the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee building in central Seoul on May 31, 2017, demanding that clerical workers pay taxes like all waged workers. ""The imposition starting next year is the right course of action. The government has deferred it for four years since first announcing it in 2013. There's no more cause for postponing it,"" said Kim Jin-ho, former head of the branch's taxation committee, who attended the meeting with the finance officials.The National Council of Churches in Korea also issued a statement accepting the newly imposed duties, saying, ""Everyone comes under the obligation to pay one's taxes.""But the more conservative-leaning protestant circles are against the pending taxation plan, especially the Presbyterian Church of Korea's Hapdong branch, an Evangelical Presbyterian denomination.""I've been paying my income taxes since 10 years ago. I'm not saying I won't pay taxes. But we're not a communist country, and if the government hastily writes up a law and tells us to follow it unilaterally, it will do more harm than good,"" said Rev. So Kang-seok, chairman of the branch's taxation committee.A representative of the conservative-leaning Christian Council of Korea commented, ""What if pseudo-religious groups pay taxes and ask the government to recognize them as legitimate entities?""Catholic priests have been voluntarily paying income taxes since the mid-1990s, and a growing number of religious leaders have expressed their intention to pay taxes on their earnings.""As a member of the public the Catholic clergy has also dutifully paid taxes and will continue to follow state laws,"" a representative of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea said.The Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, the country's largest Buddhist sect, also approves of the taxation plan. ""I hope that the finance ministry and the NTS will prepare more meetings and education in the remaining time before the plan takes effect,"" Ven. Jookyung of the order said.Rep. Kim Jin-pyo of the ruling Democratic Party, who also headed the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee that disbanded last month, meanwhile, has called for the government to defer the tax plan until 2020 and plans to submit a related bill to parliament this month.""I will submit an income tax revision bill that calls for the postponement of the clerical taxation until January 2020. I've received about 30 signatures from fellow lawmakers,"" Kim told Yonhap News Agency over the phone.Kim explained that his bill is designed to urge the government to better prepare against potential friction between authorities and religious leaders.""It would be critical for a pastor or a Buddhist priest to undergo a tax audit without proper preparation , then be reported by the media,"" Kim said.

The initial goal was to meet 55.9 percent of the target by the midway point. The first-half figure also falls below the 50 percent average for 2013-2015, data showed.The Moon Jae-in administration, after taking office in May, has made job creation and employment its top priorities to improve the lives of the people. It also has been campaigning for state and private firms to turn their temporary workers into permanent employees.On top of the public hiring goal set by the preceding administration, the Moon government added 2,500 more to the target, creating a rush to fulfill the number in the second half. Second-quarter employment was especially low, data indicated.January-March hirings totaled 5,046, 94 people short of the goal.But for the following quarter, the hirings stopped at 4,693, missing the target by 1,267 people.Government officials said part of the reason was that there were fewer retirees than expected, opening up fewer positions.A more prevalent explanation among officials is that public agencies withheld employment during the second quarter when the government was under siege by the impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye.""Political uncertainties were high, so it would not have been easy to make decisions on new hirings,"" an official said. ""Agencies that were headed by chiefs appointed by Park or where top executive positions were vacant would not have been in a position to hire people.""","hirings stopped at 693 missing ,862 new workers they planned ,january march hirings totaled 046 ,organizations newly employed 739 people ,second half second quarter employment","['Moon', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35177454  0.33239433

104,104,[Eye Interview] Education reformer aims to tackle elitism in schools,"Education in South Korea has no shortage of problems: an emphasis on tests that drives teenagers -- even pre-teens -- to engage in yearslong competition for top universities, a massive and growing private academy market that dwarfs public schools, and despite all this, a growing mismatch between education and job skills. But Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, believes it ...","Education in South Korea has no shortage of problems: an emphasis on tests that drives teenagers -- even pre-teens -- to engage in yearslong competition for top universities, a massive and growing private academy market that dwarfs public schools, and despite all this, a growing mismatch between education and job skills. But Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, believes it is his duty to reform the country’s education system -- which has long relied on rote memorization at the expense of creativity and initiative -- and tackle deep-rooted elitism.  Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education “We need a paradigm shift -- one that is not based on competition, but one that recognizes students’ hidden true capacities,” he says. “We need ‘education revolutionaries.’”As Seoul’s education chief, Cho, 61, is a divisive figure. His decisions, liberal policies and ideas often invite harsh criticism from conservative educators and parents. Some have taken legal actions to stop him, although all have failed so far. In person, he is a cordial man, with a calm smile and observant, bespectacled eyes.When he spoke of reform in an interview with The Korea Herald, his intensity and focus was a reminder of the challenges that any effort to change the status quo in schools would face in South Korea’s education-obsessed society.  A former liberal sociology professor at Seoul’s SungKongHoe University, Cho is determined to go his own way about it. Neoliberalism prioritizes competition and inequality over social capital, and that favors elitism in every sector, especially education, he said. The survival-of-the-fittest model will help no one in the age of artificial intelligence, he added. “Rich families have more resources for their kids to win the race, while others keep pushing their own kids into the hierarchical education environment to get into top-tier universities and climb up the ladder,” Cho said. “We need systemic answers as we have systemic challenges. We should start thinking systemically and move away from the current system where students are caught up in a competition for admissions to elite private high schools in order to later enter top universities.”Origins of the problems The root of the problems was not that education policymakers preceding him did not know where the problems were. It was rather because the origins of those problems were largely outside the reach of schools, deeply entrenched in the traditions of a Confucian society that values education the most, says Cho. More recently, there has also been an emphasis on education as a means of social mobility. Furthermore, the political response to curb excessive competition has largely been short-sighted, such as regulating the operation hours of cram schools. But real reform should aim to tackle elitism itself -- our deepest and most stubborn educational challenge, Cho stressed. Last month, Cho criticized the nation’s most coveted elite private high schools during a press conference to mark the third anniversary of his inauguration, saying that the schools have become “an alternate route to top universities.”With tuition fees amounting to up to over 20 million won  a year, these schools have become the favored choice for parents who want better education for their children. Competition to get into these schools is so extreme that it now starts in primary schools. Behind the education craze lies the belief that good universities will lead to good jobs, which then leads to good marriages and good lives. However the liberal educator’s campaign for equality in education, more precisely the removal of the elite schools, is stoking concerns and fears. Every day, opponents -- many of them parents from the wealthy district of Gangnam, a mecca for the most expensive and top class hagwon, or private academies -- protest the move to abolish elite schools in front of Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education. On concerns that a shift toward equality would strip education of depth and complexity in order to simplify it for the masses, Cho said he aims to achieve “horizontal diversity” among schools. “A new public school system, coupled with innovative education curriculums, assessment and college admissions, can increase the quality of all,” Cho said. Alternative ways The most ambitious of his education-reform efforts is the introduction in 2015 of an “Odyssey School” that runs free-learning semesters under Cho’s signature pilot project for high school freshmen. During the one-year free-learning period, students attend participatory classes apart from test-based rote learning. The pilot school has evaluated first graders on procedure, not test results, offering more opportunities to explore future career paths without tests.Expansion of the free-learning semester will “help set a new paradigm for our education system,” shifting away from memorization and cramming that leads to students doing little else but prepare for standardized assessments, Cho explained. “Today, our education should aim to attract, retain, and recognize diverse talent in all students, regardless of their family background or test scores,” Cho said. Seoul’s education office recently announced that it is working to formally designate the Odyssey School, after the two-year pilot program ends.  Cho also said he had set up a task force to implement open-book exams in all elementary, middle and high schools in Seoul, which he believes would “improve thinking and application skills” rather than memorizing textbooks.In the era of the “fourth industrial revolution,” artificial intelligence, cloud computing and predictive analytics, schools must change to teach skills that will matter in the future, he stressed. “The rote-learning system and excessive competition are not the answers. Vertical diversity among students through state-of-the-art new schools is all part of my plan,” Cho said. Critics say the elitist system, though problematic, has attributed to bringing up the performances of South Korean students. South Korea ranks among the top group of high performers in the Program for International Student Assessment. To Cho, good PISA scores are not something that South Korea should feel proud of, when they come largely by forcing children against their will into never-ending competition. “That’s an old legacy from the industrialization era where efficiency was the single most important value and the winner took all. We need to move forward,” he said.By Bak Se-hwan","south korea education obsessed society ,in south korea education obsessed ,competition for top universities massive ,south korea education obsessed ,need education revolutionaries as seoul","['South Korea', 'Superintendent Cho Hee - yeon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Superintendent Cho Hee - yeon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'sungkonghoe University', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'confucian', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Seoul', 'the Odyssey School', 'Cho', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'the Program for International Student Assessment', 'Cho', 'South Korea', 'Bak Se - hwan']",12,"[ 3.          0.          4.         ... -0.79815573  0.86156613

The panel's explanation triggered a controversy as it was seen as a reversal of the government's pledge that ""citizen jurors"" will have the final say over the highly polarizing issue that could affect President Moon Jae-in's overall energy policy direction.""During the public deliberation process, the decision on whether to approve of or disapprove of  will be made,"" a presidential official told Yonhap News Agency over the phone, declining to be named.The panel began its three-month operation on Monday amid concerns that the cancellation of the construction, which is nearly30 percent complete, would incur some 2.6 trillion won  in losses, and trigger many layoffs and damage suits. The suspension of the construction last month was in line with Moon's pursuit of an energy policy shift away from nuclear power, which experts warn could lead to a hefty rise in electricity prices and a potential energy shortage.The panel plans to conduct a survey on the issue on around 20,000 citizens next month. Among the 20,000 citizens, it plans to pick 350 people who will engage in the full-fledged deliberation process.

The National Human Rights Commission of Korea said that foreign workers in the construction sector are exposed to poor working conditions and work accidents, setting out recommendations for the Labor Ministry to improve the situation.According to a study on 337 foreign construction workers by IOM Migration Research & Training Center in 2015, 67.9 percent of migrant workers injured on the job did not receive the government’s industrial accident compensation. Among them, 17.1 percent were not even unaware that they had the right to claim compensation for injuries and illnesses due to their job. Under the Labor Standards Act and the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act, both Korean and foreign workers are eligible to receive compensation for work-related injuries. Filing compensation applications to the Labor Ministry does not require employers’ consent. But foreign workers find it difficult to receive compensation due to language barriers, low awareness of the scheme and employers who try to cover up accidents, local activists said. Kim Hyung-jin from Gimhae Migrant Human Rights Center said that most foreign workers at construction sites are hired on a day-to-day basis without even signing contracts.“So they tend to lack understanding of their rights to claim compensation for work accidents. With many workers unregistered or having no contract, the process gets more complicated especially because they cannot speak Korean well,” he said. Migrant workers in South Korea are exposed to a high risk of work-related injuries, as a large number of them are employed in so-called “3-D” jobs -- dirty, difficult and dangerous -- mostly in the manufacturing and construction sectors shunned by locals. According to Statistics Korea, there were 962,000 foreigners working in the country last year, with 8 percent of them, or 392,000, hired in the construction sector in 2015. Nearly half of them  are ethnic Koreans from China. Of 1,777 workers who died of workplace accidents in the country in 2016, 554 people  were hired in the construction sector. Out of 88 foreign workers who died due to workplace accidents that year, 40 people  were working at construction sites. A 2014 report by the Construction & Economy Research Institute of Korea cited Korea’s aging population, lack of skilled workers, shortage of budget for workers’ safety and language barriers as reasons behind work-related accidents at construction sites. The NHRCK also highlighted employers’ reluctance to help workers claim compensation.“When employers want to handle work accidents on construction sites ‘quietly’ rather than report them to authorities, migrant workers who lack Korean language skills and have other restrictions mostly accept it without actively exercising their rights,” the NHRCK said.Under the law, employers should pay more to the state-run insurance scheme in accordance with the number of industrial accidents at their work sites. They may have to pay a fine if they are caught hiring unregistered migrant workers. The NHRCK report also found that 21.4 percent of foreign workers said they had been beaten. Among them, 85.7 percent said they had been assaulted by Koreans. Nearly 63 percent said that they had heard curse words from co-workers. Most of their housing, or 60.6 percent, had no kitchen or cooking facilities. Some 7 percent of their residences did not have locks and 6 percent of their houses had no windows. Nearly 6 percent of their houses had no shower facilities. On average, 4.2 people were living together in one room.The NHRCK imposed several recommendations for the Labor Ministry to enhance human rights protection for migrant workers. It advised the ministry to revise rules on foreign workers’ food and housing, expand job training programs and education for their labor rights and increase the budget to release work safety-related material in different languages. It also called for the ministry to revise a local act in order to make standardized hiring contracts and guarantee paid holidays, breaks and legitimate work hours for foreign workers.

It aimed to prevent water shortages, improve water quality and create riverside tour spots, but critics say it was a failure that caused damage to the environment.As part of a plan to foster riverside tourism, some 3.1 trillion won was injected to set up a total of 357 riverside parks by the Han, Nakdong, Geum and Youngsan rivers.The ministry’s decision to inspect and refurbish the parks came amid concerns over excessive maintenance cost as well as calls to remove the “hideous” parks by the river, officials said.Authorities estimate between 500 billion won and 1 trillion won is spent annually for the maintenance of these underused parks. Over the next eight months, the ministry will inspect 181 community parks, 42 sports parks and 67 ecological parks, and either remove them or convert them to farmland, based on an analysis of the frequency they are visited by nearby residents. In June, the Board of Audit and Inspection said it would probe the four rivers development project, a legacy of former President Lee, following President Moon Jae-in’s order in May.By Kim Da-sol","some 300 underused riverside parks ,rebuilding of 87 old dams ,will inspect 181 community parks ,would inspect 297 riverside parks ,refurbish some 300 underused riverside","['the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Han', 'Nakdong', 'Geum', 'Youngsan', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection', 'Lee', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Da - sol']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45032728 -0.05761111

On Monday, a committee tasked with deliberating the question of scrapping the Shin-Kori 5 and 6 nuclear reactors was launched, 10 days after their construction was put on hold. The temporary suspension, which reflects President Moon’s vision of making South Korea nuclear free, immediately drew fire from a range of groups including conservative parties and Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power’s labor union.  The panel will select a group of citizens who will make the final decision on whether to cancel the construction of the reactors in Ulsan. The final decision is to be made by Oct. 21.While Moon’s government is set on nuclear-free energy policies, critics say that abandoning the project will incur some 2.6 trillion won  in sunk costs and trigger many job losses. As soon as the committee was launched, opposition parties opened fire, accusing Moon of “imperial presidency” and attacking the committee for lacking legal grounds. “The party’s legal team is reviewing the matter, and  there is clear violation of the law , legal steps will be taken,” Liberty Korea Party Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik said Tuesday. Liberty Korea Party policy chief Rep. Lee Hyun-jae echoed the view, saying that the committee lacked legitimacy. “ is an arbitrary civilian organization for carrying out the president’s imperialistic orders,” Lee said.“The president has already declared that more reactors could be shut down by 2030, it is worrisome whether this organization can make an unbiased and fair decision.” Kim Moon-soo, the outspoken former Gyeonggi Province governor of the Liberty Korea Party, also chimed in, accusing the government of making groundless decisions and of mob justice. “The committee is a kangaroo court that upholds the will of the candlelight emperor,” Kim wrote on his social media account, referring to the president. Kim went on to accuse Moon of violating government finance and nuclear safety laws by halting construction approved by the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission after 38 months of deliberation. The minor opposition People’s Party appears to be siding with the conservatives on the issue, echoing the main opposition’s views. “Halting the construction of nuclear reactors that are 29.8 percent complete at a cost of 1.6 trillion won is a very important matter,” Rep. Son Kum-ju, who heads the party’s committee on Moon’s nuclear-free policy. “It is not a matter that can be covered up with gimmicks such as a committee that lacks legal grounds, and citizen jurors.” Saying that the committee lacked expertise as well as legal grounds and fails to represent Korean society, Son accused the government of using the committee as a scapegoat. The public, which has shown overwhelming support for Moon and a number of his policies, is equally divided on the issue. A Gallup Korea poll conducted on July 14 showed that 41 percent of the public support scrapping the two Shin-Kori reactors, while 37 percent think that the construction should be resumed. The margin of error in the poll is 3.1 percent. The committee has also been attacked for lacking expertise in the field of nuclear energy. The committee is headed by Kim Ji-hyung, a former Supreme Court justice, and has eight members, two each from four categories: humanities and society; science and technology; survey and statistics; and conflict management. However, neither of the two science and technology members are experts in nuclear energy. The two scientists on the committee are Yu Tae-kyung, a chemical engineering professor at Kyung Hee University, and physics professor Lee Sung-jay of the Korea Institute for Advanced Study.By Choi He-suk","nuclear free on monday committee ,nuclear safety laws by halting ,reactors in ulsan the final ,party committee on moon nuclear ,halting the construction of nuclear","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'Korea Hydro and', 'Nuclear Power ’s', 'Ulsan', 'Moon ’s', 'Moon', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Chung Woo', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Lee Hyun - jae', 'Lee', 'Kim Moon - soo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Liberty Korea Party', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission', 'People ’s Party', 'Son Kum - ju', 'Moon', 'korean', 'Moon', 'Gallup Korea', 'Shin - Kori', 'Kim Ji - hyung', 'Supreme Court', 'Yu Tae - kyung', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Lee Sung - jay', 'the Korea Institute for Advanced Study', 'Choi']",11,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.25692818  0.25313473

It even has an engine leakage and malfunctions in its fuselage and windshield.   The state-run audit body said Korea Aerospace Industry, Surion’s manufacturer, did not run proper flight tests, while Defense Acquisition Program Administration and its affiliate Agency for Defense Development failed to supervise the procedure. The audit agency requested an investigation into DAPA chief Chang Myoung-jin, who allowed for continued deployment of Surion in December despite the defects, along with two other DAPA officials. Surion helicopter. Yonhap“We hope the investigation will help us come up with measures to fix Surion’s safety issues,” said the audit agency in a statement. “ will serve as an opportunity to ensure safety of the pilots and make Surion the best Korean helicopters.” It was not the first time that the helicopters’ flight safety prompted public concern. In 2015, a Surion crashed due to engine malfunction. In May, 1.2-1.5 centimeters-long cracks were found on the fuselage of eight Surions.Deployed to the South Korean Army since 2012, Surion is a twin-engine light utility helicopter designed to support various missions including troop assault, search-and-rescue, tactical lift, liaison and medical evacuation.Designed to fit the mountainous topography of the Korean Peninsula, the helicopters can travel at a speed of 140 knots for more than two hours with nine fully-equipped soldiers and make a vertical ascent at a speed of 500 feet per minute. The 15 meter-long and 4.5 meter-tall chopper is equipped with an automated navigation device, a multi-functional display system and other high-tech gears. Surions will replace aging U.S. UH-1Hs and 500MDs, which have been in service for more than three decades, according to DAPA.

The Board of Audit and Inspection said that South Korea-born Surion helicopters are not airworthy as they lack lightning protection and anti-icing capability, while failing to receive proper engine certification. It even reported that the homegrown chopper, also called the KUH-1, has a water leakage problem. The BAI said it requested a prosecution probe into Chang Myoung-jin, chief of the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, and other two officials for breach of trust. Chang determined in December 2016 that the Surions were ready to operate even though they failed to meet airworthiness qualifications. The BAI said it gave a ""warning"" to Chang and asked the other two officials, including the head of the Korean Helicopter Program, to be demoted.The audit agency also ordered Chang to halt delivery of the Surions until their problems are fixed and the DAPA to file damage claims against Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. It also asked the South Korean army's chief of staff to consult with Chang to come up with safety management measures on the Surions.  Surion helicopters South Korea invested 1.29 trillion won from June 2006 for KAI, the country's sole aircraft manufacturer, to develop the Surion and the project was completed in July 2012 after it was approved for combat-use. Since then, South Korean military has been using 60 Surions in the field.However, various accidents took place after the chopper went into operation. In January and February 2015, two Surion helicopters made an emergency landing following an engine failure, while another Surion chopper crash landed due to same problem. The BAI said the 2015 incidents are related to Surion's lack of anti-icing capability and the officials negligence to fix the problem.From October 2015 to March 2016, the DAPA conducted a set of tests in Michigan regarding the Surion's operation in humid and freezing conditions, but the chopper failed to meet 29 of 101 standards. The DAPA in August 2016 decided not to deliver the Surion to the South Korean army, but after the KAI announced in October that it will fix the problem until June 2018, the arms procurement agency decided to resume delivery of the helicopter even though no measures were taken to correct the icing defect.The BAI also ordered the South Korean army's chief of staff to request compensation from KAI and the Surion's enginemaker Hanwha Techwin Co. for the chopper's crash in 2015 and get a free engine replacement from the two companies. State prosecutors on Friday, meanwhile raided the offices of KAI on allegations of corruption in a set of major defense projects.","utility helicopters have various defects ,the chopper crash in 2015 ,helicopters made an emergency landing ,damage claims against korea aerospace ,friday meanwhile raided the offices","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Board of Audit and Inspection', 'South Korea', 'BAI', 'Chang Myoung - jin', 'the Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Chang', 'Surions', 'BAI', 'Chang', 'the Korean Helicopter Program', 'Chang', 'Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd.', 'south korean', 'Chang', 'Surions', 'South Korea', 'KAI', 'south korean', 'Surion', 'BAI', 'Surion', 'DAPA', 'Michigan', 'Surion', 'south korean', 'KAI', 'BAI', 'south korean', 'KAI', 'Surion', 'Hanwha Techwin Co.', 'KAI']",3,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.70044333  0.85904074

It also said the effective tax rate on businesses can be adjusted upwards by reducing various exemptions, loopholes and deductions.""Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon already said last month that Seoul is not considering raising income and corporate taxes,"" an official said. He added that policymakers are looking into other means to increase state revenue, hinting that various measures are being explored.He said the talks undertaken by the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee in regards to taxes have recently been passed to the finance ministry that will form the foundation for altering the tax bracket for the rich.Changes being hinted by the government are centered on the ""rich man's tax"" and calls for rates of 40 percent to be slapped on people making more than 300 million won  annually, down from the current 500 million won. At present those making between 150 million won to 500 million won per annum are subject to 38 percent income tax rates.""There had been talk of raising the tax rate for the top tier earners to 42 percent, but this approach has likely been scrapped despite calls by some ruling party lawmakers,"" said a government source, who declined to be identified.If the changes go into effect, only about 40,000 people will be affected, reducing the likelihood of widespread public backlash or tax hike resistance.In addition, the government may consider lowering exemptions given to inheritance taxes and financial sector profits, which can be seen as unearned income.The country's tax office gave favors to people who voluntarily reported inheritances, while the so-called comprehensive taxation has only been slapped on people whose earnings from financial holdings exceeded 20 million won annually.

While some job seekers hailed the move, others cried foul saying it would discriminate against those who studied hard to enter prestigious universities and acquire good grades. “I think the blind hiring system is good because I think it is a better way to more thoroughly evaluate candidates. If one is competent enough, one can get a job even without revealing the names of the school they went to,” Lee Hyun-song, 24, who graduated from a university outside Seoul, told The Korea Herald.“The system will be able to distinguish candidates based on job skills and abilities,” she said. Amid the competitive job market, it is common for Korean employers to ask potential hires about possible discriminatory factors such as age, gender, height, weight, marital status and even their parents’ professions in application forms or interviews. The hiring process has also been criticized for placing too much emphasis on the names of schools, academic records and English test scores.“In general, I agree with the blind screening system,” said Park Seong-ha, 27. “But I am against the government policy of giving advantages to students from schools outside Seoul. It is self-contradictory.” President Moon Jae-in has ordered his Cabinet to draw up plans for state-run organizations outside Seoul to fill at least 30 percent of their new hires with those who graduated from schools in cities they are based in, citing the need for a balanced regional development. Opponents say the envisioned system would deny the yearslong efforts of job seekers to be accepted into elite schools and get good grades, which some call “reverse discrimination.”“I don’t view it positively. I think that not being able to reveal my school name will be disadvantageous to me,” said a 24-year-old student who graduated from one of the top universities in Seoul. “I don’t think my school diploma has nothing to do with my abilities to do a job.” Another job seeker takes issue with the system’s efficacy. “I don’t know why they say it is fair. What is the point of public education if those who graduated from good schools cannot be rewarded?” said Park Sung-jun, 30. “And by not requiring a school’s name, language test score and academic records, companies would require other things such as internship experience. But internship chances are only given to those who already have good qualifications anyway.”The government will release a detailed guideline later this month and draw up a standardized resume to be used in the hiring process. It also said that it will not force but encourage private companies to follow its lead. According to a survey by job portal site Job Korea on 418 human resources managers, 80.9 percent of them said they would consider adopting the system at their companies. By Ock Hyun-ju","grades think the blind hiring ,from job seekers triggering controversy ,government announcement to implement blind ,job seekers triggering controversy over ,think the blind hiring system","['Lee Hyun - song', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'korean', 'english', 'Park Seong - ha', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul', '”“i', 'Seoul', 'Park Sung - jun', 'Job Korea']",11,"[ 0.          0.          4.         ... -0.18065719  0.17123784

Lamb and beef loomed large at 39.2 and 27 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram produced, respectively. Following that were cheese , pork , farmed salmon , turkey , chicken  and canned tuna . A typical serving of cheese, around 25 grams, results in much less than a typical 100-200 grams of meat. At the bottom of the list was lentils at 0.9 kg of carbon dioxide per kilogram produced, with milk at 1.9 kg and dry beans and tofu both at 2 kg.In 2009, celebrity vegan Paul McCartney launched nonprofit group Meat-Free Monday to encourage people to devote a day a week to swearing off meat. The group cites a conservative estimate from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that pins 14.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions on livestock production, while other estimates have ranged as high as 51 percent. On May 9, former US President Barack Obama delivered a keynote address at the Global Innovation Summit in Milan, Italy, where he stressed the importance of changing food habits on a global scale to curb global warming. Foremost, according to Obama, is reducing food waste. Beyond that, he suggested having “a smaller steak.” We can “make progress in educating the advanced world about the need to reduce,” he added, “the amount of meat that we consume at any given meal.”According to a 2012 study in Environmental Research Letters, stabilizing greenhouse gases by 2050 requires, among other efforts, “a 50 percent reduction in mean per capita meat consumption in the developed world.”While meat consumption per capita in the developed world is estimated to increase by little more than 10 percent from 1990 to 2030, for the developing world it is estimated to more than double, according to figures from the FAO.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed Monday that small flocks of farm chickens on the southern island of Jeju have tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus. The agency also said it will raise the bird flu alert to the highest level.The announcement came in response to a report by an owner of a small backyard farm Friday after eight of his chickens died. All sales of live poultry here are also banned until further notice starting Monday.Health authorities attempt to catch poultry at a farm in Busan on Monday as part of efforts to prevent the spread of bird flu. The government is taking prompt steps to contain the outbreak at an early stage. It had faced criticism over its tardy response that contributed to the worst-ever outbreak last year. Until health authorities closed the last case in early April, 37.8 million farm birds, or a fifth of the total poultry population here, were culled. With then-President Park Geun-hye’s duties suspended and the nation in political turmoil, the administration had failed to move quickly to stabilize the situation. “Make sure to stop bird flu with preventive measures and remain on high alert until  is over,” President Moon Jae said at a meeting with top secretaries and advisers, instructing Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon to oversee the issue. At least 20 farms in six cities and provinces are under close watch, according to ministry officials. Over 30,000 farm birds near the infected farms were slaughtered as a precaution. Amid spiraling public concern, the government and officials at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that there is very low risk that H5N8 and H5N6, common strains of bird flu, will infect humans. It is yet unclear what triggered the comeback of the virus in Gunsan, as the country had seen no cases since two months ago. The government announced the de facto end of the spread of bird flu by lowering the alert level to normal Thursday -- just two days before it raised the level back again. In the wake of the latest discovery, critics argue that a full investigation should be carried out to determine the source of the infection, as well as to strengthen prevention measures. “More investigation is needed in terms of the source of the infection, but it’s highly likely that the recent outbreak is attributed to viruses that have remained inside ,” Kim Jae-hong, a professor of veterinary medicine at Seoul National University, told The Korea Herald. The infected areas include Gunsan, the country’s southwestern region, which had possibly shipped out infected chickens and ducks to more farms including Paju, Gyeonggi, and Yangsan, and possibly to more areas not reported yet.Authorities are working to identify those areas to limit the spread of the virus. Kim added that the government’s “hasty decision” to lower the alert level last week was partly to blame for the re-emergence of bird flu, with many unauthorized backyard farms in individual households distributing poultry from and to local farmers. The lack of preventive measures for AI, despite its outbreak being almost an annual event since 2003, is another issue that should be addressed, critics say. “Our prevention system relies too much on farmers’ reports to the authority with insufficient measures to detect the course of the virus in advance,” Seo Sang-heui, a veterinary medicine professor at Chungnam National University, said in an interview with a local news outlet.By Bak Se-hwan","his chickens died all sales ,eight of his chickens died ,bird flu will infect humans ,the massive slaughter of poultry ,the infected farms were slaughtered","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'Jeju', 'Busan', 'Park Geun', 'Moon Jae', 'Lee Nak - yon', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Gunsan', 'Kim Jae - hong', 'Seoul National University', 'the Korea Herald', 'Paju', 'Yangsan', 'Kim', 'AI', 'Seo Sang - heui', 'Chungnam National University', 'Bak Se - hwan']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.49607122  0.83885145

Seniors are also more likely to die in traffic accidents due to their relatively weak physical conditions and reduced ability to recover ,” Oh Ju-seok, senior researcher at the Road Traffic Authority, told The Korea Herald. “It is important to strengthen the country’s license renewal requirements for the elderly to make an accurate diagnosis of their driving abilities.” In a separate survey conducted by the traffic authority last year, 75.7 percent of drivers above the age of 70 assessed their physical condition to be “good.” No respondents said they were in “poor” condition compared to other age groups, the survey showed. By Bak Se-hwan","traffic accidents has doubled over ,accidents doubling from the 2007 ,in traffic accidents has doubled ,traffic accidents has doubled ,died in road accidents doubling","['the Road Traffic Authority', 'the Road Traffic Authority', 'the Korea Herald', 'Bak Se - hwan']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67891252  0.15899682

The proposal reportedly pushes for giving more clout to main agencies under the Public Safety Ministry, such as the National Emergency Management and the Korea Coast Guard. The state’s fire agency, which has been a part of the National Emergency Management, will also receive its own desk following the decision. The meeting is expected to draw conclusions for the reorganization proposal that will be submitted to the parliament. The blueprint revolves around President Moon Jae-in’s vow to build a disaster control tower around Cheong Wa Dae to bolster the government’s risk and crisis management capabilities. The Ministry of Public Safety and Security was established in 2014 in the wake of the Sewol ferry disaster. It is the first governmental organization specialized in public safety and security, and was established under the Park Geun-hye administration. The ousted president, currently occupied with a series of hearings and trials, took flak over the questionable handling of the Sewol ferry disaster. The Korea Coast Guard, once an external branch of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, was also held responsible for its handling of the sinking, which eventually led to it being publicly reformed. Another top priority of the reshuffling plan is to reallocate the task of trade negotiation from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.By Jung Min-kyung","monday with government restructuring plans ,on monday with government restructuring ,monday with government restructuring ,korea on monday with government ,the new administration government reorganization","['South Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'the Ministry of Interior', 'the Public Safety Ministry ’s', 'Ministry of Public Safety and Security the Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'the Public Safety Ministry', 'the National Emergency Management', 'the Korea Coast Guard', 'the National Emergency Management', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'the Korea Coast Guard', 'the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries', 'the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Jung Min - kyung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50801784  0.70342553

From Thursday, the government will release water from six of the 16 dammed pools on four major rivers, the first step after Moon’s order earlier this month to review from scratch the previous Lee Myung-bak administration’s 22 trillion won  project.The water levels of the dammed pools will gradually drop by 2-3 centimeters per hour from 2 p.m. on Thursday, officials from the environment and land ministries said in a joint press briefing Monday. The discharge is expected to lower water levels by between 1.25 meters and 2 meters in total in six weir dams built on three of the four rivers -- Nakdong, Geum and Yeongsan.A boat stands stranded on dry cracked earth in a reservoir in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, Monday as a severe drought continues to grip the Korean Peninsula. “We have not decided to open all of the 16 dammed pools immediately and completely, because five years have passed since the dams were established and the ecosystem has adjusted to the change already,” the ministries said. They emphasized that discharging that amount of water will not affect irrigation for nearby farmers, noting that rice planting season has just begun.Some experts and farmers expressed concerns that the timing could not be more wrong. “Based on calculations, South Korea is now facing the worst drought amid serious climate change, which experts forecast will cause the driest season in 2025,” warned professor Byun Hee-ryong of Pukyung National University.As of the end of May, the country saw an accumulated precipitation of 161.1 millimeters, only half the usual level of 292.7 mm.Low precipitation has led to low water levels in reservoirs. Boryung Dam, a source of water for eight cities and counties in South Chungcheong Province, currently has an “alert” placed on it because it has insufficient water for agricultural use. Environmental activists said the government’s decision was neither drought-busting nor capable of cleaning waterways.“The release of water from only six dammed pools and lowering the water level by up to 1.25 meters will do very little to improve the water quality or remove algae,” the Korea Federation for Environmental Movements said in a statement. “Discharging such a small amount water, which is less than 10 percent of at least 1 billion tons of water stored there, will not fundamentally solve the algae problem,” said civic activist Lim Hee-ja.Along with the immediate release of water from the dammed pools, Moon ordered the execution of a drought countermeasure plan in advance. “Drought countermeasures must not be a temporary plan, but should fundamentally tackle the serious drought problem here,” Moon was quoted as saying.When rice planting season ends, the government will further lower the water level by 50-100 centimeters in October and open all dammed pools to the lowest limit by the end of 2018, Cheong Wa Dae said. “In an effort to restore the environment in the rivers through a comprehensive and considerate analysis, the opening of another 10 pools will be decided depending on the outcome of future studies on their impact on the ecosystem,” said Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun.Cheong Wa Dae said ministries and a related task force will monitor water levels to effectively deal with problems following the opening of dams.By Kim Da-sol","most severe droughts in decades ,droughts in decades from thursday ,monday as severe drought continues ,drought amid serious climate change ,province monday as severe drought","['Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'Moon ’s', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Nakdong', 'Geum', 'Yeongsan', 'Anseong', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'South Korea', 'Byun Hee - ryong', 'Pukyung National University', 'Boryung Dam', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'the Korea Federation for Environmental Movements', 'Lim Hee - ja', 'Moon', 'drought', 'Moon', 'Cheong Wa', 'Dae', 'Kim Da - sol']",14,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.656964    0.19537754

The aging population is feared to reduce the workforce and drive up welfare costs, undermining the growth potential of Asia's fourth-largest economy.It has been struggling to boost its birthrate, though no significant progress has been made yet, as many young people delay marriage as they cannot find decent jobs amid a prolonged economic slowdown.The country's total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- stood at 1.25 in 2016.","many dual income newlywed couples ,newlywed couples in south korea ,income newlywed couples in south ,maternity leave totaled 12 weeks ,dual income newlywed couples","['South Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'OECD', 'south Korean', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'South Korea']",0,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.69188201  0.46971515

Prevalence for becoming overweight also increased from 1.9 percent to 4.3 percent during the period. The findings were based on five separate national health and nutritional surveys conducted between 1998 and 2012 that cover 19,218 adults aged 19-39 . They were published in the latest edition of the medical journal Obesity Research & Clinical Practice.One of the stark findings was that young women became more extreme in their weights, either over or under the desired weight.  According to the report, women in the studied age group were 1.7 times more at risk of becoming obese compared with 1998 and 2.3 times more at risk of becoming too thin.In the case of men, prevalence for obesity grew from 2.3 percent to 14.4 percent. Prevalence for abdominal obesity increased even more, from 6.6 percent to 21.1 percent. Unlike women, however, prevalence for becoming underweight fell from 4.5 percent to 3.2 percent.Park Hye-soon and Lim Ji-sun, the authors of the report, said the phenomenon has largely to do with dietary patterns and people's lifestyles. For men, 35.1 percent were consuming excess calorie energy in 2012 compared with 27.6 percent in 1998. For women, the number dropped from 25.8 percent to 19.8 percent.Both men and women were not exercising enough, and they were drinking much more alcohol than before, they said.Park cited the dangers of adult obesity: how it can weaken parasympathetic nerves, cause problems with the autonomic nervous system and increase the risks of cardiovascular diseases. Even when in the normal weight range, excessive fat in the body's middle areas can increase chances of cardiovascular diseases, she said.""The report affirms that young women who are slim are shedding weight to become thinner,"" Lim said.

The fine dust level recorded average in Seoul on the day, the National Institute of Environmental Research said. The government also plans to shut down the 10 plants for four months next year, from March to June, when power demand is relatively low and fine dust level is high. “President ’s decision to halt operating aged coal-fired plants shows his strong will to provide a fundamental solution to the current fine dust problem,” said Yoon Young-chan, the chief press secretary. Yoon also said Moon has ordered the senior social affairs secretary to create a special task force to deal with measures to combat fine dust here.“The government will also install dust-measuring devices at some 11,000 elementary to high schools across the nation to constantly monitor air quality,” said President Moon Jae-in during his visit to an elementary school in Seoul on Monday. Moon added that he would inject some 60 billion won  to complete installing those devices as well as air circulators.During the presidential campaign, Moon has vowed to cut fine dust emissions by 30 percent by reducing the number of coal-fired power plants.His energy policy pledges included permanently closing old coal-fired plants within his five-year term while reassessing plans to construct nine new plants.He also pledged to close old nuclear power plants and suspend the construction of new ones in an aim to become a nation without nuclear power in 40 years.“We can no longer delay the pursuit of safe and clean energies. I will reduce coal-fired power plants and nuclear reactors, but increase renewable natural gas power generation,” Moon said in a statement.“If construction on a coal-fired power plant is less than 10 percent completed, I will review the project after taking leadership of the country.”South Korea has 59 coal-fired power plants that currently produce about 40 percent of the country’s electricity. Nuclear power is the second-biggest source of electricity accounting for about 30 percent of the output, followed by liquefied natural gas at 25 percent and oil at 3 percent. Renewable sources account for just around 2 percent of the nation’s electricity production.According to government data, the 10 old coal-fired plants account for almost 20 percent of the pollution -- 33,000 tons of dust, sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide -- discharged from the total number of coal-fired plants operated in the country.By Kim Da-sol","permanently closing old coal fired ,closing old coal fired plants ,included permanently closing old coal ,outdated coal fired plants aged ,shut down the 10 plants","['Gangwon', 'South Jeolla', 'South Chungcheong', 'South Gyeongsang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the National Institute of Environmental Research', 'Yoon Young - chan', 'Yoon', 'Moon', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Korea', 'Kim Da - sol']",11,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.73775369  0.39578426

The cat had since lived with Moon and his wife Kim Jung-sook at their home in Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province. Jjing-jjing Jjing-jjing became famous in 2012 when Moon first ran for the presidency against the eventual ousted President Park Geun-hye. Yoo Hong-joon, former head of the Cultural Heritage Administration, mentioned the pet in his speech to illustrate Moon’s caring personality. On Sunday, Moon tweeted about a flycatcher whose recently built nest was found in the Cheong Wa Dae compound. Its baby birds apparently hatched the day Moon won the presidential election.“Jjing-jjing has arrived, but I have a concern,” Moon tweeted, “There are five baby flycatchers living in the nest between a glass window and a sliding paper window.” “Jjing-jjing used to occasionally surprise us at our  Gyeongsang  home with dead birds,” Moon wrote, expressing worry his cat might attack the baby birds. Maroo In addition to Jjing-jjing, Moon is also bringing “Maroo,” his dog from his Yangsan home, and is proceeding to adopt “Tory,” a homeless dog whose name -- referring to chestnut -- reflects its dark coat.

Results included in the report showed that 66.9 percent of them had received government allowances for raising children at home. Asked to grade the subsidy system between 1  to 4 , the respondents gave the average score of 2.4, close to 2 points . The government started the subsidy system in March 2013 to encourage parents to better bond with their children by caring for them at home and lessen their use of daycare centers. The amount of the allowance was set uniformly, regardless of household income, according to each child's age at between 100,000 won  and 200,000 won.The subsidies, however, are less than the amount of government assistance for parents who need to send their children to daycare centers or kindergartens. From July last year, parents can receive between 220,000 won and 825,000 won, depending on the hours of use.Survey results said 61 percent of the women who received child rearing subsidies wanted a higher amount of allowances, while 23 percent said the paid amount should differ according to family income.Among those who wanted a higher subsidy, 75.7 percent said the paid sum fell short of actual money spent on their children, while 24.3 percent cited the differences in amount with parents who use daycare centers.","mothers receiving state subsidy for ,majority of mothers receiving state ,kindergartens from july last year ,mothers receiving state subsidy ,march 2013 to encourage parents",['the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education'],19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6148802  -0.01963435

Incentives tourists refer to people who are treated to a paid holiday as a reward from the company he or she works for by meeting growth targets or tasks.Under the pact, Vietnam's travel agencies will send around 100 incentive traveler groups per year to South Korea's resort island that can greatly contribute to Jeju's tourism industry.The island, off the southern coast of South Korea, has become a favorite attraction for many travelers, but the diplomatic row with China over Seoul's decision to install an advanced anti-missile defense system on its soil has seriously affected the inflow of Chinese visitors.""Vietnam is growing at a brisk pace and has great potential in terms of outbound travelers,"" said an official from the Jeju provincial government, who played a role in facilitating the latest deal. He said that the agreement will not only promote visits by incentive travelers but those coming on individual and group trips down the line.According to data provided by Jeju, the island received some 11,617 visitors from Vietnam in 2010, with this number expanding to 31,914 in 2014, before backtracking in 2015 and sliding to 25,008 last year.Jeju tourism authorities said that besides Vietnam it will seek to attract more visitors from places like Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia by strengthening marketing efforts.","000 incentive tourists from vietnam ,sunday the jeju tourism organization ,incentive tourists from vietnam ,host some 000 incentive tourists ,tourists from vietnam as part","['Vietnam', 'southeast asian', 'the Jeju Tourism Organization , Jeju Convention and Visitors Bureau', 'the Korea Tourism Organization', 'Ho Chi Minh City', 'Viettravel', 'Saigon Tourist', 'Vietnam', ""South Korea 's"", 'Jeju', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Jeju', 'Jeju', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Taiwan', 'Singapore', 'Malaysia']",2,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.24134022  0.73705077

The ministry has announced a set of anti-air pollution guidelines that include restricting the outdoor activities of students when the concentration of airborne pollutants is high.The capital blanketed in a gray haze caused by fine dust in the air. “A new committee will be run in cooperation with regional education offices and experts of environment and education to solve air pollution problems,” the ministry said in a press release. “If necessary, we are considering to form an additional task force team.”Thursday’s announcement came after Seoul’s local education office independently notified schools in the city to refrain from outdoor activities during times of bad air quality. Public concerns have risen over local schools’ lack of response to air pollution, which parents and experts say would have a greater impact on children.Under the new guidelines, all schools are recommended to have enough space to carry out indoor sports activities in case of fine dust concentration levels exceeding 81 micrograms per cubic meter .The invisible dust particles can cause a wide range of maladies, including cancer, by penetrating into the respiratory system.To better inform the public about air quality, the government body will also hold talks with the Ministry of Environment to make the measurements of fine dust more accurate to meet the World Health Organization’s standards. “In order to prevent the health damage of students,  need to recognize the danger of fine dust and continue creating education programs on the subject,” said Education Minister Lee Joon-sik. “Active cooperation is needed between authorities, education offices and schools in order to create a safe school environment.”By Bak Se-hwan","students from worsening air pollution ,education to solve air pollution ,force team thursday announcement ,worsening air pollution the ministry ,the new guidelines all schools","['South Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Education', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Environment', 'the World Health Organization ’s', 'Lee Joon - sik', 'Bak Se - hwan']",11,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.47054747  0.20980981

This raised concerns over possible havoc in case of interest rate hikes take place in the coming years.Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party has said he plans to increase property tax, citing the ratio of the property tax to the gross domestic product standing at 0.79 percent compared to the average ratio of 1.09 percent for OECD member states.Moon's approval rating was 32.7 percent in a public survey released on Sunday with Ahn Cheol-soo of the centrist People's Party coming in first with 36.8 percent. Approval ratings between Moon and Ahn fluctuate depending on polls, although all clearly show them in the lead. Hong Joon-pyo of the former ruling Liberty Korea Party garnered only 6.5 percent in the wake of the impeachment of the former President Park Geun-hye over alleged bribery and power abuses.Ahn has said he will normalize the housing tax system, indirectly expressing his intentions to tighten housing loan regulations.Some analysts predict any hikes of the property tax should entail real estate transfer tax cuts.""In that case, calls for property sale tax cuts will be mounting as the property transfer tax rate is higher in South Korea than those in the United States and other advanced countries,"" an analyst said.Both Moon and Ahn have said they will tighten the DTI and LTV ratios to help reduce the household debt.The housing industry, however, has demanded the government extend the current DTI and LTV ratios until July next year to revitalize the sagging construction industry. The current eased ratios are to expire in July.Moon's Democratic Party has also submitted a bill to limit rent and jeonse fees, a returnable lump sum deposit unique to South Korea, which the incumbent government has opposed for fear of dampening the housing market by restricting homeowners' right to property ownership.Moon also proposed investing 50 trillion won in the coming five years in the development of new towns and renovation of old city neighborhoods across the country while building 50,000 public rental houses and additional dormitories for up to 50,000 students.Ahn for his part pledged to build 50,000 public rental homes for youths annually and subsidize the construction of dormitories in universities.

When such desire escalates, the students tended to rely heavily on alcohol by drinking more and more frequently, the study said.  The study drew a parallel from conclusions from other reports that said people exposed to vulnerabilities, including victims of violence, grow dependent on alcohol or substances, thinking they are answers to their psychological pains.Such behavior, however, only reinforces negative feelings and state of mind, causing even deeper dependence on alcohol, drugs and other substances while weakening self-control, the study said. Such a destructive cycle was also seen among collegians suffering from depression and stress, it said.The study recommended that efforts to solve or change the drinking culture at universities should be focused on the cause of such alcohol binges. The students should be taught to realize that alcohol and substances do not relieve their psychological strains but worsen them, and induce the students to find other means of dealing with the pains, the study added.","campus drinking problems the latest ,to solve campus drinking problems ,campus drinking problems ,drinking problems the latest health ,violence grow dependent on alcohol",['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs'],1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.01159585  0.10969914

Substances are placed in this category when there is evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. According to a report by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, cigarettes contain seven group 1 substances, including benzene, benzopyrene and 4-aminobiphenyl, as well as five other lower-level substances. Benzene, which not only increases the risk of cancer and other illnesses, is a cause of bone marrow failure. Most nonindustrial applications of the substance are tightly regulated.The report also showed that despite the perception that e-cigarettes are less harmful, using the device significantly raises exposure to carcinogenic substances.The latest findings clearly show that smoking is a serious health risk that can undermine the general public's well-being, authorities said.In an effort to lower the smoking rate, the government mandated tobacco companies place graphic images showing the harmful effects of smoking on the upper part of cigarette packs in 2016.The new rule requires the pictorial warnings to occupy more than 30 percent of the front and back of cigarette packaging. The graphic warning images must be placed on packets of e-cigarettes and chewing tobacco as well.However, the current packaging only notifies users of the level of tar and nicotine, the authorities said.The smoking rate among South Koreans came to 39.3 percent among males and 5.5 percent among women, while that for people aged under 19 reached 9.6 percent for males and 2.7 percent for females in 2015.","market contain seven cancer causing ,seven cancer causing substances that ,contain seven cancer causing substances ,seven cancer causing substances ,the market contain seven cancer","['cigarette', 'south korean', 'the International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'the World Health Organization', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'Benzene', 'South Koreans']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79288936  0.43936116

The report, released Sunday by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, has also found a positive correlation between the supply of affordable housing and marriage, although no meaningful link was found when it comes to childbirths.The paper analyzed the correlation between housing, marriage and childbirth, using data from the National Statistical Office, Korea Appraisal Board and others from 2010 to 2014.“The result signifies higher home prices or key money deposits could lead to lower marriage rates or total fertility rates,” the research team said.The study also indicated that housing costs, tenure types and home sizes play a role in people’s decision to have children.Couples put off childbirth if housing costs are unmanageable or their housing is small, but most do not delay having more children if they own their own home, the data found.In order to break the negative link between the housing burden and childbirth and make a virtuous circle, lead researcher Lee Sam-sik suggests that the country tackles the housing paradigm that a home is something that a family should “own.” “Instead of providing support for housing purchases and rental fees, the country should consider expanding the supplies of public rental housing,” he said.South Korea has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, with an average 1.25 children per woman in 2016, while more and more young people are deferring marriage to a later age or choosing not to wed at all.By Byun Hee-jin","marriages and birthrates recent study ,prices or rents lowers marriages ,fertility rates the research ,lowers marriages and birthrates recent ,rents lowers marriages and birthrates","['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'the National Statistical Office', 'Korea Appraisal Board', 'Lee Sam - sik', 'South Korea', 'Byun Hee - jin']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.92565948  0.34737802

Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea, holds a press conference after the presentation of a report on the human rights situation in North Korea at the session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on March 13, 2017. The US State Department's latest country report on human rights practices, which took issue with other countries' human rights conditions, is a ridiculous act given the US itself is full of hard-to-solve human rights issues, the paper criticized. ""It's the anti-human rights nature of the money-dominated US election that a handful of the privileged are mocking the political rights of the masses through a game of power,"" the paper said. The paper also berated the abuse of guns and racial discrimination in the US.""It is none other than the US, chieftain of invasion and mass-killing, which caused the worst-ever refugee crisis in the Middle East under the pretext of 'anti-terror war,'"" the paper said. The paper derided the country report, saying, ""The successive US administrations release reports on human rights as national treasure, though they are considered by the international community as waste papers.""

Only the photos believed to contain documents were enlarged, though all of the enlarged photos may not be documents.""The Air Force also noted that all smartphone users in active duty have signed a written pledge to cooperate in security inspections.But the human rights commission ruled that the privacy of soldiers should not be violated without reasonable legal grounds.""The signing of a written security pledge cannot be interpreted as an intent to agree to make public their private matters,"" the commission said.","soldiers smartphone content without consent ,inspecting individual soldiers smartphone content ,air force officer also complained ,investigators viewed the smartphone photos ,breastfeeding stored on his smartphone","['south korean', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'the Defense Security Command', 'defense Security Command', 'Air Force', 'Air Force', 'DSC', 'Air Force', 'another Air Force', 'DSC', '""the Air Force']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4460527   0.5699923

I think that is part of what Secretary Tillerson is going to be discussing with him during their meeting,"" he said of a meeting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had with Trump after returning from a trip to Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing.Over the weekend, Trump also held a series of meetings to discuss North Korea, including one with his National Security Advisor H.R.

It also said Trump also met with military personnel, though it was unclear if the meeting was related to North Korea.Trump said Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is acting ""very, very badly.""Saturday's engine test by the North came after Tillerson strongly signaled a hardline policy on the North, saying two decades of diplomatic efforts to disarm the North failed, and the US is looking at a range of options, including the use of military action.During a trip to Seoul and Tokyo, Tillerson also declared an end to former President Barack Obama's North Korea policy, known as ""strategic patience,"" which centers on waiting for Pyongyang to show good faith while increasing sanctions and pressure on the regime.""I think he sent a very clear signal that our policy of strategic patience is over,"" Spicer said.

The two will be designated as level-three infectious diseases starting in June, said the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The ministry divides infectious diseases into five levels in terms of how dangerous they are and how quickly they can spread.The Ministry of Health and Welfare said on March 17 it will designate two super bacteria -- the Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- that are resistant to certain antibiotics as level-three diseases. The ministry had so far ordered 115 major hospitals to monitor and notify the health authorities of suspicious cases of six kinds of antibiotics-resistant threats, including the two super bacteria.Under the new and revised measure, all hospitals and clinics across the country must notify cases of the two super bacteria, in an effort to better counter the possible spread of the infectious diseases.The ministry said more than 80,000 people are infected with super bacteria annually that are resistant to antibiotics due to the overuse and misuse of drugs.VRSA, which has also been cited for causing bacteremia, osteomyelitis and certain types of skin disease, leads to pneumonia and in severe cases death of the patient. CRE is a bacteria that is resistant to the carbapenem class of antibiotics that are considered the last resort for such infections.

The blacklisted artists were barred from receiving state funding or support. Kim Young-san, director of the culture ministry's culture and arts policy bureau, speaks during a press briefing at a Seoul restaurant on March 9, 2017, to announce the ministry's plan to prevent any future blacklisting of artists. The ministry will also insert a new clause into the code of conduct for cultural ministry officials to protect officials from being punished for rejecting unjust instructions from their superiors.To ensure more autonomy and independence of the Arts Council Korea and the Korean Film Council, two main government agencies in charge of supporting artists, the government will let the culture and arts scene appoint their members and chairmen. Currently, the culture minister can name members and chairmen of the councils with recommendations from the scene.The two agencies have come under fire for taking the role of enforcing the blacklist, yielding to political pressure from the government.In addition, the ministry will restore unjustly scrapped or reformed support programs in the fields of literature, theatrical play and film under the current government and create five new programs to support local publishing and performing arts.

Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of latent TB patients are known to develop TB at some time in their lives, usually between 15 and 40.About 850,000 South Koreans aged 40 will also get tested for latent TB during their annual mandatory medical checkups from July this year.In January, the ministry required all possible military conscripts and employees of postpartum centers to receive a mandatory test for latent TB. The compulsory tests will be expanded to workers at daycare centers, hospitals and welfare facilities in March, and to prison inmates in May. The move comes as South Korea has the highest prevalence rate of TB among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The country had 63 patients per 100,000 people in 2015. Portugal ranks second with 25 patients, followed by Poland with 21.Yet South Korea's TB incidence rate has been on the decline.The country's new TB patients stood at 32,181 in 2015, down 2,688 from the previous year.In March last year, the ministry unveiled a package of measures to counter TB, which calls for lowering the country's incidence rate for the disease to 12 patients per 100,000 people by 2025.","latent tb during their annual ,000 high school freshmen teachers ,the country new tb patients ,free tests for latent tuberculosis ,10 percent of latent tb","['South Korea', 'TB', 'TB', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'TB', 'South Koreans', 'TB', 'South Korea', 'TB', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Portugal', 'Poland', ""South Korea 's"", 'TB', 'TB']",14,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.41321623  0.23339559

The WHO recommends an average sodium intake of 2,000 mg per day, as an excessive amount could raise blood pressure and pose health risks.In general, Koreans consume 3,400 mg of sodium daily, almost 1.5 times the recommended daily intake. Separate studies showed that most Koreans’ daily sodium intake comes from dining out instead of cooking and eating at home. Of their total sodium intake, about 12 percent came from kimchi.There are a variety of rice burgers, ranging from those made with bulgogi to those with kimchi, diced ham, spicy pork and other fillings. However, the one made with diced ham has the highest sodium content, at 1,736.3 mg, or 86.8 percent of the recommended daily intake amount.The report said that 17 out of 50 rice burger stores included in the survey sold rice burgers with at least 1,000 mg of sodium content.The report also said most of these rice burger stores did not list basic nutrition information on their menus, making it difficult for consumers to become aware of the high sodium content of their food. Currently, the Special Act on Safety Management of Children’s Dietary Lifestyle stipulates that a restaurant franchise that has over 100 local stores and which sells food popular among children -- such as bakery products, hamburgers and pizzas -- should provide nutrition information to consumers. But rice burgers or kimbap are excluded from this category of food.The city government stressed that the authorities should require more food chains to provide nutrition information so young consumers know what they are eating. They also recommended food chains to standardize their recipes, so consumers can avoid food with high sodium content.“We will continue to conduct regular monitoring on food enjoyed by children and students, while discussing ways for consumers to find nutrition information helpful to maintaining a balanced diet,” said Na Baek-ju from the Seoul City’s Citizens’ health bureau.

These garments prevent doctor-patient contamination, offer some storage space for items such as pens and small medical instruments, and also allow easy recognition by colleagues and patients. They also underline doctors’ authority.But ironically, these white coats have recently come under fire for posing an infection risk when worn outside clinical environments. Doctors wearing white medical coats are seen outside a hospital in Seoul. The figures in the photo are not related to those mentioned in the article. Shin Ji-eun, a part-timer at a cafe next to a hospital in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province, frequently witnesses doctors wearing their white coats out in the streets.“Almost every day, I see doctors and nurses in their medical gowns, on their way out for a quick lunch or coffee,” Shin said.“Of course I do not approve, as those people have been meeting and touching patients while wearing their coats -- and do the same when they go back inside, after striding down the street defenselessly.”If the intention is to look professional in public, the doctors should find another way to do so -- one which would not cause sanitation concerns, she added.Experts, however, claim there is no proven connection between these uniforms and infections.“There is little clinical evidence on the impact that the white coats may have on potential infections,” Park Do-joon, director general of the Korea National Institute of Health, told The Korea Herald.But doctors are nevertheless advised not to wear them outside the hospital, due to the possibility they might play a role in transferring pathogens to the community, he added.Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health and Welfare released a proposal of recommendation for health care workers to “not go outside in their duty uniform  and pay extra attention to personal hygiene.” It also recommended patients not to leave hospitals wearing their hospital gowns.There are similar guidelines overseas. In the United States, the American Medical Association in 2009 passed a resolution to encourage the “adoption of hospital guidelines for dress codes that minimize transmission of nosocomial infections.”In Korea, Rep. Shin Kyoung-min of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea motioned a bill related to the current Medical Service Act in July last year, to ban medical workers from wearing their white coats outside the hospital.“With the series of epidemic outbreaks, our society should become more careful to prevent contamination inside and outside a hospital,” the lawmaker said. But some view these pre-emptive moves as excessive restrictions.“We should not expect doctors to strictly abide by such regulations when there is no concrete evidence that their coat is a source of spreading infection,” Kim Nam-joong, a professor at Seoul National University Hospital’s division of infectious diseases, told The Korea Herald.“What about mobiles phones? They are almost never sterilized,” Kim added.Several years ago, SNU hospital redesigned its duty uniforms for doctors and nurses, changing them to short-sleeved ones and with bow ties, on the premise that long sleeves and ties might increase contact between staff and patients. “Since we are most frequently in contact with patients through our hands, it is hand sanitation that we  keep as a top priority at all times,” Kim said.“We keep a real-time watch on washing hands, but do not really pay keen attention to the wearing and taking off of the coats.”The Korean Medical Association said in a statement that “it is a violation of human rights if doctors are forced to take off their white coats outside, as they are viewed as a source of spreading infection without concrete evidence.”By Kim Da-sol","doctors wearing white medical coats ,environments doctors wearing white medical ,doctors wearing white medical ,witnesses doctors wearing their white ,doctors wearing their white coats","['Seoul', 'Shin Ji - eun', 'Bundang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Shin', 'the Korea National Institute of Health', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the United States', 'the American Medical Association', 'Korea', 'Shin Kyoung - min', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Kim Nam - joong', 'Seoul National University Hospital ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'snu', 'Kim', 'Korean Medical Association', 'Kim Da - sol']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.63004255  0.36419144

According to the “State of Global Air 2017,” a report by nonprofit environmental group Health Effects Institute in the United States, the nation’s average population-weighted concentration level of PM2.5 -- which refers to ultrafine particles or particle matter with a diameter of at least 2.5 micrometers -- was 29 micrograms per cubic meter in 2015, above the average 15 micrograms for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Fine dust covers the cityscape of Jongno-gu and Lotte World Tower in Jamsil, Seoul, on Thursday. South Korea’s reading trailed only Turkey among the OECD. The study showed the dust problem grew worse in South Korea, while the OECD average had improved in the past 25 years. In 1990, the PM 2.5 figure was 26 micrograms, compared to the OECD average of 17 micrograms. When compared to other Asian countries, the quality of air in Korea is more polluted than Japan and Singapore, which scored 13 micrograms and 19 micrograms, respectively. China recorded 58 micrograms, followed by North Korea at 34 and Laos at 33. The latest survey came as South Koreans debate the cause of the deteriorating air condition, crucial for deciding on measures to curb it. While many have pointed to China as the main culprit, the South Korean government highlights emissions from diesel engine cars and business sites dealing with construction waste or using solid fuel. The Environmental Ministry last June came up with fine dust countermeasures, including a weekly no-driving campaign and gradually cutting down on benefits given to diesel car owners, with an aim of improving the country’s air quality to levels equivalent to European countries in 10 years. However, the government’s plan did not gain wide support from the public.A survey of 1,000 citizens conducted by the state-run Korea Environment Institute last September showed that 53.1 percent of Koreans were dissatisfied with the government’s handling of the fine dust situation, while 55.2 were worried about the current dust concentration. “I have always thought the fine dust came to Korea through wind from China. Instead of blaming the citizens for causing the dust, the government should make more efforts to stop its influx from China,” Kim Hee-jung, a university student said. An online community site was also established last May where members gather to demand solutions to the dust problem from the government. In less than a year, membership had expanded to some 30,393 across the country.While high population density and rapid industrialization are also cited as driving the high concentration of fine dust in South Korea, citizens raise questions as to the possible influx of the harmful particles from outside the peninsula.In early January, a separate study conducted by the KEI showed that about 70 percent of fine dust particles found in South Korean skies came from neighboring Northeast Asian countries such as China.Pundits and analysts said that for a more accurate analysis on the impact from other countries, more data needs to be shared between them. “I cannot say the KEI’s conclusion about  70 percent of the fine dust in the country is perfectly accurate. However, it is true that China may have influenced the concentration level of the dust in Korea,” Park Jong-gil, chief of the Atmospheric Environmental Information Research Center of Inje University, said. “China is not so fond of giving  their meteorological information, which makes it hard us to compare the elements of fine dust in the two countries. More cooperation is needed.”By Jo He-rim","korea has nearly the worst ,grew worse in south korea ,korea is more polluted than ,seoul on thursday south korea ,in korea is more polluted","['South Korea', 'Health Effects Institute', 'the United States', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Jongno - gu', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Jamsil', 'Seoul', 'South Korea ’s', 'Turkey', 'OECD', 'South Korea', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'asian', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Singapore', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Laos', 'South Koreans', 'China', 'south korean', 'the Environmental Ministry', 'european', 'Korea Environment Institute', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'South Korea', 'KEI', 'south korean', 'northeast asian', 'China', 'KEI', 'China', 'Korea', 'Park Jong - gil', 'the Atmospheric Environmental Information Research Center of Inje University', 'China', 'Jo He - rim']",9,"[ 3.          0.          1.         ... -1.03235698  0.5858478

Typhoon Lionrock smashed the province in early September last year, which North Korean news outlets earlier said left nearly 70,000 residents homeless. More than 130 North Koreans were also reportedly dead and about 400 missing in the North's worst-ever flood. According to the source, the North kept all the canned aid food for its war preparations and redirected all of the diesel offered by Russia to its military.The source also claimed that the confectionery given by the international community was presented to children in major cities on the birthday of leader Kim Jong-un, which fell on Jan. 8.The 20 million yuan  in emergency aid offered by China was used to acquire excavators, iron bars, cement and other construction equipment or building materials for the Ryomyong project, according to the source. Ryomyong Boulevard connects the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which holds the embalmed bodies of the leader’s father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung, with a Tower of Eternal Life -- one of many in North Korea.The North is expected to concentrate its efforts on a development project in Samjiyon near Mount Paektu on the border with China and the construction of a tourist development project in Wonsan after the street project is complete, the source said, adding international aid for the recovery of its flood damage is used to help it publicize Kim's leadership and his political achievements.","caused by deadly flooding last ,deadly flooding last year for ,by deadly flooding last year ,deadly flooding last year ,flooding last year for its","['North Korea', 'US', 'Ryanggang Province', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Ryomyong Street', 'Pyongyang', 'Wonsan', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Rodong Sinmun', 'Typhoon Lionrock', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'Russia', 'Kim Jong - un', 'China', 'Ryomyong', 'Ryomyong Boulevard', 'Sun', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Il - sung', 'a Tower of Eternal Life', 'North Korea', 'Samjiyon', 'China', 'Wonsan', 'Kim']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.02592051  0.15342934

The number is already more than double the previous record of 13.96 million destroyed in a 2014 outbreak.   The first case in the latest outbreak was reported at a chicken farm in Haenam, about 420 kilometers south of Seoul, on Nov. 16. It was caused by the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu strain.   After ravaging some 340 poultry farms nationwide, the outbreak appeared to subside around early February.    But it resurfaced on Monday at a poultry farm in Gimje, North Jeolla Province, some 260 kilometers southwest of Seoul.   The latest AI case came as the country was also grappling with the spread of foot-and-mouth disease , first reported on Feb. 5 in North Chungcheong Province's Boeun, some 180 kilometers south of Seoul.   More FMD cases were later reported at farms in Jeongeup, located 260 kilometers south of Seoul in North Jeolla Province, and in Yeoncheon, 62 kilometers north of Seoul and near the border with North Korea.   So far, 1,093 cattle from 14 farms have been slaughtered as of Friday, according to the agriculture ministry. The ministry has begun vaccinating some 2.83 million cattle since Wednesday after evidence suggested that some haven't properly developed antibodies.   ""The vaccination is going smoothly and we plan to finish the process no later than Sunday evening,"" a ministry official said.       Government compensation towards the 340 AI-hit farms is expected to total 261.2 billion won , 2.6 times larger than the amount from 2014.   By law, the central government shoulders 80 percent of the cost, with local governments responsible for the remaining 20 percent.     Despite this arrangement, local governments are asking the central government to increase its share of costs, citing additional burdens from the FMD outbreak.   ""The situation is dire to the point where talks are floating on whether we should announce a moratorium as our budget might run out after paying for preventive measures and providing compensation,"" a local government official, who wished to remain anonymous, said.   ""The central government should shoulder more.

It also plans to recruit more plaintiffs. Earlier this week, the special counsel team investigating President Park’s scandal indicted Kim and Cho in relation to the blacklist allegation and stated Park as an accomplice in their arraignment.    The team believes that the creation of the list was led by Park’s chief of staff Kim, under the president’s directive, and was handed over to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism as a reference for state-funded projects and grant programs.  Although the list has never been surfaced, local reports said they had some 10,000 names, including high-profile celebrities such as “Oldboy” director Park Chan-wook and poet Ko Un. “The damages  are too serious to be estimated, as the list blocked them from performing artistic activities,” Jeon Min-kyung, one of the representatives of the group, said at the press conference. “The 1 million won we are demanding is just part of the compensation, along with other property damages.”  The group added that it would file another lawsuit against Park’s aides for illegally collecting the personal information of artists in the process of the blacklisting. Park’s alleged involvement in blacklisting liberal artists has been seen as a key element in her ongoing impeachment trial by the Constitutional Court. The court is currently reviewing whether to end her presidency, while Park has been stripped of her powers until the decision is made.By Bak Se-hwan","400 artists allegedly blacklisted by ,team investigating president park scandal ,over 400 artists allegedly blacklisted ,400 artists allegedly blacklisted ,blacklisting of over 400 artists","['Park', 'Minbyun', 'Lawyers for a Democratic Society', 'Park', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Culture', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Lawyers for a Democratic Society', 'Park Geun', 'Minbyun', 'Kim', 'Cho', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Kim', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism', 'Oldboy', 'Park Chan -', 'Ko Un', 'Jeon Min - kyung', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Bak Se - hwan']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37991479  0.41578192

Officials said many of the farmers had skipped vaccination on fears of side effects on milking and giving birth by their cows, but the government came under fire for shoddy management. Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Minister Kim Jae-soo ""It is true that the existing testing system does not show the rate of antibody development for the full population of cows,"" Park Bong-kyun, head of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, said in a briefing. ""We will overhaul the method and cycle of the inspections.""The agency has been conducting tests annually since 2010 on some 9,500 cattle farms, about 10 percent of the nation's total.Farms for testing were picked regardless of their size, with only one cow selected for verification. If the cow had antibodies, then the farm was recorded as having a 100 percent rate of antibody development. Officials said that under such a system, only 0.3 percent of the entire cattle population had been subject to inspection.Park said the agency will revise the system to test six cows per farm instead of just one and make detailed sampling to include cows of different genders and age. The tests will be increased to a maximum of four times a year from a one-time inspection, he said.The agency said the problem of farmers' negligence remains despite the proposed changes. Cows need to be vaccinated every four to seven months, but farm owners tend to avoid it, fearing losses in milk yield and problems in impregnation and giving birth, it said.""We can't dismiss financial losses from a cow's miscarriage, but an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease will require culling of all cattle,"" Park said.

Civic groups in support of sexual minorities call for the abolishment of the Education Ministry‘s controversial guidelines for sex education during a press conference in front of the Seoul Government Complex, Wednesday So far, mentions of LGBT people are non-existent in textbooks and education materials at schools in South Korea. The government remains reluctant to bring the LGBT topics to the fore in the education field, citing anti-LGBT sentiments in the country. It said that it requires a social consensus and long-term discussion to include homosexuality in its education curriculum.“The education ministry’s sex education guidelines are a regression excluding sexual minorities and solidifying gender roles,” said Park Hyun-yi, an activist at Seoul Youth Sex Culture Center. “The guidelines that do not even mention ‘masturbation’ or ‘sexual minority’ are stifling sex education.” Human Rights Watch, an international human rights group, also recommended the South Korean government to revise its guidelines to include description about sexual minorities, citing its “discriminatory” impact. In the face of the backlash, the Education Ministry said that guidelines are only to help teachers with giving their students sex education and that teachers can educate their students about homosexuality at their own discretion. The Education Ministry mapped out the 40-page guidelines for schools nationwide in March 2015, which drew criticism for solidifying gender roles and stressing abstinence from sex. One of the controversial tips in the guidelines said that girls should not be with their boyfriends alone in order to avoid sexual violence. Sexual minorities still live largely on the fringes of Korean society, as the majority of Koreans remain intolerant of homosexuality and LGBT children are more vulnerable to such intolerance. According to a 2015 survey by a public interest lawyers’ group GongGam on 200 LGBT youth, aged 13 to 18, one in five attempted a suicide. Seven out of 11 of those who quit school did so due to discrimination, isolation and fear, the survey showed.By Ock Hyun-ju","discard the sex education guidelines ,education field citing anti lgbt ,ministry should discard the sex ,exclude the lgbt lesbian gay ,should discard the sex education","['the Education Ministry ’s', '”“The Education Ministry', 'LGBT', 'Seoul', 'the Education Ministry', 'LGBT', 'lgbt', 'South Korea', 'lgbt', 'anti - lgbt', 'Park Hyun - yi', 'Seoul Youth Sex Culture Center', 'south korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'lgbt', 'GongGam', 'LGBT', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",16,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.43071753  0.20937793

All infected livestock were culled. According to the investigation, the affected cows had been infected by the O-type strain of foot and mouth, the most common type of the disease here, but were carrying a new mutation that had not been detected in Korea before.Authorities said that the genotype was 99.4 percent similar to the virus that has appeared in Thailand and Vietnam, while they are still looking into movements by workers and animals at the farm in question to find out how the infection was picket up.On Monday, the first infection in 11 months was confirmed at a cattle farm in North Chungcheong Province. Authorities immediately imposed a ban on the movement of all livestock and farm vehicles throughout the nation for 30 hours in order to prevent spread of the virus.Meanwhile, the ministry said it looked into the result of the sample inspections and found that only 5 percent of the cows in the disease-hit region had antibodies against the foot and mouth virus. “The owners said that they had been negligent in vaccinating their cows to save money,” said the ministry official Kim Kyung-gyu.“Some said that  thinking the vaccine injection may cause cows to suffer miscarriages,” he added.The ministry said that, typically, 97.5 percent of cattle develop antibodies against the virus if given regular vaccinations.“It is true that the authorities’ sampling inspections were less concentrated on cows, as we have only seen more infection cases among pigs, so the ministry is considering changing the current inspection method,” said Kim, adding that the ministry would immediately vaccinate about 3 million more cattle.As of Tuesday, around 102,000 cattle and pigs in Korea are in line to be vaccinated this week, as part of the government’s measures to prevent further spread of the disease.

The ministry has made a public announcement on a planned revision to related regulations that will allow the use of full body scanners on all air passengers.Already, the second passenger terminal at the Incheon airport, set to open in October, is designed to be equipped with 22 full body scanners and equal number of metal detectors, ministry officials said.The number of body scanners at the exiting first passenger terminal at the airport will also increase, while metal detectors will be rarely used to check those unable to walk or stand, including the elderly and babies.""The use of full body scanners is already common in most countries and regions, including the United States and Europe.

The government also began imposing individual consumption tax on cigarettes.It immediately drew mixed reactions, as some criticized whether such price hikes were for the people or to increase tax revenue. The latest government data showed the country’s cigarette sales edged up from a year earlier during the July-September period in 2016, up 0.6 percent from 980 million a year earlier to 990 million packs, despite the government-led anti-smoking campaign.National Health Insurance Service Meanwhile, the ministry-run National Health Insurance Service’s research center released a report last year suggesting the government should impose health promotion fees on liquor products. The paper concluded that liquor and tobacco are detrimental to public health and aggravate the costs of state health care programs here.By Kim Da-sol","korean government is considering levying ,additional tax on liquor stirring ,government led anti smoking campaign ,considering levying an additional tax ,tax revenue the latest government","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance', 'National Health Insurance Service', 'National Health Insurance Service ’s', 'Kim Da - sol']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54470903  0.34938771

Research shows that growing plants inside is associated with lower blood pressure and stress levels. The appeal of potted plants is greater during winter, they say, as people spend more time indoors.“Indoor air pollutants have been ranked among the top five environmental risks to public health. Furnishings, synthetic building materials and cleaning products in homes and offices can emit a variety of toxic compounds, such as formaldehyde and benzene,” said Kim Gwang-jin, an official from the Rural Development Administration’s urban agriculture division. “Living and working in places rife with air contaminants and lacking ventilation can cause ‘sick building syndrome,’ which can cause headaches, nausea and eye, ear and nose irritation,” Kim added.A 1989 study by NASA to find the best plants to grow in spaceships revealed the surprising power of nature. NASA scientists found several plants remove pollutants from the air by absorbing them through their leaves and roots, while the microorganisms that live in the soil also play an instrumental role in neutralizing other pollutants.English ivy, areca palms and aloe vera, among others, were found to be more beneficial than others in removing harmful household toxins, even removing 90 percent of chemicals in the air in only 24 hours.But for beginners of home gardening, there is one important thing to remember: Each plant has its own favored environmental conditions.Horticulturists say that is why it is important to look for the tag that comes with the plant or look online to find out how much sunlight and water a plant will need. Plants can outgrow their space and may need to be repotted. Find a pot that’s at least 3 centimeters larger than the previous container, add potting soil to the bottom and place the plant so that the top of the soil remains at the same level as before. The following are The Korea Herald’s top five choices for beginners. They are all easy to grow at home and are on the NASA list of best air-purifying plants. Areca Palm The Areca Palm is ranked as the top air purifying plant by NASA’s study. Dubbed “the most efficient air humidifier,” the Areca Palm can be counted on to keep spaces moist during dry times. During winter, it can literally replace the use of humidifiers.Bamboo PalmThe bamboo palm thrives when kept moist in indirect sunlight, but never overwater it. Only water it when the soil feels dry and allow the soil to dry out between watering in the winter. The bamboo palm can be counted on to continuously remove chemical toxins from the air. Rubber PlantAccording to the NASA study, rubber plants excel at removing chemical toxins, especially formaldehyde, from the air indoors. It requires less light than other plants and outperforms all other indoor purifying plants. But be mindful if pets roam around, since its leaves can be toxic.Aloe VeraIn addition to being easy to care for, aloe makes some serious health claims. The plant’s leaves contain a clear liquid full of vitamins, amino acids and other compounds that have wound-healing, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Gerbera DaisyAs the only flowering plant on the list, Gerbera Daisy can be grown indoors, flowering all year long. Keeping them as a houseplant not only livens up the home, but also purifies indoor air. They are listed among the top 12 “green air cleaners” by NASA.

The reports of the cats’ possible infection were made on Dec. 25-26. The test marked South Korea’s first infection of avian influenza in mammals since February 2015, according to the Agriculture Ministry. The cats were found some 2 kilometers from a chicken farm where the H5N6 avian influenza was reported late November. They are believed to have had eaten birds contaminated with the virus. More than 1.7 million chickens have been culled in the town alone.  A researcher at the Gyeonggi Veterinary Service in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, conducts an antigen test for bird flu on Sunday. The outbreak has prompted authorities to distribute quicklime around the affected farms as a disinfectant and requested municipalities to install nets to stop wild animals from accessing them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said no case of the virus spreading to humans through cats had been found anywhere in the world. But it has dispensed antiviral drugs to about a dozen people including a cat owner as a preventive step, officials said. The virus’ incubation period is 10 days. As of midnight Friday, more than 28 million chickens and ducks at 606 farms have been slaughtered across the country. Nearly 16 percent of all Korea’s chickens and 26 percent of its ducks have been culled, ministry data shows. Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn on Sunday reiterated calls for a swifter end to the AI spread, saying daily reports of potential infections had been dwindling since Tuesday but further work was needed. Hwang had urged related agencies to bring the figure to zero by Tuesday. “Now beyond basic quarantine efforts, we need to carry out differentiated, effective activities tailor-made to the characteristics of each kind of poultry and regional breeding conditions,” Hwang said at a daily public-private meeting on the outbreak. “Together with this, more scientific and systematic quarantine activities should be taken through consultations with specialists and precision diagnoses at the farms.”By Shin Hyon-hee","cats found dead in pocheon ,virus more than million chickens ,avian influenza in mammals since ,country chicken population since november ,that two cats found dead","['Pocheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Agriculture Ministry', 'the Gyeonggi Veterinary Service', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'AI', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52962637  0.56193763
