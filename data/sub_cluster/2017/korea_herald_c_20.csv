This placed South Korea 219th among 224 nations checked.According to Statistics Korea, the number of babies born in 2016 reached 406,300, down 7.3 percent, or 32,100, from a year earlier. The figure marked the lowest number of newborns since 1970, when the statistics agency started to compile such data.Pointing to the woeful numbers, Moon called on the committee to ""boldly"" overcome the limits of existing policies to tackle the low fertility rate.""The government has so far focused on reducing the burden related to marriage, child delivery and care, but we have found that they are insufficient,"" Moon said. ""Beyond the policy of encouraging births, we now have to pay attention to the issues of women's lives at large and move in the direction of helping address them.""What matters more than anything is to help women find a work-family balance, Moon added.""The fundamental measure to address low fertility is to create a society in which women can protect the values of their lives while continuing their professional careers, and get married and raise children,"" he said.","tuesday for more effective ,fertility rate president moon ,presidential committee on aging ,policy moon also stressed ,called tuesday for more","['Moon Jae - in', ""South Korea 's"", 'the Presidential Committee on Aging Society and Population Policy', 'Moon']",20,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.36783174  0.28665975

""In consideration of the outcome of the task force's review, I think it is right for us to reflect the voices of the victims and the civic groups sufficiently through sufficient communication before making the government's stance ,"" she added. Under the deal, they agreed to ""finally and irreversibly"" resolve the comfort women issue, while Tokyo gave an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.It, however, prompted strong criticism from victims and civic groups as they claim that Japan's apology was not sincere enough and that the government did not consult with them in advance. Some even call for scrapping the deal.The Moon government, which took office in May, has said that there appears to have been procedural problems in reaching the deal. The task force launched after the new government's inauguration is to announce the outcome of it review on Tuesday.Japan is urging South Korea to faithfully carry out what was agreed upon. The Seoul government is saying that it will seek a ""two-track"" approach in which such historical issues will be separated from bilateral diplomatic relations.""The task force's review is about the procedure by which the deal was reached and its evaluation, not about any policy recommendations,"" Kang said. ""What diplomatic policy the government is to take does not rely entirely on the review outcome.""""The outcome should be taken into account but there should be communication with the victims as well.""Kang declined to elaborate on what the task force will announce but noted that the previous government surely did not make enough efforts to communicate with the victims. ""The conclusion is that communication with victims lacked significantly until the deal was finally made,"" she said. ""It is the conclusion that we have expected but now we can say that with sufficient review and evidence.""Kang said that ""all options"" should remain open on what action the government will take on the deal she said about 70 percent of Korean people cannot accept. She still emphasized that the government will make all possible diplomatic efforts to upgrade bilateral ties with Japan despite many recalcitrant issues between the two countries, while facing ""squarely"" up to their shared history. Noh Kyu-duk, foreign ministry spokesman, said during a regular press briefing held later in the day that the government will explain the outcome of the task force's review to Japan ""before it will be announced,"" adding that it is in line with diplomatic protocol as the country is also a party involved in the issue. On North Korea and its nuclear issues, Kang said that the government will closely review all scenarios including additional provocations and a possible resumption of talks to deal with its growing threats. With regard to China and bilateral ties that have been chilled over the deployment of a US missile defense system here, Kang reaffirmed that the leaders of the two countries shared the view to normalize their relations ""in the mid and long term.""""Based on the shared view to put cooperation and exchanges in all areas, including personnel exchanges, back on track, our ministry, for its part, will make all-out efforts,"" she said.","korean women after listening ,slavery of korean women ,women deal south korea ,press meeting in seoul ,korean women after","[""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.27284658  0.25524572

The recommendation by the National Human Rights Commission to the Ministry of National Defense came based on its research into the military prosecution's handling of recent sexual assault cases regarding superiors and lower-level officers, the watchdog said. The survey began in May following the suicide of a Navy lieutenant who was raped by her commanding officer.   Kim Seong-joon, the head of the investigation unit at the National Human Rights Commission, speaks during a press briefing on Dec. 21, 2017, on its recommendation to the defense ministry calling for tougher punishment for assailants in the sexual assault cases in the military. The NHRC has found that 80 percent of sexual assault victims between 2014 and 2016 were sergeants due to be examined by their superiors for extension of service. It alludes to the fact that they are in a vulnerable position in terms of resisting their boss even if they are sexually mistreated, the watchdog noted. The analysis also revealed that the military prosecution has tended to be lenient on the charges they press against the offenders. Some of them were indicted under the Criminal Law, or the law related to banning sexual violence, instead of the Military Criminal Law subject to aggravated punishment. One non-commissioned officer in his 40s was charged for sexually harassing a female subordinate in her early 20s under the general criminal law and is still on the job as he received a pecuniary penalty.In a separate case, the military court meted out a suspended sentence for an officer who groped a young female commissioned officer on her thigh, upholding the defendant's claim that he was intoxicated and made a mistake. The ratio of military court rulings of suspended sentences for sexual offenders came in at 10.34 percent, much higher than 1.36 percent by general district courts. The watchdog also called for stricter disciplinary measures against a sexual assailant, including an immediate opening of the reprimand process and collaboration with outside experts for a more thorough and independent review once an allegation is raised.","punishment for sex crimes ,rights watchdog recommended thursday ,sex offenders in military ,punishment of sex offenders ,watchdog calls for tougher","[""South Korea 's"", 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'the Ministry of National Defense']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.36811343  0.10419025

5,5,[Herald Interview] Nuclear deterrence is myth says Nobel laureate ICAN,"Nuclear weapons as deterrence against war is a myth created through propaganda, and the world must unite to bring about complete nuclear disarmament, says International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons Asia Pacific Director Tim Wright. Founded in Australia in 2007, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons works to inform the public about the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons being used.

Founded in Australia in 2007, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons works to inform the public about the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons being used. For its work on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons adopted on July 7, ICAN was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Dec. 10.  International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons Asia Pacific Director Tim Wright. Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldThe treaty prohibits signatory states from “developing, testing, producing, manufacturing, transferring, possessing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons, or allowing nuclear weapons to be stationed on their territory.”The treaty also prohibits nations from “assisting, encouraging or inducing anyone to engage in any of these activities.” States that have nuclear arms, or those with another country’s nuclear weapons in their territories must dismantle or remove them if they sign the treaty. Now that the treaty has been adopted, ICAN hopes to bring together countries to sign the treaty to enforce a binding ban on nuclear weapons. “We very much want South Korea to sign this treaty. And the main impediment at the moment is the concept of the nuclear umbrella, which is inconsistent with the treaty,” Wright said. “We believe that by claiming protection from nuclear weapons under the umbrella, that confers legitimacy on nuclear weapons. It suggest that they are useful, that they are a source of security and we want South Korea to adopt a very strong, unequivocal position against nuclear weapons.”Adding that his organization wants North Korea to do the same and that though no nuclear-armed state has so far joined the treaty, Wright says the treaty lays the foundations for eventual global nuclear disarmament. “The purpose of the treaty is to stigmatize the weapons, and to establish a strong international norm against them. It is a reaction, in a sense, to the failure of nuclear-armed nations to fulfill their disarmament obligations,” he said. “It’s about putting pressure on them through the power of the norm that the treaty creates. This is a tool that asks every country to state whether they support or oppose nuclear weapons. And we are confident that the vast majority will support it.”Saying that full nuclear disarmament has not been realized due to lack of political will, he added that the treaty will be a “game changer” in creating the right environment for progress.“A country that joins the treaty cannot help another country to manufacture nuclear weapons, it needs to ensure that there are no funds from that country going towards the nuclear weapon program of another country. This can have profound implications,” he said. Regarding US President Donald Trump’s announcement of nuclear arsenal modernization plans, Wright said that such programs were also backed by the Obama administration, and that most nuclear-armed states are pursuing similar goals. However, unlike the previous US president, the unpredictable nature of Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has put the world in grave danger, Wright says. “Which is why it’s so important that countries like South Korea with moderate leaders are able to play a peacemaking role, and not become embroiled, not become part of the problem but instead become part of the solution. That is why we want SK to join this treaty, to be part of the solution,” he said. Seoul, however, faces another difficulty. The South Korea-US alliance effectively places the country under the US nuclear umbrella. Wright, however, suggests that Seoul can maintain the alliance while rejecting the idea of US nuclear deterrence, and that Seoul should play a role in prompting the US to give up its nuclear weapons. “We want South Korea to speak out, not in hostility to the US, but in the spirit of friendship that’s what a good friend does,” he said, comparing the situation to one friend discouraging another from drunk driving. ICAN also rejects the argument that nuclear weapons deter war.“I think that deterrence is an entirely irrational security policy. Imagine every country argued that it needed nukes for deterrence, would that make the world a safer place? It would be a recipe for disaster,” he said. “We need to start, view nuclear weapons as weapons, not as some magical tools, and that’s why our campaign has been so focused on what these weapons actually do when they are used,” he said. He added that as long as South Korea relies on the nuclear-armed US to maintain peace on the peninsula, it is effectively relying on the “preparedness of the US to unleash catastrophic consequences” on behalf of the country.

I believe the role of the judiciary lies right there,"" Ahn said during his opening remarks.""The protection of the socially weak is not to give them special benefits that are not written in the law but to recover their inherent rights that are stipulated in the law,"" he added.  Supreme Court Justice nominee Ahn Chul-sang speaks during a parliamentary confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on Dec. 19, 2017. To show his longstanding commitment to protecting the rights of the socially marginalized, Ahn catalogued a history of his rulings in favor of them. One of them concerned a naturalized foreign-born spouse on the verge of losing her citizenship.Ahn said that his advocacy for the socially disadvantaged stems from his personal experience.""My father passed away when I was a high school student, and due to my family's financial conditions, I had difficulty advancing into the tertiary education,"" he recalled. ""It was a tough period, but this experience helped me understand the socially weak.""The nominee then highlighted the importance of ""objective, fair"" trials to enhance public trust in courts. He also said that the legal process should be speedy to ensure that low-income citizens are not put at a disadvantage due to lengthy, costly litigation procedures.During the hearing, Ahn came under fire for his children's use of fake addresses in the 1990s to send them to schools of their choice. He acknowledged it and apologized.Asked about whether the death penalty should be abolished, he said that the capital punishment has to be ""considerably"" restricted as any misjudgment cannot be reversed. On the issue of those refusing to carry out their mandatory military duty based on their religious beliefs, the nominee threw his support behind the idea of allowing them to carry out alternative services.Ahn's appointment requires consent from a majority of lawmakers present during a floor vote that can be set up by a majority of all 299 legislators. The ruling Democratic Party with only 121 seats is far short of a majority, necessitating opposition support.","nominee pledges fair trials ,chul sang vowed tuesday ,court nominee pledges fair ,treatment of former judges ,pledges fair trials for","['Supreme Court', 'Ahn Chul - sang', 'Ahn', 'the Daejeon District Court']",20,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.11432205 0.37405011 0.27920744],Yonhap,Social affairs,12,2017,"lawmakers present during floor vote ,ahn chul sang vowed tuesday ,favorable treatment of former judges ,299 legislators the ruling democratic ,sang speaks during parliamentary confirmation","['Supreme Court', 'Ahn Chul - sang', 'Ahn', 'the Daejeon District Court', 'Supreme Court', 'Ahn Chul - sang', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'ahn', 'Democratic Party']",6,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.11432205 0.37405011 0.27920744]

Special Counsel in charge of the case asked the appellate court to sentence former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun to seven and six years in prison, respectively.  The composite photo, filed Oct. 24, 2017, shows former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun , and former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon  under the previous Park Geun-hye government. It also demanded the same jail terms for five others, including then presidential and culture ministry officials charged for their involvement in the case, as the sentences requested in the trial at the lowest court. Kim and Cho were indicted in February on charges of abuse of power and perjury. They are accused of masterminding the creation of a list of nearly 10,000 artists, writers and filmmakers deemed unfriendly to the then conservative administration. Those on the list were denied state subsidies or removed from their jobs in the mainstream media. The Seoul Central District Court sentenced Kim in July to three years in jail, finding him guilty of the charges. But it released Cho on a one-year prison term suspended for two years, convicting her only of perjury. Both the prosecution and defendants have appealed the ruling. Kim was in office from mid-2013 to early 2015. Cho served as the presidential secretary for political affairs from June 2014 for about a year and became the culture minister in September last year.","blacklist prosecutors on tuesday ,artist blacklist prosecutors on ,blacklist prosecutors on ,prosecutors on tuesday ,over artist blacklist prosecutors","['Park Geun', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Culture', 'Cho Yoon - sun']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33704892  0.32463339

Average daily school hours for primary schools in some other countries are 4.9 hours in the United States, 4.8 hours in France and 4.67 hours in Britain.Unlike children aged five or under, who are taught at kindergartens or nursery schools until 6 p.m. or later with financial support from the government, elementary school students return home early in the afternoon.Confronted with this situation, many women quit their jobs to take care of children who come home early. This has been cited as one cause of the country's low birthrate.An education ministry official, however, reacted negatively to moves to keep children at school for longer hours.""I understand other government agencies are considering such as a measure, but it will be difficult for our ministry to consider that kind of policy change,"" the official said.","considering raising school hours ,presidential committee mulls raising ,mulls raising class hours ,committee mulls raising class ,students official the presidential",[],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61580807  0.24522407

The shocking incident took place Sunday at a local Starbucks, where Annie was having a conversation with her friend in Korean. Her Korean-American tutor, Sean Lee, was also at the scene.Breaking off the two Korean women’s chat, a middle-aged white woman, unprovoked, suddenly told the two, “Don’t you dare say that again,” adding that she does not like to hear that language, which she thinks is “disgusting,” adding that only English should be spoken in America.Annie hit the record button on her smartphone. Annie An, also known as An Hong. “Some specific words she mentioned made me so mad. ‘Especially Korean,’ ‘disgusting,’ ‘Be quiet and sit down,’ ‘English only,’ and ‘immigrants,’” Annie told The Korea Herald in an interview.Starbucks employees and three police officers escorted the woman out of the coffee joint.“I have experienced racism on multiple counts during my stay in the US,” said Annie. “For instance, the waitress would refuse to serve me at a restaurant in a white neighborhood, or a white man would yell at me from a passing car, calling me ‘Ching Ching.’”“But this is my first time to encounter someone who exhibited such outright sarcasm in a nonchalant, uncaring manner,” the 21-year-old said. “We should never brush off racist remarks and actions. The more we stay quiet, the more history will ignore us. I wish more people would realize the power of immigrants, as the nation of US was built by immigrant hands.”Annie’s video of what had been her “most unexpected and unbelievable day” of 2017 went viral via Facebook.Annie said she has received much encouragement and support from people following her post, but not all the feedback has been positive. “Some left aggressive comments on the video thread. Two people sent direct messages. One read, ‘You should have talked quietly. Your language sounds kinda annoying,’ and another read ‘F--- off Asian,’” she said.Annie said she believes there is much burden on immigrants to speak up in times of inequality and racial adversity. “I am proud to be bilingual,” she said.

The number of countries where the test is taken was 73, up from just four in 1997. TOPIK scores are a requirement for foreigners to obtain some types of visa or college places in South Korea. Nearly 300,000 took the test this year alone, a 140-fold jump from 1997 when 2,692 people sat for the exam, according to the data. The popularity of South Korean television dramas and pop music are one contributor to the upsurge, the institute said. The test, which started off as a once-a-year event, has been held six times a year since 2015 to reflect the growing demand. The number of elementary and secondary schools abroad that offer Korean language courses also rose from 695 in 2011 to 1,309 as of 2016, according to Ministry of Education’s data.

Revelations of his abusive acts sparked public outrage, leading to his removal from a command position and transfer to a temporary training position. Park has since been arrested on bribery charges.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Park should be tried in a civilian court because he is considered to have been discharged from the military when he was transfered to a temporary position that is not defined in the law.Military personnel law states that general-level officers should be placed in positions specified by law and, otherwise, they are automatically discharged. That means that Park's transfer to the temporary training position amounts to an automatic discharge.According to the ruling, Park will be transfered from military to civilian custody. Civilian prosecutors will take over the case from military prosecutors, paving the way for a possible reinvestigation into his abuse of soldiers.While indicting Park for bribery, military prosecutors pressed no charges against Park with regard to his alleged bullying, saying it's not a matter of legal punishment.","for bullying soldiers assigned ,bullying soldiers assigned to ,bullying soldiers assigned ,known for bullying soldiers ,for bullying soldiers","['the Supreme Court', 'Army', 'Park Chan - ju', 'the Army Second Operations Command']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38605586 -0.30303633

Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha ""It still remains to be seen how the schedule for the minister's trip will be finalized but it seems that it will likely happen before the task force's review will come out,"" a source said.South Korea and Japan reached in December 2015 to leave behind Tokyo's wartime sexual slavery of many Korean women, who are euphemistically called comfort women.Under the deal, they agreed to ""finally and irreversibly""resolve the comfort women issue, while Tokyo gave an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.It, however, prompted strong criticism from civic groups and some of the victims as well, as they claim that Japan's apology is not sincere enough and that the government did not consult with them in advance.The Moon government, which took office in May, has said that there appear to be procedural problems in reaching the deal. The task force launched after the new government's inauguration earlier said that it will finalize its review of the controversial deal within this year. Japan is urging South Korea to faithfully carry out what was agreed upon in the deal. The Seoul government is saying that it will seek a ""two-track"" approach in which such historical issues will be separated from bilateral diplomatic relations.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual servitude during wartime. The number of surviving South Korean victims stands at 33.","visit japan next week ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,fm trip to japan ,japan next week before ,japan next week","[""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Taro Kono']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.20666164  0.53751051

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy launched a consultative body composed of state-run utilities, construction companies and research institutes to put concerted efforts toward developing the nation's nuclear decommissioning industry.The ministry said it aims to develop technologies needed to dismantle nuclear reactors by 2021 and establish a research institute to pave the way for entering the global market by 2030.   South Korea has 17 key technologies for nuclear decommissioning, while it hasn't acquired 21 technologies related to decommissioning preparation, decontamination, dismantling, waste disposal and environmental recovery.The tough task is gaining importance as the state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co.  is preparing steps to decommission the Kori-1 unit, which was shut down in June following 40 years of commercial use. It is one of 24 nuclear power plants in Asia's fourth-largest economy, which are responsible for about 30 percent of the nation's total electric energy generation.A total of 11 reactors will be retired one by one by 2030 as their operational life cycles expire as the government said it won't extend their operation. As part of the nuclear phase-out plan, the government is also pushing for an early closure of Wolsong-1, now the nation's oldest operating reactor, as soon as possible.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency , 34 nations have built 611 reactors and 449 were in operation as of April 2017. Among 160 reactors permanently shut down, the decommissioning process has been completed for 19.","foster nuclear decommissioning industry ,to foster nuclear decommissioning ,foster nuclear decommissioning ,nuclear decommissioning industry south ,nuclear decommissioning industry","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.50860178  0.3790831

It is a delicate and sensitive issue in Korea due to cultural differences, but the most important thing for us is the welfare of the animals.”The event, organized by HSI and sponsored by the embassy, was attended by Robin Russell, an international environmentalist and businessman who has worked extensively on conservation issues and championed the partnership of corporate philanthropy and environmental campaigns in the UK.Caspian, a dog rescued by the Humane Society International in January, 2016, and adopted by British Ambassador Charles Hay's family British Ambassador to Korea Charles Hay poses with his spouse Pascale, daughters and Caspian, rescued from a dog farm in Korea in 2016. “These photos show powerful transformations of the rescued dogs, and highlight that these creatures need, demand and deserve to be treated as the sentient beings that they are. I felt a deep and profound sadness when I arrived at the farm this morning on my first visit to Korea. The sadness turned into anger and by the end of the day, hope,” Russell said in a speech. “I felt sad and angry at the absence of freedom for the dogs and of compassion on the part of people. These dogs live, breathe and feel heat, cold, hunger, thirst and fear. I was surprised to see that some of them, despite all of their misery, were able to reach out for attention and touch, and their spirit remained.”The HSI, founded in 1991, works around the world to alleviate the suffering of animals. It targets inhumane practices affecting companion and farm animals, the illegal wildlife trade, threats to endangered species, the slaughter of marine mammals and the use of animals in medical research and testing. It has worked with governments, humane organizations and animal protection workers to find solutions to these problems and spread a culture of compassion for all forms of life. Since 2014, the society has saved over 1,220 dogs and closed 10 dog farms in Korea through 10 rescue missions. The rescued dogs are then given medical treatment and flown overseas to be adopted as pets, primarily in the United States, Canada and the UK. British Ambassador Charles Hay  poses with a puppy rescued from a dog farm in Korea by Humane Society International at a photo exhibition in Seoul on Thursday. In the picture are his spouse Pascale , businessman and environmentalist Robin Russell  and HSI campaign manager Lola Webber. A photo exhibition organized by the Humane Society International and sponsored by the British Embassy, was attended by Robin Russell , an international environmentalist and businessman who has worked extensively on conservation issues and championed the partnership of corporate philanthropy and environmental campaigns in the UK. “There is a widespread perception here that there are two different types of dogs -- pet dogs and meat dogs. But through years of investigation we know that it is simply a myth,” said Lola Webber, HSI’s campaign manager. “There is no difference between different types of dogs. A dog is a dog. Each dog in South Korea’s meat industry suffers equally and in unimaginable ways.”The HSI said that all breeds of dogs can be found in the country’s dog farming industry, including popular pure breeds such as golden retrievers, spaniels and Chihuahuas, as well as the native Jindo, Tosa and Yellow Dog breeds. In some cases, stolen or abandoned pet dogs have been found in dog farms, still wearing their collars. The dogs live inside cramped, unhygienic cages and are exposed to the weather, causing pain, trauma, skin diseases and malnutrition.A central pillar of the HSI’s work in Korea is to work with dog meat farmers to permanently close their business and switch to alternative livelihoods such as arable agriculture. Dog meat farming has also become less profitable owing to falling demand, as the meat has attracted a stigma and younger generations increasingly avoid it.Although eating dog is widespread across Asia -- in China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia -- Korea is the only country to have industrialized the trade, according to HSI, and slaughters an estimated 2.5 million dogs annually. There are an estimated 17,000 dog farms across South Korea that supply dog meat restaurants with meat or live animals. The meat is most popular with the over-60s, especially men, who savor spicy dog meat soup known as boshintang. Dog eaters think that boshintang gives them virility and energy, in contrast to medical advice cautioning against it, as the meat has often been contaminated with antibiotics, drugs and unsanitary elements from their food. Dogs rescued by the Humane Society International in Korea HSI staff rescue canines from a dog farm in Korea. In many cases, the dogs are killed to produce gaesoju, or dog tonic, a medicinal broth strained from dog meat and cooked with herbs.The methods used to kill dogs are brutal, with electrocution the most common. It takes on average two to five minutes for a dog to die this way, and sometimes up to 20 minutes. Death by hanging or beating with a metal pipe before bleeding out is still practiced, as butchers believe the beating “softens” the meat and makes it more “tender.”The dog meat trade here exists in a legal limbo, with Article 7 of the Animal Protection Act allowing the slaughter of dogs for consumption but prohibiting the killing of animals using brutal methods -- provisions that are routinely flouted by the industry. “The PyeongChang Olympics and Paralympics are supposed to symbolize humanity and new horizons, so they offer the perfect backdrop for South Korea to finally address the terrible suffering of the dogs and put an end to the industry,” Wendy Higgins, director of international media at the HSI UK, told The Korea Herald. “In the past when big sporting events occurred in South Korea, we saw Seoul authorities simply implement short-term bans on dog meat restaurants, to hide them from the global media’s attention. But it is a makeshift solution and fails to address legitimate concerns of citizens around the world as well as of a growing number of South Koreans.” The recent decision by Korean President Moon Jae-in to adopt a dog rescued from a dog farm, Tory, as well as his pledge to improve animal welfare, should be catalyzed upon by the Korean government and public, the society urged.

A parliamentary committee passed the animal bill revision Friday, although it needs final approval at a plenary session later this month. Legislative attempts to strengthen punishment for negligent dog owners have gained steam in recent months after a fatal dog bite involving a K-pop star and a famous business woman sparked calls for better control of potentially dangerous dogs. The bill requires owners of aggressive dog breeds to use a leash and a muzzle in public spaces and bans such animals from entering daycare centers and elementary schools. If dogs that are not leashed carry out fatal attacks, their owners will be subject to up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of 30 million won . The bill also allows mayors and provincial governors to keep vicious dogs in isolation without owners' consent if they cause injuries to people. The latest move comes as growing number of people have been involved in dog attacks in recent years.A total of 1,019 dog bite accidents occurred last year, quadruple the 245 cases reported in 2011, according to the Korea Consumer Agency.","animal bill revision friday ,leash law aggressive dogs ,law officials said saturday ,stricter dog leash law ,dog leash law aggressive",[],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55524403 -0.04982637

PyeongChang Winter Olympics' official down jackets flew off the shelves, with people lining up overnight in front of stores to get hold of the limited item. School commute scenes nowadays can’t be described without mentioning a new quasi-uniform look, complete with black, hooded, knee-length padded jackets. Despite the striking uniformity, the coats are not a uniform. They are the season’s latest ‘it’ item among teenagers. Long padded coats on display at a department store in Seoul Now, let’s ask the question. Why are they so popular? “It’s practical, keeps you warm, and people think it’s trendy. Then why not?” says Park Bo-ra, an office worker in 30s and owner of a hip-length down jacket, now seriously considering buying a longer one that conforms to the latest trend. To be sure, padded jackets have been around for a while. To many, it is even considered a winter essential, something that you need for a quick run to the nearby supermarket, to walk your dog or for when the weather is just so freezing cold. Fashion experts see the newfound interest in these not-so-fancy performance wear as a fashion statement item as being linked to the “normcore” fashion trend globally. “Long padded down jackets were in high fashion recently. There were many showcased at the catwalk in Seoul Fashion Week, too” Jung Yoon-gi, a celebrity stylist, told a local radio station. While fashion experts interpret it as a continuation of normcore, others say the incredible popularity of the identical-looking coats have social overtones of people here finding comfort in uniformity rather than individuality. Youn Mi-young, a mom of two teenage students, bought the coats for her children, despite their hefty price tags, because she did not want her children to be singled out by classmates and wanted them to blend in. “Nowadays, it has become easier to share what they are wearing, or what they’d like to wear through the messaging app KakaoTalk.” Youn said. By Lee Sun-young","pyeongchang winter olympics official ,korea pyeongchang winter olympics ,rage in south korea ,winter olympics official down ,olympics official down jackets","['South Korea', 'PyeongChang']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.30770564  0.44636056

Korea International School students pose for a photo during its art creativity event at school. KISThe school held a fall art exhibition last month, comprised of creative pieces by students in pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. Under the theme of “Chroma,” the exhibition featured a multitude of color celebrating the diversity of experiences and ideas that students brought through their art. “Students self-curate their work, reflect on their outcomes, and receive valuable feedback from visitors and fellow students alike. Young artists at KIS are also able to see themselves as real artists and envision a future path in the creative arts,” said Candice Kim, head of the Visual Arts Department at KIS.In an effort to expand the reach of their art skills and in conjunction with the KIS Service Learning initiatives -- a program which KIS has launched to help students participate in service to grow together as a community -- students from the elementary to high school collaborate to create a coloring book. All proceeds from this activity go to the Nabiya cat shelter, the school said. Each fall, art students participate in charity activities utilizing their artistic skills. Since 2015, middle school students have been making coloring books. The following year, the school also hosted a silent auction of student-made potteries to benefit orphanages in Suji and Suwon.Catherine Kim is one of the KIS students who have been reaching out to the community through the program since 2013. She has been applying her artistic knowledge by offering mentoring to underprivileged students from 1st to 6th grade at Chungsol Community Welfare Center. Through the National Art Honor Society, Kim also formed a committee of dedicated volunteers. “The most rewarding thing about teaching other students has been the reciprocal learning, which taught both myself and the students,” she said. KIS said it will host Fine Arts Week from April 16-20. This weeklong event will focus on how to appreciate art outside the classroom and apply it throughout all areas. Students in the Advanced Placement art course will sponsor a gallery showing slated for May 21-25.“It will be a culminating experience highlighting all of the technical and creative skills they have acquired throughout their art career,” KIS said.By Kim Da-sol","school students pose for ,creativity event at school ,school held fall art ,international school students pose ,to develop students artistic","['Korea International School', 'KIS', 'Korea International School']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63178062  0.08750278

He added that the government will closely cooperate with the International Olympic Committee and other international bodies to step up preparations for the games.The prospect for the major international sporting event in PyeongChang has been overshadowed by escalating security threats from North Korea, with France announcing in September that it would withdraw from the games unless safety is guaranteed.Seoul has been striving to restore ties with Pyongyang by encouraging the North to join the Games.

""The crime of match fixing damages the credibility of sport, and in international matches, it has a bad effect on the country's credibility as well,"" the court said. ""Bang had an obligation to play the game fairly, but he ignored it and took an important role in the scheme. But we did take into consideration that Bang won the bout and returned the money afterwards."" In this file photo taken Nov. 28, 2015, South Korean mixed martial arts  fighter Bang Tae-hyun  competes with Leo Kuntz of the United States during their lightweight bout at UFC Fight Night 79 at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. According to the investigative authorities, Bang agreed to lose the first two rounds against Leo Kuntz at UFC Fight Night 79 in Seoul on Nov. 28, 2015. The scam, however, didn't succeed, as the lightweight fighter apparently changed his mind at the last moment and went on to beat Kuntz in a split decision.Bang reportedly decided not to throw the match after UFC officials warned him about fight fixing following a sudden shift in betting patterns on gambling websites. The 34-year-old was first listed as the slight favorite against Kuntz, but just hours before the fight, UFC officials caught drastic changes in odds that made him the underdog and his American opponent the overwhelming favorite. Bang is no longer with the UFC, the world's largest MMA promotion. After the UFC event in Seoul, Bang fought once more in Germany last year at UFC Fight Night 93, where he lost to Nick Hein by unanimous decision. Bang became the seventh South Korean to enter the Octagon after he signed with the UFC in late 2013. He posted two wins and three losses with the US-based MMA promotion.","mma fighter gets 10 ,ultimate fighting championship event ,10 months in prison ,korean mma fighter ,the ultimate fighting championship","['south korean', 'Bang Tae - hyun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Bang', 'the Ultimate Fighting Championship', 'South Korea']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.21143915  0.36289778

Medical experts say it will take some time for the end-of-life care system to be put in place, as hospitals lack professional counselors and the paperwork is excessive. “Many people don’t know about life-sustaining treatment. It’s hard to explain even the basic concepts,” said a professor of medicine at a university hospital taking part in the trial operation of end-of-life care.“There can be disputes between medical staff and the patient’s family over who is responsible for a patient’s death. The government needs to work more on the details of the law before it goes into effect.”The government plans to increase the bioethics-related budget to educate the public about end-of-life care.In 1997, two doctors at a Seoul hospital were indicted for murder after they removed a respirator from a terminally ill patient at the request of his wife. The doctors were later punished on charges of aiding murder.In 2009, the Supreme Court ordered a hospital to remove a comatose patient’s respirator, noting that continuing treatment just to prolong life without the hope of recovery violates an individual’s dignity.The 78-year-old woman died in January 2010, 200 days after being removed from life support, though doctors had expected her to die in less than three hours.It marked the first court-approved case of death with dignity in Korea. By Kim So-hyun","treatment died last week ,from gastrointestinal cancer refused ,sustaining treatment died last ,died last week marking ,died last week","['Korea ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'CPR']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44781676 -0.14104508

Professor Lee Hyun-jae of the University of Seoul’s Institute for Urban Humanities was criticized for comments in September when she appeared on a TV talk show and shared her thoughts on sexual complexes. The professor argued at the time that the Shotaro complex -- sexual attraction for young boys by adults -- is not of the same characteristic as the Lolita complex for young girls, adding a predilection for young boys could be considered a “preference” rather than irregular practice.  Her remarks have come under scrutiny again after a Korean national authored a written account of sexual abuse of an underage Australian boy on an online misandrists community on Sunday. Lee took to social media Tuesday to clarify her position. She said she thinks of “acts motivated by the Shotaro complex” as serious crimes that should be punished. “Shotaro complex motivated concepts, however, are something new in the history of male hegemony,” she wrote. “The concepts are questionable, but the appearance of ‘beautiful boys’ is a new preference of the era.” She added that “the media outlets that report stories , unrelated to the facts will take responsibility.” Her attempt at clarification, however, was largely received as unsatisfactory, lending itself to further criticism. Some refuted, saying obsessional preference for little boys should never be accepted as part of culture.By Im Eun-byel","pedophilic sexual complexes professor ,professor under fire for ,sexual complexes the professor ,the professor argued at ,sexual complexes professor lee","['Lee Hyun - jae', 'the University of Seoul ’s Institute for Urban Humanities']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63074011  0.16917706

The Catholic Bishops' Conference decided during a meeting at the weekend to issue a statement opposing the repeal of the crime of abortion. A national laity association has recently sent a letter outlining the case against abortion to 79 Catholic lawmakers. The Committee For Life in the Seoul Archdiocese, chaired by Cardinal Andrew Yeom Soo-jung, posted a pro-life petition on the website of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Nov. 14.  Participants shout slogans condemning the government`s plan to toughen punishment for illegal abortions during a rally in central Seoul last year. The moves came as the presidential office is set to respond to a petition to legalize abortion posted on its web site on Sept. 30. More than 200,000 people have signed the request, obligating Cheong Wa Dae to make an official response. ""Human life should be categorically respected from the first moment. It precedes the right to liberty and the right to decide as an independent individual, not as part of a woman's body, from the very moment when it is conceived,"" the Committee For Life said in its petition.Cardinal Yeom told a life forum at the National Assembly early this month, ""Some argue abortion is a woman's right and is an unavoidable choice for women's health. The claim represents a selfishness that clamps down on other's life for the sake of one's rights and health."" The pro-abortion petition to Cheong Wa Dae said, ""Unwanted pregnancies are a tragedy all to those directly concerned, to the babies and to the state, and thus the current abortion law should be scrapped.""In a recent survey of 516 people, conducted by local pollster Realmeter, 51.9 percent of the respondents were for the abolition of the law and 36.2 percent were against it.","abortion campaign korean catholics ,anti abortion campaign korean ,steps up anti abortion ,abortion campaign korean ,abortion over the weekend","['korean Catholics', ""the Catholic Bishops ' Conference""]",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24181378  0.49821946

At the time, doctors stated that his death was caused by an illness, sparking public backlash. Critics and his bereaved family claimed that the hospital had arrived at the conclusion due to the connection between former President Park Geun-hye and the hospital’s chief, who served as a personal doctor to the president. The audit agency also criticized the hospital’s delayed decision making process. “Officials at the hospital convened a meeting almost two months after the issue was first raised in March,” the agency said in the report. “Due to such a delay and the correction made to the death certificate, the hospital suffered a serious credibility problem and negative media reports.” Regarding why it took so long, Kim Yon-su, vice president of SNUH, said it was due to the hierarchy among doctors and supervising professors, which had hampered different views on the diagnosis from being accepted. In September, which marked the first anniversary of Baek’s death, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon apologized, saying that the farmer had lost his life due to the “violent use” of police power and that the tragedy represents a “betrayal of the state’s basic duties of protecting the lives of people.” By Kim Da-sol","activist farmer who died ,death ended this june ,analysis of farmer death ,farmer who died last ,died last year months","['Seoul National University Hospital', 'Baek Nam - gi']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76674831  0.28989363

A report by the European Food Safety Authority in May 2016 claimed that the processed palm oil may cause a potential health risk, but did not, however, ban consumers from consuming palm oil. Government and civic groups said that when processed oils are heated above 200 degrees Celsius, the cancer risk from palm oil may reach an alarmingly high level and pushed for the exclusion of the carcinogenic ingredient from production. However, EFSA declined to comment on the palm oil's health risk when heated at low temperatures. Amid the ""carcinogenic"" ingredient controversy, Ferrero fought back to keep its original Nutella recipe, which accounts for one-fifth of the company’s total sales. Recent developments on Nutella’s new recipe, however, came to light from the Hamburg Consumer Center in Germany. According to researchers, they reported the following changes in recipe: an increase in the amount of skim milk from 7.5 to 8.7 percent, a lighter color, reduction of cacao concentration and increase in sugar concentration from 55.9 to 56.3 percent. Many media outlets have requested Ferrero to confirm the reports of the change in Nutella’s recipe, but Ferrero remained silent about its “secret ingredient.” The Italian brand only confirmed making “slight adjustments,"" assuring the public about the safety of its beloved product.  By Catherine Chung","recipe globally beloved nutella ,silent on new recipe ,nutella maker ferrero stays ,melting chocolate during world ,alternative to melting chocolate","['Nutella', 'italian', 'Ferrero', 'the European Food Safety Authority']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63251823  0.21843253

Amid the Arctic’s vast emptiness and silence, you sweep them away and experience who you truly are deep underneath the trappings of modern life, the distractions, noise, fragmentation and industrialization.”“In the environment of sacredness,” he added, “You appreciate what matters the most.”England stressed that the polar zone is under threat of climate and environmental changes more acutely than any other place on earth. He asked for the global community’s “shared love” of the natural environment over material aggrandizement. His research has focused on the history of ancient ice sheets, ocean and lake sediments, ocean currents and sea levels, providing a long-term perspective on climate change. He won the prestigious $50,000 Weston Family Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Northern Research last December for his lifelong dedication to the increasingly precarious and precious region. The scholar is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, having proposed and played an instrumental role in creating Canada’s northernmost Quttinirpaaq National Park on Ellesmere Island. “The Arctic is a place of incredible beauty. It is not a snow globe of permanent glaciers, permafrost and northern communities,” he said. “It is a heritage that needs to be fundamentally protected in the interests of global citizens, not just Canadians.”Canada and Korea -- a member and observer, respectively, of the Arctic Council, a multilateral forum that addresses issues faced by the Arctic governments and Indigenous communities -- can strengthen their research collaboration on the state of the region and ways to preserve it, according to the professor.England suggested holding annual or biannual forums through which various themes related to the Arctic are raised and discussed among scientists, policymakers and diplomats.“The sky is the limit,” he said in terms of collaborative opportunities, mentioning biology, geology, botany, zoology, oceanographic and marine sciences, among other areas of investigation.A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit Korea’s icebreaker Araon conducted a 70-day international exploration mission in the Arctic Ocean, reaching the North Pole on July 21 as part of an international team organized to probe into the causes of global warming and its impact on the Arctic ecosystem. Canadian and Korean scientists, along with those from the US, China and Germany, collaborated on the mission from Aug. 27-Sept. 16.“As a new frontier, there is another gold rush, a stampede to use up the Arctic’s resources and carelessly develop them without considering all negative consequences,” England emphasized, saying, “We run the risk of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.”“As a civilization, we need to grow up and stop pushing the boundaries of nature that is intolerable and unsustainable. Let’s not put greed, money and economic development before fresh air, clean water and vibrant healthy communities.”Pointing to the Ellesmere Ice Shelf that has shrunk to a mere 300 square kilometers from 10,000 in the past, the academic said human civilization has “already lost the luxury of pretending we can just keep growing and growing and growing without any cost.”A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit England underlined the growing scientific consensus that the United Nations-led Paris climate agreement is not enough to adequately stall global warming. Ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany from Nov. 6-17, experts have warned that tens of millions of people will be dislocated from their homes by changing climate and sea rise in the coming decade. The number of climate refugees will dwarf those who have fled the Middle East and North Africa, forewarned senior US military and security experts, bringing insurmountable challenges to Europe.Scientists estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in low-lying coastal areas vulnerable to flooding at a rise of 3 degrees Celsius in global warming by 2100, the latest projection to lay bare the inadequacy of the Paris accord, designed to limit temperature rise within 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The agreement could be “much more ambitious and stringent,” England said. “Given our human creativity, there is not much we can’t do, including slowing and even reversing carbon emission through renewable energy, carbon sequestration and geoengineering if we put our minds to it.”Despite Donald Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris accord, there’s still a “wellspring of goodness and dedication” toward mitigating climate change and protecting our environment in the US, he said. “But we can only achieve our goals if we pull on the same rope together. We have to challenge those climate change deniers in a progressive and rational way, not by name-calling or vilifying.”Canadian Inuit activist Caitlyn Baikie is a Canada 150 ambassador and member of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.For Canadian Inuit activist Caitlyn Baikie, climate change has been an unstoppable tide upturning her people’s indigenous lifestyles for millennia. “While the European colonization affected our ways of living, climate change has added extra pressure on how we transmit our oral history,” she said in an interview, noting Inuit are an oral people whose knowledge has been bequeathed intergenerationally through livelihood-related activities such as hunting. Global warming has changed seasonal patterns, making it difficult to pass down hunting skills and practical knowledge to younger generations, as the weather and outdoor conditions have become unpredictable and dangerous, explained the Canada 150 ambassador and member of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Baikie was born and raised in Nain in the autonomous Inuit area of Nunatsiavut in Newfoundland and Labrador. She currently lives in Gatineau, Quebec.The Inuit people, who have lived across the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska for thousands of years, used to travel seasonally to harvest different animals, such as seals, whales, walrus, caribou, polar bears, muskoxen, birds and fish, she said. But since the modern colonization of the latter half of the 20th century, they have begun to settle in small communities and participate in modern economies and ways of life. A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit The majority of Inuit people live in 53 communities spread across Inuit Nunangat, their homeland encompassing over one-third of Canada’s landmass and half of its coastline in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunatsiavut in Labrador, Nunavik in Quebec and Nunavut. “My father was the first person to be born in a hospital, the first generation to grow up with technology, be expected to go to school and not learn our traditional language Inuktitut,” Baikie said, adding the modernization wave came only six decades ago. Due to the rapid transition, she revealed, many people who had no proper education or experience in the modern economy struggled and fell behind, often taking their own lives or taking drugs. Nowadays, however, through the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national representational organization protecting and advancing Inuit rights and interests in Canada, Inuit communities are strengthening their positions and coping with various issues, she added. The Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada also plays key roles in how the government develops programs and policies regarding indigenous governance.Drawing attention to the untradeable value of their heritage, Baikie highlighted the movie “Angry Inuk,” a 2016 Canadian feature-length documentary film written and directed by Alethea Arnaquq-Baril that defends the Inuit seal hunt. The film portrays sealing, which has been the Inuits’ lifeblood since time immemorial, as vital to their modus vivendi and argues against the European Union’s ban on seal products as well as the disapproval of Greenpeace, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and other nongovernmental organizations.“Angry Inuk” entered Canada’s Top 10 list at the Toronto International Film Festival on Dec. 7 last year and won numerous film accolades. “The information that’s pumped out into the world is heavily funded and influenced by people who don’t know anything about seal hunting,” Baikie said, adding anti-sealing activists stir popular imaginations with pictures of crying seal pups and the gory killing of seals. “Our commercial seal hunt accounts for over half of our sealing. It’s not only for our livelihood. It’s a very humane and sustainable hunt, as we use every part of the animal, including the skin that gets traded worldwide,” she said. “People think we still live in igloos with no television or internet, when in fact we are watching closely issues that directly impact our lives, like the climate change and anti-seal hunt campaign.” By Joel Lee  A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit A photograph from the Arctic Impressions Photo Exhibit","heritage canadian arctic scientist ,canada arctic painstakingly surveying ,canadian arctic scientist ,herald interview arctic fragile ,sustainable heritage canadian arctic","['canadian', 'John England', 'Canadian', 'Inuit', 'Caitlyn Baikie', 'the Korea Herald', 'Inuit', 'the Canadian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'John England', 'Canada']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31772038  0.28225625

Victoria Kwakwa, World Bank regional vice president of East Asia and the Pacific, stressed in an exclusive interview that Korea’s knowledge and experience in postwar economic growth -- buoyed by the bank’s financial and technical assistance -- have crucially helped developing Asian economies forge a sustainable strategy forward. “It’s not just about giving money in the form of aid, but transferring successful development experience and knowledge. It’s about providing practical help and technical assistance working in consort with institutions like the Korea Development Institute,” she told The Korea Herald at the World Bank Group satellite office in Seoul. Areas of collaboration include guidance on the financial sector, economic policy, public investment planning, green growth, sustainable development, urban planning, poverty reduction and higher education, among others, she added, noting the two sides utilize trust funds set up by the Korean government. Victoria Kwakwa, World Bank regional vice president of East Asia and the Pacific A successful example is a co-financing arrangement through the Korea Eximbank’s Economic Development Cooperation Fund to develop the Tina River Hydropower Project in the Solomon Islands. Korea’s hydropower company K-Water has been selected for the project with resources from the Korean government, World Bank and other partners in a consortium. “The project will bring huge changes to how electricity will be delivered in the country,” Kwakwa said. Through the Korean Green Growth Trust Fund, the World Bank and Korea are helping the energy transition of fossil fuel-dependent economies, including China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Philippines, toward renewables. “We bring in technological and concessional expertise so that the renewables’ costs are competitive over fossil fuel,” according to the economist. Responding to global warming and rising sea levels, the two have collaborated in formulating climate adaption measures, as well as nationally determined contributions for governments, as they strive to lower their carbon emissions in adherence to the United Nations-led Paris agreement. “Several countries are coming up with their own green growth strategies, and this is where the World Bank and Korea can work together,” she said. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim speaks during a high-level seminar on the Belt and Road Initiative in Washington D.C., the United States, Oct. 12, 2017. China's Ministry of Finance and the World Bank on Thursday held a high-level seminar on the Belt and Road Initiative for the first time during the bank's annual meetings. Kwakwa pointed to other cases where the bank and Korean government -- partners since 1955 -- have organized workshops and seminars to explore the nature of conflicts and offer technical assistance to conflict-ridden countries. One example is Myanmar, which began a transition to democracy in 2010 following decades of military dictatorship, and where the Rohingya Muslim minority has recently faced persecution and fled to neighboring Bangladesh. The World Bank Group is a family of five organizations: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, International Finance Corp., the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Korea joined the IBRD in 1955, the IDA in 1961 and the IFC in 1964. It exited these programs by 1995, only to rejoin following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Korea graduated from the IBRD in 2016.Kwaka lauded Seoul’s continuous and increasing contributions to international aid through its official development assistance program. After joining the IDA in 1961, Korea made its first contribution in 1977 as a donor country, and in 2009 entered the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee. Korea currently spends 0.14 percent of its gross national income on development assistance, and plans to increase that to 0.2 percent by 2020 and 0.3 percent by 2030. In 2015,  Korea provided $1.9 billion in net ODA. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim  and World Bank Regional Vice President for East Asia and Pacific Victoria Kwakwa  speak to Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon  and other policymakers in Washington on Oct. 15 “Korea’s focus on the quality of its aid program, by combining the financial contribution with knowledge and hands-on expertise, is laudable,” the vice president said. “Money doesn’t automatically bring results you expect if you don’t use it properly.”The economist expressed a strong affirmation of partnership with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank headquartered in Beijing that aims to support infrastructure development across the Asia-Pacific region. “The World Bank and AIIB work closely by co-financing projects across Asia and North Africa,” she said, noting they use uniform rules and standards regarding lending, social and environmental impact and others that lower transaction costs for clients. The two are heavily involved in the China-led “One Belt One Road” initiative to develop infrastructure and trade links across Eurasia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania and Northeast Africa via the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt and the oceangoing Maritime Silk Road.World Bank President Jim Yong Kim  and Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon pose after signing a memorandum of understanding to expand the capacity of the World Bank Group Korea Office in Songdo, Incheon on Oct. 14. China signed a memorandum of understanding with multilateral financial organizations including the World Bank, AIIB, Asian Development Bank and European Investment Bank for the gargantuan worldwide integration project. Korea joined the AIIB in June 2015. “What we can bring to the OBOR is strong analytic work around the initiative,” she said, adding sound analysis and policy advice underpin projects’ implementation. “It’s important to understand the economics of the six corridors that are part of the OBOR, explore existing opportunities as well as assess risks and challenges, such as the debt sustainability of participating countries.”Kwakwa underscored that in the absence of sound policies on trade, integration and connectivity, the roads, highways, airports and railways that will be built cannot realize their maximum impact. “We help in project selection so that they are aligned with strategic priorities of governments involved as well as our individual partnerships with countries,” she said. “We help structure those projects to bring in private commercial money, and also co-finance them with our own money.”By Joel Lee","herald interview masterminding building ,most paramount economic challenges ,world bank and korea ,interview masterminding building blocks ,world most paramount economic","['the World Bank', 'Korea', 'Victoria Kwakwa', 'World Bank']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28993243  0.61242855

Japanese officials reacted angrily, saying the invitation of the ""comfort woman"" breaches the spirit of a 2015 agreement to settle the longstanding dispute between the two neighbors.  They have also fumed at the decision to serve ""Dokdo Shrimp"" from waters off South Korea's easternmost islets, to which Japan makes a territorial claim.  South Korea countered that Japan is inappropriately meddling in the way Seoul accommodates its most important guests.On Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in hosted the banquet for Trump and U.S. officials on a two-day trip to Seoul. The presidential office invited the 88-year-old Lee Yong-soo, who was forced into sex slavery for Japanese troops during World War II, to the dinner.Lee is one of more than 30 living Korean victims, euphemistically called comfort women. She is known as an outspoken and vocal critic of Japan.According to local media, Japan delivered its protest at Lee's attendance of the dinner to South Korea through diplomatic channels and demanded the deal the two countries reached in 2015 to ""finally"" and ""irreversibly"" resolve the comfort women issue should be faithfully enforced.""Japanese officials view the invitation of Lee, one of the most vocal critics of Japan's handling of the issue, to the event as running counter to the spirit of the agreement,"" Kyodo news agency reported. Japanese daily Sankei Shimbun also reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono has delivered a protest to South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha over the matter. The report has not been confirmed.In response South Korea's foreign ministry said Thursday that it is inappropriate for Japan to take issue with how it prepares a state dinner and that it delivered its own stance on the matter through diplomatic channels. ""The food served at the dinner and those invitees were determined by reflecting all necessary factors,"" Noh Kyu-duk, foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing. ""We do not think it is appropriate to take issue with that.""The former comfort woman Lee also expressed anger and strongly criticized Japan in an interview earlier in the day.""Whether I go and meet such guests is none of their business. ... They are too arrogant,"" Lee said.South Korea and Japan reached a deal in December 2015 under which Tokyo apologized for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.Saying that the deal lacks public consensus, the Moon Jae-in government, which took office in May, has been reviewing the process by which it was reached under the previous administration, hinting that it could be scrapped or revised. Japan says that both countries have to faithfully enforce what was agreed upon by their governments.Historians say more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude in front-line Japanese brothels during World War II, when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony.","shrimp at trump dinner ,dokdo shrimp at trump ,president donald trump japanese ,shrimp at trump ,trump dinner spark new","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Donald Trump', 'japanese']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.61483532  0.23374493

The report was based on a study of the patients between 2003 and 2012, taken from South Korea's National Health insurance sample cohort database. Results showed that 28.6 percent  of the people were smokers before the diagnosis. Among them, 49.9 percent  continued their habit even after the diagnosis.Some picked up the habit again after the disease. For example, 13 of 194 people who had succeeded in quitting before the diagnosis said they started to smoke again. Twenty-four of 1,020 patients who had never smoked said they actually began to smoke after finding out about their disease.The report cited that depression may be the reason for such behavior. ""The feeling of hopelessness or depression experienced by patients after the CVD  event could have been a trigger for the smoking relapse,"" it said. ""The prevalence of depression among patients with cardiac disease is about two to three times higher than that found in the general population.""The results indicate that health care providers should periodically screen the smoking status of patients during follow-ups to lessen the risks of mortality and recurrence of the disease, the report said.","cardiovascular diseases nearly half ,after suffering cardiovascular diseases ,study of 700 patients ,medical report said thursday ,stop smoking medical report",['south korean'],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41819331  0.37972528

Mendel -- retailing at a hefty 10 million won .  Melania Trump is dressed in a navy see-through sequin dress with lace designed by J. Mendel, retailing for about $4,000, for an official dinner at Cheong Wa Dae, Tuesday. Wearing her hair down and wavy with minimal jewelry, she stood out from the pack, contrasting against Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook, who wore a traditional Korean dress covering the entire body. “While first ladies typically use fashion to support American or emerging designers on trips abroad, it looks like Melania goes for her own preferences such as European brands,” said Park Young-sil, a brand image strategist, giving an example of Trump's choice of Italian fashion powerhouse Fendi during her visit to Japan earlier this week. “She looked gorgeous in that dress, but was it appropriate for a state dinner? I don’t know,” a long-time fashion reporter said in reaction to her look.    Trump, accompanying her husband on his first official trip to Asia, sported an avant-garde fall trend with her volumized updo as she arrived at around noon on Tuesday. The 180-centimeter former model wore a mid-length sculptural coat with puffy sleeves by Spanish designer Delpozo and her ubiquitous sky-high Manolo Blahnik heels. The fall-esque outfit featured a zipper and thin belt, which altogether retails for $4,000. It was the first look of the second stop on the presidential tour of Asia.  Melania Trump, accompanying her husband on his first official trip to Asia, sports an avant-garde fall trend with three different outfits. She arrived here in a mid-length sculptural coat with puffy sleeves by Spanish designer Delpozo . On the day of the Trumps’ departure, she wore a knee-length black coat featuring a thin black belt with her ubiquitous sky-high Manolo Blahnik heels. YonhapIn that outfit, the first lady toured Cheong Wa Dae with South Korean first lady Kim and met with schoolchildren at US Embassy Korea. “Mrs. Trump always wants to be thoughtful and respect the traditions and protocols of the countries she visits,” communications director Stephanie Grisham was quoted as saying by CNN. “She knows she is representing the United States, and wants to be sure she is appropriate in all that she does.”On Wednesday, Melania Trump accompanied President Donald Trump for his address at the National Assembly and paid respects at the National Cemetery. There, she wore a knee-length black coat featuring a thin black belt, in unity with her long formal black pants and sky-high stiletto pumps. The presidential couple then left to China to continue the tour of Asian countries. When the Trumps visited storm-ravaged Texas in August, Melania Trump was photographed walking in stiletto pumps, part of an outfit including tailored capri pants and aviator sunglasses.She was also criticized for her $1,390 red flannel shirt by French designer Balmain at a garden event with children at the White House in September. Kate Andersen Brower, an American author who wrote “First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies,” said that first ladies typically use fashion to support American designers.“They put the spotlight on emerging designers and, on trips abroad, to pay tribute to foreign designers. ... Michelle Obama was brilliant at this -- she wore an Indian-American designer to the India state dinner, all British designers on a trip to London and Kenzo in Tokyo,” she said in a recent interview.“But Melania Trump is not a first lady who appears to care all that much what people have to say about what‘s in her closet,” she added. By Kim Da-sol","melania trump fashion catches ,eyebrows among fashion conservatives ,south korea her outfits ,lady melania trump wardrobe ,melania trump wardrobe choices","['US', 'Melania Trump', 'South Korea']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.94184858 -0.10549115

But Lim Hyoung-joon, the United Nations World Food Program’s Korea office head, stresses humanitarian support must continue, regardless of the current political situation. Lim Hyoung-joon, head of the United Nations World Food Program’s Seoul office. “The issue of humanitarian aid to North Korea should be viewed separately from the political situation,” Lim said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Thursday.“Political situations can be complicated, but such issues must be dealt separately” he added.The WFP launched the North Korea program in the mid-1990s, focusing on food and disaster relief. The Seoul office supports its funding and serves as a liaison between the UN body and the South Korean government.“Our resource is based on voluntary funding and there has been a noticeable drop in donations ,” said Lim, expressing worry for next year's program.Despite the lackluster donation figures, however, the UN official expressed hope over South Korea’s plan to provide aid through WFP.The Moon Jae-in administration will chip in $4.5 million for a nutrition program run by WFP, aimed at nurturing suffering children and pregnant women, for its first state-backed aid to the North.It comes as part of the government’s $8 million aid package to North Korea, announced in September. The remaining $3.5 million will go to a malnutrition project and vaccine provisions by the UN Children’s Fund. The previous administration under President Park Geun-hye suspended all support to the North following its fourth nuclear weapons test in January last year.Lim said South Korea providing aid to the North at this tense moment will send a positive message.“South Korea graduated from WFP assistance only in 20 years and actually achieved ‘zero hunger,’ which has manifested into a symbol of hope to the world.”“The world will move once South Korea takes a step.”A recent UN report showed that about 72 percent of the North Korean population of 24.9 million suffers from food shortages and malnutrition. Among them, 1.3 million, including children and pregnant women, are in dire need of help.He also underlined transparency in its aid program.“We have a very transparent and strict ‘no access, no food assistance’ policy which prioritizes monitoring of our aid supply routes. In the areas we operate, the monitoring team conducts inspections as frequently as 130 times a month,” he stressed. By Jung Min-kyung","set for donation drought ,office head stresses humanitarian ,world food program seoul ,herald interview south humanitarian ,for donation drought","['North Korea ’s', 'the United Nations ’', 'Lim Hyoung - joon', 'the United Nations World Food Program ’s Korea', 'Lim Hyoung - joon', 'the United Nations World Food Program ’s Seoul', 'WFP)“The']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05001779 -0.06423512

Lee earned the nickname the ""molar father"" after losing all but one molar while treating the disease. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon speaks during a Cabinet meeting on Oct. 31, 2017. However, it turned out that Lee had actually been living a luxurious life with donations he received from those who took pity on him since the airing of the TV show, as well as government allowances.Lee has admitted to the killing and said he picked the victim to satisfy his sexual desire.""The 'molar father' incident is a very shameful case for the administration as it showed how poorly government subsidies are executed,"" the prime minister said during a Cabinet meeting, noting that the killer received about 120 million won  in government allowances even when he was collecting donations worth a total of 1.28 billion won.He said the amount of money spent on welfare programs rose 1.5 times over the last five years and is expected to grow further, and unless fraudulent claims of government allowances aren't rooted out, it will significantly affect such programs.""This is not a problem of yesterday or today. This is also not limited to welfare sector only,"" Lee said. ""We've come to a point where we cannot let this problem go on any longer. All related ministries and agencies should tackle this with a determination to eradicate it.""Lee ordered ministries to launch inspections to check if subsidies reach the right people.","public donations the killing ,35 year old killer ,killer of middle school ,year old killer lee ,killing of the 14","['Lee Nak - yon', 'Lee Young - hak']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35858974  0.2328379

When Chadwick International was first established in 2010, we only accepted up to Grade 7, marking them the highest grade level. It was an intentional decision for the school. Chadwick wanted to provide an opportunity for our highest grade to immerse themselves in Chadwick education for at least six years while growing together before they enter the new world of their own.After their six years, we were elated to hear outstanding college acceptance results and it was a remarkable experience for me to see the students pursue further education based on their best interests and fit. In the midst of the excitement, it was also a bittersweet feeling to see our beloved kiddos leave the Chadwick campus. During the commencement ceremony, I couldn’t help but notice mixed emotions manifesting among our students, teachers, and parents as they shared warm smiles and hugs. At that moment, I wanted to capture the heartfelt emotions I encountered in a memorable way.The initial draft of the “I am your pool” was written from perspectives of the Chadwick community, coach, or parents who accompanied the students on their journey. It stated:“You were the first one to open the door to the swimming pool every day. I remember your every stroke to get better. I remember your first triumph and imagined you would have many wins and losses in your life. But I believe you will always have the winning spirit. Because I was your deepest blue sea in your heart, not just a pool.”As a teacher, a parent and a school administrator, the best support we can provide to the students is to watch them grow, cheer for them and provide solid foundations in the realm of our “deep blue sea.” I certainly hope students prosper beyond our deep blue sea, however, knowing that they will always be embraced by Chadwick as proud graduates. I would like to convey sincere gratitude to The Korea Herald for recognizing our education as one of the prime examples that stands out. I would like to share this recognition with the whole Chadwick community which is where unfathomable support and love for our students comes from. By Helen LeeHelen Lee, director of communications at Chadwick International","first graduating class ,first graduating class of ,the first graduating class ,first established in 2010 ,best brand chadwick international","['Chadwick International', 'Chadwick International']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46317667  0.33636907

Choi Soon-sil is escorted to the courtroom at the Seoul Central District Court to attend her hearing on Oct. 19. YonhapPark’s confidante Choi Soon-sil was identified as its owner by JTBC, the TV network that had obtained the abandoned gadget. But a year after it was unearthed, questions still remain over its ownership. Choi, now embroiled in a criminal trial, continues to deny the tablet was hers. Choi’s lawyer Lee Kyung-jae asked last week that the court reject the tablet PC as evidence, saying Choi did not even know how to use such a device. “The identification and verification of the true ownership of the tablet PC would be a first step in getting to the truth,” Lee told reporters. “It’s been a year since the revelation of the device by JTBC, but nothing is yet certain nor confirmed over the ownership, and Choi has consistently denied it since the beginning of the investigation,” Lee added. The device was submitted by the prosecution and acknowledged by judges as possible evidence that Choi used her friendship with Park to influence state affairs and benefited personally by illegally soliciting bribes from conglomerates for nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi and Park. The device contained classified documents on national security and diplomatic issues, as well as a draft version of a speech to be made by Park, viewed before the date of the speech, and self-taken photos of Choi using the device. Earlier this month, Shin Hye-won, a former member of Park’s 2012 presidential campaign team, claimed she was the actual owner, not Choi. Choi has asked the court re-examine the device’s ownership. Park’s legal team had planned to bring Shin to the witness stand, but the lawyers resigned en masse on Oct. 16 in protest of the decision to extend her detention. Regarding Choi’s ownership of the tablet device, chief of Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office Yoon Seok-yeol confirmed it belonged to Choi at a 20-day parliamentary audit last week. When questioned by lawmakers from the main opposition Liberty Korea Party on who owns the tablet device, Yoon said they concluded that it belonged to Choi, saying the conclusion had been based on the fact that GPS locations stored in the device matched Choi’s whereabouts. Yoon added that Park’s former secretary Jeong Ho-seong had also said that it was Choi’s. Jeong was indicted on charges that including giving classified information to Choi. Choi exchanged text messages with Jeong to receive classified documents through emails that were sent to Choi’s tablet PC, Yoon explained. Nam Kyoung-kook, a law professor at the University of Seoul Law School, said Choi’s strategy was to “raise a question over the ownership and divert attention from other allegations.” “The revelation of the tablet computer is just a piece of the puzzle. Park’s former aides, including Jeong, are revealing to the court that the confidante peddled influence in state affairs for her own benefit using her friendship with Park,” Nam told The Korea Herald. Choi has been held in detention since Oct. 31 last year while on trial for charges including coercion and bribery in collusion with Park. The lower court’s verdict for Choi is expected next month, while the verdict for Park was delayed until early next year after her legal team resigned. The court has designated five court-appointed attorneys to represent Park in her trial. The first female president elected in South Korea, Park was indicted on 18 charges on April 17, including receiving bribes from Samsung alongside Choi, who had no formal government position.The scandal led to the candlelight movement that began on Oct. 29 last year, in which a total 17 million participants to demand Park’s ouster. Park has been detained at a corrections facility in southern Seoul since she was arrested on March 31.By Bak Se-hwan","over 200 presidential documents ,pc in park scandal ,scandal private tablet pc ,200 presidential documents ,park scandal private tablet","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'YonhapPark', 'JTBC']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3757039  -0.06342801

Led by the nation’s second-largest umbrella labor group Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, some 220 left-wing civic organizations joined the campaign, as military tensions have escalated here in the wake of a heated war of words between Pyongyang and Washington in recent months. The progressive groups said they will hold large-scale rallies against the US and Trump under the slogan of “No Trump No War People’s Rally,” starting on Nov. 4 near the US Embassy in central Seoul. “Who can possibly welcome a foreign leader who talks about the possibility of a war on their land?” the association of anti-war civic groups said during a press briefing. Activists from an association of 220 left-wing civic groups hold up placards that express their opposition to US President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to Korea scheduled for Nov. 7-8, during a press briefing in central Seoul, Thursday. President Trump is scheduled to visit Korea from Nov. 7-8 to reaffirm the Korea-US alliance, as part of his 11-day Asian trip. During the trip, he is expected to increase pressure on the North -- which is seemingly inching closer to putting the US mainland within the range of its nuclear-tipped missiles -- to give up its weapons program and rally support for his strategy of isolating the communist regime economically.Trump warned in August the US would unleash “fire and fury” on Pyongyang if it continued provocations. Since then, the North has conducted a massive underground nuclear test and launched several ballistic missiles. “We should take the path of peace, not war. We cannot help but protect peace on our land and our livelihood for ourselves,” the civic groups said, dismissing the Moon Jae-in administration’s diplomacy as “humiliating” and “neglecting” its responsibility to protect its people. Several protests by civic groups are set to be staged in central Seoul in the week leading up to Trump’s visit to Seoul. When he arrives on Nov. 7, the civic groups will hold a candlelight vigil chanting “No Trump, No War” at Gwanghwamun Square. They will also hold a protest outside the National Assembly building when Trump addresses the parliament on Nov. 8. Far-left groups have traditionally demanded Korea pursue a more independent foreign policy without being swayed by its powerful allies, particularly the US. It believes the US has used the Korean Peninsula’s continued tensions as an opportunity to sell its weapons and exert influence over East Asia. Through the anti-US protests, the civic groups plan to call on the US to stop threatening to start a war, putting pressure on the North and forcing the South to buy American-made weapons. They also want the withdrawal of the US Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, which they say caters only to US interests while widening the divide between South Korea and China. China, which believes the system’s radar could be used to spy on its territory, has taken what appear to be retaliatory actions against Korea, such as restrictions on Korean firms’ businesses in China.They also want the abolishment of the Korea-US bilateral trade deal, which the two countries have recently begun to renegotiate at Trump’s urging, saying the trade deal only benefits the US and disadvantages Korea, especially local farmers.

Franciscus Kim Yeon-jun.Kim has been working to promote awareness of the selfless service of the two nurses.  This photo provided by Rev. Franciscus Kim Yeon-jun shows a signature of President Moon Jae-in on a petition calling for nominating two Austrian nurses for the Nobel Peace Prize for their 40 years of volunteer service for South Korean leprosy patients. Kim, the government of South Jeolla Province and the archdiocese in the southwestern city of Gwangju have been working together to form a committee aimed at nominating them for the Nobel prize. Former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik has agreed to chair the committee.Moon's signature is expected to give the campaign a boost.After graduating from nursing college in Austria, Stoeger and Pissar moved to Sorok in 1962 and 1966, separately, after learning that the island was in need of nurses. It had been known and shunned for more than 100 years as a leprosy colony. The two, better known here as Sisters Marianne and Margareta even though they were not ordained, spent the next 40 years working at the National Sorok Island Hospital as volunteer nurses without pay before they returned to their home country in 2005.","austrian nurses for nobel ,nurses for nobel peace ,nurses for nobel ,women for the nobel ,two austrian nurses for","['Moon Jae - in', 'austrian', 'south korean', 'catholic', 'Yeosu', 'Moon', 'Marianne Stoeger', 'Margareta Pissar']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.55033821  0.36508515

The suspect is being accused of giving shots of aesthetic fillers and botox to some 20 women and quoting a fee that is 30 percent of what a hospital would normally charge. The man originally worked as a supplier of cosmetics appliances. In between his jobs, he learned how to give the shots on various parts of the face through the product’s booklets and video instructions. The man made some 6 million won in profits through the irregular practice. Unregulated beauty procedures hold serious risks of facial paralysis, dyschromodermia, blindness and apoplexy.

Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun announces President Moon Jae-in`s stance on the decision regarding Shin Kori reactors on Sunday. YonhapThe works on the reactors had been suspended by Moon, who hopes to take South Korea away from nuclear power, and the commission was launched to decide through public deliberation whether to resume construction or to terminate the project. The reactors were about 30 percent complete before their construction was suspended in July. About 1.6 trillion won  had already been spent on the project.“Nuclear power plant safety standards will be strengthened so that residents  can rest at ease,” Moon said in a statement, saying that several million people reside within a 30-kilometer radius of nuclear power facilities in the Gyeongsang provinces. He added that his administration will root out corruption from the nuclear power industry, and continue to execute the plans for veering away from nuclear power and to increase the use of renewable sources. “Plans for new nuclear power plants will be stopped, and once it is confirmed that energy supply is stable, the operations of Wolseong 1 reactor will be stopped.” Wolseong 1 reactor was completed in 1983. The reactor was brought to a halt in 2012, but operations resumed in 2015 after the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission deemed it fit for operation. The Seoul Administrative Court, however, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs fighting the decision in February. “Even then, four nuclear reactors will go into operation during the current government. The number of nuclear reactors will begin to drop from the next government,” Moon said. “The government will spur on expansion of  natural gas, and renewable energy  to enable the next administration to continue the trend of nuclear-free .”Moon went on to say that a research institute specializing in deconstructing nuclear power plants will be established in the southeast region to prepare for future needs, and to expand into overseas markets for related services.

The planes can allow South Korea to better counter North Korea's growing underwater threat that may include submarines with the capability to launch ballistic missile.South Korea's Navy said that it wants to acquire six more patrol aircraft to augment the 16 P-3C and P-3CK Orion planes currently in service. ""The Navy plans to receive requests for the proposal from the bidders and after a careful evaluation, pick the winning plane next year,"" said an official, who declined to be identified. The Boeing P-8A Poseidon of the US Navy Boeing has said that its aircraft based on the popular B737-800 passenger jet is currently in service with the United States Navy and has been selected as the MPA of such countries as India, Australia, Britain and Norway.It added that the P-8A has been specifically built for a wide range of missions ranging from anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface unit warfare and general reconnaissance.Saab on the other hand, which is new to the maritime reconnaissance market, has offered South Korea the opportunity to take part in development and construction of the planes. This it said could allow the country to build its own MPA platforms going forward. A model of the Saab`s Swordfish maritime patrol aircraft The company is said to have offered to build two to three of the initial Swordfish planes in Sweden, with the rest being assembled in South Korea.The Swordfish is built on the airframe of the Bombardier Global 6000 business jet, with Saab claiming the plane is capable of 12 hours of loitering time. The plane is equipped with an active electronically scanned array radar that has 360 degrees detection capability.South Korean Navy insiders, meanwhile, said that because of South Korea's geographical location and the persistent North Korean threat there is a requirement for at least 60 MPAs. This they said is still smaller than the roughly 100 maritime reconnaissance planes operated by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.","boeing saab compete to ,compete to win korea ,boeing saab compete ,korea next maritime patrol ,saab compete to win","['US', 'Boeing Co.', 'Saab of Sweden', ""South Korea 's"", 'Seoul International Aerospace', 'Seongnam', 'Swordfish']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.62141925  0.62872547

An open letter from a dating violence victim was posted on a bulletin board at Korea University in Seoul. “I am usually on the other side of the campus, but I came here today to read the letter after learning about it on the news. I couldn’t believe this happened at our school,” said a graduate student at the school, surnamed Kim, in an interview with The Korea Herald.Among the crowd of students at the bulletin board, some sighed and moaned at the shocking details of the victim’s testimony. “This sounds like a very painful experience and I want to support the victim’s courage in taking the initiative to publicize the case,” said a media major surnamed Kang, Behind the publication of the letter is Korea University Minority Human Rights Committee, an advocacy group at the school, which received the letter from the victim and then made it public. “The letter has received a substantial amount of reactions from the students, as well as from social media where the letter was shared. Our purpose of publishing this was to raise the awareness on the issue and prevent other students from suffering dating violence,” a member of the KUMHRC told The Korea Herald. The letter describes how the victim’s then-boyfriend, a student of Yonsei University, treated her like “an object with which to satisfy his sexual desires.” The victim claims that her former boyfriend pressured her into having sex with him and used violent language to threaten her. At the end of the letter, she calls on students to recognize the seriousness of dating violence, and urges other victims to report their cases.The KUMHRC said the school should take more steps to tackle dating violence and other types of sexual violence prevalent on campus. “The case we publicized through this letter is not the only sexual violence incident on campus. We ask our school to come up with a more systematic solution to handling this problem, such as protective measures for students affected by sexual violence,” the committee said.At the request of the Korea University committee, the letter has also been posted at Yonsei University. Both posts are set to be removed from the college bulletin boards late Wednesday.   An open letter from a dating violence victim was posted on a bulletin board at Korea University in Seoul.","viral on social media ,dating violence has sparked ,went viral on social ,dating violence victim sparks ,viral on social","['Korea University', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80820596 -0.1394113

It is referred to as the “April 3 Incident” or “April 3 Massacre.”  Oct. 17 marks the day when Korean Maj. Song Yo-han, who stood guard over Jeju Island under the command of the US military, issued a decree to shoot down anyone who walked within 5 kilometers from the coastline. This later lead to the introduction of an ordinance that resulted in a large-scale massacre. Marking the 70th anniversary since the decree, the civic groups said then-US commander on Jeju Island, Rothwell H. Brown, did not care about the cause behind the people’s uprising, but only about suppressing the movement. The groups argued that Brown played a critical role in escalating tensions on post-war Jeju Island that ultimately led to a mass murder.The civic groups are petitioning to gather 100,000 signatures through online and offline portals for the US and UN to form an investigative body to uncover the truth behind the massacre and come up with a guideline on appropriate measures to aid and compensate the victims. The first round of signature gathering is taking place until March 2018. The second round will take place between April 2018 and October 2018.

He also pointed to rising collaborative opportunities with South Korea based on its advanced economy and large investments in research and science. “Our economies are complementary. Korea needs our resources while Australia needs Korea’s human capital, talents and technologies. Your advanced and powerful manufacturing capacities, innovative skills, services industries and sophisticated consumer base can clearly transform Australian materials into sellable products and services.”Highlighting Australia’s growing engagement with Southeast Asian and Northeast Asian economies, the minister confidently argued that the nation Down Under will be the “energy, food and resources engine room of Asia for a long time to come.”Australia has abundant natural resources, chiefly mineral resources of copper, iron ore, gold and diamonds; energy resources of coal, oil, natural gas and uranium; and land resources for farming and logging. South Australia possesses one-third of the world’s recoverable uranium and large reserves of copper, iron ore and onshore oil and gas.Sellicks Beach, South Australia Long Beach, South Australia Touching on the Australia-Korea Free Trade Agreement that entered into force on Dec. 12, 2014, he said improvements can be made to the bilateral accord to prune and disencumber it, particularly by eliminating nontariff barriers.“We were disappointed that the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement didn’t eventuate with the US’ withdrawal, but we shouldn’t stop our multilateral efforts to reduce trade and regulatory barriers as well as a whole list of nontariff barriers,” he underlined. Before entering politics in 1997, Hamilton-Smith worked in property development, investment and private child care business, a civilian career he launched following 24 years of military service in the Australian Army. He served with the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, a Special Forces unit, attaining the rank of colonel and undertaking overseas assignments in Malaysia, Egypt and Israel, among others.“My Royal Australian Regiment participated in the 1950-53 Korean War and lost many lives. Korea also falls within my portfolio in terms of commemorating those lives lost during the war,” he explained, citing his veterans’ affairs oversight. A vineyard in South Australia Murray River Mentioning the sister regional relationship between South Australia and South Chungcheong Province of Korea, Hamilton-Smith said, “More collaboration in arts, culture and sports would allow us to know each other better. If you want to do business, you have to be able to understand and trust each other first.”The wine and food tasting event at Hotel Shilla in Seoul featured various wines of South Australia and Bultarra Australian Saltbrush lamb, with a live cooking show by chef Choi Kwang-ho. Eight wineries from South Australia -- Alpha Box and Dice, Barristers Block, Great Australian Wine Company, Negociants International, Nova Vita Wines, Raidis Estate, Tim Adams and Wines by Geoff Hardy -- participated. South Australia leads the nation’s agriculture, food and wine industries, sustainably producing premium wine, beef and lamb that are exported worldwide alongside its Southern Bluefin Tuna, abalone, prawns, rock lobster, oysters and other seafood. “We have 200 cellar doors within an hour north and south of Adelaide, which is one of eight Great Wine Capitals of the World, including Bordeaux, Meinz, Mendoza, Napa Valley and Verona,” said Brian Smedley, chief executive of the South Australian Wine Industry Association, in an interview. Representatives of South Australian wineries, including Brian Smedley, chief executive of the South Australian Wine Industry Association , pose at the South Australian Food and Wine Showcase at Hotel Shilla in Seoul on Friday. Chef Choi Kwang-ho cooks lamb dishes with South Australian lamb cuts “We have diverse climates and soils that add richness to our wines’ characteristics. There’s a lot of fruit characteristics in our wines and the variations will be subtle, depending on an early pick or a late pick, warm or cool sea breeze and et cetera, all of which influence the wine’s taste.”Barossa Shiraz from the Barossa region is a fine example of a Shiraz wine, he noted, adding South Australian wines dominate the national market with 60 percent of local production exported and 59 percent of the country’s global wine export coming from South Australia. The wine sector generated $2.1 billion of revenue from 2015-2016, while the food and wine industry exported $5.2 billion of products during the same period. Red wine dominates in South Australia, making up some 60 percent of total production on average and up to 90 percent in some regions. Sparkling wine and fortified wine are also popular and highly sought after globally, the chief executive said.Wine grapes are either hand-picked or machine-harvested and produced through sustainable practices -- such as energy-efficient irrigation that saves water -- part and parcel of South Australia’s viticulture and winemaking, Smedly explained. “Australians try to drink wine in moderation without getting into drunken revelry. It’s an enjoyable experience and you should come out feeling good from start to finish, while having great conversations in it,” he said. “Traditionally, our wines have been part of our meal, but increasingly they are enjoyed around the world in different social occasions. Our wines are versatile and provide diversity for any type of occasion.”By Joel Lee  A guest looks for information on South Australian wine at the South Australian Food and Wine Showcase at Hotel Shilla in Seoul on Friday Participants try South Australian wine at the South Australian Food and Wine Showcase at Hotel Shilla in Seoul on Friday","australia gateway to business ,sustainable development south australia ,australia is keen to ,since australia became federation ,south australia is keen","['australian', 'Australia', 'South Korea']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.77880359  0.41325614

On Thursday, the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae revealed that documents indicating that the Park Geun-hye administration’s presidential aides altered documents concerning former President Park Geun-hye’s actions on April 16, 2014, when the ferry sank, killing more than 300 people.  The ruling Democratic Party of Korea’s floor leader Rep. Woo Won-shik  speaks at a meeting on the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster at the National Assembly on Sunday. YonhapAccording to President Moon Jae-in’s Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok, the time at which Park was first briefed on the accident was altered to 10 a.m., from the initially recorded 9:30 a.m., about six months after the accident. Im also revealed that then-National Security Council chief Kim Kwan-jin ordered for the government’s crisis response manual to be altered without following proper legal procedures. Following the revelation, Cheong Wa Dae on Friday requested a formal investigation by the prosecutors’ office. In addition, civic groups concerned with the Sewol accident took to the streets on Saturday to call for the committee investigating the accident to be relaunched. ”The officials of the Park Geun-hye administration must take legal responsibility for bearing false witness at the National Assembly and the courts,“ Rep. Woo Won-shik, floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, said at a meeting with families of those who died in the disaster on Sunday. ”A complete reinvestigation into former President Park at the time of the accident is unavoidable.  will use all possible means to reveal the truth.“ The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, in contrast, attacked the administration of attempting to interfere with the ongoing parliamentary audit of the government. The party branded the revelation as an attempt to manipulate the media to divert the public attention from the parliamentary audit. “The  chief of staff announced that Sewol-related documents have been found, while the Education Ministry’s press release raises questions on the opinion polls on state-authored textbooks at a time when the first parliamentary audit of the new administration is underway,” Rep. Jun Hee-kyung said. She added that such developments were an unprecedented attempt at keeping the public from being informed about the parliamentary audit. “The illegality of the Moon Jae-in administration’s political revenge being carried out under the name of addressing accumulated wrongs will be laid bare through the parliamentary audit.”The current administration has focused on addressing irregularities found in society, the political arena and government organization as one of its main agendas. While the administration maintains that related efforts are part of building a more transparent society, the opposition bloc has accused the president of taking revenge against the conservatives. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea hit back accusing the main opposition of wanting to keep the truth hidden.“The Liberty Korea Party hinders  the National Assembly whenever the topic of Sewol and state-authored  textbooks are raised,” Democratic Party floor spokesperson Rep. Je Youn-kyung said in a statement on Sunday. The previous administration had planned to introduce state-authored history textbooks, which progressives claim contained biased views. “It is questionable how much  fears the truth that it refuses  the parliamentary audit.”","thursday the presidential office ,the 2014 ferry disaster ,presidential aides altered documents ,on thursday the presidential ,2014 ferry disaster is","['Park Geun - hye', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Park Geun - hye']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59942961  0.45140302

The student said the professor relayed to the class on Wednesday, “Boys, if you have any desires of kidnapping girls, feel free to find me. I have a whole carton full of the drug.”The student made a follow-up post on Facebook highlighting the seriousness of the suggested crime. Following the student’s report, more than 700 Facebook commenters and university students denounced the professor and his comments. Officials at the university are looking into the student’s report on Facebook due to the nature of the alleged comments, specifically an infringement of rights that may encourage one to commit a crime.","on kidnapping women university ,kidnapping women university in ,kidnapping women university ,remarks on kidnapping women ,anonymous facebook post thursday","['Busan', 'Dispatch']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14496669  0.23485486

The camp, set to be held at the Gyeseongwon retreat training center in the central city of Cheonan, is crucial because participants are expected to make up their mind depending on the debates. Officials plan to conduct two surveys asking the participants whether the reactors' construction should continue or end, at the beginning and end of the camp. Results are expected to be the main basis of a recommendation that a state commission plans to make on the reactors' fate next week.During the camp, participants will hear briefings by experts, take part in group and plenary discussions, and hold question and answer sessions, according to officials of the commission charged with overseeing the process.They will also be shown videos featuring those calling for the continuation or cancellation of the project, such as residents near the site of the reactors and young people, officials said.In an effort to reduce South Korea's dependence on nuclear energy, Moon proposed scrapping the reactor project. The government then established the independent commission and charged it with gauging public opinion on the proposal. It also suspended the reactors' construction until a decision is made. The commission plans to unveil its recommendation Oct. 20. Government officials have said that they will fully endorse whatever recommendation the commission makes.The problem is what the commission will do if the results of the survey are within the margin of error. Separate opinion polls have shown that pros and cons are neck and neck, with four Gallup surveys showing the public is nearly evenly split with differences of less than five percentage points.The reactors were about 28.8 percent complete before construction was suspended in July.The proposal to scrap work on the reactors sparked heated debate in a country that relies on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity. Proponents say the country should phase out nuclear power for safety and environmental reasons, but opponents say it will lead to a shortage in the power supply and a spike in electricity prices, and that too much money has already been spent on the construction.","day debate camp friday ,of unfinished nuclear reactors ,three day debate camp ,unfinished nuclear power reactors ,debate camp friday",['Moon Jae - in'],20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.22135709  0.48843357

""We will gradually phase out the nuclear reactors and make coal-fired thermal power plants more eco-friendly.""South Korea operates 24 nuclear reactors that generate about 30 percent of its electricity, while coal and renewable energy provide 37.5 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, according to the ministry. Since President Moon Jae-in took office in May, the plan to build six more nuclear reactors has been abandoned and construction of two reactors has been temporarily halted to gather public opinion. Its result will be announced on Oct. 20. Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Paik Un-gyu Paik said the new energy policy was designed to keep pace with the changing energy environment and growing safety concerns following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and the nation's largest-recorded earthquake in Gyeongju.A 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit Gyeongju, located 370 kilometers southeast of Seoul, where six reactors and a nuclear waste facility are located. The epicenter is also close to Ulsan, an industrial city with eight reactors.""Nuclear scholars say an accident has a one in a million chance, but large accidents have already occurred three times with 448 nuclear reactors in the world,"" Paik said, noting the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and 1979 Three Mile Island incident in the US. ""It is hard to accept the safety data provided by nuclear scholars. We have to take all matters into consideration, including the equipment, location and the operator's capacity.""The ministry said the energy road map will raise the ratio of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2030 by increasing investment in research and development, and supporting related industries  For the goal, the road map will provide detailed plans on the location and accommodation for renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and hydro power plants. Following the closure of the nation's oldest reactor, Kori No. 1, in May, the government will push for an early closure of Wolsong No. 1, now the nation's oldest reactor. The nation's 10 oldest reactors will be retired by 2030 as their operational life cycles expire one by one. While permitting the ongoing construction of five coal plants, the ministry said it won't authorize new licenses and consult utility companies to turn their coal projects to natural liquefied gas stations.The existing 39 coal power plants will be required to cut CO2 emissions by 40 percent in 2022 and 58 percent in 2030 to meet the national emission reduction goal. Last year, South Korea set its national target for the Paris climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent from business-as-usual levels by 2030. Six coal power plants aged over 30 years will be shut down in the next five years, and they will temporarily cease operations in spring time, the ministry said. Separate from the domestic energy policy, the government vowed active support for local industries' efforts to export indigenous designed nuclear reactors to maintain their decadeslong know-how and have a competitive edge in the global market.""If  is beneficial for the national interest and its risk is managed, the government will roll up its sleeves to provide full support,"" he said.Currently, the state-run Korea Electric Corp. and local construction companies have been actively trying to make inroads overseas, eyeing nuclear projects in Britain, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic. Despite the government's pledge, local industries have expressed concerns that the less investment in new nuclear technology could weaken their status in the global stage in the face of fierce competition from rivals.","future energy reflecting global ,korea to complete energy ,technology innovation the government ,thursday we will change ,energy reflecting global trends",['South Korea'],20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.60643584  0.58507717

The probe team found piles of documents that show top officials from the Ministry of Education allegedly carried out a scheme in late 2015 to doctor citizens' written statements on their views of the uniform history textbooks published by the state. The ministry said this week it plans to request that the Supreme Prosecutors' Office further investigate the case.  This captured image of files, provided by the Ministry of Education on Oct. 11, 2017, shows three separate statements in support of the state history textbooks pushed by former President Park Geun-hye and her government in 2015, which all gave the same address. The former president pushed for the adoption of the revised history books by high schools in the country by 2017. She highlighted their need, citing the ""left-leaning"" nature of existing versions that she said should be corrected. The adoption of the state-issued history books was considered one of her key policies that ended up earning little public support as it faced huge backlash from opponents and historians accusing her government of manipulating modern history in a way that glorified the dictatorial rule of ex-leader Park Chung-hee, her father. When President Moon Jae-in took office in May after Park's ouster over a corruption scandal, he scrapped the plan in the first month of his presidency.The probe team discovered the opinion statements in chunks, which were categorized as filled out by proponents. But the personal details of the respondents, such as names, addresses and phone numbers, were all fabricated. About 1,600 of them even used the same address. In November of 2015, the education ministry announced the tally on the opinion collection with opponents outpacing proponents around 321,000 to 152,000.","state history textbooks probe ,state issued history textbooks ,on state history textbooks ,history textbooks probe the ,history textbooks probe","['Park Geun', 'the Ministry of Education']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17132756  0.33336115

The camp, set to be held at the Gyeseongwon retreat training center in the central city of Cheonan, is crucial because participants are expected to make up their mind depending on the debates. Members of a jury on the fate of two unfinished nuclear power reactors attend an orientation session on Sept. 16. Officials plan to conduct two surveys asking the participants whether the reactors' construction should continue or end, at the beginning and end of the camp. Results are expected to be the main basis of a recommendation that a state commission plans to make on the reactors' fate next week.During the camp, participants will hear briefings by experts, take part in group and plenary discussions, and hold question and answer sessions, according to officials of the commission charged with overseeing the process.They will also be shown videos of those calling for continuing and ending the project, such as residents near the reactors' site and future generations, officials said.In an effort to reduce South Korea's dependence on nuclear energy, Moon proposed scrapping the reactor project. The government then established the independent commission charged with gauging public opinion on the proposal and suspended the reactors' construction until a decision is made. The commission plans to unveil its recommendation on Oct. 20. Government officials have said that they will fully endorse whatever recommendation the commission makes.The reactors were about 28.8 percent complete before the construction was suspended in July.The proposal to scrap the reactors' construction sparked heated debate in a country that relies on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity. Proponents say the country should phase out nuclear power for safety and environmental reasons, but opponents say it will lead to a shortage in the power supply and a spike in electricity bills, and that too much money has already been spent on the construction.","three day debate camp ,debate camp this week ,of unfinished nuclear reactors ,unfinished nuclear power reactors ,scrap two unfinished nuclear",['Moon Jae - in'],20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.3550314   0.30141816

The North Korean workers found in Chinese factories aren't allowed to leave, and receive only a fraction of their pay _ most goes straight to the North Korean state. This means that American consumers buying seafood labeled ""Caught in the USA, Processed in China"" may inadvertently be subsidizing the government of Kim Jong Un as it builds nuclear weapons, and also supporting forced labor. In this Sept. 2, 2017, photo, a worker stacks crates at the Yanbian Shenghai Industry & Trade Co. Ltd., which hires some North Korean workers to process seafood in the city of Hunchun in northeastern China's Jilin province. In an effort to boost the local economy, China and North Korea agreed several years ago to allow factories to contract for groups of North Korean workers, establishing an industrial zone with bargain-priced labor. US Customs and Border Protection said in a statement Thursday it is reviewing the allegations and if warranted, would ""pursue all enforcement actions and prohibit goods from importation as appropriate."" The companies that responded also vowed to investigate ties with suppliers.GOP Congressman Chris Smith from New Jersey, who has repeatedly called for tougher enforcement, said the Labor Department has already identified trafficking in 12 sectors of goods exported by China.""CBP should be stopping every shipment from those sectors _ and now trafficking-tainted salmon too,"" he said.A White House National Security Council spokesman said the North Korean government's scheme to outsource its labor underscores why the United States has pushed for restrictions on North Korean foreign workers. The spokesman said all countries should, at a minimum, ban companies from bringing in North Korean crews, as pledged in recent United Nations sanctions.China is among the countries that have promised to comply, already banning imports of North Korean seafood, and saying no more North Korean workers will be allowed starting next year.""But all nations must go further and reject what is clearly a despicable practice that only serves the regime's nuclear ambitions,"" said the NSC spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment.Walmart said its supplier has addressed the problem, although it did not specify how. Walmart and ALDI said they are committed to human rights and fair labor practices, and expect the same from their business partners.At a time when North Korea faces sanctions on many exports, the government is sending tens of thousands of workers worldwide, bringing in revenue estimated at anywhere from $200 million to $500 million a year. That could account for a sizable portion of North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs, which South Korea says have cost more than $1 billion.North Koreans overseas work in construction in the Gulf states, shipbuilding in Poland, logging in Russia. In Uruguay, authorities told AP, about 90 North Koreans crewed fishing boats last year.""I am not surprised at all,"" said Anthony Talbott, who directs the University of Dayton's Human Rights Center. ""North Korea has probably the single highest level of state-sanctioned slavery in the world, it's a major source of income for them.""Among those North Korean laborers in China, roughly 3,000 are believed to work in the northeast industrial hub of Hunchun, just a few miles from the borders of both North Korea and Russia. AP documented North Koreans in several Hunchun seafood processing plants, and tracked their supply chains to importers, including Sea-Trek Enterprises in Rhode Island, where managers said they are being inundated with phone calls from customers and suppliers since the AP story.Sea-Trek's owners said that they hadn't visited China and were unaware of the makeup of the workers, but would immediately cease dealings with the plant until the situation is resolved.""Sea-Trek will not purchase product from any company using forced labor,"" said vice president Mitch Sarnoff.Mark Liszt, owner of Lawrence Wholesale, a national food distributor in Southern California, said it would investigate its suppliers as well.""We're middlemen,"" said Liszt. ""We do make a practice of trying to go and visit the plants that we buy from in person, but it's not a perfect world that we can see into every single one.""Some US brands and companies had indirect ties to the North Korean laborers in Hunchun, including Chicken of the Sea, owned by Thai Union. Trade records show shipments came from a sister company of the Hunchun factory in another part of China, where Thai Union spokeswoman Whitney Small says labor standards are being met and the employees are all Chinese. Small said the sister company should not be penalized.AP observed North Korean workers in Chinese factories building hardwood flooring, sewing garments and manufacturing electronics. Fordham University economics professor Giacomo Santangelo said he doubts it's just fish processed by North Korean workers that reaches the US markets.""Now we need to ask, how many other products imported from China are made with North Korean labor?"" he said.Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York said US officials must keep products made by North Koreans out of the United States.""The administration needs to ramp up the pressure on China to crack down on trade with North Korea across the board,"" he said.Ohio's Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who helped pass North Korea, Iran and Russia sanctions this summer, said corporations also have a responsibility to make sure they are abiding by UN sanctions and US laws.However, Bucknell University political science professor Zhiqun Zhu said a sanction-based approach that cracks down on imports isn't going to solve the problem.""It has so many loopholes,"" he said.

Since being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, sometimes known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, in 2010, Yoo, 55, now finds himself facing the reality that the country’s disability care budget covers only half the cost of the home help services that he needs for 24 hours a day.“I can no longer work and take care of myself, but I sure don’t want sympathy. I just want to be treated fairly by the government, whose primary goal is to protect its citizens,” Yoo told The Korea Herald. “It’s a tragedy for myself and also for other people like me whose lives will be affected by the government’s negligence toward the plight of us who cannot afford to pay for the 24-hour care services.” The government’s lack of support left him with no choice but to give up his independent home life to receive 24-hour care at a cheap medical facility, Yoo said. While South Korea’s new government vows to address social inequality by boosting the minimum wage and unemployment benefits, it still largely fails to come to grips with the challenges faced by people with disabilities who need 24-hour care, Yoo and other activists said.They say the government’s care package only allows them to receive 13 hours of home help service a day, even though they need 24-hour support. The remaining 11 hours come as a burden for each city and province to cover, and in many cases, disabled people have to pay for care out of their own pockets. According to government data, disabled South Koreans make up around 5 percent of the country’s 50 million population.Since 2015, the capital Seoul has vowed to provide 24-hour care services for up to 200 people with severe disabilities, but currently only 98 people are receiving the full package, according to one of its district offices. “Our district has set up our own budget of 270 million won  for the past few years and even increased the budget for this year to reflect the inflation rate. But the budget is still not enough to cover 24-hour services for all those who need it,” said Lee Kang-se, head of the social welfare department of the city’s Songpa-gu district. Insufficient home care support can lead to deadly incidents. In June 2016, a 40-year-old woman with Lou Gehrig’s disease died from breathing problems at home after her respirator was accidently withdrawn from her mouth. Another similar incident happened in the same year, taking the life of a 50-year-old woman with brain disorder. Both were left unattended at the time of the accident. “It’s time for the central government to come up with a solution,” said Kim Jun-woo, head of a local charity group, Songpa Solution Center for Independent Living. “We can’t just blame the district offices for not providing the 11 hours that the state left them to provide.” Kim said. Park In-Chun, 59, has been a quadriplegic all his life and has to rely on three different government agencies for 24-hour care. He came to Seoul’s Songpa district five years ago to receive better care. Like Park, many people with disability are moving to different cities because benefits differ from city to city.“I’m dependent on care workers all the time. It was OK when my parents were alive, they paid for everything,” he said.But earlier this year the district office reduced his covered care hours from 120 to 100 a week. To make sure he receives round-the-clock care, his caregivers work an extra 30 minutes for free after each shift. On top of this, they run errands for him in their spare time, as Park cannot be left alone and cannot afford to have more than one support worker at a time. He needs two people to lift him and relies on help from people from his church to help him bath. “For disabled people, it’s not like we want special rights. I tried to commit suicide three times. I failed. I want to live but living like something else, with purpose,” he said. Last month, Park wrote a letter to the district office asking that his care hours be reinstated. He received a response saying that the letter was forwarded to the Welfare Ministry but has yet to hear back. “I am alive. I just want some support from the government,” he said.The Ministry of Health and Welfare told The Korea Herald it was “in the works to address the disability care issue,” but denied to reveal further details.The provision of 24-hour support for the seriously disabled is not welfare, it could be a matter of life or death, says Cho Hyun-soo, policy director of a nonprofit activist group, Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination.“The problem is in case of an emergency, the lack of support could kill these people,” Cho said, stressing that Korea’s state support for disability care services is far below the average for member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of its budget.Things are tough for the care workers as well. Wages for home care workers have been largely stagnant, hovering just above 6,900 won an hour. The workers are paid by the government, but the center takes a 25 percent cut of their pay for connecting them and covering their insurance. But low wages often drive people who find the work meaningful out of the field, Cho noted. “These people care deeply for their work, but because of low wages they often do part-time jobs at night or even go and find other kinds of jobs,” Cho added.

Eoh Kiy-ku, said the estimated value of North Korea's untapped minerals as of the end of 2016 is 14 times more than 230 trillion won for South Korea. The North has signed 38 contracts with foreign companies to develop the mineral mines ranging from gold and silver to coal, of which 33 are with Chinese firms, according to the agency. The others are divided among companies from Japan, which have two contracts, France, also two, and Switzerland, which has one. All of the 10 long-term contracts, effective for between 10 to 50 years, are with Chinese companies, the report said.South Korea is barred from the business under sanctions imposed in 2010 as a punitive measure for the North's torpedo attack of the corvette Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors.According to the report, South Korean firms had invested $41.95 million in North Korea's mineral development, but most of the projects have been suspended.KORES had invested $6.65 million and retrieved about $244,221, the report said.","trillion won 79 trillion ,worth some 200 trillion ,some 200 trillion won ,trillion worth of mineral ,won 79 trillion","['North Korea', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Resources Corp.', 'Eoh kiy - ku', ""North Korea 's""]",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.42352909  0.10578675

Tillerson is making his second visit in office to the world's No. 2 economy and chief American rival for influence in Asia, and increasingly, the world. He is scheduled to meet Saturday with top Chinese officials including senior foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi, Foreign Minister Wang Yi and President Xi Jinping. Relations between Beijing and Washington are seen as more crucial than ever with the standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles entering a new, dangerous phase as its leader, Kim Jong Un, and Trump exchange personal insults and threats of war with no sign of a diplomatic solution. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang on Friday said talks would center on ``issues regarding the improvement of bilateral ties, President Trump's visit to China within the year as invited by President Xi, and international and regional issues of common concerns.''Trump has been pressing for tougher measures on Pyongyang from China, the North's chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support. Although adamantly opposed to measures that could bring down Kim's regime, Beijing appears increasingly willing to tighten the screws in agreeing to tough new United Nations sanctions that would substantially cut foreign revenue for the isolated North. On Thursday, Beijing ordered North Korean-owned businesses and ventures with Chinese partners to close by early January, days after it said it would cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products, effective Jan. 1. It made no mention of crude oil, which makes up the bulk of Chinese energy supplies to North Korea and is not covered by the UN sanctions.China has also banned imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ore, and seafood since early September.Still, Washington hopes China will exert even greater pressure, even while Beijing says the impasse can't be solved by sanctions alone and calls on Washington to cool its rhetoric and open dialogue with Pyongyang.Other than North Korea, the US and China have other security concerns to address. They remain at odds over Beijing's military buildup and assertive claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea.Tillerson is also expected to restate concerns about China's massive trade surplus with the US -- $347 billion last year -- and what American companies say are unfair barriers to investment, including pressure to hand over their technology. Washington wants Beijing to make good on its promise to let market forces have a bigger role in its economy, give equal treatment to foreign and Chinese companies and roll back state industry's dominance.Tillerson will also be laying the groundwork for Trump's planned visit to China in November that will come just weeks after Xi is expected to receive a new five-year term as leader of the ruling Communist Party. Despite his tough criticism of China's trade practices, Trump has forged a personal connection with Xi over phone calls and while hosting him at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in April, where they agreed on four high-level dialogues to cover various aspects of relations. In a prelude to his trip to Beijing, Trump met Thursday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong, who was attending the inaugural dialogue on people-to-people ties in Washington.The November meeting of the two leaders will be grander and more choreographed than the informal talks in Florida that were most memorable for Trump's ordering a missile strike on Syria and then informing Xi about it afterward as they ate chocolate cake.Tillerson, facing criticism at home for his muted impact as the top U.S. diplomat, may also be seeking to put his own stamp on the relationship. He surprised some observers during his first official visit to China in March when he employed China's own words to characterize relations between the sides _ language the Obama administration had largely rejected as an attempt by Beijing to establish a type of moral parity between the sides. While Chinese state media hailed that as a breakthrough in relations, observers questioned whether the move had been intentional or whether Tillerson, who was traveling with only a small group of relatively inexperienced advisers, had simply been underprepared for his meetings.","in beijing on saturday ,donald trump in november ,beijing on saturday for ,saturday with top chinese ,beijing on saturday","['BEIJING', 'US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'Donald Trump', 'Tillerson', 'american', 'chinese']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.93719977  0.81310475

Kim, deprived but determined to succeed, worked countless odd jobs to pay for his tuition and living expenses when he entered university in the early 2000s. Eager to escape menial work, he launched an online advertising company after finishing his military service. The enterprise took off propitiously, and Kim made the bold decision to get out of his comfort zone and enter a conglomerate for more experience. He eventually landed in Silicon Valley in 2012. “In the beginning, I was the typical Asian outlier in the fast-paced entrepreneurial core of Silicon Valley. But following the release of singer Psy’s global hit ‘Gangnam Style,’ everyone wanted to get up close and personal with me,” the founder and chief executive officer of Diocian, a company offering networking services to fledgling musicians worldwide, told a seminar audience on Sept. 18. “People started perceiving Korea and Koreans as ‘cool,’ ‘exciting’ and ‘glamorous.’ It was only then I realized the power of content in human relationships that could be applied to business as well.”  Organizers, speakers and students pose at the ASEAN-Korea Youth Forum designed to foster entrepreneurship at Seoul City Hall on Sept. 18 Kim was one of three keynote speakers at the ASEAN-Korea Youth Forum, an annual event designed to foster global entrepreneurship and empower young people of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Korea and elsewhere. Organized by the ASEAN-Korea Center in Seoul, the event is annually held at the Seoul City Hall, and was co-hosted this year with the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Science and Technology Policy Institute and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific’s subregional office for East and Northeast Asia. The conference was also supported by the ASEAN Secretariat, Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Hanwha Dreamplus.Relying on his conviction, Kim established Diocian in 2013 to link artists with 45 music channels -- notably iTunes, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Soribada, Kakao Music, Melon, Line Music and Awa Music -- in 80 countries around the world. With offices in Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the United States and plans for expansion into China, Thailand, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, Diocian takes charge of the whole commercialization process, from networking artists and partners to marketing and sales. The company allows artists to communicate with fans and share information, and profits are shared between artists and the company online. “Within every crisis lies new opportunities,” he highlighted in front of some 200 university students of various nationalities. “Had my father’s business gone well through the 1997 crisis, I would not have created my own advertising company. Had I been content as a salaryman in a big company, I would not be standing here today.”The key to spawning untapped opportunities in the whirlwind of uncertainty is to take concrete steps of finding a person who can help solve problems step by step, the entrepreneur advised. “There is always a way out of a quandary. Don’t be overly concerned by money, language difficulties and other obstacles. If you leap over these hurdles, brand new possibilities and horizons will appear in sight.” Kim Doo-hwan, the founder and chief executive officer of Diocian, a company offering networking services to fledgling musicians worldwide He also encouraged the students to experience the world as much as possible while they are still young, stressing that global exposure would widen their range of vision.As for his future goals, Kim told The Korea Herald that he has set his eyes on investing in 10 countries by 2020 and guiding his company through its initial public offering.Other speakers were Penny Low, the president and founder of Social Innovation in Singapore, who shared her career insights gleaned from undertaking socially benefiting innovation projects; and Mohammad Fitri Othman, CEO of TaniMac, a firm producing ergonomic agricultural tools. Following the talks, teams of students presented their business proposals in front of the speakers, who acted as judges. Proposals included a mobile application providing location-specific matching services between international travelers and locals; software designed to maximize efficiency in sustainable waste management in Southeast Asia using geographic data; a biochemical solution for sustainable agriculture; and a mobile service designed to incentivize the use of public transit and bicycles in Seoul. “Youth entrepreneurship is a key concept for ASEAN, as it aims for a socially responsible community,” said ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary-General Kim Young-sun. “We are living in a world far more complex than the one I grew up in. Part of what makes it so complicated is the entrepreneurialism of young bright minds like you. We need you to discover your ambitions, inspirations and desires to creatively figure out how to better live our lives and share our new prosperity with people around the world.” ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary-General Kim Young-sun Dr. Song Jong-guk, president of the Science and Technology Policy Institute, said, “In the era of the ‘fourth industrial revolution,’ entrepreneurship is the key determinant of job creation and driving force of economic growth. To resolve today’s problems of youth unemployment worldwide, it is essential to support the discovery and incubation of startups, which gave birth to the likes of Uber and Airbnb.”Kim Chang-beom, ambassador for international relations at the Seoul Metropolitan Government, underscored the importance South Korea attaches to ASEAN, signaled by President Moon Jae-in’s dispatching of Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon to the region as his special envoy in late May. “Through Mayor Park’s visit to ASEAN earlier this year as a special envoy, I was able to confirm my belief that Korea’s future lies in ASEAN and ASEAN’s prosperity can go hand in hand with Korea’s future,” Kim said. Noting that the ASEAN bloc has become Korea’s second-largest trade partner after China, with the two sides working to increase their bilateral trade to $200 billion by 2020, the envoy said that more than 300,000 ASEAN nationals live and work in Korea, crucially contributing to its economy and society. The Seoul government has actively devised and implemented innovative initiatives and policies to tackle youth unemployment, he said, citing the Seoul Youth Policy Network, Seoul Youth Volunteer Scheme and Youth Allowance Program, as well as various special housing programs for youths and students.By Joel Lee","father business was teetering ,the asian financial crisis ,entrepreneurs share secrets ,2000s eager to escape ,online advertising company after","['Kim Doo - hwan', 'asian', 'Kim']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64830786  0.74337053

Union workers of major South Korean broadcasters KBS and MBC are participating in the strike in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul to call for the networks' top management to step down for allegedly influencing news coverage to be in favor of former conservative administrations.During the Lee administration, which ended in 2013, the NIS allegedly pressured public broadcasting companies to send out biased information in support of conservatives under the leadership of former NIS chief Won Sei-hoon. Won was recently sentenced to four years in prison for his role in the agency’s covert cyber operation aimed to bolster the political base of conservatives and to support former President Park Geun-hye’s election campaign. The NIS Reform Committee -- a body launched by President Moon Jae-in to tackle irregularities committed under the Lee and Park administrations -- has also claimed that the spy agency engaged in a smear campaign on social media against left-wing Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon in the 2011 mayoral election. Seoul Mayor Park filed a complaint last week against Lee, saying that the former president masterminded the NIS’ political interference and the spy agency’s role in creating the blacklist. Regarding the complaint, prosecutors are expected to summon Won -- and possibly Lee -- to question them over the scandal. The NIS internal task force also found that its former chief Won allegedly headed the spy agency’s compilation of a blacklist of reporters, producers, artists and cultural figures critical of the government and peddled influence in human resources.The blacklist came to light in the wake of an investigation into the corruption scandal that led to the ouster of former President Park.Amid the scandal, labor unions of Korean Broadcasting Service and Munhwa Broadcasting Co. are taking their own action, calling for the CEOs of the two companies, who are accused of colluding with the NIS to discriminate against dissenting employees, to step down.By Bak Se-hwan","media blacklist state prosecutors ,an investigation this week ,blacklist state prosecutors ,expands to media blacklist ,intelligence service blacklisted media","['the National Intelligence Service', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'NIS', 'Lee']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59980083  0.19369011

Noh Woong-rae of the ruling Democratic Party, who works on the Education, Culture, Sports, and Tourism Committee of the National Assembly, said the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee in April amended its code to allow for commuting of the sentences of officials convicted of any of four major offenses -- embezzlement or breach of duty, school admission corruption related with sports, a crime of violence or sexual assault, or match-fixing.Following the revision, 24 officials applied for a pardon and five of them saw their lifetime bans reduced to reprimands or five-year suspension, according to Roh. Those who avoided lifetime bans included a former Korea Swimming Federation vice president who was found guilty of receiving bribes from construction firms for the Gwangju Summer Universiade and other officials who pocketed money during national team selections. This file photo, taken on Aug. 29, 2017, shows a board meeting of the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee at the National Training Center in Seoul. Roh claimed that officials close to current KSOC President Lee Kee-heung, who previously headed the KSF, benefited the most. Roh also called on the sports ministry to conduct an audit on the KSOC.The KSOC, however, denied that commuting punishments has anything to do with Lee or its board, saying that the decision was made by an independent committee promoting fair play. The KSOC also said in addition to former KSF executives, officials from other sports received pardons after they went through the committee's screening.","convicted swimming execs lawmaker ,swimming executives convicted ,convicted swimming execs ,on convicted swimming execs ,punishments on convicted swimming","[""South Korea 's"", 'Noh Woong - rae', 'Democratic Party', 'the Education , Culture , Sports', 'Tourism Committee of the National Assembly', 'the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54532343 -0.03866779

How do I look?” reads a caption across a moving photo slide of a young child who appeared to be attending primary school. The expandable comment thread below the video rolls out: “Honestly, you’re ugly,” “I’ll buy the pair of eyes that haven’t seen this face ,” “You should take this video down,” and “This will become your worst history.” The face-evaluation videos are called “eolpyeong” in Korean, translating from an acronym of “eolgul”  and “pyeongga” . A related keyword search yields more than 20,000 results on YouTube as of Thursday. According to The Herald Business report, the face-evaluation videos started to pop up four to five years ago on Afreeca TV, the country’s biggest video streaming platform. As some famous Afreeca TV’s streamers switched to YouTube and more audiences flocked to enjoy the US video platform, the number of face-evaluation videos went up, especially involving children. Experts said children tend to view the face-evaluation videos as a light-hearted game, while revealing their desire to become famous overnight through social media.","attending primary school youtube ,for fun on youtube ,by strangers on youtube ,fun on youtube despite ,youtube despite concerns growing","['korean', 'YouTube']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18845372  0.00510501

The complaint comes a day after local tabloids ran stories about the only child of Kim Kwang-seok, Seo-yeon, who died in 2007 at the age of 16. Some of the reports speculated the death may not be accidental, as she was the legal inheritor of her father's estate, including copyrights to his music.Lee Sang-ho, a TV journalist and documentary film director, filed the complaint against Kim's widow, only identified by her surname Seo. He accused her of not informing Kim's family of her daughter's death while they were in a legal battle over the ownership of copyrights to his music and albums.  This file photo, taken April 1, 2016, shows a picture of late folk rock singer Kim Kwang-seok at an exhibition held in commemoration of him and his music in Seoul. Lee's lawyer declined to give further details on the complaint, only saying that it's related to the younger Kim's death being a possible homicide. Lee has also requested a ban on Seo leaving the country, the lawyer said.Police closed the daughter's case as accidental, based on the autopsy that concluded her death was caused by acute pneumonia, with no signs of external injuries. The top court ruled in 2008 the daughter holds the rights to the singer's estate. Seo became the legal inheritor of Kim's assets after their daughter died and now owns all the copyrights and neighboring copyrights to his music.The singer Kim committed suicide in 1996, when he was 32. His death sent shock waves through fans and the public, who loved his plaintive yet captivating vocals and sentimental lyrics that critics say portrayed individuals' sorrow and frustration at a time when the society was struggling in its early stage of democracy following rapid industrialization. The reporter, who has undertaken a probe of his own into Kim's death, has insisted Kim did not kill himself. He alleges Seo and her brother, who has a long rap sheet, were involved in the case.","folk rock singer daughter ,singer daughter news reporter ,rock singer teenage daughter ,rock singer daughter news ,prosecutors on thursday seeking",['Kim Kwang - seok'],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39746392  0.51828098

They also noted that the series of missile and nuclear tests may have been based on the regime’s calculated timeline and that the regime would not halt its endeavors until it can exert concessions from the US in a one-on-one negotiation. Despite the United Nations’ new sanctions, the North on Friday fired another missile that flew over Japan. Earlier this month, it conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test and test-fired its first intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. “North Korea is strongly convinced about what they are doing,” said Shin Won-sik, a retired three-star general who served as a top operational strategist at Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. “It will continuously step on the accelerator until it achieves the goal.” Pedestrians walk in front of a large video screen in Tokyo broadcasting a news report showing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, following a North Korean missile test that passed over Japan on Friday. The North’s continued show of defiance is ultimately designed to enhance its leverage in negotiation with the United States and exert concessions such as the US' recognition of it as a legitimate nuclear power and withdrawing US troops from South Korea, said Kim Yeon-chul, a professor at Inje University. “The current accelerated pace of provocations can be understood in the context of North Korea’s belief that it can strike a deal with the US only after accomplishing its nuclear ambition,” he said. On Wednesday, a day after the UN adopted new sanctions against North Korea’s sixth nuclear test, Pyongyang vowed to continue developing weapons, saying it will puruse the current path “at a faster pace without  slightest diversion until this fight to the end is over.” “I suspect Kim Jong-un also thinks he is running out of time,” said Cha Doo-hyeon, a senior analyst at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.  Faced with pressure to acquire reliable ICBM technology and concern over toughening UN sanctions, Kim Jong-un might have decided to accelerate  efforts to field nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles on the front line as soon as possible, Cha added. North Korea’s leader Kim had laid out his goal of achieving his nuclear ambition within the year. In a New Year’s statement, Kim said the regime is “in the final stages” of perfecting ICBM technology.  North Korea appears to have succeed in developing a powerful nuclear warhead to be fitted into ballistic missiles. Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, commander of Strategic Command, said Thursday he assumes the Sept. 3 nuclear test by North Korea involved a hydrogen bomb. “When I look at a thing that size, I as a military officer assume that it’s a hydrogen bomb,” Hyten said, while adding that he was not in a position to confirm it. As head of Strategic Command, the general would be in charge of all elements of the US nuclear force in the event of a nuclear war.Despite the North’s claim that it has acquired a reliable re-entry vehicle, doubts persist over whether the communist regime has secured the technology that can protect its nuclear warhead from extreme heat and pressure when entering the atmosphere.

The annual award, which kicked off in 2010, honors individuals who “best exemplify ‘global citizenship’ through their unique contributions toward improving the state of the world,” the institute said in its press release. “I see the award is not my personal feat, but is given to all South Korean citizens who have secured democracy through the revolutionary candlelight vigils. I thank our citizens and would like to share the honor,” President Moon was quoted as saying by presidential spokesman Kwon Hyuk-ki. President Moon will attend the award ceremony on Tuesday in New York. He is scheduled to visit the US city from Sept. 18-22 to attend the UN General Assembly. Two other recipients, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Chinese pianist and philanthropist Lang Lang will also be present at the event with President Moon, the institute said. The Atlantic Council said it recognized President Moon’s life-long dedication to the advocacy of human rights and democracy through his achievements as a human rights lawyer, and his efforts to defuse tensions with North Korea and contribute to regional stability. On its website, the council described President Moon’s life before he entered politics, as a human rights lawyer actively defending dissidents. It also explained that he is implementing strong reform policies to eradicate deep-rooted problems and is making efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis.As for Trudeau the think tank cited his “visionary leadership” for universal freedom, diversity, and open trade policies as the reason for the award.

Kim doubles as deputy prime minister for social affairs. Education Minister Kim Sang-gon  holds a meeting with other ministers and officials from related government agencies to discuss measures against rising juvenile crime in Seoul on Sept. 12, 2017. Juvenile crimes have surfaced as a pressing issue since video footage of a middle school girl bleeding profusely after being attacked by a group of her peers in the southern city of Busan went viral early this month. Many other similar cases were revealed later, including one in which a high school girl in the eastern city of Gangneung was brutally assaulted by her peers in July.The extreme violence sent shockwaves through the country as the media reported that the young assailants shared the beating via social media and exchanged messages that suggested they were amused by their actions. ""The recent peer violence cases are too cruel for us to deal with as simple juvenile crimes. It is important that we draw up effective measures to prevent a recurrence of such cases,"" Kim said.The officials noted that a lot of the juvenile delinquents who committed these crimes have dropped out of school and run away from home, and many of them are copying what they have seen in movies. Secondary damage caused by social media attention and cyberbullying as a result of these videos becoming public must also be considered, they said.Kim called on the justice ministry to consider the revision of laws related to juvenile crimes and step up correctional programs for those on probation to prevent repeat crimes. On Monday, President Moon Jae-in called for discussion of the revision of juvenile crime law, as young criminals are subject to light punishment under the current legal system.","an urgent meeting tuesday ,meeting tuesday to tackle ,teens top south korean ,urgent meeting tuesday ,public outrage education minister","['south korean', 'Kim Sang - gon', 'Kim', 'Kim Sang - gon']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38916141  0.39117256

They were among a total of 20,000 respondents in an initial survey conducted to select the jury.The jury will hold its first meeting on Saturday for an orientation session. After spending a month familiarizing themselves with the pros and cons of the project, they will spend three days together in a camp for final debates from Oct. 13-15. Three surveys will be conducted on the jury before, during and at the end of the camp. Based on the results, the commission will unveil its recommendation on Oct. 20.Ending the project was one of Moon's campaign promises. But rather than carrying out the pledge, Moon said he would first seek public opinion on his idea and formed the independent commission to collect that public opinion. The proposal to scrap the reactors' construction sparked heated debate in a country that relies on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity. Proponents say the country should phase out nuclear power for safety and environmental reasons, but opponents say it will lead to a shortage in the power supply and a spike in electricity bills.","nuclear reactors 500 member ,of nuclear reactors 500 ,nuclear reactors 500 ,reactors 500 member jury ,reactors 500 member","['Moon Jae - in', 'Ulsan']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.11571237  0.52763444

He also said that ministers in charge of social affairs should take up the issue.""Even if it is discussed in a social affairs ministers' meeting, we also need to collect sufficient views from the public,"" Moon said.

Park Joo-sun of the minor opposition People's Party by the foreign office. The figure is almost on par with the corresponding number of 8,482 tallied for all of 2016, the lawmaker said. The analysis on Internet IP addresses that attempted the cyberattacks showed that a considerable portion of them came from China. The cyberattacks detected from the neighboring country stood at 4,509, accounting for 75 percent of all attempted cyber penetrations. The percentage has risen sharply from 54.7 percent in 2016.  This photo, filed on April 11, 2017, shows the foreign ministry building in central Seoul. South Korea and China have lock horns over the deployment of a US anti-missile system on the Korean Peninsula, since Seoul and Washington agreed to the plan last year. Beijing has slammed the decision for threatening its own security interests, while the two allies have said it is only to counter North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile threats. Last week, Seoul's military announced the completion of the stationing of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here, a few days after Pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. President Moon Jae-in defended the deployment Friday, saying it was an inevitable decision to protect the people and country from a belligerent North. Since taking office in May, he had held back from completing the deployment, a decision made by his predecessor Park Geun-hye and her government, citing environmental concerns.","attempted hackings from china ,cyberattack attempts from china ,hackings from china ,hackings from china in ,china this year south","[""South Korea 's"", 'China', 'Park Joo', ""People 's Party""]",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.83263993  0.69060081

98,98,[Eye] The guilt of a South Korean cram school mogul,"In the 1990s, Son Joo-eun was a much sought-after tutor offering only a select few affluent students tips on how to score well in the national college exam.

Having grown up poor and landed a place at the elite Seoul National University, he easily took home 50 million won  from his tutoring work, enough to buy a standard two-bed room house in Seoul back then, each month. The life of the star hagwon teacher soon got on a fast track to fame and fortune.Son Joo-eun, head of MegaStudy In 2000, he founded an online cram school, MegaStudy, offering test-prep courses to a much wider audience. The venture, which started off with five staff and an initial paid-in capital of 300 million won, became an instant sensation among students and parents, bringing him success that he had never imagined.  “I’d earned money by taking advantage of the country’s obsession with college diplomas,” Son, now 56, said in his super-spacious office at MegaStudy’s headquarters in Seoul. Deep inside, there has always been a sense of guilt, Son said, that he is capitalizing on cruelty that pushes young students into long hours of afterschool study and fierce competition to enter top universities. Businesswise, MegaStudy’s early success is case study material. In 2004, MegaStudy debuted on the Kosdaq, a tech-focused secondary bourse. In the years that followed, the firm’s market capitalization peaked at a whopping 2.5 trillion won. Investors loved Son’s venture as a textbook case that turned the country’s obsession with education and a high internet penetration rate into a perfect business opportunity. The business has since taken a downward turn, as competition thickened and saturation neared in the online test-prep services market. MegaStudy’s market cap has dropped almost ten-fold to stand at 126 billion won Friday. Son stepped aside from the company’s management and the cram school business as a whole in 2014, though he still remains on the board of directors as chairman and is the firm’s No. 1 shareholder with over 26 percent of shares.Now, he is a champion of education reform. Cramming won’t prepare today’s students for the AI-focused “fourth industrial revolution,” he believes.“The time has passed when test scores determined a student’s life and career path,” Son said. “In the future, they won’t determine anything nor do they guarantee any of the lucrative jobs they had before. In fact, jobs are disappearing fast, with robots replacing human input,” he said. Schools and private education businesses must adopt creative, innovative teaching, breaking away from the old model that focuses on written tests, he said. “Society is already dramatically shifting to a stage where creativity, deep understanding of human nature and connectivity are values sought in young talent since only with those humans can beat the artificial intelligence,” he said. Korean students, still locked in the old system of public schools and private educational institutes, may face challenges in the future, since they have never been taught how to innovate, focusing instead on high test scores and memorization skills, Son warned. The education mogul says he regrets the way he found success and wants to give back to society. Last year, he established a 30 billion won foundation to support young entrepreneurs and startups. The Yoonmin Foundation, named after his daughter, who died in a car accident in 1991, helps innovative minds to turn their ideas into real business. This year, 500 individuals and groups applied for the grant.   “We need a change in mindset to support more innovative activities by young people,” Son said. “Even with a simple, creative idea that doesn’t catch the eyes of investors, they can knock at our door for support.” As for the cram school business, Son predicts a very grim future. With innovation becoming an integral part across industries, the society will see an advent of new jobs that combine both in-demand skills and new, creative ideas, something Son said can never be taught at cram schools. Son added that the private education market will have to develop a new, sustainable business model to survive. Many parents and observers think test-prep services will have a market here as long as the country’s obsession with top universities remain, but Son believes otherwise. At least the days of a factory-like, large-scale cram schools are gone, he stressed. “Schools and colleges alike have long favored elitism that spurs competition. In the race, rich families that can spare more resources for their kids have an upper hand,” Son said, stressing that it is now time to change that. “We are talking about a business here, but it is also important to acknowledge that what we sell in the market partly shapes kids’ educational environment. We need to have a sense of responsibility and prepare to take on new roles in the rapidly changing educational paradigm.”By Bak Se-hwan","korean cram school mogul ,elite seoul national university ,home 50 million won ,few affluent students tips ,the star hagwon teacher","['Seoul National University', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41126794  0.30388218

But in the process, there should be no workers disadvantaged. Society should choose between improving the quality of irregular jobs or just sticking to the old paradigm of permanent jobs, he said. ""The diversification of work forms tends to disadvantage those working in nonstandard forms,” Ryder said in Seoul, citing part-time workers suffering from disadvantages in salaries, social protection and pensions as an example. “If irregular workers suffer inferior working conditions and precariousness, we should be acting,” he said. “But that’s not to say all types of diversifications of work forms by definition are bad.”“A balance has to be struck between the needs so that all workers are given protection and opportunities of decent work. There is no right or wrong in this. People need to come together and find solutions,” he said. “That’s why social dialogue is important in Korea.”Ryder, who took office in 2012 as the ILO’s chief for a five-year term and was re-elected to head the UN agency until 2022, was in Korea for a four-day visit this week to meet with President Moon Jae-in, the nation’s trade unions and attend a forum on job creation hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The solutions to tackle inequality in the labor market could involve a hike in the minimum wage or an increase in union membership rates, he said.South Korea raised the minimum wage for 2018 by 16.4 percent from this year, which Ryder called “encouraging.”  ILO Director-General Guy Ryder “Only 10 percent of union density , that is a challenge. I think it is fair to say that trade unions -- they need to have their eyes open and feel a responsibility for the entirety of the labor force,” he said. Trade unions need to reach out to workers, especially irregular workers and unemployed ones “beyond their membership,” he noted.The two biggest umbrella labor unions -- the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and Korean Confederation of Trade Unions -- only represented about 10 percent of all Korean workers as of 2016, according to government data. Just 1 in 10 union members are irregular workers.There have been growing concerns over polarization of the labor market in Korea in which irregular workers face job insecurity and poor working conditions, while their duties are the same as permanent employees.According to data from the Ministry of Labor and Employment, the number of irregular employees stands at 6.15 million, making up 32 percent of the entire labor force as of June 2016. The average wage for irregular workers stands at 12,076 won  per hour, about 66 percent of that of regular workers. While 98 percent of regular employees are covered under four main social insurance schemes, including health and occupational accident insurances, irregular workers were less likely to be covered. South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in has strived to root out irregular work in the country, vowing to gradually endow regular status for all irregular workers in the public sector to lay the groundwork for private firms to do the same. Ryder said he sees an “opportunity” under the Moon administration to see improvements in labor conditions, citing his meeting with Moon that he said was “constructive” and “useful.”“In the conversation with Moon, the president reiterated his commitment to proceeding ratification of ILO conventions. I offered full support of ILO, technical support and any information we could provide to help the process forward,” he said, referring to two of the core conventions -- the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention  and Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention .“The reason Korea should ratify these conventions is because they do define human rights at work,” he said. “It is not a difficult job, but a matter of political will.”His remark comes in line with growing calls for the legal status of South Korea‘s outlawed teachers and public servants unions. Their rights to organize have long been denied by the Labor Ministry because they included terminated workers as members.He also said that the country’s migrant employment scheme should be re-examined to prevent discrimination against foreign workers in terms of wages and conditions. “When workers are restricted to an employer, that is a problem,” he said, referring to the Employment Permit System that bans workers from freely changing workplaces without employers’ consent. Human rights activists have called on the government to discard the EPS, which was introduced to fill low-skilled jobs shunned by locals in the manufacturing, farming and fishing industries, calling it a “modern-day slavery.” Last month, a Nepalese worker, who had worked at a car parts factory, took his own life allegedly because he was not able to leave or change his workplace despite harsh working conditions, By Ock Hyun-ju","reporters wednesday ilo director ,society must decide whether ,interview time to decide ,innovation and society must ,society must decide","['nonregular', 'the International Labor Organization', 'Guy Ryder']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68039715  0.93786925

""I ask you to stage strong measures to eradicate corruption in both the public and private sectors to an extent where the people can actually feel the change,"" he added, according to pool reports.The meeting marked the fifth of its kind that were designed to brief the new president on key policy objectives of government offices.

The discussions session were scheduled to last until Thursday, involving a different set of government ministries and agencies each day.

The agency explained that France, Bulgaria, Peru and Mexico have scaled back or expelled some of the North's diplomatic staff on their soil with Kuwait having recently joined them, according to Rep. Lee Wan-young of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, who attended the briefing.  ""Some Middle Eastern states have restricted the new import of North Korean labor, while some Southeast Asian countries have urged their nationals to refrain from traveling to the North,"" the NIS reported.Commenting on the North's launches on Saturday of projectiles, the NIS said that chances are high that they were short-range ballistic missiles.In the first provocation in a month, the North fired three projectiles into the East Sea. The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae initially presumed that they were from a new 300-mm multiple artillery rocket launch system -- a claim that triggered speculation it was trying to downplay it to help create momentum for dialogue with the North.The NIS also said that Pyongyang has completed preparations for another nuclear test at tunnel 2 and 3 at its Punggye-ri test site.During the briefing, the NIS noted that the North's technology to produce the reentry vehicle for its proclaimed intercontinental ballistic missile is at a ""low"" level.The assessment was based on its analysis of a photo, which the North's state media released in its report on the North's leader Kim Jong-un's recent visit to the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defense Sciences. On the possibility of additional provocations, the NIS predicted that the North could launch another ballistic missile during the remainder of the ongoing South Korea-US military exercise set to end Thursday or in time for its regime's foundation on Sept. 9.","toughened international sanctions against ,fatigue over toughened international ,impoverished state seoul spy ,monday during parliamentary briefing ,growing public fatigue over","['North Korea', 'Seoul', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'european', 'latin american']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23010288  0.13198467

The plan, consisting of three sub-packages, is to benefit a total of 130,000 residents between the ages of 18 to 34, who work more than 36 hours a week for SMEs headquartered in the province....","Gyeonggi Province plans to give cash subsidies to young people working for small- and medium- enterprises as early as this year, in a bid to tackle chronic labor shortages in the SME sector as well as soaring youth unemployment. The plan, consisting of three sub-packages, is to benefit a total of 130,000 residents between the ages of 18 to 34, who work more than 36 hours a week for SMEs headquartered in the province.  Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil“The new policy will support the long-term employment of SME workers and help attract a fresh batch of laborers into the SME sector,” said Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil during a press conference held earlier this year to unveil the measures. The governor noted that the main goal of the measures is to alleviate the wage gap between SMEs and big companies -- the key reason why young workers shun SME jobs and SME employers fail to retain talent.According to a recent study by the Korea Small Business Institute, the average pay of SME workers in manufacturing is just 54.9 percent of what their peers in big companies earn. Among the three packages, the monthly subsidy plan entails provision for up to two years of 300,000 won  directly to 20,000 workers whose monthly wage is 2 million won or less. This is 7.2 million won in total per person, translating to at least a 15 percent increase in salary, Gyeonggi officials explained. The province will establish a welfare credit point system that enables recipients, numbering 100,000, to collect bonuses worth 800,000 won to 1.2 million won per year, as SME jobs tend to lack in fringe benefits. In addition, the province plans to introduce a special pension program for SME workers, on top of the existing retirement pension scheme. The 10-year program will have subscribers pay 100,000 won to 300,000 won into the fund every month, which will be matched by the same amount of contribution from the province. Subscribers for this 10-year pension plan are limited at 10,000 who earn less than 2.5 million won per month. Beneficiaries of these three programs will be selected based on their income level. A worker cannot apply for more than one program. “These policies will help strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs, which will then lead to new quality jobs for workers. It would create a virtuous circle,” Nam stressed. Province officials said the three measures are designed to address the crippling factors in the SME employment as much as possible -- low pay, long hours and a lack of employment benefits. Without measures on these factors, a job policy won’t fix the SME job mismatch. The province will establish a special unit to oversee the program’s successful implementation. Nam said the new job policy signals a shift in Gyeonggi’s welfare approach from universal welfare to “targeted” welfare. He stressed with the South Korean population greying rapidly and an anticipated hike in welfare demand, universal welfare should be replaced by a more efficient model that can reduce fiscal burden. The Moon Jae-in administration has been making efforts to invigorate the SME industry by setting up a new ministry dedicated to supporting smaller companies and creating more jobs in July, as part of its five-year policy road map. The average monthly wage of SME workers stood at 3.23 million won in 2016, or 62.9 percent of 5.13 million won paid to employees working for large enterprises, showed a report by the think tank Korea Small Business Institute. The ratio of long-term unemployed people to the total jobless in South Korea reached an 18-year high in July, according to Statistics Korea in August.By Jung Min-kyung","soaring youth unemployment ,province plans cash subsidies ,soaring youth unemployment the ,youth unemployment the plan ,as soaring youth unemployment","['Gyeonggi Province', 'SME']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45487794 -0.04019091

Pyongyang said it was granting his release for ""medical reasons.""Says he 'never preached'Lim told CBC he had ""never preached"" in North Korea, emphasizing that his many trips to the country were purely for humanitarian reasons, notably to deal with a nursing home and an orphanage founded by his church.

Marymond“I first bought Marymond’s phone case because it was pretty. But by purchasing the product that is designed based on the former sex slaves’ paintings, I felt good to support victims through my consumption,” said 26-year-old Lee Chae-yoon. Marymond started six years ago as a way to help restore the dignity of the victims, euphemistically called comfort women, who were forced to work at frontline brothels for the Japanese army. Its products range from stationery to water bottles and smartphone cases. A bracelet attached with a small charm of a girl statue -- a symbol of comfort women -- is sold at 12,000 won , while an eco-bag with simple Marymond logo is 10,000 won. Proceeds from the sale goes into a fund to care for the 37 surviving victims and to establish a sex slavery museum.“The fact that the product doesn’t explicitly say ‘I support military sex slaves’ makes it more stylish and fashionable,” said college student Kim Ha-yeon, who recently joined the list of people who support victims by using Marymond’s products. Marymond saw a tenfold jump in sales to 4 billion won in 2016. Its customers include A-list celebrities such as Suzy and Park Bo-gum. Following the recent growth, over 585 million won was delivered to the victims’ shelter last year. The company’s success is not just driven by public interest in the unsolved issue, a long-standing thorn in Korea-Japan relations, but also reflects the rise of “conscious” consumption, experts say. “Buying a product from the company that cares about the community makes people feel good and proud to sport the brand. In that sense, it is the charity factor that has caused Marymond to become such a successful one,” said professor Chung Dong-il of Economics from Sookmyung Women’s University. “Also, there is an emotional impact that is attached to buying a product,” he said.Like Marymond, Craftlink sells colorful handmade string bracelets to support over 24,000 single mothers in South Korea who live in the shadows of society. Craftlink“By buying a trendy accessory, consumers can help others. It makes people feel better about their purchase because they are supporting a good cause with their money,” Martin Ko, CEO of Craftlink, told The Korea Herald. The company in 2013 sold bracelets made by single mothers worth 30 million won in 20 days through web portal Naver. Early this year, it launched a complete collection of accessory items to support single moms. “One person, on their own, cannot fundamentally solve or tackle the root of the social problems like the state’s poor support for single mothers, but purchasing a product that is directly connected to their living can have an impact,” Ko said. Experts said social network services drove the popularity of such items, as interested individuals share information about the social value-added items with their like-minded followers. “Young generations are creating their own ways of studying historic issues and supporting social movements,” Professor Seo Kyeong-deok of Sungshin Women’s University said in a recent interview. But there were also concerns over the commercialization of sensitive social and historic issues. “Sales of social value-incorporated products can support those in need and help raise awareness of social issues, but when an issue related to nationalism is combined with commercialism, there is a possibility that product marketing which only sheds light to sensitive and certain historical facts may lead to exclusions and antagonism,” said professor Lee Taek-gwang of Global Communication from Kyung Hee University.By Kim Da-sol","support sex slave victims ,sex slaves paintings felt ,former sex slaves paintings ,sex slaves paintings ,sex slave victims conscious",['Marymond'],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42681098 -0.41338018

The remark, coupled with criticism Ryu failed to act effectively to bring the situation under control, spurred speculation he could be sacked. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon  shakes hands with Ryu Young-jin, minister of food and drug safety, during a policy coordination meeing on Aug. 18, 2017. On Thursday, Lee issued a thinly veiled criticism of Ryu.""With regard to the egg scare, the government is getting a lot of rebuke from the people not only for failing to do enough oversight, but also for failing to carry out its obligation to offer adequate explanations,"" Lee said during an appointment ceremony for vice minister-level officials.""This is a rebuke, not irritation,"" Lee said, sparking laughter from participants.Lee pointed out that Ryu failed to do enough to dispel concern and questions people might have.On Sunday, in an effort to calm public jitters over tainted eggs, Ryu's ministry said that it's safe for adults to consume 2.6 contaminated eggs every day for the rest of their lives. Lee said that the ministry failed to answer follow-up questions, such as why the government is destroying all contaminated eggs if it's safe to consume them.""We have to think about what people would be wondering and what they're concerned about and what they're suspicious about.

The Cold War foes have become ""strategic cooperative partners."" Trade has surged more than 30-fold with human exchanges up nearly 70-fold. Each is among the other's most favorite tourism destinations.  However, the quarter-century anniversary of diplomatic ties is in no celebratory mood, as geopolitics are returning with vengeance amid tensions over North Korea's nuclear arms and the deployment of a US missile shield in South Korea.  The two countries established formal diplomatic ties on Aug. 24, 1992, leaving behind their animosity stemming from the 1950-53 Korean War and the decades-long Cold War. Communist China fought for the North during the conflict.  Despite many ups and downs, the two countries have never stopped going forward and trending stronger as ties have been widened and deepened, especially in economy and business.According to government data, bilateral trade between South Korea and China, which stood at around $6.4 billion in 1992, surged to $211.39 billion in 2016. China has emerged as the largest export destination for South Korea, which sells more than 20 percent of its products to the world's most populous country.Long closed to each other, the tourism market and personnel exchanges have also been boosted thanks to thawed relations. The data provided by the Korea Tourism Organization showed that just about 152,000 people traveled back and forth between the countries in 1993 but the number increased by 69-fold to some 10,428,000 in 2015. Buoyed by the expanded personal exchanges, around 1,170 flights are now available between the two countries every week.The economic ties culminated in December 2015 when the two enforced a free trade agreement intended to phase out tariffs on more than 90 percent of products over a maximum of 20 years. ""It was a win-win to build diplomatic relations,"" said Yun Duk-min, former chancellor of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. ""South Korea has had significant economic benefits, while at the same time Korea served as a bridge for China to come out of the isolation caused by the Tiananmen Square incident. The Korean economy also provided a major model for China."" Jin Jingyi, a professor at Peking University, echoed the view. ""The biggest driving force behind the bilateral ties between China and South Korea was economic exchanges,"" he said. ""In terms of their ties,  have made huge achievements in a very short period of time.""Their diplomatic ties have also been strengthened ever since. In 2008, they upgraded their relations to a strategic cooperative partnership intended to make exchanges go beyond the economy to cooperation in many other areas including security. The ties got a boost especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2013. Xi paid a visit to South Korea in July 2014, a rare trip by a Chinese leader that preceded a trip to its ally North Korea. About a year later, then South Korean President Park Geun-hye went to Beijing and joined a massive military parade, the centerpiece of the 70th anniversary of China's victory over Japan in World War II.This is not to say that the two have never experienced hiccups in ties.A trade dispute in 2000 sparked by South Korea's safeguard action on Chinese garlic to protect its market which was followed by China banning imports of Korean mobile phones and polyethylene products was one of the lowest points. China's push to include an ancient Korean kingdom in its own history still remains a sensitive issue.With Seoul and China set to mark the 25th anniversary of building diplomatic relations next week, however, their ties seem to be put to the test again as the two remain staunchly at odds over the ongoing installation of a US missile defense system in South Korean territory.In July last year, South Korea and the US unveiled their joint plan to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, saying that it is intended to better defend against missiles from North Korea.China has adamantly opposed the move, claiming it is part of the US missile defense system and its powerful X-band radar, in particular, will hurt its strategic security interests. It has intensified what is seen as retaliation against South Korean companies and products in its markets. China has apparently imposed restrictions on travel to Korea and strictly enforced rules on Korean goods including cultural products.Strained ties with China poses a serious threat for South Korea in terms of the economy due to its heavy dependence on the world's largest market. It might be the last thing that South Korea wants at a time when it seeks cooperation from China, the closest ally to North Korea, to resolve the current nuclear stalemate surrounding the Korean Peninsula.""Unlike the disputes over garlic or history, the conflict surrounding the THAAD system is a multilateral issue along which the US and China are sharply conflicting with each other. It will not likely be solved just with time,"" said Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.Chinese officials also expressed concerns over the prolonged dispute over the THAAD system and its ramifications on ties with South Korea. ""The THAAD issue is the most difficult challenge confronting us over the 25 years,"" Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Qiu Guohong said at a forum held in the southern resort island of Jeju on Thursday. ""Many experts on Korea and China are concerned about the current situation.""He, however, expressed hope that things would return to normal as the two countries have strong ""momentum"" and ""basis"" for cooperation. ""What I would like to emphasize is that the two countries have made practical cooperation in diverse areas for the past 25 years and that it has created practical benefits for their people,"" he said. ""It has become a trend that cannot be reversed that South Korea and China will advance their ties in a stable and healthy way and it is what everyone wants.""A senior South Korean diplomat called the recent development caused by the THAAD controversy a ""growing pain,"" saying that it is something that the two countries should overcome to prepare for a better future.""It is like a growing pain for the relations set to mark the 25th anniversary. We should get over the pain no matter what and try to usher in another 25 years of stronger and healthier ties,"" the diplomat said.","most favorite tourism ,korea china mark 25 ,most favorite tourism destinations ,other most favorite tourism ,25 years of improving","['South Korea', 'China']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.69825023  0.45867231

According to Korea Post, the nation’s postal service provider, about 300 citizens lined up in front of the Seoul Central Post Office in Jung-gu, central Seoul, before sales opened at 9 a.m.  People stand in line to purchase commemorative stamps of President Moon Jae-in’s inauguration in front of a post office in Seoul on Thursday. A total of 5 million ceremonial stamps, 500,000 stamp photo sheets and 20,000 stamp albums -- printed with pictures of the president -- went on sale at selected post offices nationwide and at the postal service’s online mall. The online server of Korea Post also crashed in the morning with users trying to access the site to buy the stamps online. Korea Post limited the number of stamp albums per person to one, and stopped online preorders for the albums, making them only available at post offices.Upon noticing high demand through preorders, Korea Post decided to publish an additional 12,000 stamp albums. It is the first time the office is placing a second order for stamps on high demand.“The additional products will be supplied before the end of this month,” an official from the headquarters said. Total sales of the stamps were not revealed as of Thursday afternoon. The stamp album contains pictures of the president’s past life, including his childhood and when he was a presidential aide under the late former President Roh Moo-hyun. The price for one stamp is 330 won, 420 won for the photo sheets and 23,000 won for the stamp album.  Dubbed “Inie goods” or “Moon-tem,” merchandise related to the president have been very popular since he was elected president. From his autobiographical memoir “Moon Jae-in’s Destiny” to a striped shirt he was wearing while making a phone call to US President Donald Trump on Aug. 7, the items have been best-sellers or sold out quickly after they were seen in the media. The Asian edition of the magazine Time, featuring Moon on its cover, sold out even after additional printing in May. The high demand for the official goods reflect positive public sentiment toward the president, who took office after his predecessor, President Park Geun-hye, was ousted and jailed over a corruption scandal. In the latest poll by Realmeter on Thursday, 71.2 percent of 1,006 respondents supported the president, while 22.1 percent expressed disapproval of the leader. When asked about the strengths of the new government in a different Realmeter survey on 9,513 citizens, 23 percent chose his policies that focus on the middle class and the disadvantaged in society. His less authoritarian attitude, open image and attempts to communicate were named as other strengths, with 21.3 percent mentioning his strong will. His promises for a comprehensive reform of society was the third most cited reason, with 18.5 percent. While 33.5 percent said there was nothing being done wrong by the Moon administration, 19.2 percent expressed negativity toward his “stunt pledges.” Another 11.8 percent mentioned his attempts to divide the nation between those in support and against him, while 10.6 percent answered that he lacks the ability to deal with national security and foreign affairs. On portal sites, such as Naver and Daum, the phrase “Thank You, Moon Jae-in,” appeared as the most frequently searched words, Thursday, as his fans sought to show their support online. Eighteen commemorative stamps have been published to celebrate inaugurations since the nation’s first President Rhee Syng-man in 1948. Only the fourth President Yun Po-sun, who led the country from 1960 to 1962 did not publish any ceremonial stamps.By Jo He-rim","stamps celebrating the inauguration ,seoul before sales opened ,liberal leader 100th day ,100th day in office ,thursday morning the liberal","['Moon Jae -', 'Korea Post', 'the Seoul Central Post Office', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22769319  0.56306988

Franciscus Kim Yeon-jun, who has been working to promote the awareness of the selfless service of the two nurses, Marianne Stoeger, 82, and Margareta Pissar, 81, told reporters that the former prime minister ""gladly accepted"" an offer for him to chair the envisioned committee.The government of South Jeolla Province and the archdiocese in the southwestern city of Gwangju have been working together to form the committee expected to comprise about 50 people. The two sides have sought to invite the former prime minister to serve its chairman and First Lady Kim Jung-sook as honorary chairperson. The campaign to nominate the two nurses for the Nobel honor was conceived when current Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon was governor of South Jeolla Province. Lee proposed the campaign after watching a documentary film about the two produced by Rev. Kim.After graduating from nursing college in Austria, Stoeger and Pissar moved to South Korea's southern island of Sorok in 1962 and 1966, separately, after learning that the island was in need of nurses. It had been known and shunned for more than 100 years as a leprosy colony. The two, better known here as Sisters Marianne and Margareta even though they were not ordained, spent the next 40 years working at the National Sorok Island Hospital as volunteer nurses without pay before they returned to their home country in 2005.Rev. Kim, who worked with them on Sorok for about a year before they left Korea, said he was so moved and shocked by their service that he decided to produce the documentary to let the world know of such unprecedented acts.""When they came, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Policies for leprosy patients were even poorer,"" Kim said. ""When they came to Sorok, there were few Korean doctors and nurses and even if there were, they didn't even try to touch patients. But Marianne and Margareta touched affected parts of patients and wiped out pus.""Kim said it must be unprecedented for nurses to volunteer without pay for 40 years.He said that the committee is expected to be launched next month.Kim also proposed offering them official South Korean citizenship in recognition of their service so that they can keep dual citizenship. In 2006, the government offered them honorary citizenship.In June, officials of the South Jeolla provincial government visited the two nurses in Austria. Kim said that Marianne has cancer and Margareta light dementia.""The two nurses spent more than 40 years on Sorok. They are South Korean people. When they were younger, they said they would bury their bones on Sorok,"" Kim said. ""But as they became old, they left saying they don't want to be a burden. We feel ashamed and guilty that we failed to make sure that they live comfortable lives.""","austrian nurses for nobel ,nurses for nobel prize ,nominating two austrian nurses ,nurses for nobel ,two austrian nurses","['Kim Hwang', 'austrian', 'south korean', 'catholic', 'Franciscus Kim Yeon - jun', 'Marianne Stoeger']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7467382   0.54762852

Badrul Alam , a Bangladeshi professor, carries out a research project at Kyungpook National University in the southeastern city of Daegu, in this undated photo released by the Education Ministry. Under a South Korea-funded scholarship program, Alam earned a doctoral degree in agriculture at the South Korean school. The program has given birth to about 3,850 graduates including former Ghanaian Employment and Social Welfare Minister Moses Aduku Asaga and Karl Muller, a mechanical engineer who developed the Masai Barefoot Technology shoe in the late 1990s.Among this year's graduates is Badrul Alam from Bangladesh, who came to South Korea while working as a university professor and earned a doctorate in agriculture at Kyungpook National University.Egyptian student Sofia El Khouly, who is infatuated with Korean calligraphy, received a master's degree in design from Choongang University.Huryk Nicholas Paul, an international student from the United States and a Korean-American adoptee, acquired a master's degree in international development. The program helped him get to know his home country's culture and language better, he said.Choi Young-han, the senior official responsible for international cooperation affairs at the ministry, expected that ""the scholarship students will play a bigger role in promoting friendly relations between their home countries and South Korea as well as in developing their own countries.""","446 foreign scholarship students ,korean schools this month ,414 in graduate courses ,of 446 international students ,446 international students","['South Korea', 'the Education Ministry', 'asian', 'european', 'african']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.25714406  0.9325034

They might have to come to school only for morning classes or even every other day,” said Gim Chae-chun, president of the Korean Educational Development Institute, a research group that develops educational goals, methods and policy solutions for South Korea’s Ministry of Education.“After-school classes and self-study sessions will disappear in future schools,” Gim told The Korea Herald.While at school, students will participate in various learning activities, he said. “For example, in one corner of a classroom, students might be engaged in lessons tailored to their individual needs, interests and pace of learning, with digital gadgets such as smart pads. In another corner, others might be exploring upcoming content on the internet.” Teachers will play different roles as advisers, coaches, and facilitators who help students learn in more self-motivated ways in the future, Gim said.Lee Kyung-ho, head of the Future Education Research Institute, said that smart learning would be the norm.In primary and secondary schools, machine-assisted educational platforms will enable learners to study at their own pace and repeat subjects, courses or chapters that they are struggling with, Lee said. “Traditionally, what teachers found most challenging was meeting the individual demands of students, regardless of a class’ size. New platforms based on AI will change that.” Data on millions of lessons will help identify learning algorithms and the patterns of individual students, suggesting a whole new approach to interacting with students, he added. There are already scoring robots in the market, albeit still in their early stages, with the potential to free teachers from the tedious work of grading and allow them to focus more on in-class activities.   A paradigm shift in education As technology changes, so does the role of education, according to Han You-kyung, an education professor at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University.A new education paradigm will ensure that learning is not to prepare students for one single profession or job skill, but to help them nurture the ability to constantly adapt to changing demands. “It won’t be like just teaching students a set of fixed knowledge with textbooks over a fixed period. It has to be a lifelong learning process more responsive to the future workforce in a way that students can discover their true passions and talents,” Han said. The “fourth industrial revolution” across the world will inevitably change the way we think about work and “make us think more creatively” than ever before. In the course of the transformation, outdated models of learning need to be replaced to cope with the unknown challenges lying ahead, Han added. Some of the challenges are already emerging, says Song Gil-young, executive vice president of AI-based big data analytics company Daumsoft.“Automated robots are already replacing low-skilled humans in various fields of jobs. In less than 50 years, AI machines will be able to beat humans in many intellectual fields, including law and medicine.” The main focus of education, therefore, should be on cultivating students’ competencies to identify and solve problems independently, not on operating machinery or doing basic programming, Gim Chae-chun of KEDI said.“It is difficult to say that South Korean schools are successfully doing the job. It is because Korean education continues to focus more on delivering basic information and knowledge provided by textbooks. Fostering students’ capabilities to identify and solve problems so that they will be better prepared for the rapidly changing job market will be a must,” Gim said. “We also need to change the evaluation system. We need to evaluate students based on whether they have the ability to create something by themselves or to identify and solve problems independently rather than evaluating them with written, multiple-choice tests.”  Will a college diploma still guarantee a better-paying job in the future? Not likely, say the experts. “I believe that the value of college diplomas from famous universities will be gradually depreciated,” Gim said. In future, what’s important is not whether you “possess knowledge. AI will beat humans in that. What is required is “the ability to utilize that knowledge creatively,” he said.By Bak Se-hwan","only for morning classes ,school photo credit 123rfschools ,school only for morning ,for morning classes ,classroom is the future","['Gim Chae - chun', 'the Korean Educational Development']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29566431  0.16887863

The display, organized by the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, began at 8 a.m. and was scheduled to end eight hours and 14 minutes later, which symbolizes Aug. 14.On each of the mini statues was inscribed the name of a victim. The 500 statues represented 239 victims in South Korea and an unidentified number of victims in North Korea.After the display, the council plans to dole out the statues to those who donated 50,000 won  or more to helping victims.The council also plans to hold cultural performances and a fundraising event at the square, one of which will feature a signing by surviving victim Kil Won-ok who has recently released a music album. Earlier in the day, five public buses began service each carrying a girl's statue to commemorate the comfort women day. The traditional Korean folk song, Arirang, is played when the bus passes the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul.Women's groups also planned to hold a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy to denounce an agreement struck between the two countries on resolving the issue. The deal, reached in late 2015, has been deeply unpopular amid criticism that it failed to reflect the voices of the victims. The groups also said they will hold a signature-collecting campaign to call for resolving the issue.Provincial cities also planned to hold ceremonies to unveil more such statues symbolizing comfort women victims, including the southwestern city of Gwangju and the central city of Yongjin.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.","500 statues of girl ,women day civic organizations ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,international comfort women day ,women day civic","['Japan', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.09158066 -0.07153837

They expand the envelope,"" he said.US President Donald Trump has made clear how the US will respond to North Korea's provocations, and hopefully, the regime will understand, Pompeo added.Trump warned last week that North Korea would be met with ""fire and fury"" if it continued to threaten his country. In response, North Korea announced a detailed plan to fire ballistic missiles towards Guam, a US territory in the Pacific.CIA Director Mike Pompeo. ""This administration has made our policy very clear. We've engaged the world to support that policy,"" Pompeo said, adding there will no longer be ""strategic patience,"" the policy of former President Barack Obama, which centered on waiting for Pyongyang to return to denuclearization talks while increasing sanctions and pressure on the regime. Pompeo described the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, as ""rational.""""He responds to adverse circumstances,"" he said.In a separate interview on ABC News, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, struck a similar tone.He said he doesn't think the US is closer to war than a week ago, but closer to war than a decade ago.""Our response is we are prepared militarily to deal with this if necessary. But we're taking all possible actions short of military action to resolve this very grave threat to the United States and the world,"" the lieutenant general said, citing diplomatic efforts, increased sanctions and increased pressure.He played down the gravity of Trump's tweet Friday that the US military is ""locked and loaded"" to respond to North Korea's threats.""The United States military is always locked and loaded,"" he said. ""But the purpose of capable, ready forces is to preserve peace and prevent war. And George Washington said it. The most effective way of preserving peace is to be prepared for war.""On whether North Korea's threats alone could provoke a military response, he responded:""Well, it depends on the nature of the threat, right?

According to a special task force on the reform of the National Intelligence Service on Thursday, the NIS created as many as 30 units dedicated to posting online comments in favor of the then-conservative administration. The units then hired more than 3,500 civilians to post such comments on portal sites, such as Naver and Daum, and social media, such as Twitter. The teams were created in May 2009 and continued their work until December 2012, when the candidate from Lee’s ruling camp, Park Geun-hye, won the presidential election, the task force said.  The findings appear to confirm the allegation that the NIS abused its power to interfere with domestic politics and add weight to the suspicion that former President Lee and his presidential office greenlighted the illegal activitiesLee and his aides had yet to make any public comments as of Friday afternoon. The NIS chief at the time of the suspected activity, Won Sei-hoon, is currently on trial for meddling in the 2012 election. Prosecutors demanded a four-year jail term for him. The top court is to rule on Aug. 30.“We believe  is the tip of the iceberg, but still it is extremely shocking,” said Kim Hyun, spokesperson of the current ruling, liberal Democratic Party of Korea. “Those involved should come forward and tell the truth before it is too late.” Dubbed “outer cyber teams,” the units consisted of civilians, such as retired military officers, office workers, housewives and self-employed entrepreneurs. They were paid up to 300 million won  per month and worked under the NIS’ psychological operations department.  Former President Lee Myung-bak. YonhapAccording to the task force, the NIS was also involved in monitoring the activities of liberal politicians from the then-opposition parties, such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and Sohn Hak-kyu, who headed the Democratic Party at the time. The spy agency documented their surveillance information and reported it to the presidential office of the Lee administration, the task force added. Besides eavesdropping on the politicians, the report also included an analysis of how to use social networks for a political campaign. “The report is designed to propose an election strategy for the ruling party’s candidates during general and presidential elections,” said the task force. The political meddling scandal involving the NIS was revealed for the first time in December 2012 when the nation was gearing up for the presidential election. Former NIS chief Won was indicted in 2013 on charges of ordering an online smear campaign against opposition candidates, mainly then-presidential candidate Moon Jae-in, who is now president.  Won was sentenced to three years in prison by the Seoul High Court in early 2015. But the Supreme Court returned his case to the lower court in July, saying the evidence that led to his conviction could not be seen as valid.Prosecutors argued that Won was guilty based on emails retrieved from an NIS officer’s computer that contained hundreds of Twitter IDs and his instructions on online comments. But the top court overruled the claim, saying there was no evidence to substantiate the documents were written upon Won’s orders.","election meddling scandal calls ,intelligence service on thursday ,nis election meddling scandal ,election meddling scandal ,500 member cyber team","['Lee Myung - bak', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'NIS']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11010853  0.18581088

Park was elected by a narrow margin.Won was also found to have ordered the agency to muzzle the press and provide support for conservative civic groups.It has been confirmed as well that the NIS attempted to influence parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2012 and put some major opposition politicians under secret surveillance, said the task force, which scrutinized transcripts of Won's instructions.Many files were deleted apparently by Won and his aides but restored by investigators.The country's new administration of reform-minded Moon Jae-in has vowed to reform the NIS by making it focus on collecting and analyzing intelligence and information on North Korea and foreign affairs.  The task force is looking into a dozen other cases of the agency's alleged past wrongdoings.","spy agency election smear ,probe team announced thursday ,state spy agency election ,spy agency election ,team announced thursday","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Intelligence Service']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.21071173  0.30978847

But the assignment he received was something he had not anticipated: becoming the commander’s housekeeper. “I was more like his body servant,” said Kwon, who left the Navy in March, recalling his days at the commander’s residence near the East Sea. “Sweeping the floor, picking up the laundry, cleaning the garden ... you name it. I even tutored his children and translated his thesis into English.” Kwon was a “housekeeping soldier,” part of a unique South Korean system that been roiling the nation this week after it was revealed by a local human rights watchdog how an Army four-star general’s wife treated assigned soldiers. Gen. Park Chan-ju, chief of 2nd Operational Command. Yonhap According to the Center for Military Human Rights Korea on Wednesday, housekeeping soldiers for Gen. Park Chan-ju, chief of 2nd Operational Command, had to stay on duty 24/7, wearing electronic bracelets to be alerted whenever they are needed. One of them was coerced into attending church services, although he was Buddhist.In addition, the soldiers were ordered by Park’s wife to pick up clipped toenails and dead skin cells from the sofa. They were forced to be on duty from 6 a.m., when the general went for his early morning prayers, to 10 p.m. when he went to bed, regardless of their official working hours, the center said. “Having them use a separate bathroom and wear electronic bracelets shows that the Parks treat those soldiers like slaves,” the center said in a statement. “The soldiers were restricted from going outside the residence, so it was difficult for them to report.” On Tuesday, a day after the allegation was released to the public, Park vowed to resign, saying he would “take full responsibility.” Ministry of National Defense spokesman Moon Sang-kyun said the ministry had launched an investigation of Park. Defense Minister Song Young-moo said he would overhaul the system of “housekeeping soldiers” by replacing them with civilian contractors. To set an example, Song said he would remove his own housekeeping soldiers at his residence. Soldiers check their targets at an Army shooting range in Daejeon . Assigning enlisted soldiers housekeeping jobs is a unique system in the South Korean mandatory military service system, where every abled-bodied men, mostly in their 20s, has to serve in the military between 21 and 24 months. Unlike most enlisted soldiers staying in barracks, the housekeeping soldiers spend most of their time at their commanders’ residence. Most of them are recruited when they get promoted to the upper rank for the first time, which usually comes after serving more than six months. Given that the soldiers have to deal with a high-ranking officer almost every day, they are often handpicked by the commander’s executive officers or aide-de-camp, and selected from among high-educated enlisted individuals who specialize in administrative work, military officials said. “Every military around the world has a system to deliver messages or help with administrative jobs on behalf of commanders. If the commanders were concerned about that, they would lose a war,” a retired Air Force colonel, who left the military last year, said under the condition of anonymity. But the problem is that the work they are assigned by commanders are often unrelated to their intended duties and instead involve helping with personal matters, the officer noted, adding that there is no regulation in the military governing their roles.Usually, South Korea’s commanding officers have three to four soldiers for driving, preparing meals and managing overall household duties. The US military, on the other hand, does not assign soldiers for such duties, and hires civilian contractors if necessary, according to military officials.It was not the first time a commander’s abuse of housekeeping soldiers has made headlines. In 2015, former Air Force chief Choi Cha-kyu was forced to resign over the allegation that he ordered one of the soldiers to drive his son to a club in Seoul.“Despite the government’s efforts to overhaul deep-rooted wrongdoing in society, some military leaders and their family members are treating their own soldiers as slaves. It’s such an outdated, retrograde practice,” said Lim Tae-hoon, head of the Center for Military Human Rights Korea.By Yeo Jun-suk","after finishing his freshman ,his mandatory service sailing ,finishing his freshman ,housekeeping soldiers ugly ,finishing his freshman year","['Kwon Tae - jin', 'Navy', 'Seoul', 'Kwon']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08878718  0.29522496

The new trade minister, whose position will be that of a vice minister, is Kim Hyun-chong, a graduate of Columbia Law School and professor of language and trade at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. Last year Kim was also appointed a new member of the World Trade Organization‘s dispute settlement body for Korea, which doles out final decisions on trade disputes between governments, and is currently serving a four-year term. Kim Hyun-chong Kim Hyun-chong returns to the chief trade negotiator’s post, which was recently resurrected in the administration’s government reorganization, after nearly a decade since he led the Korea-US FTA negotiations. Although two presidents have come and gone, handling the Korea-US FTA is likely to be one of the biggest tasks Kim Hyun-chong will face. Since the Korea-US summit in June, the US has formally requested Seoul open talks to discuss possible amendments to the Korea-US FTA. Although far from an overhaul apparently sought by US President Donald Trump, the proposed talks would put the pact under close scrutiny. While the new trade minister’s experience in negotiating trade pacts is undisputable, critics have honed in on his pro-business attitude and the allegedly pro-US stance he took in initial FTA negotiations. The minor left-wing Justice Party has already made its opposition to Kim Hyun-chong’s possible appointment clear, while a farmers’ association warned it would interpret his appointment as Moon “betraying the candlelight revolution,” referring to the citizens’ movement that ousted former President Park and eventually led to Moon’s ascent to the presidency. His stint at Samsung Group from 2009 to 2011 has also raised questions, with former Samsung Group lawyer Kim Yong-chul’s book claiming that the new trade minister revealed highly pro-business views. In his book, Kim Yong-chul quoted Kim Hyun-chong as saying “protecting corporation’s interests is protecting national interests,” adding that such views were behind Kim Hyun-chong “pushing policies that are beneficial only to large companies.”Along with Kim Hyun-chong, Moon named prosecutor-turned-lawyer Kim Yung-moon to head the Korea Customs Service.  Kim Young-moon served as former chief prosecutor at the Daegu District Public Prosecutor’s Office and is currently a partner at Jipyoung Law Firm. The unusual choice of a former prosecutor has been taken as a sign that the government will push for a sweeping reform of the customs service, which has recently become mired in allegations of corruption. “He was known as an expert in investigating cutting-edge crimes while serving as a prosecutor,” Yoon Young-chan, Cheong Wa Dae’s chief public relations officer said. “His clean and strong leadership will allow the customs office to be reborn as an organization trusted by the people and the corporate community.”By Choi He-suk","the new trade minister ,new trade minister whose ,new trade minister ,moon trade minister pick ,graduate of columbia law","['Moon Jae - in', 'US', 'the Korea - US Free Trade Agreement', 'Kim Hyun - chong', 'Columbia Law School', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Kim', 'the World Trade o']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.17308772  0.41839114

The bear in question was released into the mountainous Jirisan for species restoration, but was found 80 kilometers away, raising concerns of both human safety and habitat protection.In 2004, the Ministry of Environment’s Species Restoration Technology Institute launched the bear restoration project at Jirisan in South Gyeongsang Province to release young bears into the wild. The mountain Jirisan was previously home to many Asian black bears, but habitat destruction forced the species into extinction in Korea. Thanks to the project, there are currently 47 bears on Jirisan with chips implanted that enable authorities to monitor their whereabouts. KM-53, however, was found by a mountain trail on Sudosan in Gimcheon, North Gyeongsang Province, some 80 kilometers from the original Mount Jiri habitat.Authorities say they had lost track of the bear in September, due to the GPS failure of the chip. The bear was spotted in the foothills of Sudosan, eating food from nearby houses. It had not caused injury to any humans, officials said. Earlier this month, the bear was relocated back to Jirisan, but two weeks later the bear was found once again at Sudosan. Currently, the bear is in captivity at Jirisan, and authorities plan to keep the animal in captivity permanently if it is deemed a risk to again leave the Jirisan area. But environmental activists say the animal should be set free at Sudosan, as the bear appears to want to settle in the new habitat. They also argue that the incident reveals flaws in current restoration policies.“The ministry should create a better environment for bears to live. The bears are moving north because they are under the influence of a shrinking habitat on Jirisan, which at least 3 million hikers visit each year,” the National Park Conservation Network said in a statement. They say the bear’s migration to another region is unusual, considering the typical radius of the bear’s activities is less than 15 kilometers. The bear is believed to have passed through Gwangju-Daegu Expressway and Daejeon-Tongyeong Expressway to reach Sudosan, according to the ministry. Meanwhile, it was also revealed last week that more than half of 47 bears at the Jirisan habitat were not being monitored by the ministry. According to Rep. Lee Jeong-mi of the Justice Party, 28 of 47 bears were not detectable because 15 were newborns not implanted with GPS chips and another 13 had dead batteries for the chip. So far, there have been 390 reports of damage caused by the bears since the government spearheaded the bear restoration project in 2004, Rep. Lee said.By Kim Da-sol","asian black bear tagged ,black bear is captured ,discord between environmental activists ,an asian black bear ,the bear restoration project","['asian', 'asian', 'Sudosan in Gimcheon', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Species Restoration Technology', 'Jirisan']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3904551   0.02895526

Senior officials from the ruling Democratic Party and government pose for a photo before their meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on July 24, 2017. The party and government officials said that new economic policies would focus on raising household incomes, creating quality jobs, ensuring fair competition and pursuing innovative growth.The policy focus meshes with Moon's much-publicized economic formula aimed at addressing income disparities and boosting growth by creating jobs and increasing household revenue.Last week, during a meeting on financial strategy, Moon pointed out that his government's economic policies must be people-oriented, inclusive, balanced and transparent, and involve citizens' participation.Meanwhile, Woo Won-shik, the party whip, stressed the need to speed up preparations for a tax reform that is expected to increase tax rates for top-earning individuals and businesses.Woo framed the envisioned tax overhaul as a ""normalization of the corporate tax and tax hike on the super-rich"" as critics called it a ""potential tax bomb.""The party and the government plan to hold another meeting Thursday to discuss possible increases in corporate, income and capital gains taxes that would target highest-income earners and companies.The debate on the tax increase was reignited last week amid growing concerns about how the Moon administration will finance his costly five-year policy agenda, including creating new jobs in the public sector.","policy shift repeating president ,government on monday vowed ,shift repeating president moon ,monday vowed seamless cooperation ,seeking major economic policy","['Democratic Party', 'Moon Jae - in', ""South Korea 's""]",20,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.30017319  0.31333447

136,136,Last chance to see North Korea for US tourists,"The Westerners lined up on Sunday before giant statues of North Korea's founder Kim Il-Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong-Il and, on command from their guide, bowed deeply.It is a ritual that the Trump administration intends to stop US tourists performing, with Washington due to impose a ban this week on its citizens holidaying in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as the North is officially known...","The Westerners lined up on Sunday before giant statues of North Korea's founder Kim Il-Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong-Il and, on command from their guide, bowed deeply.It is a ritual that the Trump administration intends to stop US tourists performing, with Washington due to impose a ban this week on its citizens holidaying in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea , as the North is officially known.The move comes amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile ambitions -- it launched a rocket earlier this month which specialists say could reach Alaska or Hawaii -- and after the death of US student Otto Warmbier, who had been imprisoned for more than a year by Pyongyang.Warmbier was convicted of crimes against the state and sentenced to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda poster from a Pyongyang hotel. He was sent home in June in a mysterious coma that proved fatal soon afterwards.Most tourists to North Korea are motivated by curiosity and the desire to experience a different destination.The iconic 20-metre-high  statues at Mansu hill look out over Pyongyang and groups of North Koreans in suits and ties arrive regularly to pay their respects. Passing traffic is obliged to slow down.As the tourists reached the platform speakers played ""We miss our general"", about Kim Jong-Il, the father of current leader Kim Jong-Un.""President Kim Il-Sung liberated our country and built a people's paradise on this land,"" they were told. Call centre manager Kyle Myers, 28, from Ireland, said he wanted ""to go somewhere very different from what I'm used to"" for his first trip to Asia, ""to see something that not a lot of people from back home have seen"".The mounting tensions in the year since he booked the tour had made him nervous, he said, but he added: ""I don't see the threat here for tourists as long as they behave themselves and they follow the rules of the country.""'A little disquieting'Some of the visitors -- who paid from 1,850 euros  for the tour -- expressed enthusiasm. Australian IT manager Pallavi Phadke, 43, was among those who placed a bouquet before the statues.It was ""a sign of respect"", she told AFP. ""It's the same as covering your head when you go to a mosque or removing your shoes when you go to a temple.""The people seem happy, they certainly don't appear to be oppressed or anything,"" she said. ""They're very proud of their country, they're proud of their history and it's nice to watch them be patriotic.""Many disagree, with the United Nations, multiple Western governments and independent groups accusing Pyongyang of widespread human rights violations.Other tourists were more sceptical. Mark Hill, a writer and editor from Calgary in Canada, compared the statues to ""a very grim Mount Rushmore"".""It's all very impressive and also a little disquieting,"" he said.For years the US State Department has warned its citizens against travelling to North Korea, telling them that they are "" at serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea's system of law enforcement"", which ""imposes unduly harsh sentences for actions that would not be considered crimes in the United States"", including showing disrespect to the country's leaders and proselytising.It is ""entirely possible that money spent by tourists in the DPRK"" goes to fund its weapons programmes, it adds.The ban will go into force 30 days after it is formally declared, said department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, and ""US passports will be invalid for travel to, through and in North Korea"".'Monolithic evil force'The vast majority of tourists to North Korea are from China, its sole major ally and key provider of trade and aid.Americans make up around 20 percent of the 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who go to the country each year, according to Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours, the leader in the niche market, which brought Sunday's visitors to Pyongyang.Warmbier's death had already hammered the market, he said, with bookings down 50 percent since then.""It's would-be customers' perceptions that anybody can make a mistake,"" he told AFP. ""And almost everyone in their lives has made some mistake and of course they don't want the consequences of that mistake to be so devastating.""But Washington's move, he said, was self-defeating. As well as the potential ramifications for North Koreans who earn their living from tourism, he said, it would ""completely eliminate any human interaction between United States citizens and North Korean citizens"".Pyongyang's state propaganda about the US was ""100 percent negative"", he said, but contacts between tourists and locals ""work against the idea that foreigners are some kind of monolithic evil force out to undermine the North Koreans"".""The idea that tourism is somehow sustaining the government is absurd,"" he added. ""The numbers are very low, the revenues are very low.""Young Pioneer Tours, the firm which brought Warmbier to the North, had already said it would no longer take US citizens to the country.Among Sunday's tour group was comedy writer Evan Symon, from Los Angeles, who as a result of Washington's ban is likely to be one of the last American tourists to the country for several years.""It's just what happened,"" he said. ""Kind of cool in a way, I guess.""","sunday before giant statues ,korea for us tourists ,impose ban this week ,stop us tourists performing ,the trump administration","['Westerners', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Il - Sung', 'Kim Jong - Il', 'Trump', 'US', 'Washington', ""the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea""]",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51508021  0.96471637

I am afraid we may have to have every ministry put in everything they have no matter how much money it costs,"" Kim was quoted as saying.Gender Equality Minister Chung Hyun-back stressed the need for increased support for female workers, noting many are often force to quit their jobs after giving births.Moon agreed with an urgent need to boost the country's birth rate.""I believe the current situation requires us to put in all national resources. And, in the end, increasing jobs for the youth and easing of unemployment problem are the fundamental solutions to the low birth rate,"" Moon told the meeting, according to Park.The two-day meeting came as a follow-up to the announcement of the 100 policy tasks as it apparently sought to prioritize policy objectives, rather than discussing ways to finance the government tasks as earlier expected.Park said the government will likely begin discussing how to fund the tasks, possibly including a tax hike, at the economy-related ministers' meeting next week.Friday's meeting also discussed ways to accelerate and support the so-called fourth industrial revolution in the country.To this end, the presidential office said the government has decided to nearly double its investment on what it called researcher-initiated research and development to 2.5 trillion won  in 2022 from 1.26 trillion won this year, according to Park.","new jobs friday calling ,boosting birth rate president ,creating new jobs friday ,new jobs friday ,jobs friday calling","['Moon Jae - in', 'Cheong']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.26986665  0.06504823

""It's an area of major concern for us.""She declined to comment further, saying it is a ""very sensitive matter.""Historians estimate that up to 200,000 Asian women, mostly from Korea, were mobilized by the Japanese military to work in front-line brothels.

The issue of ""comfort women,"" a euphemistic term for the victims, has long been a thorn in ties between South Korea and Japan. In 2015, the two sides struck a deal to resolve the issue with an apology and compensation measures from Tokyo. But some of the Korean victims have rejected the agreement, saying it fails to address their grievances.The new South Korean administration of President Moon Jae-in, who took office in May, has strongly indicated it could revise the deal.Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, elaborated in remarks sent later to Yonhap.""In general, our position of this issue has not changed,"" she said.

The government says the measure is part of a bigger plan to transform the Army into a more modernized force based on career military officers, but critics warn that it runs the risk of undermining the country’s fundamental military capability, if confronted by the 1.2 million-strong North Korean Army. The two Koreas are still technically at war. President Moon on Wednesday unveiled a five-year plan to scale back the mandatory military service period to 18 months from the current 21, along with a separate scheme to reduce the number of armed forces to about 500,000 from 620,000.  “Under the proposed reduction scheme, one South Korean solider is to fight against two or more North Korean soldiers during war,” said Yang Uk, a senior researcher at the Seoul-based think tank Korea Defense Forum.The truce village of Panmunjom. YonhapCurrently, every Korean able-bodied man is mandated to serve in the military for 21 months for the Army, 23 months for the Navy and 24 months for the Air Force. The draftees can also choose to serve in the police for 21 months and the fire department for 23 months. The three-month cut would have wide ramifications for South Korea’s defense against the belligerent North, as the conscriptable population is already shrinking, critics said. According to a projection by the military, the number of new draftees -- mostly in their 20s -- would fall from the current 350,000 to 250,000 by 2022, the final year of Moon’s presidency and the five-year plan. A study by the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analysis shows that if the military service period is reduced by a month, the number of soldiers available for combat would decline by 10,000. A three-month reduction would lead to a shortage of about 33,000, the agency said. Some officials are worried that an 18-month service period would be too short for soldiers to master war training. “Apart from for the training period at boot camp, the soldiers would need at least nine months to be familiar with war skills. Under the current 21-month service period, only 10-20 percent of conscripts are considered to be fully combat-ready,” said an Army officer, who declined to reveal his identity due to the sensitivity of the issue. Proponents argue that streamlining the military with the shorter service period is a “step in the right direction.” “We need to stop playing games with numbers,” said Lim Tae-hoon, head of the Center for Military Human Rights Korea. “We can recruit more noncommissioned officers with expertise and transform the reserve forces into a more developed, qualified one.” Reducing the number of those enlisted and their service period was an election pledge of Moon, who led a similar scheme when he served as chief of staff for late President Roh Moo-hyun. The plan was scrapped under the tenure of conservative Presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye. Yang of the Korea Defense Forum stressed that although the Army needs to be transformed and modernized, the number of armed forces still matters even in modern warfare. When the Iraq War broke out in 2003, “the US said they would win the war within months, but they were forced to withdraw due to the conflict on the ground. … Technology can play a big role in deterring war, but during actual warfare, the number of troops still matters,” he said.  By Yeo Jun-suk","service sparked debate thursday ,reduce conscripted soldiers mandatory ,moon plan to cut ,to cut mandatory military ,debate brews over moon","['Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea ’s', 'Army']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29894328  0.20405418

The move underscored Moon's pursuit of clean, safe and renewable energy sources.  Trade, Industry and Energy Minister nominee Paik Un-gyu speaks during a parliamentary confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on July 19, 2017. "" pursue the process of the policy transition based on social consensus through sufficient discussions, including soliciting expert opinions on the issue,"" he said, stressing the whole process will be carried out in a ""transparent and fair"" way.""I will seek to advance the time -- when  breathe cleaner air and live in a safer environment -- by gradually reducing nuclear and coal-fired power plants that have spawned concerns about safety and environmental , and through increasing renewable energy supplies,"" he added.Asked about the allegations that the government has suspended the construction of two nuclear reactors in Ulsan, 414 kilometers southeast of Seoul, without considering its potential ramifications, the nominee said that the government's policy road map has been crafted after its ""comprehensive"" review of the potential impacts, including one on energy prices.Touching on Washington's recent request for a revision to the South Korea-US free trade agreement, Paik said that he will ""confidently"" deal with it under the principles of maximizing national interests and striking the right balance of interests between the countries.He also pledged to ""enhance"" strategic economic cooperation with China and Japan to increase benefits from the trade relations with the neighbors.""I will thoroughly cope with the pending trade issues through interagency cooperation and seek to bolster our trade negotiation capabilities,"" he said.Paik also stressed his resolve to help foster new industries, such as smart cars and intelligent robots, by capitalizing on the country's leading-edge technologies and manufacturing capacity.During the hearing, Paik was grilled over the suspicion that he dodged mandatory military service in the 1980s. In his first physical checkup in 1985, he was listed as fit for active duty, but four years later, he was exempted from duty following a car accident.""I apologize to the citizens for failing to fulfill the sacred duty,"" he said, while rejecting the notion that he intentionally dodged military service.Paik also came under fire for the allegation that he had served as an outside director for a local firm without permission from a Seoul university where he has taught since 1999 -- in breach of the private school law.For this, he also apologized, saying he has failed to ""properly take care of"" the issue. Korea Communications Commission  chief-nominee Lee Hyo-seong speaks during a parliamentary confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on July 19, 2017. Also on Wednesday, the parliament held a confirmation hearing for Korea Communications Commission chief-nominee Lee Hyo-seong.Lee said that if appointed, he would work to ensure that public broadcasters produce fairer, unbiased content, and that their programs would not be skewed in favor of ""particular political forces.""""Over the past years, there has been much criticism over the fairness of public broadcasters,"" Lee, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University, said. ""I will take due measures if necessary after looking into the situation to see if there really are problems.""During the hearing, opposition lawmakers attacked him over a series of allegations against him, ranging from real estate speculation to false address registration.

147,147,[News Focus] Teen murderer may be faking mental illness,"A teen suspect on trial for the murder of an 8-year-old girl in Incheon in March may be feigning mental illness in order to receive a lenient punishment, said a psychologist who interviewed the suspect to evaluate her mental condition. Professor Kim Tae-kyung of Woosuk University said the suspect, a 17-year-old high school dropout identified only by her surname Kim, seemed “quite different” from mentally ill people...","A teen suspect on trial for the murder of an 8-year-old girl in Incheon in March may be feigning mental illness in order to receive a lenient punishment, said a psychologist who interviewed the suspect to evaluate her mental condition. Professor Kim Tae-kyung of Woosuk University said the suspect, a 17-year-old high school dropout identified only by her surname Kim, seemed “quite different” from mentally ill people he has known and interviewed throughout his career. The professor, as an adviser to the Forensic Science Investigation Department of the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, interviewed the suspect in April ahead of her trial. “She was observant of others’ reactions and careful about how to respond to questions during the interview. She tried to justify her crime with mental disorders she claimed she has,” Professor Kim said in a telephone interview with The Korea Herald on Sunday.“That’s really not the way a person with mental disorders is expected to behave or talk.”During the prosecutorial investigation, the suspect confessed to luring, strangling and dismembering the victim in a quiet residential neighborhood of Yeonsu in Incheon on March 29. She then handed over part of the victim’s remains to an accomplice, aged 18, who she had known through Twitter. They spoke over the phone for more than two hours the night prior to the murder. The accomplice has been nabbed and is also standing trial. It was revealed during a court hearing that Kim messaged Park on the day of the killing, saying “ going on the hunt.”“Returned home. The situation was good,” Kim said later in another text message. Her trial has drawn a lot of attention for its brutality as well as for the suspects’ age. In South Korea, the harshest punishment that can be handed down to a legal minor, under the age 19, is 15 years of imprisonment, regardless of the offense. He or she becomes eligible for parole after serving five years. Apparently aware of this, the suspect’s defense at court has been mainly about her mental state. The attorney claimed she suffers a number of psychological disorders, including schizophrenia and Asperger’s syndrome, and that the killing was a result of her mental condition. The professor who interviewed the suspect, however, countered the claim, saying it is highly unlikely. “People with schizophrenia, for example, may hear and see things that aren’t really there. They also tend to believe others are plotting to harm them and become extremely agitated. The suspect said she had some sort of audible or visual hallucinations but failed to elaborate on what they were,” the expert explained. “Kim’s behavior was consistent in a sense that she was self-centered and indifferent toward the victim and the victim’s family. She showed signs of remorse for the first time when she realized she has to serve some time in prison if convicted.” At a court hearing last week, inmates from a detention facility who shared a cell with the suspect also made testimonies that could work against her claim. “ studied Asperger’s syndrome books that her parents gave to her,” one of the inmates revealed. “Her mood brightened after she learnt that her jail term could be reduced if she is diagnosed with a mental disease,” another testified. Legal experts said Monday that the defendant could receive up to 20 years in jail, if convicted, but the term would be cut by half, if the court acknowledges that Kim was mentally unstable when she killed the victim. As for the accomplice, who will turn 19 in December, there are more complex legal issues to determine the punishment she may receive, pundits said. Currently, the teenager is charged with being an accessory to murder, but prosecutors may change this to a more serious charge of instigating Kim to kill the victim. If convicted of instigation of murder, the 18-year-old accomplice could get a harsher punishment than the killer. The final hearing of Kim’s trial is set for Aug. 9, while that of the alleged accomplice is to follow the week after.

The 68-year-old was formally appointed by President Moon Jae-in a day earlier, following a month-long tug of war with opposition parties which had fiercely demurred at the nomination chiefly over his high-paying post-retirement stints at a law firm and defense contractor. Moon, however, is pinning high hopes on the former chief of naval operations as the very man to spearhead his ambitious reform agenda aimed at stamping out irregularities in acquisition deals and ramping up Seoul’s own defense power which would facilitate its takeover of wartime operational control from the US. “We ought to construct a brand new military well beyond defense reform so that we could regain the people’s trust. We can no longer delay defense reform for any reason,” Song said in his inauguration speech.  Defense Minister Song Young-moo  salutes the flat at his inauguration ceremony at the ministry headquarters on Friday. He stressed the evolving threats by the Kim Jong-un regime in the wake of its recent test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which has given rise to an “unlimited competition” between the neighbor countries over an edge in economic and military power. “The security situation surrounding the Korean Peninsula is more critical than ever. Despite the circumstances, we must create a strong military that could protect its own fate by itself, and pass it to the next generations,” he said. “What we need is defense power with which to surmount any North Korean threats and play a mutually beneficial bridging role between the neighbors.” While on active duty, Song was involved in defense reform and OPCON transfer as head of strategic planning at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when Moon was a top aide to then President Roh Moo-hyun. With the alliance with the US being the backbone of the peninsula defense, the minister emphasized the significance of establishing a “comprehensive security regime” to encompass not only cross-border contingencies but natural disasters and other nonmilitary threats. Internally, he pledged to foster a more favorable, violence-free barrack culture and increase the workforce of female soldiers and officers and improve their working conditions, among others. The military has been hit by a series of bullying and shooting incidents involving casualties. Last month, a Navy captain was arrested on charges of repeatedly raping a 20-something female officer in his team which led her to commit suicide. The ministry came under fire also last month after being found to have deliberately concealed in its report to Cheong Wa Dae that four launchers of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system have been brought to its site, not the two as widely known. Following a probe, the presidential office shunted off the deputy defense minister and suspended the deployment process. New Defense Minister Song Young-moo  and outgoing Minister Han Min-koo walk to their inauguration and farewell ceremony at the ministry headquarters in Seoul on Friday. As the first minister from the Navy in about 13 years, he would also have to strike a balance in empowering all military organs, given the festering infighting between the Army, Navy and Air Force. They were seen once again engaging in a fierce power struggle in the lead up to and even after Song’s nomination.An upcoming shake-up is likely to put the nascent leadership to an early test, amid rising speculation over whether a non-Army commander will become the JCS chairman for the first time. Many other top commander posts are up for grabs, including the chief of staff of the Army and Air Force and deputy commander of the Combined Force Command. “The leadership reshuffle is the most urgent matter at this point as the successors would have to make a command decision and take part in trainings,” Song told reporters after the inauguration ceremony. “But it could not take place so quickly because the JCS chairman and chiefs of each organ are subject to a cabinet approval and the president’s appointment.” By Shin Hyon-hee","friday vowing to rebuild ,new defense chief vows ,took office friday vowing ,office friday vowing ,defense chief vows reform","['Defense', 'Song Young', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in']",20,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.098568   0.25257927 0.53212231],Shin Hyon-hee,Defense,7,2017,"office friday vowing to rebuild ,his inauguration speech defense minister ,moo took office friday vowing ,process new defense minister song ,reporters after the inauguration ceremony","['Defense', 'Song Young', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'US', 'song', 'Song Young', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Song', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Moon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'US', 'Navy', 'US', 'Song Young', 'Han Min - koo', 'Seoul', 'Navy', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Song ’s', 'non - army', 'JCS', 'Army', 'Air Force', 'the Combined Force Command', 'Song', 'JCS', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",6,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.098568   0.25257927 0.53212231]

According to Cheong Wa Dae, about 300 documents were found in an unused cabinet in the office used by President Moon Jae-in’s civil affairs aides, and that the documents contain potentially incriminating information about Park Geun-hye administration’s interest in Samsung Group’s succession. “These documents are deemed to be related to the so-called Choi Soon-sil state affairs manipulation case. Special counsel Park Young-soo attempted to search the previous government’s civil affairs secretary’s office but was not able to do so,” said Park Soo-hyun, President Moon Jae-in’s spokesman.  Park Soo-hyun Park said that the documents were produced under the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, and that many of the documents were compiled by Woo Byung-woo -- a civil affairs secretary to former President Park Geun-hye on trial for his part in the scandal that ousted Park. “With these documents having been found, copies will be handed over to the prosecution,” Park said, saying that copies of documents are not presidential records, the disclosure of which would require Assembly action. According to Park, a handwritten memo found among the documents reads “Samsung’s management rights inheritance” followed by an arrow pointing to the words “use as an opportunity.” “Determine what Samsung requires in passing on management rights, and help  where possible. Seek ways for Samsung to contribute more to the country’s economy,” reads the memo, Park said. “It is possible for the government to exert significant influence in resolving issues Samsung faces. Response to regulations regarding economic democratization, support  deregulating separation of finance and industry.” Moon’s spokesman also revealed that included among the documents are outlines of plans to make the country’s culture and arts circles “wholesome.” The concerned documents also includes statements such as that most of the top civil servants in the Culture Ministry were “subject to review.” Other issues dealt with in the documents include minister nominations between June 11, 2014 and June 24, 2015, the National Pension Service’s voting rights as a corporate shareholder, and local elections outlook. Park also revealed the contents of a memo presumed to be written by late civil affairs secretary Kim Young-han. The memo mentions “judges lenient on spies” and includes the words “replacement driver report to southern district-urge stringent investigation,” which Park interpreted as being related to the case of a replacement driver who was assaulted by members of a committee representing Sewol victims’ families. The same memo also mentions directions for using “patriotic rightwing organizations” in a matter related to history textbooks.

On Wednesday, plans to issue commemorative stamps for Park were scrapped, more than a year after the decision was made. On the same day, the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation announced a plan to establish the Roh Moo-hyun Center in central Seoul.   Park and Roh are seen as polar opposites of each other, both in terms of character and political style, as well as what they symbolize to Koreans. To older generations and conservatives, the late Park is a symbol of progress and anti-communism, while to younger generations and liberals, he is a symbol of authoritarianism. The late Roh, on the other hand, is a liberal icon to younger Koreans, while many older conservatives think of him as being pro-North Korea. On Wednesday, the plans for issuing commemorative stamps marking a century since Park’s birth on Nov. 17, 1917 were canceled, adding fresh fuel to the controversial project. This is the first time a decision to issue commemorative stamps has been overturned. The decision to print the stamps was approved last year in a unanimous decision by the committee that reviews such plans. At the time, nine of the 17 committee members attended the meeting. The decision was revoked by the committee, whose members remained the same, on Wednesday, with eight of the 12 members present voting to scrap the plans. Both of the committees’ decisions have been subject to criticism, though from different spheres of Korean society.  The initial decision, made during former President Park Geun-hye’s term, was attacked as idolizing the dictator, and Korea Post had flatly ruled out demands for reassessment from opposition lawmakers. Park Geun-hye, currently on trial for corruption, is the eldest daughter of Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated by Kim Jae-gyu in 1979. At the time of the assassination, Kim was serving as the chief of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, which later became the National Intelligence Service. Wednesday’s decision has come under fire from conservative groups who say the move only exasperates the ideological divide and is an attempt to curry favor with the liberal administration of President Moon Jae-in. Just as the controversy over the stamps reignited, the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation revealed its plans for facilities commemorating the liberal icon who was also Moon’s associate and political mentor. “The plans are to begin work on the center from President Roh’s memorial service on May 23 next year,” a foundation official told reporters. Roh, who served as president from 2003 to 2008, took his own life on May 23, 2009, after members of his family became embroiled in a corruption probe. According to the foundation, the center will offer various cultural programs for the public, and will be built near the palace Changgyeonggung.

A family, whose identity was withheld, filed a complaint against McDonald's Korea with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, seeking an investigation into a possible breach of food safety law.

Earlier in the day, a man in his late 30s also lodged a petition calling for a thorough probe into his claim that he was given a burger with undercooked meat at one of its stores.Their actions followed a previous complaint submitted last week by parents of a four-year-old who has been diagnosed with hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a food-borne disease that mostly results in acute kidney failure, after she ate a Happy Meal burger last year. They blame an undercooked burger patty for the illness.She has now to receive dialysis.The incident has spurred a heated dispute in Korea. Many criticized the US fast-food chain while some played down the possibility of the burger being the cause of renal failure. Some consumers, especially parents with young kids, vowed to boycott the company and stop their children from eating fast food. The three-year-old girl recovered after treatment and the parents did not specify an undercooked burger patty as the cause of the enteritis in their complaint.

154,154,[News Focus] Bareun Party charts new conservative course,"Rep. Lee Hye-hoon, chairwoman of the conservative splinter Bareun Party, on Wednesday paid homage to the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, a liberal icon openly disdained by the conservative old guard. “I will restructure true conservativism and make South Korea healthy, keeping balance between the right and left wing,” she wrote in the visitor’s book.

Lee Hye-hoon, chairwoman of the conservative splinter Bareun Party, on Wednesday paid homage to the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, a liberal icon openly disdained by the conservative old guard. “I will restructure true conservativism and make South Korea healthy, keeping balance between the right and left wing,” she wrote in the visitor’s book. Meeting the widow, former first lady Kwon Yang-suk, she said her party and the late president have some common ground in their political visions.  Leaders of the conservative Bareun Party, led by chairwoman Rep. Lee Hye-hoon, pay tribute at the grave of late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun in his hometown of Bongha, South Gyeongsang Province, Wednesday. “One of the core values that our party pursues is a fair market economy without foul play or favoritism. It goes in line with what the former President Roh sought,” she said. Although Bonha village in South Gyeongsang Province is frequented by liberal politicians, including President Moon Jae-in, conservative leaders have shown reluctance to go there even for his official memorial ceremonies, refusing to show due respect and recognition to the former state chief. Roh, who was president from 2003 to 2008, took his own life in 2009 amid an investigation into corruption accusations involving his family and associates.During this year’s annual memorial ceremony in May, the main conservative opposition Liberty Korea Party sent its Secretary-General Park Maeng-woo to pay tribute, while chiefs from other parties all came to the event. Rep. Lee’s visit to Roh’s grave thus perfectly encapsulates the party’s ongoing efforts to break away from “old conservatism,” represented by the much bigger rival Liberty Korea Party and to chart a distinctly new conservative course. Elected to lead the party two weeks ago, Rep. Lee has made it clear that the party will be different and that its decisions will be rational and the process will be democratic. By showing what true conservatism is the party will represent the country’s political right, she has said. The new chief also signaled a departure from anti-communist McCarthyism, a frequently used election tactic for conservative politicians. South Korea is technically still at war with the communist North Korea. “Conservatives have claimed that it holds strength in national security issues, but it  has often attacked anyone who opposes its stance as North Korean followers,” Lee said, lashing out at Liberty Korea Party in a local radio interview two days after she was elected. “Instead of labelling opponents as being pro-North, we really need to care about national defense and also work to get rid of wrong and unfair treatment in the market.” The Bareun Party’s attempt at reform appears to be fresh to some. It is also trying to grab the attention of younger supporters in their 20s and 30s who have become their main supporter base. On Monday, they started a debate tournament, in which some of its lawmakers pair up with university students to discuss on social issues, including government’s role in increasing jobs in the public sector.“Lee’s effort to pursue a new view of conservatives will be a positive influence on South Korean politics,” political science professor Lee Hyeon-woo from Sogang University told The Korea Herald. “While it may be difficult for the party to win so many seats in the regional election in the near future, the Bareun Party would be able to absorb some of the diversified conservative voters from different age groups.”The country has long maintained two-party politics, between the liberals and conservatives, but the multiparty system would now be able to represent the more specific needs of citizens, he added. Currently, there are four political parties holding more than 20 parliamentary seats, meeting the requirement for negotiation body status at the National Assembly. Bareun Party is the smallest, with 20 lawmakers. In the latest poll by Realmeter on Monday, the Bareun Party stood third with 6.6 percent of approval, trailing behind the Liberty Korea Party at 16.2 percent. The ruling Democratic Party topped the poll with 53.4 percent.

Details are still to come, but we have around 25 candidates under consideration to join the envisioned panel,” Kim said at a press conference.  Education Minister Kim Sang-kon speaks in front of reporters. It was President Moon Jae-in’s campaign pledge to establish a new committee that decides key directions of the nation‘s education policies. Moon, a liberal politician, has vowed to promote fair opportunities for all students as a way to reduce widening social disparity.  In face of growing criticism that educational policies are increasingly short-lived along with each new administration, experts have long stressed the importance of setting up long-term goals and policies in education.For a start, Moon tapped Kim, 68, a former school superintendent of Gyeonggi Province and educational reformist, as the new education minister in June. Sworn in last week, Kim is said to be the architect of Moon’s education pledges, including the removal of elite private schools here and excessive competition among students. Also at the conference, Kim emphasized the need to bring change to the ministry itself, to better cope with rapidly changing educational environments around the world.“A whole new approach is needed to reform the ministry and realize the Moon administration’s educational philosophy and goals,” Kim added.By Bak Se-hwan","latest education minister ,launch around early august ,25 candidates under consideration ,aug new body tasked ,wednesday the ministry is","['Kim Sang - kon', 'Kim']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38876787  0.73471177

156,156,[Herald Interview] ‘Military confidence-building is key to reducing tensions on Peninsula’,"Despite North Korea’s persistent missile provocations and nuclear threat, South Korea should engage with the North and build trust with it to reduce the risk of an all-out war on the peninsula, a senior United Nations official said. 　Daniel Prins, chief of the United Nation’s Conventional Arms Branch, said taking confidence-building measures on the military area is “absolutely essential” to avoid misperception b...","Despite North Korea’s persistent missile provocations and nuclear threat, South Korea should engage with the North and build trust with it to reduce the risk of an all-out war on the peninsula, a senior United Nations official said. Daniel Prins, chief of the United Nation’s Conventional Arms Branch, said taking confidence-building measures on the military area is “absolutely essential” to avoid misperception between the two Koreas, whose cross-border exchanges have been suspended since the North’s nuclear and missile test last year. “The point of military confidence-building is that you have to try constantly. You know it would fail. You know that whatever you proposed will be discarded by other sides. But you may find areas of convergence and cooperation,” Prins said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “Further characterization of military confidence-building is that you don’t need to necessarily have  full package of everything. You can just pick and choose which measure may work. It may be a tiny one. The point is to try to find those measures that can have initial agreement with the other side.” Daniel Prins, chief of the United Nation’s Conventional Arms Branch Prins came to Seoul in late June to attend the fourth International Defense Technology and Security Conference hosted by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration. The interview took place before North Korea launched what it claimed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4. In his address at the Korber Foundation in Germany on Thursday, President Moon Jae-in called for the “immediate and complete” suspension of hostile activities along the inter-Korean border from July 24, which will mark the 64th anniversary of an armistice agreement on the Korean War. Moon’s proposal will pave the way to dispelling mistrust on cross-border military activities, Prins stressed, highlighting that the two Koreas still have opportunities to work with each other because they are under an armistice condition.  “It is in the middle region where it’s interesting to do military confidence-building. … We can also think of exchange of personnel either in training, exercising and military educations. You can think of exchanges of observers at military exercises, informing each other’s military exercise before you started doing that.” Moon’s other engagement approach toward the North -- such as the reunion of families separated since the Korean War and the invitation of North Korea to the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics -- should be embraced as a “starting point” to build a platform to resolve political and military issue. “We have seen in the past how areas of culture and sports serve as good opportunities for  effective confidence-building measure. These are areas of policies that are often perceived as non-threatening to each other.”  Daniel Prins, chief of the United Nation’s Conventional Arms Branch Prins acknowledged that building confidence with North Korea is a time-consuming process, noting there is no safeguard for being cheated by the North who abandoned its pledge to give up its nuclear weapons and programs in 2005.  Despite the harsh reality of international politics, where sovereign states make their own security choices, the measure is still worth a try because it can help the two Koreas discuss more complicated, arduous issues, the UN diplomat added. “In the end, countries are sovereign entities that makes their own decisions that may be perceived as disappointing. That is the reality of the politics. We have to deal with  murky, difficult and complicated situation we have been handed down.” “The point of confidence-building is that under it lies a more important thing: procedures. If some measures go well, you can see if something else would work out. That is where you want to go and build a platform to discuss other issues.”By Yeo Jun-suk","interview military confidence building ,reducing tensions on peninsula ,key to reducing tensions ,korea persistent missile provocations ,herald interview military confidence","['North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'United Nations', 'Daniel Prins', 'the United Nation ’s', 'Arms Branch']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.14867945  0.18341833

They denounced the plans, accusing it of being “for show” prior to a trial on an appeal case of RB Korea’s former CEO Shin Hyun-woo next week. In January, Shin was convicted for skipping the due safety tests for the disputed products and for using false advertisements. A group of victims and civic activists are staging a protest in front of Reckitt Benckiser Korea in Yeouido, Seoul, Monday. Monday’s announcement comes a year after the company promised to provide up to 350 million won  to victims of categories 1 and 2. “According to the government, 52 more victims were newly included in categories 1 and 2 through the government investigation in May, in addition to 183 victims classified in January. We would like to offer all of them compensation,” Shin Hye-jeong, director of RB Korea, told The Korea Herald. Under the compensation plan, the company will reimburse previous medical treatment costs and nursing fees for the victims, based on the proof of document. Up to 1 billion won and lifelong medical treatment will be compensated for the deaths of infant and child victims, by calculating the amount of income that a victim would have been able to make if not affected by the toxic humidifier.“We hope the compensation plan that reflects the situations and inputs of the victims and families would provide some remedy for the pain and suffering they have endured. We once again express our heart-felt apology for the pain and suffering caused by the tragedy,” Park Dong-suk, CEO of RB Korea, said in a statement. So far, 162 people have reached a settlement with the company over the compensation, the company said.Gapimo, a group of victims and their families, however, argued that only a few will benefit from the plan, as a small number are classified under categories 1-2 through the government’s investigation. “Overall, at least 800 victims were recognized with health damage by the government, while there are over 5,000 victims from the use of Oxy products. RB Korea needs to come up with a ‘proper’ compensation plan that covers all victims who suffered for so long,” said Kang Chan-ho, head of Gapimo.“The company’s release of a compensation plan looks like it is to impress the new administration, hoping the situation changes favorably for them,” he said. According to the government’s current victim verification process, set in 2014, the scale goes from 1-4, with one being highly certain the health damage resulted from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectants, based on personal clinical results, diagnostic images and the level of exposure.RB Korea is responsible for some 4.4 million toxic humidifier disinfectants sold between 2000 and 2014, accounting for 62 percent of the total volume in the humidifier disinfectant market. As of July 7, 982 victims, mostly of lung failure, have been formally recognized as being linked to the products.

Preliminary investigations suggest collisions with vessels likely were to blame for at least two of those deaths, and another whale died after becoming entangled in fishing gear. Federal law requires all boats to slow down in shipping channels known to be frequented by whales. But that doesn't always help animals in the open Atlantic, where racing sailboats are moving fast. ``In the last year, at least two sailors in open ocean races collided with whales during the competition and had to be rescued,'' said Monica Pepe, policy manager for Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a conservation and research organization based in Plymouth, Massachusetts. ``We're hopeful that the information we've shared will help to keep everyone safe and help sailors know what to look for while also encouraging them to report any sightings of whales in distress along their courses,'' Pepe said. Organizers hope the America's Cup and other major races eventually incorporate it, she said. Sailors are given tips to navigate safely around whales; contact information for authorities in case they see a whale or sea turtle that's entangled or otherwise in distress; and reminders on keeping debris out of the ocean. It's tailored to each race; course maps are overlaid with any nearby whale habitat. The Audubon Society of Rhode Island and the New Bedford Whaling Museum helped Pepe's group launch the initiative, which has been dubbed ""Sharing the Seas."" The joint effort also involved US Sailing, the sport's national governing body, and Sailors for the Sea, a Newport, Rhode Island-based group that promotes responsible ocean stewardship among sailors. Anne Coulombe, co-director of the Marblehead to Halifax race, calls the information ``critical to the safety of our racing crews as well as to marine life.'' ``We thought it essential to include it in our skipper's packets,'' she said.","whales ho sailors conservationists ,keep whales safe boston ,conservationists help keep whales ,sailboat racing and nonprofit ,whales safe boston ap",['AP'],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36070511  0.02271896

Being primarily a forum for international cooperation on financial and economic issues, discussions on other issues such as climate change and counterterrorism are limited to their economic implications within the G-20 summit. But the participating national leaders would frequently use the occasion to voice their opinions on prime matters of interest and to touch base with crucial counterparts on the sidelines of the sessions.For the South Korean president, the top priority was to highlight North Korea’s escalating military provocations and the need for the global community to roll out pragmatic, collaborated countermeasures. A day prior to Moon’s departure for Germany, the North launched another missile, which it claimed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland.While the international community remains divided on the precise classification and capabilities of the projectile, the consensus is that the recent launch shows the progress in Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. Moon’s issue-raising turned out to be half a success -- forming a consensus on the seriousness of the threat posed by North Korea, but falling short of the leaders issuing an official statement that would exert more pressure on Pyongyang. “The North Korea problem was mentioned in the close-door retreat session this morning,” said German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a press briefing on Friday.“Though it was the president of South Korea, which is to take the direct effect , I would like to point out that all other chiefs of state and government also expressed their concerns over the  situation.”The German leader thereby urged the United Nations Security Council to play its due role and take measures corresponding to the reclusive regime’s breach of international resolutions.Such action from the presidency state fell short of Moon’s aspiration of having a warning from the international community to North Korea included in the G-20 summit’s official communique.“I believe that the G-20 summits need to express their shared view on North Korea’s missile launch, separately from the UNSC resolution to increase sanctions and pressure,” Moon said in his speech at Berlin’s Old City Hall on Thursday.South Korean government officials, however, claimed that Merkel‘s statement holds sufficient political leverage in the global society concerning the reclusive regime.“Because the G-20 is an economic, financial forum, it is difficult to prioritize political issues and include them in the final written statement,” a senior government official told reporters.“We take  remarks as the presidency‘s de facto oral statement on the issue.”Also, the South Korean president had the chance to elaborate on his roadmap for addressing the North‘s nuclear issue, with all eight state chiefs who held separate summit talks with him enquiring about the details on the matter, the official added.Another pending challenge for South Korea is to maintain a delicate balance between the US and China, and to take “the steering wheel” in dealing with the North Korea nuclear problem. Through a set of individual summits, the so-called Big Four nations -- the US, China, Japan and Russia -- all denounced the North’s nuclear program and vowed for measures to bring about its end. A clear rift, however, was observed between the two biggest players – Washington and Beijing. The former maintains that talks should be based on the North’s denuclearization, while the latter called on the US to end joint military drills with Seoul as a gesture of peace. “The international community shares the belief that North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs should be abolished in a complete, testable and irreversible manner,” the Cheong Wa Dae official said.“There may be various opinions when it comes to the details but it is unbecoming to view  as a conflict between South Korea-US-Japan and China-Russia.”President Moon also faces prolonged tension with Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on the disputed settlement on wartime sex slaves signed by Seoul’s previous conservative administration.The Japanese prime minister underlined that the agreement needs to be upheld in good faith, but Moon argued that the controversial deal is keeping the two states apart.“We have to acknowledge the fact that the majority of our people  find it emotionally difficult to accept ,” Moon said.Moon‘s participation in the G-20 sessions marked the new president’s debut in multilateral diplomacy, and a clear signal that Seoul’s summit diplomacy is back on track. During his five-day stay in Germany -- the first two days spent in Berlin and the rest in Hamburg -- Moon sat in a total of 13 summit-level meetings with counterpart state chiefs and international organization leaders.In the previous week, he made his first overseas trip as president to Washington for a bilateral meeting with US counterpart Donald Trump.By Bae Hyun-jung, Korea Herald correspondent","germany hamburg on friday ,stage for president moon ,hamburg on friday ,hamburg on friday and ,germany the 12th annual","['HAMBURG', 'Germany', 'Group of 20', 'Germany', 'Hamburg', 'Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea', 'south korean']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.68622327  0.41858482

Instead of stirring up interest in South Korea’s largest opposition party, the event saw an avalanche of entries disparaging and belittling it. It has virtually become a contest of creative mockeries of the once-ruling right wing, an embarrassing public display of the deep quandary it is now in.  Hong Joon-pyo In a public survey released Friday by Gallup Korea, the party, which controls over a third of the National Assembly’s 299 seats, scored a humiliating 7 percent in public support, against the ruling Democratic Party of Korea’s 48 percent. For the first time, it trailed the Bareun Party, a 20-seat conservative group that split from it last year, which recorded 9 percent. At 7 percent, the Liberty Korea Party tied with the Justice Party, a miniscule far-left group holding six parliamentary seats. “Once the most popular party representing conservative values, the Liberty Korea Party is no longer viewed that way in the eyes of voters,” Jun Kye-wan, a political commentator, told The Korea Herald. “People naturally relate the party to the now jailed former President Park Geun-hye and her corruption scandal.”Backed by loyal supporters, loathed by many others In power for nearly a decade, the Liberty Korea Party has survived numerous scandals and political setbacks, changing its name from the Grand National Party to the Saenuri Party to its current name. And the party’s support base has remained more or less unchanged. But the recent fall of former President Park, who had long embodied the right wing’s political values, has done damage for which there seems to be no quick fix. A further look at the aforementioned Gallup survey reveals how deep the trouble is. Only 3 percent and 2 percent of voters in their 20s and 30s, respectively, said they support the Liberty Korea Party. Its smaller conservative rival, the Bareun Party, did better in winning over voters of that age group. It garnered 12 percent from voters in their 20s and 8 percent from those in their 30s. The Liberty Korea Party’s performance in its stronghold regions was poor, barely securing 10 percent in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. In Busan and South Gyeongsang Province, another conservative hotbed, the figure stood at 12 percent. A 33-year-old office worker, who identified himself as a conservative, feels a vast majority of the public has turned hostile toward the Liberty Korea Party. “I cannot openly say that I support the party anymore,” he said, requesting his name not be mentioned.“I think the conservatives have lost their identity. They are so absorbed in factional disputes within and outside the party,” he said. Jang Kyung-sang, a party member since 1990s, harshly criticized the party for failing to strictly evaluate its past faults and reflect on them after the stormy scandal involving former President Park, which led to her expulsion from power and the election of a new president, the liberal Moon Jae-in. “Discussions here are only on how to win an edge over the rival camp, not on how to win back public trust,” Jang, the secretary-general of a private institute on state affairs management, said at a forum hosted by the party on June 13. The only way to rehabilitate the party from its current state is to put priority on true conservative values and listen to the needs of voters, he stressed.Some experts also highlighted that the conservative party is still fixated on a political power game, without taking notice of the changing political trend in South Korea and around the world. “The anti-politics sentiment is prevalent across the world. Voters wary of the establishment are showing their passive resistance against vested politicians,” said Lee Hae-young, an international relations professor at Hanshin University.The election victories of France’s youngest president, Emmanuel Macron, and US President Donald Trump, who was formerly a business tycoon, also reflect such a trend, Lee explained. “President Moon’s liberal government is not distinctively new or different from the past, but it has changed its attitude and renewed some values to win over voters. The conservatives should also come up with a new conservative identity that can really represent the demands of citizens,” Lee said. Ways to reform Luckily for the Liberty Korea Party, the next parliamentary elections are three years away. Regardless of dismal voter support now, the party will hold on to its parliamentary presence until the next general election. But that does not mean the party will be spared the consequences of its soured relationship with voters during the next three years. Local elections will be held next June and influential positions such as the mayor of Seoul are at stake. Party officials hope for a turnaround, with the election of new leadership, slated for Monday. How to rebuild the party and win back public trust are focal issues of the leadership race. The three contenders vying for the party’s chairmanship all echoed pledges to reform the party and cut connections with wrongdoings of the past. The favorite to win is Hong Joon-pyo, who garnered 24 percent of votes as the party’s flagbearer in the May presidential election. “During  presidential election period, I thought to myself, ‘How did our conservative party come to near destruction?’” former South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong said at a candidate debate with first-and second-term lawmakers last month. “As I have been a member of the Liberty Korea Party for over 22 years now, I believe I should take on the evil role to revamp this conservative party .”Known for his sharp tongue and hard-line stance, Hong cuts a conspicuous, but divisive figure. His opponents worry Hong might further scare away voters. That is why his two rivals -- five-term lawmaker Won Yoo-chul and four-term legislator Shin Sang-jin -- stress unity and a balanced leadership to navigate the party in this difficult time. So far, none of the three contenders have unveiled any concrete plan for reform. Their race has been a public display of internal feuds, with Hong not showing regard for his two contenders, who are not as known to the public and party members as he is. Hong boycotted a TV debate session with other candidates, saying the public is “disgusted by” the TV debates of politicians. The slogan for Monday’s national convention of the Liberty Korea Party is “We will change.” Yet, a reform that is bold and drastic enough to restore its past glory seems like a tall order, whoever comes out as the winner of the leadership race. By Jo He-rim","an acrostic poem contest ,avalanche of entries disparaging ,korea largest opposition party ,into major pr disaster ,acrostic poem contest","['the Liberty Korea Party ’s', 'South Korea ’s']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29025736  0.03189966

Speaking at his parliamentary confirmation hearing, the nominee also stressed that denuclearization is a prerequisite to the reinstatement of any inter-Korean business projects. “North Korea’s nuclear issue is closely related to a matter of survival for our nation,” Cho said in front of a panel of lawmakers. To bring about a change in the current standoff, “a bold and practical solution that involves all means is necessary,” he added.Cho Myoung-gyon, the nominee for South Korea`s unification minister, speaks to lawmakers at his confirmation hearing on June 29, 2017. Cho also underlined the Moon Jae-in administration’s two-track approach of dialogue and sanctions to explain its policy stance on the North. “The administration will come up with measures that can counter Pyongyang’s provocations and threats while alleviating the inter-Korean tension and recover dialogue.”“Cooperation with the international community will be also pursued.”Regarding Kaesong industrial park, a now-closed inter-Korean factory complex in the North, Cho said the issue of the North’s denuclearization should come before such exchanges, despite his belief that the reopening of the complex should be actively pursued. The joint complex, which lies in the border city of Kaesong, was shut down in 2016 by the previous government following North Korea’s series of nuclear and missile tests.“As North Korea’s nuclear issue is grave,  should come after some progress has been made over the nuclear standoff,” he said.The nominee also vowed to look into the possibility of establishing both official and non-official dialogue channels with Pyongyang and dispatching a special envoy to the North. Cho was a former presidential secretary for late President Roh Moo-hyun. He played a key role in inter-Korean negotiations for the factory complex and its launch in 2004. He retired in 2008 after taking part in several inter-Korean negotiations at the Unification Ministry. Parliamentary committee members also questioned Cho over a “deleted transcript” of the 2007 summit between President Roh and Pyongyang’s late strongman Kim Jong-il, which was speculated to contain Roh’s promise to relinquish the Northern Limit Line. He denied all allegations made against him. Cho was indicted, but was later acquitted at the local and appeals court. He is currently awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision. “Upon official appointment, I will make efforts to resolve the pain of the divided peninsula and prepare for the future of unification through a creative approach that reflects the current reality,” said Cho. Cho’s appointment does not require parliamentary approval.By Jung Min-kyung","north korea giving up ,korea giving up ,korea giving up on ,his parliamentary confirmation hearing ,korean business projects","['Cho Myoung - gyon', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean']",20,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.12082727 0.51914346 0.20003277],Jung Min-kyung,North Korea,6,2017,"business projects north korea nuclear ,korea nuclear issue is grave ,lawmakers at his confirmation hearing ,of north korea giving up ,made over the nuclear standoff","['Cho Myoung - gyon', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Cho', 'Cho Myoung - gyon', 'South korea`s', 'Cho', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Cho', 'North ’s', 'Kaesong', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Cho', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Cho', 'Roh', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Roh', 'the Northern Limit Line', 'Cho', 'the Supreme Court ’s', 'Cho', 'Cho']",5,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.12082727 0.51914346 0.20003277]

South Korean Army soldiers pay their respects to the six sailors killed in the 2002 inter-Korean naval skirmish at the Daejeon National Cemetry on June 27, 2017. The Navy is scheduled to hold a formal event later this week to mark the 15th anniversary of the battle. On June 29 during the 2002 Korea-Japan FIFA World Cup, two North Korean boats crossed the NLL, the de-facto sea border between the two Koreas. They suddenly opened fire on the Chamsuri-357 South Korean patrol ship, provoking it to return fire. One of the North Korean ships was heavily damaged and more than 30 North Koreans are believed to have been killed or wounded. Six South Korean sailors were killed and 19 others injured. The South's Navy later commissioned six high-speed patrol ships, equipped with guided missiles and named each after them, for patrol mission near the NLL.""The fathers of the six brave soldiers will be appointed as honorary captains of the ships in the 15th anniversary ceremony to be held at the Second Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek on Thursday,"" the Navy said.Yoon Doo-ho, the father of late Lt. Cdr. Yoon Young-ha, said, ""The bereaved families want just one thing. It's that the people forever remember all soldiers who made sacrifices for our country including the six sailors.""The 2002 skirmish served as a harsh reminder of the reality that the two Koreas are still technically at war as they have yet to sign a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.A similar inter-Korean naval battle took place on June 15, 1999, off the island of Yeonpyeong close to the NLL. Seven South Korean sailors were wounded.

This image, taken from the website of the National Baekdu-daegan Arboretum on June 28, 2017, shows a ""tiger forest"" at the arboretum on a mountain range near Bonghwa, a town in South Korea`s southeast province of North Gyeongsang. The relocation will come after the arboretum and the park sign a pact on cooperation in exchanges of endangered animals and plants.Another Siberian tiger will be transported to the forest in due course if Hancheong and Uri adapt to the new surroundings.In February, the service released Geumgang, an 11-year-old Siberian tiger, and another tiger named Duman, 15, into the forest. Both tigers are male, were donated by China, and were raised at the amusement park O-World in the city of Daejeon, central South Korea. However, Geumgang died of urine poisoning caused by chronic renal failure eight days after his release.Siberian tigers, also called Mount Paekdu tigers, are known to have last been captured in the wild on the Korean Peninsula in 1921.The forest service is scheduled to finish two to three months of training on the tigers for their reintroduction to the wild after the relocation and to open the arboretum to the public after September.  A 12-year-old female Siberian tiger named Hancheong, one of three that will be released into a ""tiger forest"" inside an arboretum in southeastern South Korea the next day on June 28, 2017. Choi Byung-am, head of the forest protection affairs bureau at the service, expected that ""by successfully relocating the Siberian tigers the service will show the public Siberian tigers romping around in the wild as well as preserve the animal that is at risk of extinction.""""We will also strengthen cooperation with Seoul Grand Park in the exchange and protection of endangered animal and plant genetic resources,"" Choi said.The tiger forest, the largest one displaying tigers in South Korea, is made similar to the surroundings of natural habitats where wild tigers live and has safety fences around it that keep the tigers from escaping to ensure the safety of visitors who are allowed to see them roaming in the wild.In South Korea, 50 Siberian tigers are raised in zoos nationwide.

But they won’t do it unless they see a massive global outcry,” the group, All Out, said on its campaign page. “Sign the petition and help stop the anti-gay hunt in South Korea.”Having opened Tuesday, the petition had collected over 23,000 signatures by Thursday afternoon.South Korea has long enforced a gay ban in the military, but recent cases have brought global attention to its anti-sodomy military law. In one such case, the military court last month sentenced a gay solider to six months in jail, suspended for a year, for having consensual sex with a same-sex solider in a private place.He was charged with violating the Military Criminal Act, which outlaws sodomy and other “disgraceful acts” in the armed forces, regardless of whether there was mutual consent, and carries a jail term of up to two years.The military human rights group says that in April, Army chief of staff Gen. Jang Jun-gyu ordered a measure to hunt for and identify gay soldiers. The military used dating apps to lure gay soldiers into outing themselves and put up to 50 people on its gay list through the crackdown, the group claimed. The Korean military has denied the allegations, saying it only investigated those involved in a video of two servicemen having sex posted via social media.“I urge you to drop the charges against the soldiers and repeal the discriminatory provision in Article 92-6 of the Military Criminal Code,” the petition reads.By Ock Hyun-ju","soldier crackdown global gay ,crackdown global gay rights ,gay soldier crackdown global ,crackdown on gay soldiers ,crackdown global gay","['South Korea', 'South Korea ’s']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.36332345  0.08949842

President Moon Jae-in delivers a speech in a ceremony marking the permanent shutdown of South Korea`s first nuclear reactor Kori-1 in Busan, 450 kilometers south of Seoul, on June 19, 2017. Moon said the closure of Kori-1, which played a pivotal role in responding to ever-increasing electricity demands during the fast industrial development era in the 1970s and ‘80s, heralds a fundamental shift in South Korea’s energy policy. “So far, our country’s energy policy has been focused on low price and efficiency only, thus neglecting the safety of the people or the sustainability of the natural environment,” he said.Though nuclear energy was an inevitable choice for a country heavily reliant on energy imports, it is now time to move on to a clean energy paradigm, the president said. A detailed roadmap is yet to be unveiled, but Moon has said last week that the government aims to generate 20 percent of power from clean and renewable sources by 2030, from today’s roughly 5 percent. South Korea produces 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear reactors  and thermal coal . Liquefied natural gas accounts for about 20 percent. Referring to the nuclear meltdown in Japan’s Fukushima in 2011 and the recent set of earthquakes on the Korean Peninsula, Moon warned the audience against the irreversible damages resulting from nuclear accidents.“The new government shall consider the nuclear safety issue as a national security agenda,” he said, pledging to promote the NSSC as a presidential body and to reinforce its independence and authority.The president also said that he would review the country’s nuclear policy altogether, seeking to call off the construction plans for new reactors and to gradually cease operation of outdated facilities.“Under any circumstances, the government will make it a strict rule to notify the people of anything which may be related to their life and safety,” Moon said.By Bae Hyun-jung","nuclear to renewables president ,reactors and phase out ,step towards nuclear free ,new nuclear reactors ,to renewables president moon","['Moon Jae - in', 'Kori-1', 'Republic of Korea', 'kori-1']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.60796767  0.72049898

The decision paved the way for the Seoul-based Korean Sharing Movement to help curb the spread of malaria in not only the epidemic-susceptible North but border regions in the South, for the first time in four years. The approval prompted more than 50 other civic groups to rush to file applications for contact with their respective North Korean counterparts, boosting optimism for a restart of stalled initiatives. The Unification Ministry has since granted an additional 27 requests as of Friday, including for religious exchanges. The hopes, however, are cooling quickly. About a week after Seoul’s approval, Pyongyang rejected a visit for the malaria project, taking issue with Seoul’s support for the UN Security Council’s latest resolution that expanded its blacklist of North Korean entities and individuals thought to be engaged in its nuclear and missile programs.North Korean workers transfer medical supplies donated and shipped by Eugene Bell Foundation in this handout photo.“We’re utterly baffled and disappointed,” Kang Young-sik, the KSM’s secretary-general, told The Korea Herald. The group had planned to ship quarantine supplies to the border city of Kaesong and travel to Pyongyang to discuss the program early this month. “We have no option but to wait. This should be resolved through government-to-government talks. A private organization like us has no power.”Political footballWith many North Koreans exposed to malnutrition, infectious diseases and moribund health care, civic groups at home and abroad have long carried out relief programs. But humanitarian assistance has in recent years become a source of debate as Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests dampen public sentiment toward inter-Korean projects. The Kim Jong-un regime may siphon off outside handouts to serve military and other unintended uses or fatten its own coffers, critics say. A major setback came in 2011 when then-President Lee Myung-bak imposed the so-called May 24 ban on virtually all cross-border exchanges including trade, investment and travel in response to the North’s attacks on a South Korean corvette and border island a year earlier. His successor Park Geun-hye had promised to restart humanitarian assistance in her first years, saying it should continue irrespective of political ups and downs, only to desert it following Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile test. Last year, the government only authorized the Eugene Bell Foundation, an international organization that offered to send tuberculosis medication. All other plans were refused, including for relief supplies to cope with what North Korean state media called its worst flood disaster since World War II, which left at least 528 killed or missing and another 107,000 homeless, according to the UN. “There had been consensus toward humanitarian aid until the Lee and Park administrations started developing the logic that it may help fund the nuclear program. Now it’s like if you support aid, you’re leftist and if you don’t, you’re rightist,” Kang said. “Given the several years of letup, it would naturally take some time to work things out. But to me, the North’s refusal seems the product of mistrust that’s been exacerbated by the government’s inconsistency.” The growing number of approvals points to the Moon administration’s resolve to reinstate the humanitarian principle, despite Pyongyang’s aloofness. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, who served in various top human rights-related posts at the UN, has also said that humanitarian aid to the North should be allowed separately from political consideration, calling it a “universal value of mankind.”Mindful of lingering skepticism, however, Unification Ministry officials said they would resume aid projects and other civilian exchanges “within the extent that does not undermine the framework of international sanctions, in a flexible manner.”But many relief groups argue that the sanctions are not meant to limit civilian humanitarian assistance, urging the government to settle on its position and present a clear guideline. “Theoretically, you may offer humanitarian aid even to a nation you’re at war with,” said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “Yes, there may be some ambiguity as to the interpretation of the sanctions, but it would not be problematic at all to help with fundamental needs such as extreme food shortages and medical and health care, in particular from the private sector.”Urgent needsTogether with Gyeonggi Province, the KSM has since 2008 been undertaking joint prevention projects with North Korean authorities, doling out fumigator trucks, diagnostic kits, mosquito nets, drugs and other supplies. The KSM’s primary concern is that malaria requires timely preventive activities given higher risks in summer, and therefore a delay would undercut their effects on both sides of the frontier. According to the provincial government, the number of malaria patients in border regions here sharply dropped from 1,616 in 2007 to 339 in 2013. Since the program’s halt in 2013, the figures have risen again, reaching 458 in 2014, 545 in 2015 and 492 in 2016. “Malaria prevention is a project that’s necessary for both Koreas, because disease and insect pests come and go across the border, so the work should be done in the North to ensure no one contracts malaria in the border areas in the South,” Kang said, adding the goods should be shipped no later than June. “We’ve been unable to carry out the activity for the past four years, and if this vacuum continues for a few more years, the figures would skyrocket again in both the North and South.” The Moon administration’s progressive stance toward humanitarian aid is raising hopes for not only fresh programs but also a rebirth of defunct initiatives. Among the groups awaiting approval from the ministry is ChildFund Korea, which has been providing nutrition, medicine and hospital refurbishment support for North Korean children since 2001.Following a 10-year hiatus, the fund is seeking to revive a plan to build a solar plant in the energy-strapped North, while crafting a new greenhouse project to help rural residents and their children grow vegetables themselves. “There have been various side effects since the May 24 sanctions, as most of our programs were nearly shut down, we lost many sponsors and the activists lost jobs,” said Kwak Young-joo, who oversees the group’s North Korea programs. Kwak, who also chairs the Korea NGO Council for Cooperation with North Korea, an association of 56 organizations running aid programs there, welcomed the policy shift but remains wary, saying the government’s attitude is too passive. “I think the premise itself is not right -- there are no sanctions at the UN against humanitarian support, so it should be ‘within the extent that upholds the framework of the international community’s humanitarian aid. This kind of expression hurts each other’s feelings,” he said. World Vision Korea, too, is gearing up to kick-start its existing agricultural project in the North after an on-site inspection. It runs five potato factories across the country and carries out joint research with local scientists to improve seeds and ramp up output. As a global nongovernmental organization, it has some foreign staff working in the country but the lack of South Korean participants has posed challenges, according to Lee Joo-sung, head of the group’s North Korea division. “The program is now in operation, though  not so smooth. What’s regrettable is that South Koreans have been unable to visit because the program is modeled here and without them it could not go easily,” he said. “South Korea’s humanitarian aid programs have significance in that they help achieve better understanding and a reconciliation between the two countries, and serve as a stepping stone to unification. And that’s something international NGOs cannot do.”Institutional frameworkTo minimize the political influence and ensure autonomy, relief groups stress the need to lay an institutional framework for humanitarian assistance, saying the Unification Ministry has almost absolute authority. Under the current system, South Korean individuals and entities are required to obtain the ministry’s approval to visit the North or communicate with its nationals on each occasion. Last December, Rep. Lee In-young of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea proposed a bill with the help of the groups’ association, calling for the formation of a public-private, nonpartisan committee to review and vote on aid programs and related policy. It would boost transparency, shore up South Korea’s existing legislation on North Korea human rights through a neutral implementation of humanitarian aid without linking it to the political and military situation, they said. “During last summer’s floods, people lost their homes and families and suffered from diseases. But the government did not let us provide relief supplies directly, so we had to resort to the International Committee of the Red Cross,” Kwak said. “If there was a legal and institutional basis, we could have been able to send support.” While making institutional efforts to improve the system, the government should encourage open debate such as with opposition parties at the National Assembly to foster national consensus on the issue, Lee at the University of North Korean Studies said. Stephen Linton, founder and chairman of the Eugene Bell Foundation, has also suggested Seoul reform the current one-off approval system into one under which it grants relief groups licenses and keeps tabs on aid supplies on a regular basis. “If the organization is not involved in any wrongdoing in North Korea and presents South Korea in a positive light, then the visitation rights to the North should be granted more flexibly,” he said at a news conference in Seoul on Thursday. “If we continue to sit and wait for a better world to come, these people will all die.”By Shin Hyon-hee  and Jung Min-kyung","indicating shift in seoul ,its first green light ,aid projects on may ,the epidemic susceptible north ,korean sharing movement to","['North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Korean Sharing Movement']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38710138  0.54660165

Constitutional Court chief-nominee Kim Yi-su speaks during a parliamentary confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on June 8, 2017. Constitutional Court chief-nominee Kim Yi-su has, in particular, been in the opposition camp's crosshairs due to what it calls his ""left-leaning"" streak and his rulings against pro-democracy fighters in the 1980s.A parliamentary panel in charge of vetting the nominee failed to adopt a report on the outcome of a confirmation hearing for Kim by the Monday deadline. After the deadline, National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, a former member of the ruling Democratic Party , can refer the confirmation motion to a plenary session -- slated for next Thursday -- for a full-house vote. But it remains uncertain whether he will take the step likely to trigger strong resistance from the opposition bloc. Opposition parties have become increasingly combative since Moon pressed ahead with the appointment of activist-professor Kim Sang-jo as Fair Trade Commission chairman Tuesday despite criticism about various allegations involving him and his family.Also in dispute is Land and Transport Minister nominee Kim Hyun-mee. Rival parties failed to adopt a hearing report on her Friday amid criticism over her alleged thesis plagiarism in 2001 and lack of expertise. She denied the accusations. Rival parties are also expected to lock horns over the government's proposal for an 11.2 trillion won  extra budget, a key tool for the new president to deliver on his pledge to create jobs for youth.Though Moon has stressed the urgency of the budget bill, opposition parties have opposed the bill to mainly create public-service jobs, saying it fails to meet the requirements set by the National Finance Act.The act stipulates an extra budget can be drawn up only in cases of war, massive natural disasters, economic recessions, mass unemployment or crucial changes in cross-border relations. The ruling party and government, however, see the current situation as posing the risk of mass unemployment.The DP is expected to push for a vote on the bill at a plenary session set for June 27.The passage of the bill requires consent from a majority of the lawmakers present for a vote that can be set up by half of all 299 lawmakers. The DP holds only 120 seats, far short of a majority.","political standoff over president ,standoff over president moon ,stoked fears that moon ,moon personnel choices political ,personnel choices political standoff","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.64027721  0.35260314

However, the hospital denied political consideration was the reason behind the rare decision. Kim Yon-su, vice president of SNUH, told a press conference that the death certificate of Baek Nam-gi will be revised following a monthslong discussion by the hospital’s ethics commission. Kim Yon-su, vice president of Seoul National University Hospital, speaks during a press breifing in Seoul on Thursday. “Doctors of neurosurgery accepted the ethics commission’s request to revise the death certificate yesterday,” Kim told reporters at a press briefing. Baek Sun-ha, the doctor who was in charge of Baek’s treatment, was not present at the briefing. The farmer, 69, died at SNUH in September last year after spending 10 months in a coma. Doctors had stated that his death was caused by an illness, sparking backlash. Critics and the bereaved family claimed that the hospital arrived at the conclusion due to the connection between former President Park Geun-hye and the hospital’s chief. At the time, the SNHU chief served as a personal doctor to Park. According to the hospital, the certificate will be changed to state that Baek’s death was the result of an external force. Kim explained that Baek died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a direct blast from a police water cannon at the rally in 2015. “Over the last six months, doctors at the ethics commission had a thorough discussion and reviewed perspectives from doctors and experts outside,” Kim said, adding that a compensation suit raised by the bereaved family in April had motivated the doctors to actively step up the discussion. “We decided to go with the directives of the Korean Medical Association on the proper way to fill out medical reports.”As for why it took so long, Kim cited the hierarchy among doctors and supervising professors, which had hampered different views on the diagnosis from being accepted. To prevent a similar situation from happening, the hospital has established an independent ethics commission for doctors to further discuss different views in diagnosis, Kim said. In October last year, students and alumni of the university’s medical school issued a statement calling the death certificate “incorrect.” But the hospital had not revised the death certificate. Due to the authorities and the bereaved family taking issue over whether to conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death, Baek’s funeral had been delayed for more than a month until early November.By Kim Da-sol","activist farmer died due ,november 2015 died due ,farmer died due to ,farmer died due ,snhu farmer knocked down","['Seoul National University Hospital', 'Kim Yon - su', 'snuh']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5126459   0.3182621

Kim took office on May 31, as the university’s first president elected through a direct vote of the faculty, administrative staff and students. The position had been left vacant by Choi Kyung-hee, who stepped down in October last year amid allegations that she gave admission favors to Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of former President Park Geun-hye’s longtime friend and confidante. The admission fraud was part of a sweeping corruption scandal surrounding Park which eventually led to her impeachment. The detained Choi is now on trial, along with four other school officials and professors. The new school chief was at the front of professors’ protests against the school’s leadership then led by Choi. “The key task is to build trust. The first thing I will do is to resolve conflicts among members of the school and lead them into the path of harmony and integration,” said Kim at the inauguration ceremony last month.Ewha is one of South Korea’s most prestigious educational institutions with its 130-year history. During her election campaign, Kim vowed to “return Ewha to its original state and restore its honor.” Kim’s term as university president is until February 2021.By Bak Se-hwan","womans university president ,womans university president kim ,ewha womans university president ,rebuild the elite school ,thursday vowed open communication","['Ewha Womans University', 'Kim Hei - sook']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31282145  0.48836619

The idea of holding a regular meeting with local government heads in a Cabinet meeting format was a pledge previously suggested by South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung during the primary season. Upon winning his candidacy for the Democratic Party of Korea, Moon pledged to realize this administrative vision on behalf of his former rival.During Wednesday’s meeting, Moon asked mayors and governors for their help in passing the pending supplementary budget bill, stressing that the fiscal plan would improve the labor environment in provinces.The central government last week submitted a bill to draw up an extra budget of 11.2 trillion won  aimed at creating some 810,000 new jobs in the public sector.But despite the president’s determined gestures, including his parliamentary address Monday, the budget plan currently remains in deadlock due to the majority opposition’s resistance.“Should the extra budget be arranged, 3.5 trillion won  is to be delivered to local governments in the form of local subsidies,” Moon said, requesting mayors and governors allocate the sum to job creation.“It is not within my authority to interfere  but I ask you to consider the purpose of the extra budget, which is to create as many jobs as possible and overcome the employment cliff faced by youths.”Among the 17 mayors and provincial governors present, the South Jeolla governor and South Gyeongsang governor posts were filled by acting officials. The two posts are currently vacant as former South Jeolla Gov. Lee Nak-yon was appointed as prime minister and former South Gyeongsang Gov. Hong Joon-pyo resigned in April to run in the presidential election in May. Attending the day’s meeting on behalf of the Cabinet and the presidential secretariat were Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Kim Dong-yeon, Interior Minister Hong Yun-sik, and presidential chief of staff Im Jong-seok and presidential chief of staff for policy Jang Ha-sung.By Bae Hyun-jung","election campaign season vowed ,local autonomy president moon ,election campaign season ,wednesday vowed efforts to ,moon vows efforts for","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.16557838  0.36162546

Opposition lawmakers are determined to grill the 62-year-old nominee over allegations of wrongdoing at a hearing Wednesday.  Even before the parliamentary process opened for Kang, the main opposition Liberty Korea Party demanded Tuesday that she give up on becoming minister. If she does not, the conservative party said it would stop her from taking the job.“Kang is receiving so many legal and ethical suspicions which makes it difficult for her to earn the trust of the nation,” said Liberty Korea Party Rep. Yoon Young-seok, who sits on the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. “Either President Moon Jae-in needs to retract her nomination or Kang has to drop out.”Lawmakers from other opposition parties -- the People’s Party and Bareun Party -- are also intensifying their criticism of the nominee. Despite their objections, the parties have no formal powers to block her nomination. Kang’s appointment does not require National Assembly approval, but Moon will be under immense political pressure not to heed the report on her qualification to be presented by the Assembly after the hearing. Three opposition parties together hold 167 of the 299 seats. The bleak outlook is in contrast to initial positive reactions to her May 21 nomination. She won praise as the first female nominee, and for climbing the ladder of the notoriously-exclusive Foreign Ministry as an outsider -- she joined the ministry in 1999 without passing the state exam for career diplomats. Her experience in both the global and domestic arena added to her credentials. In the past two weeks, however, media have been digging up dirt based on accusations by opposition lawmakers. The allegations include the registration of a false address for her daughter’s education, underpaying real estate taxes, improper use of national health insurance and her daughters’ evasion of gift taxes. The nominee has personally apologized for falsely registering her address to get her daughter into her alma mater, but stood firm on the other accusations. Her daughters paid gift taxes in full after the announcement of her nomination and she was cleared of the accusations of attempting to avoid property tax and free riding on health insurance by the relevant government authorities. Amid the barrage of attacks on Kang, her supporters are also speaking up. Her policy vision, unique experience in the UN, and South Korea’s monthslong diplomatic leadership vacuum should all be taken into account when judging whether she is the right person for the job, they argue. Oh Joon, a former South Korean ambassador to the UN, expressed his support for Kang through social media, saying, “I know Foreign Minister nominee Kang inside and outside of work and at the UN, she has managed to receive the most positive evaluations I’ve ever heard.”The former ambassador emphasized that it was time for South Korea to have its first female foreign minister. Former Floor Leader of the People’s Party Park Jie-won also praised the nominee for her competence in a radio interview. “I personally believe she is right for the job despite the growing irregularities surrounding her,” he said. “She carries fresh qualities as a female nominee and a non-exam diplomat.” The ruling Democratic Party of Korea said despite the alleged irregularities, no major defect has been found in Kang’s credentials to make her unfit for the job. Now, it seems how well Kang fends off attacks from opposition lawmakers at Wednesday’s hearing -- to be livestreamed online and broadcast on TV -- will determine whether or not she will take the job.

On Friday, the Chinese government said the driver, Cong Weizi, set alight a bus carrying 11 kindergarten students and a teacher inside the Taojiakuang Tunnel in Weihai, a city in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong, on May 9. Ten of the kindergarteners were South Korean.The Shandong provincial police agency has told a press conference at a Weihai hotel that Cong bought a lighter and gas, stashed them in the bus, and lit it all on the day of the bus fire, one day after he was dissatisfied because the school gave him a dismissal notice.In the arson attack that also killed Cong, he was found dead in the aisle of the bus, not in the driver's seat, causing the local police to believe that Cong was putting on a show of trying to rescue the children at the time of the fire, they said.The local police are also quoted as saying the driver chose to commit the act of arson during the rush hour, making it difficult for firefighting authorities to come to the scene so that they would be kept in the dark about the cause of the incident.Cong is also accused of having switched to low gear rather than the neutral gear that most drivers would choose in an emergency. Cong's switch to low gear is suspected as being done to keep the victims from evacuating the bus.The local police believe that Cong pretended to act like a victim just to get damages from the incident.The bereaved family members of the killed children have accepted the investigation results following two rounds of explanations the police gave about the incident, paving the way for the Chinese authorities to engage in negotiations with the bereaved families of the victims on how to hold funerals and give them compensation.The South Korean consulate general in Qingdao said it will support the families in the compensation talks by contacting the Chinese government and the Shangdong regional government.","for fatal bus fire ,fatal bus fire posed ,responsible for fatal bus ,bus fire that killed ,fatal bus fire","['BEIJING', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Shandong']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36742011 -0.00897095

According to Cheong Wa Dae, Wee ordered the fact that four THAAD launchers were in store at a US military base in South Korea to be removed from the Ministry of National Defense’s report to the presidential transition team on May 25. For his role, Wee will be excluded from his official duties.Deputy Minister for Defense Policy Wee Seung-ho “In the process of reviewing the report, Deputy Minister for Defense Policy Wee Seung-ho ordered phrases  to be deleted,” Yoon Young-chan, chief presidential press secretary, said, saying that the initial draft clearly stated that six THAAD launchers were in South Korea, four of which were stored at a US military base. The draft was first compiled before the presidential election, Yoon said, adding that the motives for withholding information is still unclear. Yoon added that the phrases were replaced with ambiguous wording designed to prevent those being briefed from fully understanding the situation in the final version. According to Cheong Wa Dae, Wee claimed that the details were removed due to an agreement with the US military to maintain secrecy, and that he had planned to give an oral report elaborating on the details. “ is an issue separate from the commander in chief. It has been confirmed that the introduction of additional launchers were reported to the previous administration, and the acting president was aware of the issue.” Yoon said that President Moon Jae-in ordered further investigation into the matter, which will be conducted by the Defense Ministry, and if necessary by the Board of Audit and Inspection. Yoon also revealed that former acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, and former and current officials including Defense Minister Han Min-koo will not be subjected to further investigation or questioning by the presidential office.The presidential office also revealed that the Defense Ministry deliberately arranged the processes involved in the deployment of THAAD to avoid a full environmental impact study. According to Cheong Wa Dae, the Defense Ministry limited the first stage of land handed over for THAAD deployment to under 330,000 square-meters to bypass local environmental laws. In the Defense Ministry’s land handover plans, drawn up on Nov. 25, 329,770 square-meters of land would be handed over to the US military in the first stage. The land designated to be handed over first is in the form of an inverted U in order to exclude the land that falls in the center from the initial handover, the presidential office said.

Cheong Wa Dae, the government and the ruling Democratic Party of Korea on Monday announced a plan to upgrade the agency to a ministerial-level organization as part of their plan to restructure the administration.Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon “The status of the Veteran Affairs Ministry needs to be strengthened in order to expand democratic values enshrined in the Constitution and raise the level of treatment of veterans,” Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon, chief of the party’s policy committee, said after a three-way meeting. The plan is expected to provide impetus for a reform initiative led by the agency’s new chief, retired Lt. Col. Pi Woo-jin. She pledged to break away from her predecessors from the military, many of whom were accused of promoting right-leaning ideological projects and sometimes chauvinistic ideas while putting policy support for war veterans on the back burner. The ministry was created in 1961 as a state body tasked with looking after war veterans and retired soldiers. But the status of the organization has often changed depending on the administration’s political lines. The organization was a ministerial-level agency until 1998, when then-President Kim Dae-jung decided to reduce its status. Kim’s successor Roh Moo-hyun reinstated its previous status in 2004, only to be lowered again by Roh’s successor Lee Myung-bak in 2008. “I’m hoping there will be no more changes to the status of our organization. Regardless of who takes power and what kinds of ideology he or she has, supporting veterans should continue,” a ministry official said on condition of anonymity. Since taking office on May 17, Pi has announced a series of programs aiming to focus on her duty: expanding support for the veterans. In an official report to Cheong Wa Dae last Tuesday, the ministry said it would provide veterans with more benefits in medical services and social welfare. Pi also vowed to overhaul the military education system implemented during the tenure of her predecessor, retired Lt. Gen. Park Sung-choon, who sparked controversy for advocating extreme, right-wing ideology during previous conservative governments. “I’m going to overhaul the controversial education system entirely. National security is not something to be taught in a top-down, one-sided manner. We are going to help the people realize democratic values and appreciate the significance of them,” Pi said on May 30.By Yeo Jun-suk","upgrade boosts hopes for ,korea on monday announced ,for reform at veterans ,boosts hopes for reform ,announced plan to upgrade","['the Ministry of Patriots', 'Veterans Affairs', 'Democratic Party of Korea']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25798047  0.2269986

I enjoy looking around and applying testers of makeup products,” said the fifth grader at a Seoul elementary school. “I feel like an idol star .” Lee said she has secretly bought three cosmetic products -- a sunblock, lip stain and powder compact -- with what she saved from allowance money.In South Korea, where many believe good looks can lead to good jobs, good marriages and a better life, makeup is no longer an adult thing. Many young teens are taking an early interest in outward beauty and ways to augment their own looks.A teenager tries on makeup in a cosmetics shop based in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province. “There is no girl in our class who doesn’t put on makeup,” said Park Da-eun, a 12-year-old sixth grade student. “I want to follow what my friends do and look pretty.”According to a 2015 survey, conducted by local educational broadcaster EBS, 91.6 percent of elementary students said that they have an experience of wearing makeup. Among them, 75 percent answered they have their own cosmetics.Another study by ChildFund Korea in 2015 found that female students aged between 10 and 12 owned two or three cosmetics of their own on average. Most carried lip stains, blushers or “BB creams” . Some even had eyeliners and mascaras. For cosmetics makers, this has meant a whole business opportunity. As of last year, the cosmetics market for teens and those in their early 20s is estimated to be worth 300 billion won . “Teenagers are the main customer base of our shop. Young kids looking like elementary school students visit the store often,” said Moon Kyung-sun, an employee at a cosmetics shop based in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province. “They mostly buy color cosmetics like lip stains.” Makeup for teenagers is displayed in a cosmetics shop based in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province. Startled by the fast growth of this particular market, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced in January that it will set guidelines for children’s cosmetics, adding a new category of “for use by kids aged 13 or below” to the existing types of cosmetics items available. Currently, there are 12 cosmetics categories, all of them for adults, except only one for infants aged 3 or below. The new category will go into effect from September. “As the age group using makeup products is getting younger and younger, regulation for children’s cosmetics became essential,” said Lee So-hyang, a ministry official. Under the new regulation, the manufacturers will be required to label the allergenic ingredients contained in cosmetics for children, much stricter than those for adults. It will also increase the frequency of monitoring children’s products on sale, the ministry said.The government’s move, however, sparked controversy among parents and civic groups over whether teens should be acknowledged as cosmetics consumers, or more fundamentally, whether it is right to allow them to wear makeup. “I’m worried for my 12 year-old daughter. Too much makeup could do harm to her skin,” said a 48-year-old mother, surnamed Choi. “Although I tell her to stop , I can’t help it since she imitates her friends putting on makeup at school.”Another mother surnamed Lee said girls that age need to learn first that beauty is not just about how they look. “The society is so fixed on outward beauty. I worry that our girls are getting an unnecessary early exposure to society’s lookism standards,” she stressed. “We may not be able to stop the trend, but why promote it?” Makeup for teenagers is displayed in a cosmetics shop based in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province. Mimicking what adults do is a natural process of children growing up, some point out. “Symbolic play is a process of children getting socialized and is a normal behavior during their development stage,” said Kim Tae-hoon, a professor of psychiatry at Yonsei University. “Since the mass media largely influence the youth, they are willing to imitate the stylish appearance of idol stars featured on television rather than to make themselves look pretty,” he added.The use of cosmetics products at an early age can lead to skin problems and even precocious puberty, medical experts warned, noting that some cheap products targeting teens might contain a high level of toxic chemicals.“When skin absorbs toxic chemicals like heavy metals contained in makeup products, an excessive amount of female hormones is produced, which causes precocious puberty,” said a doctor of Korean Medicine Seong Jin-hyuk. “Children with precocious puberty are more likely to get female disorders, including menstrual irregularity, sterility or breast cancer.”“As the skin of children is more sensitive than that of an adult, chemicals such as colorants and preservatives may irritate the skin and cause dermatological troubles such as itching or rash,” said Suh Dae-hun, a dermatologist professor at Seoul National University Hospital.He also added that makeup is not recommended to youngsters because secretion of sebum increases during adolescence. “But if one still chooses to buy children cosmetic products, make sure that the products are mild and safe by checking the ingredients contained in products thoroughly,” Suh said. “They should avoid harmful substances such as coal tar-derived colors.”The doctor also suggested to cleanse the face properly afterward as makeup residues may block the pores and cause a rash or dermatitis.By Byun Hee-jin","fun watching makeup tutorials ,cosmetics online my friends ,secretly bought three cosmetic ,watching makeup tutorials ,idol star after applying","['Lee Ji - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Lee']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59763175  0.09958542

Dubbed the “no work after 6” bill, the legislative proposal aims to address the widespread workplace culture in South Korea where those who finish work at 6 p.m., or the time stipulated in their contract, are deemed less devoted and loyal. Many Korean workers remain in the office after official work hours are over, waiting until their superiors leave.At least two proposals, submitted by lawmakers of the liberal Democratic Party and the conservative Bareun Party, are currently pending at the National Assembly. Although they differ on some details, the bills would effectively compel employers to keep a record of their employees’ working hours in order to eradicate unnecessary overtime work. Any form of work-related contact after hours -- phone calls, text messages and social media contact -- are to be regarded as work orders and would therefore trigger employers’ obligation for overtime payment. In the recent presidential election, four of the five main candidates included those measures in their manifestos. The only exception was Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party. The hard-line conservative party, along with the business circles, has largely been against the plan. The main conservative party’s claim is that the working hours rule should be introduced gradually, starting first with large companies and then moving on to smaller ones.“I agree that weekend labor should be included in the extended working hours count, but a grace period is needed,” said Rep. Shin Bo-ra of the Liberty Korea Party.The four parties in favor of the plan control at least 186 votes of the current 299-member parliament.By Bae Hyun-jung","wednesday the presidential office ,issue in june parliament ,track wednesday the presidential ,bills reflecting president moon ,after bill the legislative",['Moon Jae - in'],20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.45931411  0.21591145

This image shows National Intelligence Service director-nominee Suh Hoon speaking during a parliamentary hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul. ""Today, we will strongly call for reform and keep on checking it,"" Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the ruling Democratic Party, a senior member of the committee's subpanel in charge of security affairs, told reporters.""There are more than 100 things such as personnel, organizational structure and budgets ... We will check each and every one of them,"" he added. The NIS reform was among Moon's key campaign pledges. He vowed to remove the NIS role in gleaning domestic intelligence and reshape the agency into an entity mainly dealing with overseas security intelligence affairs involving North Korea, terrorism and international crimes.The president has tapped Suh Hoon as the NIS chief just hours after his inauguration on May 10.During his parliamentary confirmation hearing earlier this week, he pledged try to completely insulate the agency from domestic politics as pledged by Moon. He also vowed to seek to foster bipartisan cooperation through a regular security briefing for parliamentary leaders.Suh is known for his role in preparing for the landmark inter-Korean summits held in June 2000 and October 2007 -- a reason why Moon's nomination of Suh is seen as a move to enhance cross-border ties frayed amid Pyongyang's relentless provocations.","sweeping reform of spy ,spy agency president moon ,advisory panel on wednesday ,reform of spy agency ,wednesday called for wholesale","['Moon Jae - in', 'the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee', 'the National Intelligence Service']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.22805871  0.32278946

Philosophy professor Kim Hei-sook was formally appointed Friday by the board of directors as the new president, the Seoul-based school said. She received 57.3 percent of the votes in the final round of the election held Thursday, it added. Kim, 62, will assume the top post left vacant for seven months after Choi Kyung-hee stepped down amid fierce protests from Ewha students. The former chief is now on trial for her alleged role in giving special treatment to Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of former President Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. It was the first time that the school picked its leader through a direct election participated by all its members, since its foundation in 1886. Over 1,000 alumni also cast their ballots. “I will return Ewha to its original state and restore its honor,” said Kim whose term as the school’s president will begin on May 31 and end on Feb. 28, 2021. “The key task is to build trust. The first thing I will do is to resolve conflicts among members of the school and lead them into the path of harmony and integration.”Ewha, South Korea’s longest-running university, suffered from a bitter confrontation between the school leadership and students over a number of issues in the past year. But the heaviest blow came from the scandal involving the former president. Chung, a former national dressage player, was illegally admitted to the school and was given special treatment in grades, investigations by the Education Ministry and state prosecutors have found. Amid the turmoil, Kim was at the forefront of organizing professors to hold a rally against the school’s previous leadership led by Choi Kyung-hee, which was the first of its kind in the school’s 130-year history. The university’s former president and other professors are now standing trial on suspicions. President Park was impeached for corruption and abuse of power in early March and is also being tried in the same court with her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Chung, Choi Soon-sil’s daughter, is likely to be extradited from Denmark where she was arrested for illegal stay and face investigation here. Kim has been teaching at Ewha University since 1987. She received an undergraduate degree in English Literature from the university and a Ph.D. degree in philosophy from the University of Chicago. By Ock Hyun-ju","first directly elected president ,elected president ewha womans ,elected its new president ,first ever direct vote ,womans university has elected","['Ewha Womans University', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Hei - sook', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Kim Hei - sook']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39970857  0.53737456

201,201,Fall in Japanese tourists adds woes to sagging local tourism,"The drop in Japanese tourists last month is adding concerns to the faltering local tourism industry already reeling from a dearth of Chinese visitors amid diplomatic jitters with neighboring country, industry and government sources said Thursday.

Some 165,700 visitors from Japan came to South Korea in April, down 5.4 percent from a year earlier, according to the latest data release by the Korea Tourism Organization.  The tally on Japanese travelers had been on an upturn since February last year, when it rebounded for the first time in more than three years. Growing security concerns on the Korean Peninsula in the wake of the latest series of missile tests by North Korea over the past two months has probably caused Japanese visitors to shun Seoul, the state tourism agency said. The bulk of cancellations came apparently from schools that had planned on coming on field trips here, according to the KTO. The decline from Japan deals a blow to the local tourism sector that has been hit hard after China banned travel agencies from selling South Korea-bound trips from mid-March. Seoul's deployment of a US anti-missile system, or THAAD, has angered Beijing who sees it as a threat to its own security. With the number of Chinese visitors more than halved compared to a year ago, boosting Japanese demand has been one of key plans for the government to revitalize the tourism sector. The government has set a string of initiatives aimed at fueling tourism, with a focus on diversifying tourist portfolios to other Asian countries instead of relying too heavily on China. In contrast, the number of outbound visitors to Japan jumped 56.8 percent on-year to 554,600 in April from the previous year, according to government data.","the faltering local tourism ,fall in japanese tourists ,faltering local tourism industry ,drop in japanese tourists ,sagging local tourism","['japanese', 'chinese', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Tourism Organization']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.4871529   0.59923458

An independent fact-finding committee investigating the disaster, which killed over 300 passengers, is set to meet Friday to discuss how to proceed with their probe. The special body, launched in April with eight members appointed by the National Assembly, said that it will review data restored from 3-4 mobile phones, collected from the site of the sinking and inside the salvaged ferry.Workers search through the wreckage of the Sewol ferry at the port of Mokpo, South Jeolla Province, Wednesday. It was not immediately known what kind of data was retrieved, but hopes are growing for photos or videos containing fresh evidence of what caused the tragedy and why so many were not rescued. “We will have an in-depth discussion during the meeting on measures to efficiently recover remains and make use of digital forensic technology,” said Kim Chang-joon, chief of the special committee.A search team has been combing the insides of the heavily corroded passenger ship, lifted out of water in late March and now sitting on dry ground of Mokpo Port. Several human bones have been found, and the identity of two victims were confirmed as of Wednesday.A British marine surveying firm Brookes Bell had conducted an initial survey of the hull in early April. So far, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries handed a total of 77 electronic devices retrieved from the Sewol ferry to the committee, which includes mobile phones, digital camera, vehicles black box and GPS tracking system.But due to budget deficit, the special committee said it only requested data restoration to private experts for 15 mobile phones.Meanwhile, with the search operation accelerating both inside the raised Sewol ferry and underwater by divers simultaneously, workers said more remains and personal belongings were found from the ship’s interior.The ministry said that a passport of Lee Young-sook, one of the nine victims who went missing in the 2014 disaster, was found late Tuesday near where remains of a person wearing a life jacket were recovered Monday. “What we can say for now is that Lee’s passport was found among pieces of bones collected Monday, as we need identification process of bones with National Forensic Service,” said Kim Cheol-hong, a ministry official in charge of the search operation. As of Wednesday, search teams have completed about 50 percent of a search into the third and fourth deck of the ferry, where passenger cabins are located. The ministry said the workers have cut off parts of an escalator on the third floor and cleared obstacles to gain access to the rest of the cabin on the third deck.So far, among the remains found during the search operation, the identity of two victims -- a Danwon High School teacher Go Chang-suk and a student Heo Da-yoon -- have been confirmed.By Kim Da-sol","about the 2014 sinking ,meet friday to discuss ,killed over 300 passengers ,wreckage recovered missing victims ,the 2014 sinking",[],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37944144  0.4839181

President Moon Jae-in demonstrates how to read key job-related indicators displayed on a new electronic bulletin board installed in one of his offices at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on May 24, 2017. The 18 key indicators also include the wage gap between regular and irregular workers, according to Cheong Wa Dae. Moon's key election pledges included creating as many as 810,000 new jobs in the public sector alone.He has also promised to create new ""quality jobs,"" which he later explained will include turning all irregular job openings in the public sector into regular, full-time employment.Moon's first order since taking office on May 10 was to create a new presidential committee on jobs.Again highlighting his emphasis on job creation, the president has also created a new post for a senior Cheong Wa Dae official for jobs.The country's unemployment rate has remained rather high. Its jobless rate came to 4.2 percent in April, up 0.3 percentage point from a year earlier.Job conditions for the youth, however, remain alarmingly worrisome.The jobless rate of people aged between 15 and 29 years came to 11.2 percent last month, the second-highest level in the country's history after 11.3 percent tallied in February, the government said earlier.In his latest personnel reshuffle, the president named his new chief of staff for policy, a newly created post in charge of economic policies.The new presidential official's main task, Moon has said, is to create new jobs and spearhead income-based growth.","emphasis the new president ,installed new electric bulletin ,on jobs highlights president ,new president and his ,new president","['Cheong', 'Dae', 'Moon Jae - in']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.33197787  0.42990023

Fulfilling his pledge to honor Roh’s death as the nation’s president, Moon said it would be his last time attending the memorial during his term, gesturing at moving away from the deep division over the former leader who committed suicide eight years ago. “I am deeply thankful that I was able to keep the promise I made during the election season that I should attend today’s memorial ceremony as president,” said Moon in his memorial address.President Moon Jae-in speaks at a memorial service for late former President Roh Moo-hyun in Bongha, Roh's hometown, located 450 kilometers southeast of Seoul in South Gyeongsang Province, on May 23, 2017. “This is to be the last time that I attend your memorial ceremony as president. I promise I will return to see you, after completing my mission as a successful president,” said the president, vowing to carry on the legacy of the Roh administration. The event was held in the late Roh’s retirement home of Bongha Village, South Gyeongsang Province, marking eight years since he jumped to his death amid a corruption investigation, which some claimed as being politically motivated by the succeeding conservative administration, on May 23, 2009.It was eight years ago this day at 10:50 a.m. that Moon, then a lawyer and retired presidential aide, delivered the news of the tragedy to reporters at Pusan National University Hospital.This year, the memorial day attracted the largest crowd ever, with some 15,000 participating in the ceremony and 50,000 visiting the village as of 4 p.m., according to officials of the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation.Though the official ceremony started at 2 p.m., citizens dressed in formal black suits with a touch of yellow -- Roh’s signature color -- flocked to Bongha from early in the morning to pay their respects to the late state chief. “We took an early morning express train from Seoul to meet both Roh and Moon,” Jeong Bok-deuk, 72, told The Korea Herald. Her friend Kang Gwang-sook, added that it was “delightful yet painful” to commemorate Roh’s death this year.Families, especially parents with young children, were spotted waiting hours under the afternoon sun to pay their respects. “Today is different from  previous years. This huge crowd is a bit of a chaos but  still is fulfilling,” said Park Nam-jin, a father who was pushing his baby daughter’s stroller.“I feel as if the huge weight that had piled up in the past decade of conservative administrations has finally been lifted off my shoulders.”Around the site of the event and all throughout the village were banners by Roh supporters, congratulating Moon on his rise to presidency and expressing hope that he would achieve the unfinished mission of his predecessor.Among the political figures who showed up to pay respects were National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and Secretary-General Woo Yoon-keun, as well as the leadership members of Moon’s Democratic Party of Korea, the minority conservative Bareun Party and the progressive Justice Party.The main conservative Liberty Korea Party’s chief Rep. Chung Woo-taik, however, refused to attend and sent the party’s secretary-general instead, hinting at disapproval over the occasion.In the later part of the ceremony, the participants sang alongto “March for the Beloved,” a song symbolic of the democratic spirit and of the 1980 uprising in Gwangju. It was President Moon’s decision that the song, which has long remained in dispute due to backlash from conservatives, should officially be sung in unison to mark the democratization movement.After the ceremony, Moon moved to Roh’s grave where he paid a silent tribute before bidding farewell to the bereaved family and aides.During his speech, the president reiterated his earlier pledge to “eradicate accumulated evils” and to restore decency in the nation.“Since Roh’s fall, our society and politics have retrogressed into the abnormal, growing away from the people’s hope. But his dreams have been revived by the power of the citizens, and from now own, we shall never fail again,” Moon said.He then shifted his focus to unity, gesturing at moving away from the factional disputes which have long divided the conservative and the progressive, the pro-Roh and the non-Roh, the ruling party and the opposition.“This is to be the last time that I attend this event as a standing president,” Moon said, vowing to keep away from the yearly memorial ceremony during the rest of his five-year term.“I promise that I will return to see you, after completing my duty as a successful president.”By Bae Hyun-jung  and Jo He-rim","on tuesday bid farewell ,mentor former president roh ,tuesday bid farewell ,tuesday bid farewell to ,mentor former president","['SEOUL', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', 'Moon']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.49416536  0.276048

But in reality, it looked more like an old guards’ network in which retired generals were handpicked from their own exclusive inner circles and devoted most of their tenure to promoting chauvinistic ideas.The decadeslong tradition may come to an end, with a new chief -- who is drastically different from predecessors -- taking office Thursday. Pi Woo-jin, who was sworn in as the new minister, is a woman, progressive by political identity and who retired from the Army as a field officer, not a general. And she has a record of suing the military authority and winning against it.Retired Army Lt. Col. Pee Woo-jin speaks to reporters after a press conference at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Wednesday. Her focus on veteran affairs, she said during her inauguration ceremony, will be the veterans, only. “My focus on veteran affairs will be centered on veteran families,” Pi, a former Army lieutenant colonel, said during her inauguration speech at the government complex in Sejong city. She also vowed to work for national unity, apparently mindful of the past controversies involving the ministry under her predecessors.  Under the tenure of Ret. Gen. Park Sung-choon, who served between 2011 and 2017, the ministry was blamed for fueling an ideological divide, with Park banning a song commemorating the victims of the May 18 democratic uprising and igniting outrage from the victims’ families and liberal activists. Commissioned as an Army officer in 1978, Pi served in various roles until she left the army in 2009. She was a first-generation female Army helicopter pilot, a position that has rarely been assigned to female officers. During her 30-year career, she has spoken out against deep-rooted barriers against female soldiers and pervasive sexual harassment by male superiors. One of the most well-known cases is her legal battle with the Defense Ministry over its decision to discharge Pi in 2005 after she developed breast cancer and underwent treatment. After a three-year legal fight, she was able to return to the Army. “It was wrong to force me to discharge because I don’t have any trouble performing my duties,” she said in a media interview after the trial. Cancer developed in only one of her breasts, but she later removed the other because “it was bothersome when working at a military job.” Her case sparked criticism over the military’s forced discharge against those with a serious illness. In 2007, the Defense Ministry changed its rules, allowing the injured or diseased soldiers to continue their service in the military.She has also advocated female soldiers’ rights in the military, where superior jobs are often dominated by male soldiers who belittle female subordinates, treating them as if they should entertain male superiors. In an interview with a local magazine in 2006, Pi said she was removed from her post after protesting against her commander, who had ordered her to bring a young female non-commissioned officer to a drinking party. Notorious for inviting female non-commissioned officers to his drinking parties, the commander, Pi said, had asked her to send the officer in “fancy clothes.” Upon hearing the order, she instructed the officer to wear a battle dress uniform. “What I expected of the Army is to create an environment where every female solider can follow the military career the same way as male soldiers can. I will fight to the end until I see that no single female soldier is discriminated against in the military,” Pi said in the interview.By Yeo Jun-suk","retired generals were handpicked ,war veterans and retired ,veteran affairs chief breaks ,retired generals ,veterans and retired solders",[],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39099127  0.30783263

Researchers from two cybersecurity providers, US software company Symantec and the Russian-based Kaspersky Lab, said that some of the code found in the latest “WannaCry” ransomware was nearly identical to code used by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean-run hacking operation. An early version of WannaCry is similar to the code used in a 2015 backdoor created by Lazarus Group, which was implicated in a cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and an $81 million heist on a Bangladeshi bank in 2016. The group has allegedly used Bitcoin in their hacking operation.“This is the best clue we have seen to date as to the origins of WannaCry,” Kaspersky Lab researcher Kurt Baumgartner told Reuters.Choi Sang-myung, security researcher at Seoul-based software firm Hauri, echoed the view, saying the ransomware attack is attributable to North Korea because they have used their own cryptic hacking logics that have never been found in other malware. US-based security researchers, however, stuck a more cautious tone, saying the indication is far from conclusive. The researchers said while they did not rule out North Korea as a suspect, it is too early to confirm the link. Eric Chien, an investigator at Symantec, told The New York Times, that all the findings are “a temporal link.” FireEye researcher John Miller told Reuters that the similarities are “not enough to be strongly suggestive of a common operator.” The connection was first hinted by Google security researcher Neal Mehta, who posted a cryptic tweet containing only a set of characters. They referred to two portions of code in a pair of malware samples, suggesting potential evidence linking North Korea to the ransomware attack. The cyberattack, which has crippled around 300,000 computer systems in more than 150 nations since Friday, came amid international condemnation against North Korea’s test-firing of a new type of ballistic missile on Sunday, which Pyongyang said is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Noting that the attack coincided with North Korea’s missile launch, South Korean security experts suggested that the communist regime might have used the attack as an opportunity to demonstrate their capability to defy international pressure against its nuclear ambitions. “I think there was political motive for North Korea to demonstrate their willingness in time for the establishment of a new government ,” said Im Chong-in, professor at Graduate School of Information Security at Seoul-based Korea University. “North Korea is quite likely to use ransomware to secure foreign currency.”Security Researcher Choi agreed with the idea, saying that North Korea had manufactured ransomware since last August and the cyberattack served as a “perfect opportunity” for the regime to show off their cyber and military capability.By Yeo Jun-suk","weekend cyber security experts ,korea behind ransomware attack ,latest attack and hacking ,the weekend cyber security ,ransomware attack experts north","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Symantec', 'Russian', 'Kaspersky Lab', 'WannaCry']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1898098   0.58810627

The ministry said the nine missing bodies are believed to be in that area.Flowers and letters are put on desks in a classroom to remember students who are still missing after the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, fostered by the Ansan Office of Education in Gyeonggi Province. On Saturday, 16 pieces of human bone were found in mud collected from Sewol’s fourth deck, marking the first major discoveries since operators began examining the ship on April 18.Some of the fragments were assumed to be from Cho Eun-hwa, a female Danwon High School student, based on a comparison of a gold tooth found from remains and Cho’s past dental records. The bereaved family identified the remains and agreed they were from Cho.But the ministry has yet to confirm the notion, saying the inspection has just entered its initial stage.“Workers continued to find multiple pieces of human bones as they searched manually through bags of mud retrieved from the fourth deck, but it is hard to determine that the remains are from the nine missing passengers,” said a ministry official.“We can only identify the bones after DNA results come out.”The bones will be transferred to the National Forensic Service for DNA tests. The results will come out in a month, the ministry said. According to workers, the remains of another female student might be near where those remains were discovered. They have completed 85 percent of a search of the ship’s interior on the fourth deck close to the stern of the ship.Since the raised wreck’s interior is filled with mud and obstacles, authorities said workers will drill more holes from the fifth deck to gain access to more bedrooms and the women’s bathroom on the fourth deck. If the NFS’ detailed investigation confirms the identity of the remains, the search team will still need to find the remains of eight more victims, including three Danwon High School students.As of Sunday, 2,630 bags of mud had been removed during a search of the ship’s interior so far. From them, workers have sifted through to find 1,585 personal belongings, including school bags, pens, wallets and cellphones.The Sewol ferry sank on April 16, 2014 off Korea’s southwestern coast while on its way to the Jeju Island. A total of 304 people, most of them high school students on an excursion, died in the tragedy.The ship, which had remained at the bottom of the sea since then, was brought to land last month following a difficult salvage operation. But the ministry and search operators have been criticized for making little progress in finding and identifying the nine bodies still unaccounted for.By Kim Da-sol","sewol ferry on sunday ,floor bedrooms at sunday ,sunday the search team ,ferry on sunday ,and fisheries said sunday","['the Ministry of Oceans', 'Fisheries']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33381543  0.54897833

Moon's promises include shortening the service period for conscripted soldiers to 18 months from the current 21. All able-bodied South Korean male adults are obliged to serve in the military.The official stressed that the ministry will do its best for national security in respect of the commander-in-chief's policy.The new South Korean leader is expected to push for a far-reaching reform of the country's armed forces in order to counter North Korean military threats more powerfully and efficiently.He supports an increase of the country's defense budgets to around 3 percent of the gross domestic product, tallied at US$1.47 trillion, from the 2.4 percent now.It's aimed at upgrading weapon systems, training elite forces and raising wages for soldiers.He instead wants to reduce the number of troops from the current 625,000 to 500,000 by 2020.He is also determined to promote Seoul's own defense capabilities on the basis of a robust alliance with Washington.""The era has come that a nuclear submarine is necessary for us,"" Moon said at a forum last month. ""For this,  will discuss a revision to the nuclear accord .""Under the agreement, South Korea's nuclear activity is limited to peaceful purposes, which means a setback for the production of uranium with relatively high enrichment for use as fuel.In addition, his administration will seek to complete the establishment of South Korea's independent missile shield, called the Korean Air and Missile Defense , at an early date amid speculation that it may introduce sea-based SM-3 interceptor missiles. The nomination of his defense minister, expected as early as next week, will be the starting point, defense experts said.Before the election, Moon stressed the need for a civilian to lead local troops, which is unprecedented in its modern history.Internal stability is a concern amid the nuclear-armed North's continued saber-rattling, said the experts.Several retired commanders are on the reported shortlist of candidates. Among them are Song Young-moo and Hwang Ki-chul, both of whom served as the Navy chief of staff, and Park Jong-hun, former Air Force chief of staff.If Moon picks such a figure with no Army background, it could be an alternative, as South Korea's military has been traditionally dominated by ground troops in power and size.The number of Army service members totals around 490,000 out of the 630,000-strong military.Whoever becomes Moon's first defense minister will likely play a key role in crafting a blueprint for a specific reform scheme and timetable.Moon, formerly a human rights lawyer, has vowed to decentralize and devolve his presidential power to ministries in charge of related state affairs.Once the tensions subdue on the peninsula and inter-Korean ties improve, the president may seriously consider a civilian nominee for the defense ministerial post, observers said.","presidential campaign pledges on ,defense ministry said friday ,proposed by president moon ,presidential campaign pledges ,the presidential campaign pledges","[""South Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae -', 'the Ministry of National Defense']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33130875  0.29271287

The campaign, titled “120 Hours of Walking to the People,” is a five-day tour all over the country. His first stop was Daegu and surrounding areas in North Gyeongsang Province, a conservative stronghold and former President Park Geun-hye’s political hometown.People‘s Party presidential candidate Ahn Cheol-soo meets with residents of Hahoe, a village in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Thursday. “I’m hoping to share my sincerity with the people,” Ahn said through his Facebook account. He currently trails front-runner Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea. Most recent polls show that Moon has a double-digit lead over Ahn. “Instead of asking the people to come to my campaign vehicles, I will walk to the people.”The move comes amid signs that Ahn may have lost his runner-up status, with some polls showing conservative front-runner Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party in second place. In a Realmeter poll released Wednesday, Ahn and Hong’s support ratings tied at 18.6 percent. In a separate Realmeter poll targeting voters who are “most likely” to cast their ballots, Hong led with 18.8 percent to Ahn’s 16.9 percent. The result is a drastic change from a survey conducted about two weeks earlier when Ahn’s support rating stood at about three times higher than that of Hong. Alarmed by his lower-than-expected popularity, Ahn reiterated his pledge to build a “coalition government” by inviting what he called “reform-minded” presidential candidates, including Rep. Sim Sang-jeung of the minor Justice Party and Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the conservative Bareun Party. Regarding Hong and Moon, however, Ahn spared no criticism, dismissing them as “archaic politicians” who represent the interests of establishment groups and might deepen national divide across ideologies and the economy. “I am the only choice to defeat Moon Jae-in,” said Ahn on his Facebook account. “Hong Joon-pyo is not fit to be a president, even for a presidential candidate. If you vote for Ahn Cheol-soo, Ahn Cheol-soo will be the next president.”Last month, Ahn had announced his roadmap on how to run the government. He vowed to create a coalition government by embracing diverse political groups and reducing the president’s power. Ahn, however, said he did not consider Hong as a partner for a coalition government.By Yeo Jun-suk","kicks off nationwide rallies ,nationwide rallies to boost ,kicked off nationwide rallies ,nationwide rallies to canvass ,rallies to boost sluggish","['People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81577331  0.05257109

This photo, taken from the Web site of the Mokpo municipality on May 1, 2017, shows the shirt of a frayed school uniform recovered from the 6,800-ton Sewol ferry that sank on April 16, 2014, in waters off the country's southwestern coast. The items comprised 20 articles of clothing including school uniforms with no name tags, eight pairs of shoes, two bags, two electrical devices and 12 other items. If the items are not picked up by families within the next six months, they will enter the care of the government.People related to the victims to which the items belonged can claim them using their identification cards or other evidence of their relationship to the victim at the search headquarters between 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day.An official at the municipality said, ""The items transferred to us are those which have been cleaned and dried. Anyone who is confirmed to have a relationship with their owners is able to pick them up."" Three of the 157 items have been returned to the families of their owners to date.The 6,800-ton Sewol ferry that sank on April 16, 2014, in waters off the country's southwest coast claimed the lives of 304 people, most of them teenage students on a school trip.The hull was raised from the bottom of the sea and put into dry dock at a local port in Mokpo, some 410 kilometers south of Seoul, last month. The bodies of nine people, including four students and two teachers, have not yet been found. The search for the remains is scheduled to be completed within three months.A special fact-finding body has said that a probe to determine the exact cause of the tragic sinking will begin late this month.","ferry sinking victims continue ,to ferry sinking victims ,ferry sinking victims ,victims of ferry sinking ,last month local government","['mokpo', 'Mokpo', ""South Korea 's"", 'South Jeolla']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.62360668  0.21512526

The ballots were not cast due to the election protocol that states a majority rule is applied when there is only one candidate in the race.

Hong Joon-pyo, the candidate of the Liberty Korea Party, is rising in polls, despite revelations from his autobiography that he helped a friend with attempted rape decades ago, while other survey results show broad support among conservative voters for a possible two-way or three-way alliance to stop liberal front-runner Moon Jae-in.Hong Joon-pyo, the candidate of the Liberty Korea Party According to a survey from Hankook Research, 69.6 percent of those who identified themselves as supporters of the Liberty Korea Party responded that they support a three-way coalition among Hong, Yoo Seong-min of the conservative splinter Bareun Party and centrist Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party against Moon of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea.Only 10.8 percent of the Liberty Korea Party supporters opposed such an alliance, while 19.6 percent of them did not answer. A majority of Liberty Korea Party supporters are in the southeast of the country, the traditional home turf of conservative forces in South Korea. The Liberty Korea Party’s precursors, the Saenuri Party and Grand National Party, produced 18th President Park Geun-hye and 17th President Lee Myung-bak, respectively. Political watchers also note the growing possibility of a conservative resurrection from the Park scandal. They say it could pose a significant challenge to the liberals, which are aiming to capitalize on the former conservative leader Park’s stunning demise and seize power. Many Yeongnam voters are pinning hopes on Hong’s rapidly rising approval ratings, observers said. The Hankook Research survey also shows that nearly half the voters in the western Honam region, composed of Gwangju and South and North Jeolla provinces, oppose the anti-Moon coalition. Only 19.5 percent of them supported it.The three-way alliance among centrist Ahn and conservatives Hong and Yoo would surely be a big threat for Moon, though the possibility of its realization is deemed very low given the tight schedule. The election will be held May 9. Printing of the ballots is to be conducted Sunday, which means a candidate withdrawing after that day will continue to be represented on the paper ballot. Support ratings for Ahn, Hong and Yoo are hovering at about 25 percent, 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively, while that for Moon is ranging between 38 and 43 percent.Yonsei University professor Yang Seung-ham said the feasibility that Ahn will join a coalition is very low, as he had dismissed it in a TV debate.“If Ahn coordinates with the Liberty Korea Party, he would lose his current support  from Honam,” he said. “In addition, it would not be easy  to beat Moon even if the coalition was attained.”Meanwhile, Inha University visiting professor Park Sang-byung predicted great synergy, which could turn the tide of the current race.But Park also echoed Yang, saying a “three-way coalition is impossible. The scheme would eventually deprive Ahn and Yoo of political justification and duration.”A panelist on Channel A, a local cable channel, said he would not rule out the possibility that a large proportion of Hong and Yoo’s supporters would choose to vote for Ahn to block Moon’s election.By Kim Yon-se","the presidential race revs ,presidential race revs up ,presidential race revs ,with attempted rape decades ,the presidential race",['the Liberty Korea Party'],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9788118   0.37520337

However, questions linger over whether they can deliver, as some of the contenders are mired in controversy for using language critics say shows their subconscious gender stereotypes. Often compared to US President Donald Trump for his outspoken rhetoric, Hong Joon-pyo, the firebrand flag-bearer of the conservative Liberty Korea Party, has been criticized for describing his wife as someone who cooks and does dishes for him.Presidential candidate Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party When asked on a TV program whether he does the dishes at home, Hong said, “How can I do that? There are things men do and  women do. That was already decided by the heavens.” He later apologized, saying he was trying to “look strong.” Women’s groups have demanded he drop out of the presidential race over another controversy surrounding his alleged involvement in a failed sexual assault 45 years ago. In his 2005 memoir, he said he had obtained a livestock stimulant to help his friend sleep with a girl while attending university, and acknowledged “how seriously wrong” his action was. “About the incident 45 years ago, I really apologize to the public,” he said during a televised debate. But he also expressed discomfort, saying, “I already confessed it in my autobiography. It is not right to take issue with it now.” He has also made comments intolerant of diverse sexual orientations. “I don’t like . I don’t do that. Having surgery to change one’s gender is a separate matter, but homosexuality is not my thing,” Hong said in a radio interview with local cable channel YTN.Other candidates have also come under fire for their gender-biased comments.Front-runner Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea apologized after making a remark about the appearance of North Korean cheerleaders.Presidential candidate Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea “, they were natural beauties. I heard that North Koreans also have plastic surgery nowadays,” he said while talking about the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics with Choi Moon-soon, governor of Gangwon Province.A few hours later, Moon said in a statement, “I meant to say that the situation in North Korea is changing. I will take this as a chance to look back on where I am standing now.” Moon has also drawn ire from sexual minorities for his comments on homosexuality.“I oppose . I don’t like it. But I oppose discrimination ,” he said during a televised debate Tuesday.Two days later, he made an apology, saying, “Homosexuality is not a matter that I can support or oppose. It is a private matter.”Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party was also embroiled in controversy after defending his wife from allegations she was hired as a professor at Seoul National University despite her lack of qualifications, thanks to Ahn’s status. Ahn denied them, saying the attack was an “insult” to professional women. “Why do they think qualified women always need to benefit from their husbands to be employed? That perception itself is disparaging to women.”However, his opponents criticized his remarks, claiming such comments were a disgrace to professional women who play fair without any backing from the powerful.Police subdue pro-gay protestors who attempted to approach front-runner Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea as he arrived at Sejong Center for the Performing Art in central Seoul to attend a debate session, Thursday. Local experts in gender issues pointed out that presidential candidates’ attitudes and behavior speak volumes about their subconscious perceptions of gender equality. “It is positive that we can see progress in presidential candidates’ election pledges to expand equal rights for women,” Park Cha Ok-kyung of the Korean Women’s Association United told The Korea Herald. “But given what I see from candidates’ remarks and behavior, I don’t think the policies correspond to their perceptions of women yet,” she said. Another expert said that politicians are lagging behind the public, especially younger generations, in terms of sensitivity to human rights. “Candidates’ controversial comments would have not caused any stir during the election period 10 years ago,” said Kwon Soo-hyun, deputy director of Korea Womens’ Political Solidarity. “But things are different now.”“Sexism is internalized in people. So it just comes out unconsciously. People should learn what constitutes misogyny or sexism,” she said. “What is the most important here is that we pick leaders who are willing to embrace criticism, learn and correct themselves.” The Gender Gap Index released by the World Economic Forum last year placed South Korea at No. 116 out of 144 countries. The country was the worst in terms of discrimination against women at work among the 29 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to the index disclosed in March by British magazine the Economist.By Ock Hyun-ju","election 2017 gender biased ,the major presidential candidates ,2017 gender biased language ,gender biased language backfires ,2017 gender biased","['US', 'Donald Trump', 'Hong']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57452339  0.2942709

Walton H. Walker, a Korean War hero.Standing in front of the 8th Army's headquarters at Yongsan garrison, the 10-foot-tall bronze statue is a token of the US fight against North Korea alongside South Korea in the 1950-53 conflict and their decades-old alliance.The US Eighth Army hosts the Gen. Walker Monument Transition Ceremony in front of its headquarters at the Yongsan base on April 25, 2017. Walker, born in 1889 and killed in a 1950 car accident in Korea, is credited with playing a pivotal role in defending the South from the North's aggression. He is especially known for having commanded US troops at the so-called Busan Perimeter, paving the way for Gen. Douglas MacArthur's historic amphibious landing in Incheon.Taking initial steps to move to Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, the Eighth Army held the ""statue transition"" event. The statue will actually be transfered to the Humphreys in May and a formal unveiling ceremony is slated for July 13.Lt. Gen. Thomas S. Vandal, the commanding general of the 8th Army, said the statue transition ""underscores"" the base relocation.""Despite the statue moving, make no mistake about it. Our alliance 'gachigapsida ' spirit remains ironclad and strong,"" he said in a speech at the event joined by more than 50 dignitaries.They included Paik Sun-yup, a 95-year-old retired South Korean Army general. Paik, who served in the South's military during the Korean War, is the honorary commander of the Eighth US Army, the core element of the 28,500-strong US Forces Korea.Vandal noted Paik is the only figure ""here"" to have worked together with Walker.He also pointed out that the base relocation work has been ""in the making"" for about 10 years.After a long delay, the 8th Army plans to complete its transition to the Pyeongtaek base in late June.The remainder of the American troops in the Yongsan facilities will be relocated there by the end of this year, with the headquarters of the Combined Forces Korea staying at the current base.Vandal described it as one of the largest base transformations in the US Army's history, with $10.7 billion invested in the Garrison Humphreys where roughly 45,000 American service members and their family members will reside.""We all are excited to be part of this historic relocation,"" he said.On the late general Walker, he said he is one of the iconic figures of the US alliance with South Korea. Even a luxury hotel in Seoul and a US military base in Daegu are named after the general.Once his statute is unveiled this summer, ""Gen. Walker will once again point toward the north as an everlasting remainder of the threats we face,"" added Vandal.The US base in Yongsan has historical implications for Koreans, originally the home to Japanese soldiers during its brutal colonial rule of Korea from 1910-45.It will be transformed into a family park after an environmental impact survey under the bilateral Status of Forces Agreement.","american troops in seoul ,walker korean war hero ,troops in seoul kicked ,relocation tuesday to refurbished ,korean war hero standing","['american', 'Seoul', 'Walton H.

Bareun, which means ""righteous"" in Korean, held five-hour marathon talks between its lawmakers and the nominee to discuss the future of their anemic campaign.Yoo Seong-min, presidential nominee of the Bareun Party, waves from his car as he leaves a forum in Seoul on April 25, 2017. The meeting addressed the growing sense of urgency within the party that unless it provides a breakthrough, liberal champion Moon of the Democratic Party will end up winning the election two weeks away. Yoo's approval rating has hovered at around 3 percent, far behind the 30 to 40 percent garnered by Moon.""We agreed to do our best for Yoo's election, but also to come up with all possible ways to stop the leftist hegemonic forces from taking power, including a three-way merger,"" floor leader Joo Ho-young said after the talks ended past midnight, referring to Moon's campaign. ""Yoo said he would watch the process.""The party wants to forge an alliance with Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative former ruling Liberty Korea Party and Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party. Ahn has recently ranked second with ratings in the 30 percent range, while Hong has posted just below 10 percent.Later in the day, the floor leader told reporters he and the party's election committee co-chief Kim Moo-sung have agreed to ""take active steps"" to explain the outcome of the meeting to the other two parties' leaders and discuss future steps.Speaking after a conference early in the morning, Yoo reaffirmed his determination to complete the race alone.""Nothing has changed from my initial position,"" he told reporters there.The four-term lawmaker has rejected talk of a merger, citing his democratic nomination process and stark differences with Hong and Ahn. He has argued that Hong is not even qualified to run for president as he faces trial on bribery charges, while Ahn cannot be trusted on national security issues.Ahn and Hong showed little interest in the proposed merger.""Our party's position has always been clear. We reject an artificial alliance  by politicians,"" Son Kum-ju, chief spokesman of Ahn's campaign, said in a press briefing. ""Only an alliance by the people is possible. We will wait for the choice of the people.""Hong stood by his call for a conservative alliance excluding Ahn.""I think we'll have a grand conservative merger this week,"" he said during a lecture at a hotel. ""At the end of the election, I'm certain I will win.""Moon's party played down the proposal as an alliance against the people's will.""It's an attempt to pull back democracy and the people will view it as three-way collusion and not tolerate it,"" Park Kwang-on, public relations chief of Moon's election committee, said in a news briefing. ""It will never be able to succeed.""Opinion surveys indicated a merger involving Ahn could win enough public support to tip the balance against Moon, but a conservative alliance may not.Moon maintained a wide lead over Ahn with 44.3 percent against 35.3 percent in a hypothetical three-way race involving Hong, according to a poll conducted Sunday and Monday by the JoongAng Ilbo daily. In a three-way race involving Yoo, Moon still garnered 43 percent against Ahn's 37 percent.In an earlier poll conducted by Kantar Public, however, Moon and Ahn were neck and neck in a hypothetical matchup at 41.4 percent and 41 percent, respectively.Ballots for the May 9 election will be printed on Sunday.""We didn't discuss a deadline,"" Joo said after the meeting.""They say  should be completed before the ballots are printed for maximum effect, so we're thinking around then.""He added there was tacit agreement not to pursue a two-way merger with either Ahn or Hong.","upcoming presidential election ,five hour marathon talks ,tuesday proposed three way ,the upcoming presidential election ,upcoming presidential election but","['Bareun Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Bareun', 'Korean', 'Yoo Seong - min']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.36261156  0.46253875

Members of Moranbong, the singing and dancing band of women created by Kim, were seen breaking tradition with their short-hemmed, glittery stage clothes. Ri sol-ju, wife of North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un According to KDB Future Strategy Research Institute, their public appearance has created a new perception of clothing for North Korean women, who have already started mimicking the fashions they see on contraband South Korean TV dramas and films.The North's imports of precious metals and fashion accessories doubled from $832,000 in 2012 to $1.73 million in 2015, the institute, affiliated with Korea Development Bank, said.Synthetic fabric is being replaced by natural substitutes that are softer to the touch and are easier to dye, and mass-produced factory clothing is giving way to custom-tailored attire, according to the institute.While the state used to supply cheap clothing of uniform design, manufacturers are now taking orders for clothes popularized by fashion shows or from displays, it said.These changes are significant compared to the past when out-of-the-norm attire was interpreted as ideological deviation and any English letters or South Korean labels on clothing were strictly prohibited. They also indicate that North Korea is shifting from a standardized society to one where personal expressions are permitted, the institute said.The KDB agency said that the fashion industry will grow more in large cities that have textile mills and private craftsmen.The changes, however, will be slow, it said, because a dress code is still heavily enforced and trendy fashion is limited to the country's rich elites.","wife of north korea ,fashion following leader wife ,an all women band ,tuesday ri the wife ,all women band who","['North Korea', 'Ri Sol - ju', 'Ri', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18954515  0.16147703

Song, while contradicting the party’s claim, stepped down from his position as dean of the University of North Korean Studies.Democratic Party of Korea’s presidential candidate Moon Jae-in “It is politically and morally inappropriate to make such claim against a specific candidate ahead of the election without factual basis,” said Yoo Eun-hae, chief spokesperson for Moon’s campaign.The party filed a complaint to the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office, charging Song with defamation by publication, slander against a presidential candidate, breach of the Public Official Election Law and leak of official secrets.The former minister continued to stand at odds with Moon over the issue, but nevertheless offered his resignation to the university.“I am caught up in the midst of a political argument against my own will,” Song told reporters at lunchtime while leaving the school located in Samcheong-dong.“I decided to step down  lest such consequences affect the school in a negative way.”Song Min-soon, the former foreign minister arguing with leading presidential candidate Moon Jae-in over Moon’s role in the South Korean government’s 2007 decision to abstain from a UN resolution on North Korean human rights abuses, answers questions from reporters at Jongno-gu, Seoul, Monday. Song, president of the University of North Korean Studies, tendered his resignation as university president on Monday morning. The entire strife between the two top-level officials of the former liberal Roh Moo-hyun government is pivoting on Song’s political memoir “The Moving Glacier,” published in October.In the book, the former minister mentioned that then-presidential chief of staff Moon had led the government’s action to first consult the communist regime before making its decision to abstain from a UN resolution against Pyongyang’s human rights abuses.Conservative parties at once brought up the anecdote to call into question Moon’s qualifications as the potential commander-in-chief amid rising military tensions between the two Koreas.The dispute, which seemed to be overshadowed for some time last year by the corruption scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye, recently resurfaced during the election campaigning and television debates among presidential candidates.The Moon-Song feud intensified over the weekend as both sides revealed a series of documents to back their respective claims.Song suggested a letter from the late President Roh, implying his undecidedness on the abstention of the UN resolution as of Nov. 16, which led him to “consult” the North before the final decision on Nov. 20.Moon’s contradictory assertion was that the Roh administration had made the decision by that date without communicating with the North and that it only notified Pyongyang of its decision later on.“ is low ideology-based slander to sway the result of the  election, just like the Northern Limit Lime dispute in the last presidential election,” an official from Moon’s campaign said Sunday in a statement, vowing firm actions on the given issue.During the 2012 election, Moon reeled under the allegation -- raised by a conservative lawmaker -- that he and the late former President Roh had conceded the inter-Korean maritime border in the interest of the communist state. The assertion later was found to be groundless and the corresponding lawmaker was handed a fine for spreading false information.By Bae Hyun-jung","minister memoir brawl conflicts ,brawl conflicts aggravated monday ,memoir brawl conflicts aggravated ,ex minister memoir brawl ,minister memoir brawl","['the Democratic Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Min', 'song']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.13619745  0.39947036

Asked to be more specific, Spicer said, “I cannot. I’m not privy. No.”Trump made the remark during a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni at the White House, praising Chinese President Xi Jinping for trying hard to rein in the North.“Many coal ships have been sent back. Many other things have happened. Some very unusual moves have been made over the last two or three hours. I really have confidence the president will try very hard,” Trump said without elaborating.Trump appeared to be referring to unidentified fresh measures that China has just taken to pressure Pyongyang after returning coal shipments from the North, though the remark may also mean a possible contingency inside North Korea.Considering Trump spoke just hours after the U.N. Security Council adopted a press statement condemning North Korea’s latest missile launch, he might have referred to Chinese support for the measure, though it is not unusual at all for Beijing to back such a statement.It was the fifth statement the council has adopted on North Korea this year, all with Chinese support.Earlier Friday, Trump pressed China again to exercise its leverage over the North, saying in a Twitter message, “China is very much the economic lifeline to North Korea so, while nothing is easy, if they want to solve the North Korean problem, they will.” Spicer said that China has taken action to pressure the North.“I think we’ve seen a lot of positive action from China, both at the U.N., some of the public statements they’ve made on -- the President noted yesterday with respect to some -- the energy sector,” he said. “We’ve seen some very positive signs with China to help put the appropriate pressure on North Korea.”Spicer also said, however, that unless China solves the problem, the U.S. will.","problem white house president ,house president donald trump ,friday white house press ,solving problem white house ,trump very unusual moves","['U.S.', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'White House', 'Sean Spicer']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61018258  0.31573331

Critics accuse the immigration office for being biased against asylum seekers and lacking expertise and transparency. The Seoul government, however, cite difficulties in processing the rising number of refugee applications, while stressing the need to screen out economic migrants seeking asylum only to prolong their stay in the country.South Korea has seen a 17-fold increase in the number of asylum seekers over the past six years. In the face of tens of millions of people fleeing violence and war across the world, the number of those applying for refugee status here went from 423 in 2010 to 7,542 last year, according to the ministry. Currently, the Justice Ministry screens asylum seekers’ applications and decides whether to grant them refugee status. An applicant can fight the ministry’s refusal, by appealing to a consultation body under the ministry, composed of government officials. One can then bring the case to a local court, with legal proceedings taking up to three years. As over 60 percent of refused applicants appeal, the ministry and related authorities have been complaining of personnel and budget shortages to handle the workload. Establishment of an independent refuge affairs institution has been a demand by experts and activists. “We have called for an establishment of an independent body, which is specialized in screening asylum applications and has legally binding power,” said Lee Ho-taeg, a head of refugee advocacy group pNan. He stressed the envisioned unit should be independent and have an expertise to make fair yet speedy judgments. “The local administrative court make rulings on refugee applications, but judges are not equipped with knowledge about different regions and religions -- the basis to thoroughly review refugee applications,” he said. But setting up an independent body for refugee screening cannot solve all the problems, a refugee rights lawyer said. “Lack of budget and personnel have been fundamental problems in running the refugee system in the country,” said Hwang Pill-kyu from the Gonggam Human Rights Law Foundation. According to data from the Justice Ministry, the number of officials at nine immigration offices across the country was 22 to handle 5,711 cases in 2015, meaning one immigration officer taking care of 0.71 cases a day on average. “The Justice Ministry should first analyze how much more budget and personnel they need and devise a plan to improve fairness and transparency in running the refugee system,” he said.“It should make sure that authorities spend enough time to take into account individual asylum seeker’s situation and asylum seekers are fairly treated in the process.”Under the Refugee Act, South Korea offers selected applicants monthly living subsidies and state-run housing for the first six months upon their application. But government statistics showed that only 8.6 percent of the applicants -- 650 out of 7,542 people -- received living expenses last year.All of the asylum seekers are granted a G-1 visa and can get a job, six months after they submitted their applications, though language barriers and negative the perception of asylum seekers lower their chances of actually finding work.By Ock Hyun-ju","to screen refugee applications ,those rejected refugee status ,body to screen refugee ,screen refugee applications ,korea herald the research","['the Justice Ministry', 'the Korea Herald']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2786465   0.35625336

Thank you for all your support.” “Some 10,534 people made attempts to donate, and only 4,488 supporters were actually able to make deposits,” Moon’s camp said. The website is said to have been inaccessible to many would-be contributors due to heavy traffic. Moon’s camp had planned their campaign budget to be some 47 billion won. It had decided to close the first round of fundraising after an hour, as it had also received some 13 billion won from the National Election Commission, it added. “The ‘Moon Fund’ is closed. I did not expect to reach the goal so quickly. Thank you for all your attention,” read a Facebook post by Moon’s spokesperson Rep. Park Kwang-on, after donations closed. Anyone regardless of age and nationality could contribute to the fund, with the amount starting at 10,000 won. There was no upper limit. It was created as part of Moon’s plan to make politics more transparent and to “prepare campaign funds from citizens seeking for a just and fair nation.”Moon’s campaigners said the fund reflects the candidate’s will to cut ties between the government and businesses, as part of a bigger plan to rid the country of political corruption.A second round of fundraising may be planned, though the date has not been confirmed.Those who contributed to the fund will have their investments redeemed by July 19, once the state’s election subsidies are paid out. Moon’s campaign will provide investors with an interest rate of 3.6 percent, which is an average of the rates offered by 16 major South Korean banks.By Jo He-rim","moon fund raises w33b ,korea presidential candidate moon ,won 28 million far ,raises w33b in hour ,wednesday the fund website","['the "" Moon Fund', 'Democratic Party of Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the "" Moon Fund']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40818179  0.33911043

At a press conference Tuesday, the family claimed that Lee was overworked and subjected to constant verbal abuse by his superiors. CJ E&M; conducted an internal investigation into Lee’s death and concluded that there had been no insults or abuse involving Lee.“The company refused to allow our family to participate in the probe, and refused to share data that could prove he was being overworked. It also claimed that he neglected his duties, based on nothing but testimonies of his fellow workers who were hostile toward him,” the family members said.A poster image of the tvN drama “Drinking Solo.” Youth Community Union, which is working with Lee’s family to find out why he took his own life, said they decided to hold the press conference six months after his death because the family members needed time to cope with it. Tuesday was also exactly a year since Lee was assigned to the “Drinking Solo” team. The family claimed that Lee was forced to work 53 out of 55 days, while sleeping only four hours a day. They also said that there were text messages on Lee’s phone from his superiors in which they curse and insult him repeatedly.“If he was late for work, they  would threaten to make sure he would never work in the TV industry again. When they moved, they would made him carry all the bags,” Lee’s brother Han-sol said. CJ E&M; released an official statement later in the day and vowed to comply with the authorities if they choose to investigate the family’s claims.“It is very regrettable that a situation like this has happened, even though we have worked with the bereaved family on how the investigation  should take place,” the statement said.But an official of the Youth Community Union said that CJ had not made any attempt to reach out to Lee’s family since the press conference. “A legal battle is not what we’re looking for right now. All we want is for CJ to accept responsibility and provide plans so that it will not happen again. We’re not looking to put certain individuals on trial,” he said. “We never wanted money. We just wanted a sincere apology and assurance that a case like my brother would never happen again,” said Lee Han-sol. In Korean TV production, it is customary for newer members on the production team to take care of miscellaneous chores in addition to their duties. They often have to shoulder an immense workload.In 2008, a 20-something writer for SBS died by suicide after reportedly being overworked. A 2011 report by Korea Creative Content Agency showed that TV production staff work an average of 10.4 hours a day. A 2016 survey by the National Union of Media Workers showed that a TV writer works an average 53.8 hours a week.“I was a producer, but I also had to be a writer and record pieces as well,” said a former news program producer at a local channel. “After I quit, I learned that they hired two extra people to do those jobs.”She noted that the pecking order in the TV industry often presents challenges for younger workers. Failing to fall in line with her superiors resulted in a transfer to another department where she did virtually “nothing” until eventually quitting. “When I saw the news about Lee. I just thought, ‘It must’ve been so hard.’ We can somewhat relate to that, as the working environment in the TV industry is very tough,” she said. “Of course, what I went through is not nearly as tough as what Lee experienced.”By Yoon Min-sik","company died by suicide ,employee suicide the death ,apologize for employee suicide ,by suicide in october ,employee suicide the","['CJ e&m', 'korean', 'Lee Han - bit']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44504949  0.34669396

Campaigning for the presidential election officially began Monday with the release of candidate campaign posters. 

Ahn’s poster, which was reportedly counselled by an awards-winning advertisement designer Lee Je-suk, soon caught the public’s attention as it had a rather groundbreaking design for a presidential campaign poster. 











Unlike other candidates’ posters where the candidate’s face fills most of the space, Ahn’s poster featured the upper half of his body with his arms stretched out. 

Twitter user @Raoulian suggested that if put together with other posters, Ahn’s poster stands out and “it looks as if Ahn’s opening up the sliding door.” 

 


However, Twitter user @fakemommy suggested that campaign posters should focus on serving its purpose. 

“If visual differentiation influences the result of the election, the posters should be top-notch avant-garde. Why would they only pursue visual stability? Because what people expect from election posters are factors like trust and stability.” 

The design also ignited controversy since it did not mention the People’s Party. Some people said that his intention behind the action is devious and it seems he was trying to get more votes from the right by not mentioning his political party. 

However, some set forth a counterargument with @classperfect offering “If you become a president, it is natural to leave the party and serve for the people. Then what does it matter whether it has the name of the party or not?”

Twitter user @A_vilal took a contemplative view on the situation saying “Which candidate will be on the news for his or her poster design anyway?”

Under the law, a soldier who commits ""sodomy"" or ""other disgraceful conduct"" can face up to two years in prison.The civic group said the probe was solely based on the victims' sexual orientation, and there was no material evidence of them having sexual intercourse. The Army earlier denied the allegations in a statement, saying that the investigation team launched the probe after recognizing that an incumbent soldier uploaded a video of him having sexual intercourse with another male soldier on social media. The civic group said problems emerged as the Army attempted to identify gay soldiers other than the ones involved in the video based on the evidence it gained while investigating.","hunt for gay soldiers ,hunt down homosexual soldiers ,for gay soldiers civic ,hunt for gay ,gay soldiers civic group","['Army', 'the Center for Military Human Rights Korea', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'Army', 'Jang Jun - gyu']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00122588  0.13790011

The Gangseo Police Station in Seoul also took the boy's 41-year-old mother, the group's leader, and his wife into custody for abandoning and later cremating his body.Recommending an indictment, police have sent the investigation result to the prosecution. A 53-year-old woman affiliated with a cult group worshiping the dog reenacts her crime on a hill in the southwestern city of Jeonju on April 11, 2017. She has been arrested for allegedly beating to death a 3-year-old boy, who she said was possessed by a demon, in July 2014. According to police, the mother, identified only by her family name Choi, joined a commune of the cult group in February 2014 with her son and 6-year-old daughter after divorcing her husband who was against her involvement in the group.The cult group, which has no official appellation, worships dogs of the Korean Jindo breed. Ten Jindo dogs were enshrined as spiritual beings at one of the group's four houses of a multiplex housing unit in Seoul's Gangseo Ward, while 10 followers of the cult were living together in the remaining three houses, police said.People involved in the cult told investigators that the woman whose name was withheld had struck the boy multiple times for the reason that he was not disciplined.On July 7, 2014, the senior member of the cult, who was responsible for keeping its discipline, beat him with a wooden rice paddle in front of his mother, saying she had to drive a demon, which caused him to wet the bed, out of him.The mother did not join in on the beating even after being handed the paddle, as she was in a state of panic, police said.After being beaten, the boy passed out and died. For fear of the crime being detected, the woman and Choi, along with the wife of the cult's leader whose name was withheld, placed the boy's body into a wooden box before burying it on a hill in the southwestern city of Jeonju, where the group had another compound.Three days later, the three and the cult's leader went to the burial site and disinterred his body as they feared wild boars could dig it up. They cremated it on the spot before dispersing its ashes at a stream in the neighboring town of Imsil.Choi left the cult with her daughter and the next month reported to police that her son had gone missing in Bucheon, west of Seoul.But the murder case's full account surfaced earlier this year after one of the cult's followers who had left it testified about the alleged murder of the boy and his burial.","dogs for allegedly beating ,demon in july 2014 ,boy beaten to death ,for demon possession police ,july 2014 the gangseo","['the Gangseo Police Station', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14480203 -0.2637471

As no passengers volunteered to leave the aircraft, four people were selected, one of which was Dao. When Dao refused to leave his seat citing morning appointments with patients, he was brutally dragged off the plane by the police who had summoned by the airline.  A number of Facebook users in Korea shared the 30-second video, while criticizing the horrific actions of the US company. One of the users pointed out that the three out of four passengers asked to leave the plane were Asian, saying “It doesn’t make any sense, even if the passengers were chosen randomly through the computer system.” He added that the airline should “go broke.” The comment received more than 14,000 likes in a day. The video also swept Instagram and Twitter. The number of “United Airlines” hashtags in Korean soared and most posts put blame on the airline. The word “Boycottunited” also became a trending topic on Instagram.

Chung Kwang-yong  is surrounded by reporters as he enters the Jongno Police Station in downtown Seoul on April 12, 2017. Chung said he “does not admit” the accusations made against him, claiming the excessive use of force by the police killed the protesters.“As the people were infuriated, I guided them not to use violence and be calm. It was the police who reacted violently,” said Chung.The protesters at the pro-Park rally, held March 10, simulated violence after the Constitutional Court’s decision to uphold the impeachment, destroying police buses and assaulting reporters. Three people died during the rally, and many were reported injured.Chung said that he could not understand why he should be called on during the presidential election.“I can sincerely undergo investigation after the presidential election, since I’m so busy right now that I can’t even take a breath,” he said. “ party is composed of over 100,000 members right after its formation. Calling the secretary-general of the party during the presidential election is a repression of politics and election.”Police summoned Chung three times, but he insisted that he will attend after the presidential election.

Given the current pace, the state tourism body expects this year's total number of Chinese visitors will be more than halved to less than 4 million.""Korea has been a favorite destination for Chinese tourists as much as we've highly depended on them, because  is such an attractive market in terms of price and distance,"" KTO President Jung Chang-soo told a press briefing. ""We plan to act strategically and be as flexible as possible to ensure that our tourism industry becomes vibrant again."" In an all-out effort to stave off the fallout, the KTO vowed to overhaul its strategies with a focus on securing tourists from countries other than China, while luring more individual travelers as opposed to groups on package tours that had accounted for the bulk of inbound Chinese tourists.It plans to raise the budget for developing tour programs tailored to Japanese and Muslims, promoting getaways and relaxation content through online blogs and social network services as part of the attractions. For those from Southeast Asia and the Middle East, the KTO will bolster its steps with the local food service industry to increase Muslim-friendly restaurants that will serve halal dishes, it said.The state tourism body has set its annual target for non-Chinese tourists at 11.2 million in 2017, up from 9.17 million recorded the previous year.It, however, ruled out the possibility that China may become a peripheral market for Korea given the frayed relationship at present.""China accounts for 10 percent of the world's outbound  market. We cannot afford to see ties cut off because of the current circumstances. We're working to maintain a good relationship on both public and private levels,"" Chang said. The KTO will also set up a mobile platform this year that comes with Artificial Intelligence or Artificial Reality functions to assist individual tourists with directions and language translation. Aside from that, the KTO is planning to boost cooperation with regional governments to promote in-country travels for locals through discounts and other benefits, believing that diverting certain outbound to inbound demand will come as fresh momentum for local tourism, it added.As of end-February, a cumulative 4.57 million Koreans went abroad for vacation, up 14.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the KTO.","the ailing local tourism ,ailing local tourism industry ,beijing apparent retaliation against ,ailing local tourism ,tourism industry is battered","['chinese', 'South Korea', 'China', 'US', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense']",20,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.45591068  0.34868404

How do you define your ideologies?A: I think the labels are meaningless. At a time of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, what use are such labels? The tasks that face us are not about political cant. Were the candlelight protests divided between conservatives and progressives? Ending corruption is a task that goes beyond such things, they have no meaning. Q: There are historically defined concepts about progressivism and conservativism, and they have provided pivots in Korean history. A: Well, the Liberty Korea Party people call even Rep. Yoo Seong-min a leftist. By traditional standards, social democracy, or more, is considered progressive. In Korean politics, perhaps the Justice Party is the only one to have moved that far. The rest were  leftist by former ruling forces like the Saenuri Party  that showed extreme right-wing tendencies. Q: Do you think that you and Ahn Cheol-soo, the candidate of the People‘s Party, have fundamental differences in political values and philosophies? A: First, in the past Ahn wanted new politics, and I thought that we were working together for a regime change even if  had a new position. But it is becoming clear that was wrong. The most important thing is the demand of the times, and I have always been with the candlelight protests. In contrast, Ahn emphasizes that he did not participate.  have fundamentally different perceptions of the times. Q: You have stressed the role of the state, and a big government in economic issues, but Ahn highlights the private sector’s role. Do you agree? A: Fundamentally, it is right to say that jobs should be created by private sector companies. But, aren’t Korean companies’ job creating capacities at their limit?  has long tried to stimulate job creation by cutting corporate taxes, and investing, but that has failed.  have failed tens of times, and that has led to a national crisis. Saying that job creation must be done by the private sector at this juncture means to continue as before. This is irresponsible and without alternatives. In short, it is talking about the economy without knowing about state affairs. The private sector should ,  will support the Fourth Industrial Revolution, support ventures. However, it is unclear when such efforts will lead to job creation. That is why the public sector must take the lead. I want to make this clear. Q: About your policies ...A: Employment is the most important element in my pledges. Employment is the core, and the root of all problems. Slower growth is about jobs, economic polarization is about jobs. Low birthrate, aging population is about jobs. Young people can’t marry and have children, the reason they  ‘Hell Joseon,’ this is all about jobs. From this point of view, special measures must be taken.  is the area where tax expenditures must be prioritized. Q: Do you consider North Korea’s Kim Jong-un a rational counterpart, and how will you deal with Kim and United States President Donald Trump?A: North Korea is an abnormal country. And of course Kim Jong-un is the same.  shows idol worship, which is incomprehensible from the standards of a liberal democracy. However, we must recognize  as North Korea’s leader, and if we are to resolve the nuclear issue we must negotiate . To do this, we need military dominance. As for President Trump, I don’t consider him in the same category with North’s Kim. I think he is someone who derives a rational decision from his calculations. So, I think communicating with President Trump will be easier. This is because Korea and the US have shared interests. The Korea-US alliance is important to the US just as it is to us. The alliance is important to the US in relation to  global strategies. For us, the North Korean nuclear issue is one of survival, and the US must resolve the issue, too. We have a long-standing alliance, and the Korea-US free trade agreement has made us economic allies, so the issue with Trump is easier. Q: Issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula are being discussed solely between the US and China. What can you do to change that? A: The issue of the Korean Peninsula is our problem, and we are directly involved in the North Korean nuclear issue. I feel that we should take the lead. At present, we are spectators who hope for the US-China talks to go well. It is very regrettable that no agreement was reached on resolving North Korea’s nuclear issue. However, the two countries agreed on the need to work for a peaceful resolution to the issue. I expect more efforts to come. Q: What will be your first move to shut down the North’s nuclear ambitions? A: First, close cooperation with the US must be established, so that if  North Korean policies need to be changed, we can request the US alter theirs. The Trump administration considers the Obama administration and earlier Republican administrations to have failed in this regard, so Trump himself has hinted at changes in the US’ North Korean policies. Q: Please explain your positions on the US-led anti-missile system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, and Korea’s deal with Japan on the wartime sexual slavery of Korean women issue. A: The issue of THAAD must be resolved first if  take power. I will approach security, economic and other issues under the three principles of putting the national interest first, upholding the Korea-US alliance and national consensus. I will concentrate on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, which is the root of matters surrounding THAAD. The issue of ‘comfort women,’ both the agreement and the negotiation process were wrong. It must be renegotiated, as is the will of the majority of the public.Q: What are your views on reports concerning strategic nuclear weapons? A: Deploying strategic nuclear weapons  goes against the principle of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The most important basis for demanding North Korea abolish its nuclear programs is the fact that the principle of denuclearization of the peninsula was agreed to long ago. But if we  strategic nuclear weapons, we are deconstructing our most important justification for demanding  to denuclearize. Q: Should South Korea refuse even if the US pushes for deploying strategic nuclear weapons? A: The US has maintained that it would be inappropriate. Q: In your party’s primaries, you said that any alliance would be limited to being with the People’s Party and the Justice Party. There has since been much conflict between the Democratic Party and the People’s Party. Are you still open to an alliance with the People’s Party?A: Our party and the People’s Party share the same roots. The People’s Party came about due to differences regarding measures for reforming the party, it is  alternative answer to doubts they had about whether the Democratic Party could achieve an administration change. If our party wins the presidential election, then there will no longer be a reason for  to remain separate. However, the People’s Party will be judged by the people if it continues to disregard the people, and keeps showing interest in the corrupt powers’ attempt to extend their administration. Q. The Homan region  is strategically important in this election, and competition with Ahn is unavoidable. What are your views on the region’s public opinion now and in the future?A. Honam’s choice is to bring about a change of power. Their demand is to remove and pass judgment on those behind former President Park Geun-hye’s scandal and those who seek to continue their regime. If Ahn allies with those who seek the continuation of the regime, Honam will never forgive that. Q: Former President Park has been arrested, and some now say that the focus should move to more future-oriented issues. A: Removing the accumulated evils  is the demand of our time. The only thing that has changed is that former President Park has been impeached and arrested. It is only the beginning for  a just and fair Korea.  Q: Polls show that Ahn has the advantage among voters in their 50s and 60s, and in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, which overlaps with the ousted former president’s support base in the last presidential election. A: This is the result of Ahn working with the corrupt forces that hold power. I am in my 60s, and from the Yeongnam area . However, I have the most stable supporter base across the age groups and regions. This is because of the faith they have in me as the right person for removing corruption and privileges  and creating a just Korea. I will become the first president who overcomes the divide of regional and generational divides. Q: Who is your economic role model?A: My economic role models are the policies created under 32nd President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt. I believe the days of his presidency, in which economic imbalance triggered the Great Depression, are very similar to what we face now.Roosevelt emphasized equal distribution and promoted the New Deal, which made society more equal. He struggled to achieve unification of the nation, which brought change and reform. Some of the economic problems that South Korea currently faces are widening income bipolarization, decline in population and weakening growth. To solve this, it is necessary to strengthen domestic consumption, create jobs and guarantee earnings. I will make efforts to establish a system where economic growth is driven by income, jobs, renovation and shared growth, much like a four-wheeled vehicle. Q: Do you believe there should be a change in the current presidential system? A: Instead of adopting an unqualified system, I believe it’s proper to maintain the current system, but with a two-term, four-year presidency. I would also like to elaborate on the semi-presidential system since it could either mean a Cabinet constituted of the parliament and the prime minister or the parliamentary cabinet system, where the president’s role is only symbolic, like Austria. In some ways, the current system can also be labeled as semi-presidential since it take measures such as division of power, empowering the prime minister and decentralization of power. I’d like to pursue decentralization of power through distribution of authority to local governments and Cabinet members. Q.

That level is equal to an AQI of 93 on the US Environment Protection Agency’s scale.Seoul saw the problem worsen sharply compared to the past two years, reporting a total of 14 “bad” dust days in the three-month period this year. The capital had only two days of bad levels of airborne dust concentration last year and five the year before. The cutoff used – 80 micrograms per cubic meter -- is much less strict than the 25 microgram limit put forward by the World Health Organization.Nationwide, the number of bad dust days stood at eight this year, unchanged from 2015 but double that of 2016.","year marked the worst ,worst level this year ,worst level at 32 ,news korea fine dust ,two years government data","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Environment']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.70538014  0.57650137

The Chinese salvaging firm has worked with the South Korean government since August 2015 to recover the 6,800-ton ship from the seabed. The ferry capsized in waters off the southwestern tip of Jindo Island on April 16, 2014, killing 304 people on board with nine of them still unaccounted for. The sinking of the Sewol ferry has been the worst maritime disaster in the country's history. Most of the victims were high school students en route to the resort island of Jeju on a school trip. Alleged inaction and unclear whereabouts of former President Park Geun-hye at the time of the sinking were some of the key issues that triggered moves for her impeachment.The 51-year-old veteran has led a team of some 100 professional divers in the herculean operation. The Shanghai Salvage used two large barges to lift the wreck from the bottom of the sea. ""The seawater here is extremely cold and the water's very muddy, which has made our job much harder,"" he said, as he recalled the first time he went into the water. ""The ship had already been under water for so long that much of it was already being corroded and full of marine animals."" The coast near Jindo Island is notorious for its fast and unpredictable current. Jin said his team had to get ready at least two hours before the low tide came, which only lasted for a short while throughout the operation. ""We wore diving suits that had been inserted with hot water to extend the time in water as long as possible."" On Sunday, the government said the vessel, which now weighs some 17,000 tons due to water and mud inside, has been moved on land, three weeks after it was raised from the seabed. The Sewol operation has been not only an extremely risky job but gave many first experiences even for the veteran divers, Jin said.""We've never had a ship that was lifted intact, lying tilted on the ground because usually we place a wreck upright before raising it. It was also the first time for us to cover every window and door of the ship with nets to prevent any losses.""Despite the hardship, Jin expressed confidence in his work and team, saying that he would not hesitate to take part again if he went back two years and was asked to do the job. ""I'm sure I'd say yes if I was asked to do it again. I believe we can do it.""","chinese veteran diver ,chinese veteran diver the ,veteran diver the recovery ,for chinese veteran diver ,south korean sunken ferry","['south korean', 'Jin Feng', 'the Shanghai Salvage', 'Yonhap News Agency']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45595953  0.24182995

The reports also disputed the South Korean and US militaries’ initial assessment, saying the tested missile was an extended-range Scud, not a KN-15 intermediate-range ballistic missile, also known as the Pukguksong-2, which the North launched for the first time in February.This photo unveiled by the communist country's Korean Central News Agency on Feb. 13, 2017, shows North Korea's launch of a new type of intermediate-range missile, also known as the Pukguksong-2.  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff declined to verify the reports, saying further analysis is needed.“We have already explained to you about the joint analysis between South Korea and the US. We don’t have any further comments. Thorough analysis is needed for more accurate information,” Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told reporters. An unidentified US defense official told AFP that the missile was a Scud and it suffered an in-flight failure before crashing into the East Sea. Citing an unidentified intelligence official, Fox News also reported that the missile did not go as far as intended, saying it did not reach Japanese waters and may have “pinwheeled in flight.” The media outlet also quoted defense officials as saying the missile was a Scud.The speculation was further shored up by the unusual silence from Pyongyang’s state-run media, which would otherwise have lauded its new missile test the next day with relatively detailed descriptions on its specifications in its typical rhetoric. When North Korea conducted its new high-performance rocket engine in March, the official Korean Central News Agency touted it as a “new birth” for its rocket industry and released a photo of its leader Kim Jong-un giving a piggyback to a midlevel military officer.A test-launch of the Hyunmoo-2B missile in 2015 in this file photo. Meanwhile, South Korea’s military has successfully test-launched a new 800-kilometer range ballistic missile that can reach anywhere in North Korea as a strong deterrence against the regime’s nuclear and missile threat, defense sources said Thursday. The military recently conducted a successful test-launching of a Hyunmoo-type ballistic missile with a range of 800 km at the Anheung test site of the Agency for Defense Development under the wing of the Defense Ministry, they added. “As there was a space limit for us to fly the ballistic missile at a maximum range, we intentionally reduced the missile’s flight distance and focused on improving accuracy and other key functions,” the official told Yonhap News Agency. Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Col. Roh Jae-chun declined to comment on the details of the test, citing the sensitivity of the issue.The military has been spurring efforts to complete its development and deployment of a ballistic missile with a range of 800 kilometers by the end of this year, since it struck a deal with the US in 2012 to extend the range of its ballistic missiles to 800 km, up from the previous 300 km.South Korea’s missile inventory includes the Hyunmoo-2A ballistic missile, with a range of more than 300 km, and the Hyunmoo-2B that can fly over 500 km, plus the Hyunmoo-3 cruise missile with a range of 1,000 km.By Yeo Jun-suk","flight malfunction news reports ,flight malfunction news ,country latest missile test ,malfunction news reports said ,in flight malfunction news","['North Korea ’s', 'US', 'south korean', 'US']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37522775  0.437424

His sudde...","Having transformed from a medical doctor to computer virus vaccine developer, venture entrepreneur, professor and eventually politician, Ahn Cheol-soo’s entire life has been a series of identity changes.Preparing for his second bid for the Korean presidency this year, Ahn apparently sought to make another significant change in his public image -- this time by altering his oratorical tone and way of speech. His sudden vocal transition, despite mixed reactions, certainly fixed the spotlight back on the runner-up centrist candidate ahead of the main race.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party “Will you all join me in my path to victory?” Ahn shouted in a thundering voice Tuesday upon being confirmed as the candidate for the People’s Party in the upcoming May 9 presidential election.His speech startled audiences across the nation, who could no longer associate the businessman-turned-politician with his former signature scholarly image and diffident tone.Ahn’s career in information technology and academia has long been a double-edged sword for Ahn’s political ambitions.His voice was relatively high-toned, often lacking the tenacity or pugnacity required for powerful political speeches.Such features, combined with his repeated submissions in key races, created the image of a man lacking the willpower to stand firm against challenges, as his name Cheol-soo also happens to signify in Korean language. Though Cheol-soo is a popular Korean name, it can also mean “withdrawal.”Ahn first stepped into politics in 2011 as a potential candidate in the Seoul mayoral election, but gave way to liberal contender Park Won-soon before announcing his bid. He returned later in 2012 as a presidential aspirant but once again gave up his race in mid-way, with less than a month remaining to the Dec. 19 election.The fact that he kept quiet on rampant speculations as to his candidacy for several months before making the big announcement that year was also taken as a sign he was not so much a man of action, but of “thoughts.”With his renewed character, however, Ahn did not hesitate to fling down the gauntlet directly to Moon Jae-in, his once-political partner who is now the presidential front-runner, from the Democratic Party of Korea.“The time of Ahn Cheol-soo has arrived. Gone are the days of Moon Jae-in. Gone are the days of hegemony,” Ahn said, claiming himself as the only eligible candidate to achieve a change of government power and national unity.He also constantly shouted for the audience’s applause and cheers in a declamatory tone and gesture.“I, Ahn Cheol-soo, have become a million times stronger from who I was back in 2012. ... Can you feel it, people?” he exclaimed at the end of his candidacy acceptance speech.Skeptical observers suggested that the new personality of his could be but a temporary gesture to create drama at the party convention in which he officially kicked off his presidential race as the elected candidate of the party.But Ahn has been determined to keep up his new public image as an iron-willed, strong-worded, uncompromising presidential aspirant.“Many point out the change in my tone,” Ahn told reporters in a press conference after clinching his candidacy, though no related questions had been asked on the issue.“If I am unable to change myself, how may I possibly change a country?”He made it clear the drastic change was his own decision and action.“I, too, wondered , so I asked him,” said party Chairman Rep. Park Jie-won, who is also the most powerful in-party aide for Ahn.“As a former doctor and scientist, Ahn does a lot of research. Just as he researched and developed a computer vaccine, he acquired  all on his own.”Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party Ahn’s new way of speech, especially the artificial low-tone and growling impression, immediately triggered backlash from the rival Democratic Party, as well as from a large portion of the public.“ is totally awkward, just like an unfitting outfit or insincere laughter,” said Jung Chung-rae, a former lawmaker known for his radical expressions and eloquent speeches.“One does not become any stronger just by shouting.”But despite the criticism, Ahn’s support rating soared in the day following his victory in the party primaries. A survey conducted and released by local pollster Realmeter showed him garnering 34.5 percent of respondents’ support, catching up closely with Moon’s 41.3 percent.Along with his vocal change, Ahn has also altered his appearance by combing his hair back to expose his forehead and rolling up his shirt sleeves during landmark speeches -- all seen as gestures to create a strong, masculine and confident public image.By Bae Hyun-jung","developer venture entrepreneur professor ,professor and eventually politician ,vaccine developer venture entrepreneur ,korean presidency this year ,venture entrepreneur professor","['Ahn Cheol', 'korean', 'Ahn']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27473038  0.58811587

Riding the subway from near his home in Nowon district, the former software mogul talked about various issues, including how he would handle the growing problem of fine dust blowing in from China.""The fine dust that comes from China has to be resolved by diplomatic means,"" he said. ""Now our foreign policy must cover environmental issues.""During the 10-minute ride, Ahn also took selfies with passengers and broadcast himself live on Facebook at the request of one citizen. Another citizen gave him a book as a gift.When one passenger complained of his long commute to work, Ahn sympathized with him, saying it takes him 1 1/2 hours to travel from home to the National Assembly. The two-term lawmaker pointed out there should be more and better jobs in the northern area of Seoul, including Nowon.Ahn has cast himself as a self-made politician who has built a career on nothing but his own efforts. Moon of the Democratic Party, on the other hand, has the backing of followers of the late liberal icon and former President Roh Moo-hyun.The subway ride was apparently a move designed to consolidate that image claimed by Ahn.""I just took the subway from Sanggye-dong,"" he said later during a press conference at the National Assembly. ""The neighborhood of Sanggye-dong, where I live now, is where self-made people first settle down.""The party co-founder sought to dispel suspicions about his ability to run state affairs with only 39 seats in the 300-member National Assembly.""The opposition will hold a majority whether it be the People's Party that takes power or the Democratic Party,"" he said. ""What's most important is a president's ability for cooperative governance.""Without naming the Democratic Party, Ahn questioned how a party that turns away members of different factions as the enemy could work together with other parties.Asked what has changed about him in the five years since he first ran for president, the lawmaker noted his voice.""It's easier to change oneself than it is to change a nation,"" he said. ""I'd like you to regard it as an expression of will. My intentions haven't changed one bit, but my earnestness has grown.""Ahn also visited the National Cemetery in Seoul to pay his respects to the country's past leaders.In South Korea, it is customary for politicians to honor former presidents to mark the start of a new journey.","of his campaign wednesday ,his campaign wednesday ,campaign wednesday by meeting ,his campaign wednesday by ,subway on first stop","['Ahn Cheol', ""People 's Party"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol - soo', ""People 's Party""]",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.71349692  0.28926626

The weeklong program, to be held at the university’s Jukjeon campus in Gyeonggi Province through Saturday, is led by five visiting lecturers from Silicon Valley, renowned as a global hub of design thinking.Students engage in a group discussion during the Design Thinking Boots Camp at Dankook University’s campus in Jukjeon, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. Design thinking refers to an approach of breaking stereotypes to resolve problems, usually carried out in a group to gather ideas. Already used in many global companies such as Apple, SAP and IBM, it is emerging as a new educational method that befits the fourth industrial revolution. During the program, students are asked to choose a theme based on their interests and employ creative problem-solving skills to tackle the issue as a team. Any issue -- from low birthrate rate to foreign affairs -- can be accessed by design thinking. “Stanford d.school has been spreading design thinking to help startups and global enterprises to seek unique ideas and solutions. The workshop will be a good opportunity to help develop Korea’s own style of design thinking,” said Kim Tae-hyeong, director of Dankook’s Software Design Convergence Center.Dankook University opened its SW Design Convergence Center last year to nurture creativity in students through design thinking.By Byun Hee-jin  and Park Joung-kyu","lecturers from silicon valley ,korean school said tuesday ,by five visiting lecturers ,visiting lecturers from silicon ,five visiting lecturers","['Dankook University', 'Stanford', 'south korean', 'Gyeonggi Province']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2550481   0.45639446

After he was diagnosed with kidney cancer, he took to Coursera, a massive open online course platform, to keep learning and taking courses from top-rated universities for the first time in his life. “I want to learn new things because that’s what brings joy to my life,” he said in a contribution article on Coursera.  Harry Smith, a student on Massive Open Online Course platform Coursera, talks about his learning experience on a video released on April 20, 2016. Smith is one of the rare students who actually complete MOOC courses. While many start taking MOOCs on platforms such as Coursera, Udacity and edX, only a few see them through to completion. A December 2016 report from a joint research team from Harvard University and MIT showed that only 5.5 percent of the 4.5 million students who enroll in one of their open online courses earn a certificates. The drop-out rates quite often raise skepticism on the effectiveness of the platforms, especially as to whether they can properly supplement or even replace current education system as they proposed.Yet, not many critics stop to think who those students are and what kind of courses they are taking. A closer look at those 5.5 percent details reveal that though it may seem to be failing, MOOCs are still on to something.  Harry Smith, a student on Massive Open Online Course platform Coursera, surfs through the website on a video released on April 20, 2016. The HarvardX and MITx report shows that their most popular courses are in computer science, followed by those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.It is becoming a trend among MOOC platforms to focus more on tech courses. However, it is yet early to say that these platforms are veering away from traditional courses on liberal arts to practical subjects that directly benefit students.While tech courses remain popular, many students who enroll at MOOC courses still favor some non-tech courses. Humanities and arts courses such as “Seeing Through Photographs” or “Buddhism and Modern Psychology” are listed among the Most Popular Courses of 2016 on Coursera, suggesting that MOOC students are not only interested in tech courses. The vastly different backgrounds of students are also an important factor that will shape the future of MOOC courses. Only 29 percent of students on HarvardX and MITx are from the US. Others are from all over the world, including Greece, China, Indonesia, Rwanda, Kazakhstan and Iraq. Despite the brief history and some skepticism, the MOOC platform is solidifying its position as a viable option for a growing number of students who favor open and online classrooms.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis testifies before the Senate Appropriations Committee Defense Subcommittee on defense readiness and budget update in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on March 22, 2017 in Washington, DC. Mattis also accused China of ""seeking veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of nations on their periphery."" He did not elaborate, but one such case is Beijing's retaliatory measures against South Korea for hosting the US THAAD missile defense system.South Korea decided last year to host a THAAD battery to boost defense against North Korea.But China has ramped up pressure on Seoul to scrap the decision, claiming that the system, especially its powerful radar, could be used to spy on the country and undermine its nuclear deterrent, despite repeated assurances that it will be used only for defense against the North.As Seoul refused to give in to the pressure, China has taken a number of economic retaliatory measures in what critics denounce as bullying, including restricting imports from South Korea and banning Chinese tourists from visiting the neighboring nation.During a visit to Seoul last week, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Chinese economic retaliation is ""inappropriate and troubling"" and urged Beijing to ""address the threat that makes that necessary, that being the escalating threat from North Korea.""","china taking tribute nation ,we see china shredding ,see china shredding trust ,mattis china taking tribute ,china taking tribute","['US', 'Jim Mattis', 'China', 'China']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45824197  0.50807554

The event, organized by World Wide Fund for Nature, will see individuals, communities, households and businesses switch off nonessential lights for an hour from 8:30 p.m. Saturday.  Namsan Tower in Seoul In 2007, Earth Hour was launched in Sydney, Australia, to send a message to people around the world that small moves, such as switching off the lights at home, can bring about a big change. The first event involved 2.2 million citizens in Australia. Since then, it has grown to engage more than 178 countries and 7,000 cities. This year’s Earth Hour is significant due to the soaring temperatures around the world, the WWF said. According to NASA, 2016 was the hottest year on record, setting a new high for the third year in a row. The extreme weather means the impact of climate change is being felt sooner than expected, scientists said. A separate report also showed that the Earth’s surface temperature has now risen about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the levels seen before the industrial revolution, when large-scale fossil fuel burning began. The Paris agreement, an international treaty on climate change reached in December 2015, aims to cap the increase to below 1.5 C. According to the Korea Ecological Footprint Report 2016, jointly published by Global Footprint Network and World Wide Fund for Nature last year, humanity’s demands outstrip what the Earth can regenerate by 64 percent. Simply put, people are using natural resources equivalent to 1.6 times that found on Earth. And for Koreans, the amount is 3.3 times that found on the planet. Individuals and organizations that wish to take part in Earth Hour, a worldwide demonstration of support for action on climate change, may sign up to participate at http://earthhourkorea.org.The WWF said the first 500 participants who sign up will be given a free sticker of endangered animals. One can upload photos of participation in Earth Hour on social media with the hashtag #earthhour. The WWF is the world’s largest institution devoted to conserving nature, with more than 5 million members in 100 different countries. The organization aims to conserve biological diversity, lead the sustainable use of renewable energy, and reduce unnecessary consumption and environmental pollution.

Of the North Korean rocket and missile projects that we are currently aware of, the best fit for this engine would be as the second stage of the new satellite launch vehicle provisionally known as the 'Unha-9,'"" Schilling said.Unha rockets are what the North has used to put satellite into orbit. The communist nation succeeded in such a satellite launch for the first time in late 2012 and again in February last year, demonstrating strides in its long-range missile technologies.The North has long said its rocket launches are part of its space program. But Pyongyang is banned from such launches under UN Security Council resolutions as it has been accused of using them as a cover for testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Schilling said there could be a ""yet-unknown ICBM design"" sized for the big engine, but such a possibility is not large because Pyongyang has been moving towards lighter mobile systems and solid propellants for their strategic missiles.""They have been promising us an ambitious new space program, which will require a large new satellite launch vehicle.

Under the advisory, the government should come up with a system to bolster clinical trials and to drastically reduce burdens for patients with stage four cancer, the alliance said.Also, a discussion panel made up of representatives from the government, the National Assembly, doctors, patients and pharmaceutical companies should be set up to tackle cancer in a systematic manner, the group said.","for cancer patients nonprofit ,cancer patients nonprofit ,cancer patients nonprofit group ,friday the korea cancer ,support for cancer patients","['South Korea', 'the Korea Cancer Care Alliance']",20,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.1132673  0.23667778 0.46930236],KH디지털2,Social affairs,3,2017,"korea cancer death rate the ,855 people died of cancer ,statistics korea cancer death rate ,korea cancer death rate ,patients with cancer the leading","['South Korea', 'the Korea Cancer Care Alliance', 'Statistics Korea', 'Yim Young - hyeok', 'the National Assembly']",10,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.1132673  0.23667778 0.46930236]

And finally the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015, concluding 20 years of climate negotiations,"" Ban said. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Kim-moon He was speaking at an event to mark the release of the Korean-language edition of the US-published book on Ban's decade-long term, 'Furthering the Work of the United Nations; Highlights of the Tenure of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 2007-2016.' ""Many people around the world assess that the climate change accord is the greatest achievement of my 10 years as secretary general. This is by any standards, one of the proudest moments for me,"" he noted. ""I have exerted all my energy and passion to achieve the climate change agreement ... we must ensure that the commitments are kept.""During the initial period of his term, UN senior staff warned Ban that his climate change initiative may fail since it is too complicated and politically risky, he said. ""At that time, I was saying that we do not have a plan B, because we do not have a planet B."" The former South Korean foreign minister also stressed the indispensability of the world body in dealing with global issues. ""The world is yet to be peaceful ... Terrorism and radicalism continue to expand their scope of activity. The role of the UN is more demanding than ever,"" Ban said.  ""Many people are questioning whether the UN has been an effective and appropriate body in dealing with the complexities of the world today ... I strongly believe the answer is yes,"" Ban said. ""I have always been told that if we abolish the UN today the world will have to form another UN tomorrow ... This is because the UN is the only institution that pursues the most common values and ideals of the world and is the only common platform where each and every member state has an equal voice and equal vote,"" he said.  Retiring from his UN position at the end of 2016, Ban was on the verge of launching his presidential bid at a time South Korea was gripped by a massive corruption scandal which later led to the ouster this month of President Park Geun-hye. Amid emerging influence-peddling allegations surrounding his own relatives, however, Ban announced in February that he will not run for the upcoming presidential election. An aide to Ban told Yonhap News Agency on Thursday that he will leave for the US on March 24 to take up a position as a visiting professor at Harvard University.","climate accord as proudest ,10 year tenure defending ,global problems fought tirelessly ,fight climate change ,cites paris climate accord","['United Nations', 'Ban Kim - moon', 'Paris', 'UN']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69698435  0.42670068

Anyone with a smartphone today can express their views online and exercise their freedom of speech.Unfortunately, it comes at a cost -- of also empowering misogynists to engage in unfettered gender-based violence. A key way to fight this alarming trend? Strike directly at the core of the problem -- online communities where anonymous trolls share and reinforce their misinformed views -- and puncture them, a group of European experts advised. A group of European experts, including Joelle Hivonnet , deputy head at the E.U. Delegation in Seoul, speak to reporters at a press conference in northern Seoul on March 14, 2017, on the rising phenomenon of online gender-based violence. ""What the government as well as civic societies and the mainstream media needs to begin to do is to puncture these echo chambers,"" Carl Miller, research director at the London-based Center for Analysis of Social Media, said at a recent press conference in Seoul.Miller was among a group of European experts -- including Joelle Hivonnet, political head of the EU Delegation in Seoul and Liesbet Stevens, deputy director of the Belgian Institute for Equality of Women and Men -- who were invited to a forum on online violence by the Korean Institute For Gender Equality Promotion and Education held at the National Assembly on Wednesday.""One of the things that the Internet allow to be created are what we call echo chambers. Communities which are united in having a single point of view about the world,"" Miller explained.Miller added ""we need to get other kinds of messages in there in order to introduce new information.""Hivonnet underscored that Europe is also seeing this trend expanding at a dangerously fast rate, directly weighing down the region's economy.""The total cost of gender based-violence stands at 226 billion euros, which is approximately 3.26 trillion won ,"" she said, stressing that the negative impact of gender-based violence runs much deeper and wider than apparently conceived.Hanna Onwen-Huma, a researcher at Finland's National Health and Welfare, noted that the rise of gender-based violence has its roots in the cognitive discrepancies caused by changing social norms relating to gender.She explained that the Finnish society has matured so as to accept ""girls to be masculine."" But according to Onwen-Huma, it's still ""not okay for boys to be feminine.""""Not all of our boys fit into this box ,"" said Onwen-Huma, and argued that the boundary of the ""box"" should expand.Jackie Jones, law school professor at the University of West England, noted that gender-based violence isn't just a feminist issue and stressed the importance on educating people -- both young and old -- on forming healthy relationships to cope with problems stemming from the expansion of violent pornography.","puncturing to fight gender ,the problem online communities ,sword anyone with smartphone ,gender based violence experts ,fight gender based violence",[],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67778051  0.09782292

Along with Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the Bareun Party, Hong has been cited as a strong presidential contender to represent the conservative bloc. South Gyeongsang Gov. Hong Joon-pyo ""I can hardly avoid a mandate from Heaven when the moment comes,"" Hong said through his social media account on Sunday.According to the poll conducted on Saturday and Sunday by Korea Research Center, commissioned by Yonhap News Agency and KBS, Hong posted an approval rating of 1.9 percent, followed by Yoo with 1.6 percent. Hwang, who has not yet expressed his presidential ambitions, posted 9.1 percent.On Sunday, the Liberty Korea Party lifted the suspension of party membership imposed against Hong, paving the way for his candidacy. Hong's membership had been suspended since 2015 after being charged with bribery in a high-profile lobbying scandal.In February, the Seoul High Court found Hong not guilty of receiving money from Sung Wan-jong, the late former head of Kyungnam Corp., a local construction firm, ahead of a ruling party's leadership election in 2011.The Constitutional Court removed Park Geun-hye from her presidential office last week on a corruption scandal, dealing a harsh blow to the conservative bloc.Amid the rising public discontent against the conservative circle, Moon Jae-in, former head of the Democratic Party who lost against Park in the 2012 presidential race, appears to have strengthened his lead in the presidential race in local polls. The poll conducted by Yonhap and KBS showed Moon posted an approval rating of 29.9 percent, significantly higher than any other conservative figures.The presidential race is widely expected to take place in May, as South Korea must elect a new leader within 60 days after the ouster of an impeached president.","announce his presidential ambitions ,to run for president ,his aides said monday ,run for president aide ,to announce his presidential","['South Gyeongsang', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'the Liberty Korea Party', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the Bareun Party', 'Hong']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.543652    0.42417422

Kim Han-sol, the 22-year-old son of Kim Jong-nam, appeared in a recently posted YouTube clip in which he said he is with his sister and mother but didn't mention where. This image captured from a video posted on YouTube on March 8, 2017 shows a man believed to be the son of Kim Jong-nam, the murdered half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The organization that uploaded the video, however, expressed gratitude to the Netherlands, China, the United States and an unidentified country for providing emergency assistance in protecting Kim's family. In particular, it gave special thanks to Ambassador A.J.A. Embrechts, the Netherlands' top envoy to Seoul who also serves as the country's ambassador to North Korea, for help.An official at the Netherlands' Embassy in Seoul declined to comment on questions seeking confirmation, saying that it is the country's official response. But the official said that the Netherlands' foreign ministry is aware of related media reports on the YouTube video.Kim Jong-nam, the estranged brother of the North leader Kim Jong-un, was killed on Feb. 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport after two Asian women allegedly smeared the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent on his face. The North is suspected of being behind his murder, though Pyongyang denies any involvement.After Kim's death, the whereabouts of his family members have not been known amid speculation that they may be staying somewhere in Macau under China's protection.","recently posted youtube clip ,son of slain kim ,recently posted youtube ,korean leader escape from ,in recently posted youtube","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Han - sol', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'YouTube', 'YouTube']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.45028219  0.22951406

According to the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, it discovered two deaths of users of the toxic products in 1995 after reviewing 5,432 damage claims made to the government from 2011 to Feb. 9.The victims are a 54-year-old person and a 50-day-old infant. Both used a product manufactured by SK Chemical in 1994, the ACCEH said. The Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health holds a press conference at its headquarters in Jongno-gu, central Seoul, Monday, arguing that the first death tied to the use of toxic humidifier disinfectants here dates back to 1995. The humidifier disinfectant case came to light in 2011 after four pregnant women died of unidentified lung-related diseases. It was when the government officially confirmed the link between the health damages of victims and the toxic substances widely used to sterilize humidifiers in Korea up until six years ago.So far, a state-led investigation confirmed a connection between 883 lung-related damages and the chemicals used in humidifier disinfectants.But civic groups have been claiming that the number of deaths is well above 1,131, due to the delayed response and insufficient action by the government. “The number of damage reports peaked in 2011 when the government officially started to investigate the case, but the damage reports continued even after the Health Ministry ordered a withdrawal of all of toxic humidifier sterilizers from the market in 2012,” said head of the ACCEH Choi Ye-Yong during the briefing on Monday. Choi said that at least 54-68 people died each year from 2012 to last year, even after the problematic products were removed from store shelves.“It is because the government failed to keep track of victims and their undiscovered side effects. The government should re-conduct in-depth investigations to check the severity of the victims’ health conditions,” Choi said. The Environment Ministry, together with experts, is currently working on the fourth round of victim verification process to provide them with due compensation and medical treatment.Since July last year, the ministry has been providing government subsidies to humidifier disinfectant victims in categories 1-2 with monthly living costs and nursing fees.In December, the ministry expanded the state support for more victims whose suffering was deemed less directly connected to the problematic products, after lawmakers cleared a bill to create a relief fund for victims.

In 2015, the number of fined riders stood at 42,289, paying about 1.5 billion won.The most frequent tricks were bypassing the turnstiles without tagging a metro card, going through the special turnstile designed for the handicapped or tagging someone else’s transportation card. The rise was especially conspicuous in the number of those using the discount pass of a family member -- who is either aged 65 or above, a student or physically handicapped -- according to Seoul Metro.“While the number of those who hopped on a train without tagging a metro card seems to be diminishing, those who use someone else’s card to receive a price discount has largely gone up,” said an SMRT official. “Senior passes, only distributed to citizens 65 years or older, are frequently used by elderly people at a younger age, or even by their grandchildren.”Another subway official said it is physically difficult to crack down on such illegal riders, as it frequently leads to quarrels between subway staff and passengers.“Even when they are caught, many of the illegal riders refuse to give their personal information and even reproach subway staff members for levying fines on them,” a Seoul Metro official surnamed Park who works at City Hall station told The Korea Herald.“Clashes often break out as we are neither the police nor have the official right to interrogate passengers,” Park added.According to a report released by Seoul Institute last year, 724 billion won worth of extra burden is needed each year to manage Seoul’s subway operations during times of congestion. To reduce the burden, Seoul’s subway operators should consider adopting a differential fare system, charging passengers more during peak times, the report suggested.By Kim Da-sol","curb illegal subway rides ,subway operators said friday ,illegally hopping on trains ,rising subway fare dodging ,to curb illegal subway","['Seoul City ’s', 'Seoul Metro', 'Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit', 'Subway Lines']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05953296  0.16009745

DPRK is short for the North's official name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It also threatened that what it sees as such a ""desperate"" action will only bolster its move to emerge as ""the strongest power of self-reliance and self-development.""","friday launched vicious personal ,north korea on friday ,on friday launched vicious ,friday launched vicious ,launched vicious personal attack","['North Korea', 'south korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Malaysia', ""the North 's Central Committee of the De""]",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37932366  0.21343811

An association of 112 civic groups advocating sexual minorities, women, the disabled and migrant workers said that an anti-discrimination act would be a minimum tool to provide the socially marginalized with much-needed protection. An association of 112 civic groups speaking for social minority groups holds a press conference Thursday, calling for the enactment of an anti-discrimination act. “The anti-discrimination act is not only for sexual minorities. It is to protect the dignity of the socially marginalized,” they said in a press conference held at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul. “The enactment of the anti-discrimination act is the first step to achieve social integration and raise awareness of human rights in Korean society.”They condemned leading presidential hopefuls who have expressed support for sexual minorities but have opposed the enactment of an anti-discrimination law just yet, saying it is “insulting” to see them trying not to go against “those who incite discrimination.”Among them is leading opposition presidential hopeful Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea. He drew criticism from human rights groups after expressing opposition to the passage of an anti-discrimination act and same-sex marriage, saying there is no social consensus. “There is already a law that prevents people from being discriminated against or excluded on grounds of their sexual identities. Our party does not want to cause unnecessary controversy by additionally enacting an anti-discrimination law,” he said. Among presidential aspirants, Sim Sang-jeung of the minor opposition Justice Party is the only contender who supports the enactment of an anti-discrimination act. South Korea has no law that bans discrimination and inflammatory remarks in public.For now, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea receives complaints and investigates when discrimination takes place. It imposes recommendations, but they have no legally binding force. Several anti-discrimination bills aimed at rooting out bigotry on such grounds as gender, disability, age, race, marital status and religion have been submitted to the National Assembly since the liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration’s first attempt to turn it into law in 2007.But they have all either been scrapped or never passed through the National Assembly due to Protestant groups’ strong resistance. Protestant groups largely believe such a law would help expand homosexuality and undermine the Bible’s teachings.“Let me ask people who say it is not time yet to enact an anti-discrimination act: What do you say about the reality in which hatred and violence are taking place?” the groups posed. According to a new report by the National Human Rights Commission, hate speech is prevalent in Korean society against sexual minorities, women and the disabled. The poll of 1,014 people showed that 94.6 percent of the surveyed came across hate speech of sexual minorities online, followed by 83.7 percent who experienced it against women and 79.5 percent against the disabled. As for offline hate speech, sexual minorities were most victimized, with 87.5 percent, followed by the disabled with 73.5 percent and women with 70.2 percent.

Nam Kyung-pil The Bareun Party spun off from the ruling party earlier this year after factional feuds among President Park Geun-hye's loyalists and dissenters. Park was impeached by parliament in December over a corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.Nam said Yoo should ""return to the Saenuri Party"" if he wishes to join hands with those that played key roles in the scandal, referring to the former name of the Liberty Korea Party. The party changed its name recently.""Bareun Party colleagues already concluded it cannot join forces with those responsible for the scandal. The party was created with the spirit of seeking a true conservatism and breaking from the old vested groups,"" Nam said.Ahead of the presidential election, which may come as early as May, conservative parties face difficulties in securing competent candidates, prompting discussion about the possibility of a united campaign.Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic Party currently leads local opinion polls, followed by South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung from the same party.Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is the only conservative figure with a two-digit approval rating, though he remains noncommittal about his presidential ambitions.","presidential election rep yoo ,presidential hopefuls at odds ,presidential election rep ,wednesday criticized his rival ,the presidential election rep","['Nam Kyung - pil', 'Bareun Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Liberty Korea Party']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34803551  0.41278076

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  inspects a catfish farm with a smile, according to this photo carried by the Rodong Sinmun, the North's main newspaper on Feb. 21, 2017.  With a big smile, Kim Jong-un is shown going around the farm in photos carried by the Rodong Sinmun, the country's main newspaper.This is very different from the grim expression he had when attending a ceremony to mark his late father's birthday last week, shortly after the death of his estranged sibling started making headlines around the world.On Wednesday, Kim looked rigid at the key anniversary event held in Pyongyang to honor the country's previous leader and did not even wave when he left the venue, footage aired by a state-run TV channel showed.His facial expression stoked speculation that it might be related to the killing of Kim Jong-nam as analysts here cited his stiff look right after the 2013 execution of his uncle Jang Song-thaek as an example.Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il, was killed on Monday at an airport in Malaysia after being attacked by two Asian women with what appears to be poisonous substances.Malaysian police have arrested four suspects including Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old North Korean man. They said they are looking for four more North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of Kim's death.South Korea's government said that it is highly likely that the North Korean regime is behind the killing of Kim Jong-nam.North Korea's top envoy to Malaysia Kang Chol denounced Malaysia's probe results, calling for a joint investigation into the case.","catfish farm following brother ,catfish farm praising its ,visiting catfish farm pyongyang ,catfish farm praising ,samchon catfish farm praising","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'the Samchon Catfish Farm', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19084945  0.65406305

The school -- Munmyeong High School in Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang Province -- is among three that applied for the pilot program, which the ministry sought to promote with cash subsidies. Of the two other schools that signed up for it, Osan High School withdrew its application amid fierce opposition from its students and staff. The other, Gyeongbuk Aviation High School, was rejected by the ministry for failing to meet the procedural requirement. Set to be issued next year, the state-commissioned history textbooks were a pet project of President Park Geun-hye. It received the cold shoulder from experts and the public, as it was seen as the conservative president’s attempt to influence future generations to have a favorable interpretation of the country’s past military regimes, including the one led by her late father Park Chung-hee, who ruled the country from 1963 to 1979. Around 170 students of Munmyeong High and their parents took part in a rally, calling on the school to withdraw its application.“It is not right for the government to unilaterally decide what to teach in history,” a student’s father said at the rally. “The headmaster’s decision is completely against the opinions of students, teachers and parents.”Earlier this month, Education Minister Lee Joon-sik said the government would run the trial period before officially releasing the new textbook. He also said the government would offer subsidies to schools that wish to join. The push to replace existing history textbooks with state-authored ones lost momentum after President Park’s parliamentary impeachment late last year.By Bak Se-hwan","authored history textbook will ,state authored history textbook ,said monday that trial ,osan high school withdrew ,authored history textbook the","['the Ministry of Education', 'Munmyeong High School', 'Gyeongsan', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Osan High School']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28149265  0.2187127

Instead of enrolling in a university, the Steve Jobs wannabe chose to work full-time at a local software developer, hoping to kick-start his career as an IT professional. Apprentices at Yongsan Technical High School in Seoul train how to make SoC, an integrated circuit that combines components of computers or other electronic systems. “I’ve already set my goal. I want to become an app developer and one day start my own business,” said the 19-year-old graduate of Incheon Mechanical Technical High School.In South Korea, where nearly 70 percent of high school graduates advance to tertiary education, Kim may seem unusual. However, the teenager is among a small but growing number of young South Koreans who forgo what they see as costly and pointless university education in pursuit of their dreams. He is also among the first batch of 461 students who completed a two-year apprenticeship program, introduced in 2014 as part of the country’s efforts to promote vocational high schools -- often looked down on here as a place only for low achievers. The apprenticeship program started off with nine high schools nationwide in partnership with 15 small and medium-sized businesses. Of the first-batch of graduates, 80 percent have found jobs, the Education Ministry said. During the two-year course, students split their week between theoretical education at school and on-the-job training at actual workplaces. Companies registered with the program offer training on skills that they need, following the National Competency Standard, the country’s measure for occupational proficiency in industrial sectors. For employers, the program provides an opportunity to invest in the creation of the right talent pool from which they will hire. With the nation’s job market for college graduates deteriorating, the program has gained traction. Schools and workplaces participating in the apprenticeship course have risen to 60 and 198, respectively, this year. The Education Ministry, which has spent 60 billion won  since the program’s inception in 2014, plans to expand it further to 200 schools by the end of this year, said Kim Hong-sun, an Education Ministry director who oversees the program. “The apprenticeship program in high school is a win-win for both apprentices and employers, as it gives potential employees a head start in work skills.  because the apprentices are familiar with their work culture and show loyalty,” he said. Currently, this model is largely limited to blue-collar fields such as manufacturing, machining, molding and welding. But with the advent of “Industry 4.0,” which blurs traditional boundaries between blue-collar and white-collar workers, the program will be applicable to a much wider range of industries, the official said. “The coming Industry 4.0 will open up countless, unimaginable business opportunities” in what we now perceive as blue-collar, the ministry official said. Some even say apprenticeship is one answer to the country’s job-skills mismatch. “New technologies transform work across industries and we need new models to train young people,” said Kim In-suk, a researcher at the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training. “College degrees alone will not help one build new skills to adapt to the ever-changing labor market in the era of Industry 4.0.” Despite the bright prospects, parents’ obsession with their children’s university diploma is a major barrier to the model’s broader takeoff, education officials said. There is still the widespread perception among parents that a college diploma is essential for a higher-paying job and fulfilling life. The Education Ministry Director Kim also stressed that the apprenticeship is not about churning out low-paying jobs. “It’s  from which employers can recruit high-potential workers who would later on play important roles in their companies,” he said.Park Sang-ho, a second-year apprentice at Yongsan Technical High School, said he chose to take the course because he did not want to be one addition to the tens of thousands of jobseekers applying for Samsung. “I didn’t want any student loan, and plus, there are simply too many college graduates right now, who are all aiming at one job, like Samsung,” he said. “I think by the time I complete the apprenticeship and graduate from the school, I will have a more promising future.” By Bak Se-hwan","high school apprenticeships gain ,professional apprentices at yongsan ,year high school graduates ,school apprenticeships gain traction ,steve jobs wannabe chose","['Kim Sung - woo', 'Yongsan Technical High School', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41891915  0.58133584

In 2005, Shimane, which claims administrative sovereignty over the islets, designated Feb. 22 as a day to promote Takeshima, the Japanese name for Dokdo. Since then, Shimane has hosted various programs to strengthen its territorial claims to the islets on this day.At the rally, the group also accused the Japanese government of releasing a draft guideline on the school curriculum as part of efforts to require that Dokdo be stated as Japan's territory in school courses. Other than the territorial issue, the group criticized Japan for its actions related to the installation of statues symbolizing South Korean women sexually enslaved by the Japanese military during Tokyo's colonial rule period .Choi Jae-ik, leader of the group, said, ""We will let the entire world know about the unfortunate destiny of Korean women and the unhappy history of the Korean people, brought on by Japan.""The delegation is scheduled to arrive in Osaka later in the day and hold a protest meeting at the South Korean Consulate General in the western Japanese city and head to Matsue, the capital of the western Japanese prefecture, the next day.On Wednesday, the delegation will hold a press conference for Japanese and foreign reporters at 10:00 a.m., a rally in front of the Shimane prefectural government building and a street march to voice their objection to Japan's frequent claims to Dokdo and call for Takeshima Day to be repealed.It marked the 13th consecutive year for the group to send a delegation to lodge a protest over the ceremony.","protest meeting in japan ,annual ceremony stressing tokyo ,protest against an annual ,ceremony stressing tokyo ,this week to protest","[""South Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Japan']",20,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.30636057  0.15263005

The check-in area seems to be fairly crowded but two women then show up from opposite directions.The woman behind Jong-nam, with shoulder-length hair, ap­­proa­ches him with what could be a cloth or a hood and lunges from behind, to reach over his head and cover his face with the cloth.It takes only seconds and both women go back in the directions they came from.The woman who is seen attacking him glances back furtively as she walks quickly away from the scene.However, those at the check-in area all seem oblivious to the attack.On the run: Thi Huong walking away seconds after attacking Jong-nam The woman looks like Doan Thi Huong, the woman pictured wearing the blouse with “LOL”.Jong-nam looks to be stunned by the attack and is seen walking swiftly to an information counter and speaking to two personnel there, a man and a woman.The woman takes him to another part of the building where two policemen in uniform listen to his complaints.His is seen gesturing with both hands to his face and seems to be telling the policemen about the attack.Although he kept pointing to his face, he looks unharmed.Seeking first aid: Jong-nam being escorted to the KLIA2 clinic. The two policemen then walk with him to the airport clinic.Jong-nam could walk normally and did not need any help. The clip ends as he walks into the clinic.Hours later, came the report that he was dead.

The child is comfortable reading and writing in his mother tongue, can add and subtract below 20 without errors -- and without using his fingers to count -- and claims to understand why one plus infinity is still infinity. He currently attends a thrice-a-week, three-hour intensive course on English, a language he rarely hears or uses outside the classroom. A boy studies at Hanssem's Joy Magic Desk. In South Korea, a country notorious for its obsession with early education, Kim is not exceptional. Two weeks away from their first day of school, many of the 470,000 soon-to-be first-graders in South Korea would by now know how to read and write in Korean and do basic math, say parents and teachers. “It has become almost a norm in South Korea that kids develop language skills to a level  read textbooks without difficulty before school starts,” said Lee Sun-mi, an elementary school teacher. “The Korean alphabet is rarely taught in classrooms, because they already know it.” Driven by parents who want their kids to excel, the race to prepare soon-to-be first-graders for school has created a lucrative market of private tutoring, preschool education materials and hagwon, or private academies. Such preparation programs for children aged 6 or younger made up a market worth some 3.2 trillion won  in 2015, according to one study. And this is expected to grow, observers say, as long as parents consider the nine-year compulsory schooling here as the start of a long and crucial race that will shape their children’s chances at top universities, decent jobs and a comfortable life. Housewife Park In-suk is one contributor to the preschool education market. The 34-year-old mother recently decided to enroll her 4-year-old daughter in a four-week winter program at a private education institute in Daechi-dong, southern Seoul. The course, which is on top of her daughter’s regular kindergarten curriculum, costs over 1.5 million won. “It can be a bit exhausting I know, going through all the intensive studies for a little kid like her, but I don’t want my daughter to get anything less than my neighbors,” she said. Another mother, Kim Ji-soo, 32, said her family spends up to half of their monthly income on the private education of her son, who attends a full-day course for soon-to-be first-graders at a hagwon. Teachers there focus on improving pupils’ reading and writing skills, both in Korean and English, while conducting daily tests on other subjects, she said. “I’m thinking of going back to work to supplement my son’s education. Our budget for living essentials is tight, because of the high education spending and a mortgage,” she said. Parents who used to object to the idea of early education eventually feel the pressure when their kids approach the age when they must enter school. Some of them say they realized too late that there was no escape, as Korea is supercompetitive. “I thought that I was being a thoughtful mom by trying not to be carried away with this education fever and not teaching my kids things too early,” said Kim Mun-jung, whose first daughter is to enter school this March.“I was shocked to learn that kids who don’t know how to read and write feel like fools at school, because all others know.” Kim said that since January, she has made her daughter study Korean and basic arithmetic daily. In some ways, there is a positive side to overzealous parents’ desire to see their children excel in school and the peer pressure it has on other parents. South Korean students’ performance in the international test called PISA, or the Program for International Student Assessment, was among the top eight in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2015.But private education from an early age is unhealthy and unsustainable, experts warn. “One of the most perceived notions in early childhood education studies is that a heavy study load can have a bad influence on children in the course of their physical development,” said Gu Bon-chang, an activist at a Seoul-based civic group, World Without Worries About Private Education in Korea. Parents’ zeal for their children’s education is real, but in many cases, kids are being sent to one hagwon after another because both parents work late, he said. Insufficient social infrastructure for child care and a workplace culture that is unfriendly to working parents all play a part in the private education boom, he added. “Most of all, it is important for the government to build up trust that there is no need for education in advance of schooling,” Gu said. “Kids will eventually learn how to read and write Korean and perform basic arithmetic anyway, so there is no need to hurry.”By Bak Se-hwan","academic race six year ,the academic race six ,attends thrice week three ,six year old kim ,straight hours to study",['Kim Lyu - hyun'],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43833557  0.43448451

The textbook guideline, posted on Tokyo's e-government website for public view before the official announcement, will apply to elementary school textbooks from 2020 and to middle school books from 2021.Dokdo Currently, Japan is teaching its elementary and middle school students in social studies textbooks that Dokdo, called Takeshima in Japan, is its territory. But this is the first time that Tokyo specified the claim in the legally binding educational guideline. The guideline, which is usually revised every 10 years, serves as a state-enforced standard for writing textbooks. The move came in spite of strong protest from South Korea last month when it was reported that Japan's education ministry was pushing to revise the guideline to include its sovereignty claims to the islets. Dokdo, which lies closer to South Korea in the East Sea, has long been a source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since its liberation from Japan in 1945 and has made clear that Tokyo's claims are utterly groundless.The revision came amid deepening diplomatic friction over a statue, symbolizing the victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women, recently erected in front of the Japanese consulate in South Korea's southern port city of Busan. Tokyo demanded the immediate removal of the statue and called home its ambassador in protest last month. The ambassador has not come back to Seoul.","school textbooks from 2020 ,textbooks unveiled on tuesday ,japan revised textbook guideline ,school books from 2021 ,tuesday the textbook guideline","['Japan', ""South Korea 's"", 'Tokyo', 'Japan']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.14808621  0.46902341

Pyo Chang-won, a first-termer of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, for holding a satirical art exhibition that included the disputed piece. The picture, titled “Dirty Sleep,” shows Park lying down naked on a couch in a parody of the renowned “Olympia” by French artist Edouard Monet. This was part of an exhibition of so-called “blacklist artists,” referring to those who were allegedly identified by the Park administration for their anti-government stance and excluded from subsidies and key projects.Despite its intention to depict Park’s dereliction of duty and her inappropriate ties with her confidante Choi Soon-sil, the piece immediately came under fire for its sexually discriminative portrayal of the female president.“This is not just misogyny but a disgrace to our nation’s dignity,” said Kim Sung-eun, a member of the ruling Saenuri Party’s emergency council, demanding the Democratic Party to expel Rep. Pyo and for the latter to step down from his parliamentary seat.Kim also extended the blame to Moon Jae-in, the party’s former chairman and a presidential front-runner of the opposition party, for recruiting Pyo ahead of the general election last year.“Moon, too, should express his apology and take active measures to calm the dispute.”The Bareun Party, which officially took sail Tuesday after splitting from Saenuri, also called for self-control and dignity in the freedom of artistic expression. “Artists may certainly satirize politicians without restraint, but politicians should not make use of them for political purposes,” said Rep. Choung Byoung-gug, the newly elected chairman of the party.Floor Leader Rep. Joo Ho-young added that the painting was an insult not only to the president but also to all women.Facing disapproval from the political circle and the public, the Democratic Party also set about taking measures.“The party is considering holding a disciplinary meeting to decide on Rep.

Youn Kwan-suk told reporters.“We believe it will be best to round off the talks before the Lunar New Year holiday, as early as tomorrow if possible.”Floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho defined Rep. Pyo’s involvement in the exhibition as a “punishable act.”Rep. Woo Sang-ho , floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, on Wednesday calls for disciplinary measures on Rep. Pyo Chang-won for exhibiting a nude portrait of President Park Geun-hye “If someone had drawn a nude painting of former President Roh Moo-hyun during his  impeachment, we would not have remained silent,” he said during a party meeting.The former liberal president was impeached in 2004 over allegedly breaching political neutrality but was later reinstated by the Constitutional Court.Pyo largely kept silent Wednesday, but had said earlier that it is up to the artist’s free will to decide whether to have the disputed painting removed. He also added that he personally does not approve of the piece and that he had no knowledge of the details of the exhibition beforehand.This was not the first time that the former professor at the National Police University has faced a dispute since he joined politics last year.Last year, Rep. Pyo vowed to go public with the list of Saenuri lawmakers who voted against the president’s impeachment bill.More recently, he suggested that elected public posts should only be allowed to those aged 65 or under, apparently targeting potential conservative presidential candidate Ban Ki-moon, aged 72.By Bae Hyun-jung","disputes grow over naked ,caricature painting portraying president ,the nude at parliamentary ,an opposition lawmaker ,the painting as misogynic",['Park Geun'],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52031475  0.2679888

295,295,‘Park behind K-Sports Foundation’,"President Park Geun-hye was behind the extortion of donations from local firms for the embattled K-Sports Foundation and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil was closely involved in running the entity, according to new testimony Tuesday.Taking the witness stand at the trial for Choi and ex-presidential aide An Chong-bum at the Seoul Central District Court, former President of the K-Sports Foundation Jung Dong-choon said...","President Park Geun-hye was behind the extortion of donations from local firms for the embattled K-Sports Foundation and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil was closely involved in running the entity, according to new testimony Tuesday.Taking the witness stand at the trial for Choi and ex-presidential aide An Chong-bum at the Seoul Central District Court, former President of the K-Sports Foundation Jung Dong-choon said he had thought the president set up the foundation and entrusted Choi with the power to manage it.Former President of the K-Sports Foundation Jung Dong-choon “A key state task was to promote the Korean culture wave and the foundation received donations from the Federation of Korean Industries. I thought that the cooperation from companies  could only be possible if the president was behind it,” he said. “I don’t think Choi unilaterally did it.”Choi and An are standing trial on charges of forcing some 50 local firms to donate a total of 77.4 billion won  to the K-Sports and Mir foundations. President Park Geun-hye is suspected to be their accomplice.Park’s alleged involvement in the illegal fundraising campaign is one of the reasons behind her impeachment on Dec. 9. Though she has denied all charges, FKI Vice Chairman Lee Seung-cheol admitted to being under “pressure” from the presidential office to solicit corporate donations during an earlier court hearing. The K-Sports Foundation’s ranking official Roh Seung-il also appeared before the court and offered testimony that hinted at the presidential office’s attempt to destroy evidence and sway the investigation in its favor. Roh said that ex-presidential aide An handed over a two-page document telling him to offer false testimony to state prosecutors. “In the document, there was an answer sheet directing me to say ‘I don’t remember’ or ‘I don’t know’ ,” he said. He also revealed that Choi, who holds no official post at the foundation, had made key decisions for the entity behind the scenes. “Choi Soon-sil was involved in all the projects, budget execution and personnel appointments at the foundation,” he said, adding that she tried to derive benefits for the Blue-K, her German-based paper company, through the foundation. Choi has denied any involvement in the foundation’s activities other than recommending Jung as the president of the K-Sports Foundation. Jung was an owner of a massage parlor Choi had frequented.

Other marches took place in Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, St. Louis, Denver and elsewhere.Protesters walk up Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women's March in Washington, Saturday. Roused by fiery speeches, the protesters sent out a resounding message of rebuke and resistance the day after the Republican hardliner took office with a vow to roll back the legacy of his predecessor.“It feels amazing” to join women pushing back against Trump’s divisive, discriminating and threatening rhetoric, said 16-year-old Maria Iman, who traveled to Washington with fellow high school students from Illinois.“I’m part of history and one day will tell my children about this.”A sea of women and men -- teens, pensioners, parents with toddlers on their shoulders -- swarmed the streets in a determined show of unity.Educator Tanya Gaxiola, 39, who flew in from Tucson, Arizona, expressed concern that Trump will seek to restrict abortion laws and otherwise clamp down on women’s rights.“He‘s a narcissist and seeks approval, and this is a big display of disapproval,” Gaxiola said. “Hopefully, it catches his attention.”“Women won’t back down,” “Women‘s rights are human rights” and “Thank you Trump -- you turned me into an activist,” read some of the thousands of handmade signs held aloft in the capital.In Boston, where up to 175,000 people demonstrated, fiery Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren took aim at Trump’s campaign of “attacks” on women and minorities.“We can whimper. We can whine. Or we can fight back!” Warren said to a loud roar.Saturday’s rallying cry was heard far beyond America’s shores, with organizers saying over 2.5 million people signed up for one of more than 600 marches worldwide.One of the largest was in London, where tens of thousands of women, men and children marched chanting “Dump Trump.”The human tide flooding Washington appeared to dwarf the throngs of Trump supporters in red “Make America Great Again!” caps who had cheered his swearing-in.Many wore knitted “pink pussyhats” in an allusion to Trump’s videotaped boasts of being able to grab women’s genitals with impunity because he is famous.Trump’s defeated rival Hillary Clinton tweeted her support to the protesters, while former secretary of state John Kerry was spotted in the crowd -- a day after leaving office -- with his dog on a pink leash.Pop diva Madonna, wearing her own black pussyhat, made an impromptu appearance on the Washington protest stage to deliver an expletive-laden indictment of the president.“Welcome to the revolution of love,” the 58-year-old intoned. “To the rebellion. To our refusal as women to accept this new age of tyranny.”On his first full day in the world’s most powerful office, Trump visited the headquarters of the CIA, an agency he feuded with bitterly before taking office.“I am with you 1,000 percent,” Trump said in a short address to CIA staff -- during which he also accused US media playing down the inauguration turnout.But he bizarrely turned his speech toward an assault on the media for their reporting on inauguration crowd size.His press secretary, at his first briefing in the White House, also launched into reporters, falsely claiming that “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period!”Trump’s inaugural speech on Friday set the tone for his presidency: proudly populist, fiercely nationalist and determined to break with Obama’s legacy.His first act in office -- signing an executive order aimed at freezing Obama‘s signature health care law -- was a potent gesture in that direction, with more such actions expected to follow.But if Friday was Trump’s day -- marred by sporadic outbreaks of vandalism and more than 200 arrests -- Saturday belonged to demonstrators with fresh memories of his fat-shaming a former beauty queen, sex assault allegations and a controversial stance on abortion.The Women’s March began with a simple Facebook post from Hawaii grandmother and retired lawyer Teresa Shook to about 40 friends -- but word traveled quickly and the event took on a life of its own.","women marches draw millions ,protesters brought downtown washington ,marches draw millions in ,trump launched withering attack ,marches draw millions","['Washington', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'US', 'Washington', 'the White House', 'Trump']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26325142  0.11856874

The conference, entitled “2017 JETS ,” set for Thursday and Friday, is expected to lay the foundation for young entrepreneurs who wish to establish their own businesses, amid the growing importance of startups for the national economy. Entrepreneur activities have often led to the creation of jobs and the growth of the economy, KAIST said. In fact, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alone has produced roughly 26,000 businesses by students after graduation, which led to hiring more than 3.3 million employees in the United States. Their annual sales reached $1.9 trillion in 2008, which would place them ninth in gross domestic product per capita ranking, according to KAIST.Beside the science and engineering institute, Stanford University’s alumni have also contributed to creating around 5.4 million jobs in the US, generating $2.7 trillion in annual revenue in 2010. That would be the fifth-highest GDP per capita globally, KAIST added. For such reasons, several universities here have also entered the startup market by running assistance programs and giving consultations for entrepreneurial activities among their students. But the lack of collaborative actions in academia in general to support and train talented students across the nation is a hurdle to the efforts to cultivate favorable and sustainable environment for startups, KAIST said in a press release. To cope with that concern, KAIST’s upcoming conference, JETS, associated with other key science and technology universities, is expected to help people understand the concept of creating businesses more easily and bridge the gap between universities and students when it comes to startups.The conference will also bring opportunities for intellectuals to realize the role of universities for creating new industries and cultivating a sustainable business environment by training talented youth, according to a press release from KAIST. During the conference, participants are expected to attend exhibitions for newly created businesses and their products, as well as lectures and consultations to better understand entrepreneurship and how to start own businesses. Participants are also given opportunities to get sponsored with business incubators that offer a variety of amenities including work spaces and support for activities.

Choi is Park’s confidante of some 40 years. She has had no government post or policy background. “I admit that I delivered documents to Choi and made revisions to them according to Choi’s opinions,” Jeong Ho-seong said during the hearing held at Seoul Central District Court. “President Park told me to confirm with Choi and reflect her opinions in the documents.”The former presidential secretary, who is charged with colluding with Park to leak over 200 classified documents to Choi, had earlier denied Park’s involvement during a preparatory hearing in late December.Ex-presidential Jeong Ho-sung While implicating Park in the unauthorized sharing of information with Choi, Jeong also sought to defend the embattled president, who is currently standing trial on her impeachment.  “Park only intended to check once more to better run the country,” he said. “I also did my best to better assist her in her job. I feel heartbroken to hear the accusation that I colluded with her to commit a crime.” He is suspected of leaking about 180 presidential documents, including 47 state secrets, to Choi between January 2013 and April 2016. Jeong and Choi were found to have exchanged 1,197 text messages and 895 phone calls between February 2013 and December 2014. Prosecutors have submitted audio files of his phone conservations with Choi and Park -- found on his phone seized by investigators -- as evidence.The influence-peddling scandal engulfing the country first came to the fore after presidential speeches, policy drafts and President Park’s photos and undisclosed schedules were discovered on a tablet PC supposedly owned by Choi and later obtained by a local cable network. Choi has so far denied ownership of the tablet PC. She is now standing trial on charges of abuse of power, extortion and fraud. The next hearing for Jeong is scheduled for Feb. 16. He is also set to appear before the Constitutional Court on Thursday to testify in Park’s impeachment trial.Park was impeached over allegations that she let Choi interfere with state affairs, colluded with Choi and presidential aides to extort money from local firms for entities controlled by Choi and failed to save lives during the 2014 ferry disaster.By Ock Hyun-ju","government secrets to park ,editing presidential speeches behind ,wednesday to leaking government ,leaking government secrets ,including editing presidential speeches","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Park']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23307575  0.02313179

The city of 1 million, located some 40 kilometers south of Seoul, will now embark on a mission to make the city a better place to live for its residents, investing in key sectors, including education and welfare, the mayor said. “Thanks to the support of residents and burden-sharing by some 3,000 city officials, we could achieve the debt-free goal much earlier,” Jung said at a press conference held at the Seoul City Hall on Tuesday. The city has paid off 812 billion won  in debt principal and interest payments in the past 2 1/2 years under Jung’s administration. That was two years ahead of planned schedule, the city said. Yongin Mayor Jung Chan-min officially declares the Gyeonggi Province city debt-free at a press conference in central Seoul on Tuesday. YonhapBroken down, the amount consisted of 784.8 billion won in debt principal and 36.3 billion won in interest. Of the principal, 455 billion won was in city-issued bonds and the rest was owed by city-run institutions to lenders. Accordingly, per-capita debt burden of Yongin citizens has reduced from 860,000 won in July 2014 to zero. Now with sound financial health, the city can use some its money to speed up the much-anticipated investments in education, welfare and city infrastructure -- halted due to the debt burden, Jung said. Painful restructuring efforts paid off Upon taking office as mayor of Yongin in 2014, Jung declared his intention to finish the city’s debt crisis within his term and got to work, implementing a sweeping austerity program.To start with, the city reduced operating costs across the board and trimmed down investment projects. High-ranking civil servants returned the pay increase in their annual salary to the city coffers. Lower ranks joined in by contributing 50 percent for their welfare benefits to the city. Belt-tightening measures also included a 25-50 percent decrease in office maintenance expenses, night shift allowances, annual leave compensations and business trip expenses. Secondhand office supplies were distributed and programs for cultural experiences abroad were minimized. Businesses with large budgets, such as the construction of Citizens’ Sports Park, were halted or delayed after a thorough review. While trying to reduce expenses, the city made equal efforts to boost the revenue base. It collected delinquent taxes and sold off noncore city assets. The mayor even visited potential buyers of city-owned land near Yeokbuk to aid in the sale. Such efforts led to the early payout on bonds worth 297.4 billion won in September 2015 as well as 329.8 billion owed by Yongin Urban Corp. in the same year. Financial management plan for future Looking forward, Yongin City will strive to maintain a sound fiscal status, although several challenges are expected this year and next. One of the challenges is a cut in financial support from the adjacent Seoul, the country‘s capital. Seoul had shared some of its revenues collected within the city with other autonomous municipalities as part of its effort to support a balanced regional development of the country, but it started reducing the amount of subsidies last year. With the cut, Yongin is expecting a reduction in revenue by 20 billion won this year, 50 billion won next year and up to 100 billion won in 2019. Yet, the mayor is confident that the city will manage its finances soundly, having paid off over 800 billion won in such a short period of time. With stringent fiscal policies and active fundraising efforts, it will focus resources on core projects.They include renewing old school facilities and providing more extra curriculum activities for students. It aims to establish one-stop services for pregnant women, from pregnancy to delivery, which include childbirth grants and caretaker services for mothers and infants. Basic infrastructure, such as replacement of corroded water pipes, is another area that the city will spend more on. “Our city is finally debt-free, but we can’t expect everything to get better and to be perfect all of a sudden,” Jung said. “When we untighten our belt all too soon, the history will repeat itself. I won’t let that happen and will continue to watch our finances so that the citizens will not suffer again.” By Bak Se-hwan and Park Joung-kyu","debt free mayor jung ,korea most indebted city ,officially debt free mayor ,free mayor jung chan ,debt free mayor","['South Korea ’s', 'Jung Chan - min', 'Seoul']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20835072  0.90105844

His biggest potential rival and the late president’s longtime ally, Moon Jae-in, released a book containing his presidential pledges on the same day.  Accompanied by his wife, Yoo Soon-taek, Ban paid respects at Roh’s tomb in Bongha village in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province, and moved to share a few words with Roh’s wife Kwon Yang-sook at her official residence. “The late President Roh had made a lot of effort to help me become the UN secretary-general. He even talked directly to the then-US President George W. Bush. I am deeply moved as I come back here to greet him after 10 years,” Ban told Kwon.Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his wife pay respects to the late President Roh Moon-hyun in Bongha village in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province, on Tuesday Kwon congratulated him on his 10-year term at the UN and led him to the library where Roh often spent time. “You are an important person. Stay healthy,” Kwon told Ban. “Time flies, it seems like you left for the UN only yesterday. Congratulations for successfully finishing your terms.”As Kwon complimented his strength, the 72-year-old former diplomat said he was trained to follow a busy schedule from his work at the UN. He also vowed to continue to inherit and praise Roh‘s unfinished work. The visit signified Ban’s recent moves to court both conservative and liberal voters. A day earlier, he phoned the incumbent President Park Geun-hye, the deeply unpopular conservative leader currently standing an impeachment trial for corruption, and wished her luck.  Ban, a career diplomat who is not affiliated with any political party, is considered conservative. Before Park’s fall, he was widely seen as her choice for successor. Some liberal civic groups opposing Ban came to rally around the entrance of the village and outside the residence, accusing him of betrayal. Ban, who returned to South Korea on Thursday after a 10-year stint in the New York-based UN, has not yet officially declared his intention to run in this year’s presidential race. Local media outlets reported Monday that he is likely to join a political party after the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls on Jan. 28. The 72-year-old former UN official opened a personal Facebook account Tuesday in a bid to communicate with the people via social media. Also on Tuesday, Moon revealed his ideas on a number of social issues through a book.  “I have held a lot of hands as a politician. Calloused palms, sweaty hands, bony hands and little hands of babies. It was a joy but at the same time, heartbreaking as I could feel their desperate minds for a better country and a better life,” Moon said at a press conference on his book, “The Republic of Korea Asks. Moon Jae-in Answers,” which hit local shelves Tuesday. He described the book as a tribute to all the citizens who held candles at rallies and called out for political reform, referring to protestors who took to the streets since October last year to demand President Park‘s resignation. Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9, accused of allowing her civilian confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs and of colluding with her to extort funds and favors from local conglomerates.By Jo He-rim","presidential election campaign his ,book containing his presidential ,president longtime ally moon ,presidential election campaign ,containing his presidential pledges","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Yoo Soon - taek', 'Ban']",20,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29764304  0.32128859

""We call upon Tokyo to stop making such useless claims.""Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida makes the controversial remarks in front of reporters that the Dokdo belongs to Japan`s territory  Dokdo, which lies closer to South Korea in the East Sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, has long been a source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on the islets since 1954 and has made it clear that Tokyo's claims over the territory are groundless.Tokyo's renewed territorial provocations came against the backdrop of a diplomatic row which flared up between the two countries over a recently erected girl statue, which symbolizes Japan's sexual enslavement of women during World War II, in front of its consulate in the southern port city of Busan. Japan has demanded the statue be removed immediately. In protest, Tokyo recalled its ambassador to Seoul early last week. The ambassador hasn't yet returned. Japan's wartime sexual slavery has been a major source of diplomatic friction between the two countries. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops.In December 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a deal and promised to resolve the issue once and for all. Under the deal, Tokyo expressed an apology and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation aimed at supporting its surviving victims, euphemistically called comfort women.Tokyo has claimed that removing the statue standing in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul is part of the deal and that installing yet another is a violation of the agreement. Seoul has promised to make efforts to produce a ""proper resolution"" on the matter but noted that it doesn't have any authority to remove the statues, which were built by civic groups.","urges japan to stop ,japan tuesday to stop ,japan to stop claiming ,called on japan tuesday ,protest the move","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Tokyo', 'Japan']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.20641564  0.18787932

According to Segye Ilbo, Special Counsel Park Young-soo is investigating the notion following a tip-off from an undisclosed person that Choi was behind the 2015 agreement. The investigative team also suspects Yi Pyung-gi, who was at that time Park’s chief of staff, may have been involved with or at least have some knowledge of Choi’s role.  YonhapEarlier this month, the special prosecutor’s team raided Yi’s house and investigated another person -- a Korean-Japanese scholar, the report said. Under Park’s administration, Yi held several key positions as the ambassador to Japan and the director of the nation’s spy agency. Lee Kyu-chul, the special counsel team’s spokesman, could not be reached. The revelation, if found true, could add a new layer to Park’s ongoing impeachment, although it was not listed in the parliamentary motion to sack her. The agreement on the military sexual slavery issue was reached in 2015 by both governments as “final and irreversible.” Japan agreed to disburse 100 million won  to surviving victims and 20 million won to families of the deceased. A dozen victims, however, have refused to receive the money, blasting the deal as a “sell-out.” They say the Japanese government is trying to shirk its responsibility for the wartime crimes with the fund. The 12 victims sued the South Korean government last year for failing to represent their damage properly, their legal representative the Foundation for Justice and Remembrance of the Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Victims said. Choi, the jailed confidante of President Park, is currently under investigation by the special prosecutor’s team over a streak of allegations including meddling in key government affairs and forcing big businesses to donate money to her foundations, using her ties to the president. She held no governmental position in Park’s administration. Largely due to the scandal, Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9.

But he has repeatedly signaled strong presidential ambitions, vowing to work for ""a change in politics"" -- a message seen as a stinging challenge to establishment politicians.Former UN chief Ban Ki-moon meets with workers of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering During his trip to Geoje, Ban met with workers at a shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering that has been going through a creditors-led intensive restructuring program, and highlighted the possibility of boosting ship exports through diplomacy."" can promote exports through summit diplomacy and other diplomatic channels,"" he told the workers, boasting of the extensive personal network of world leaders that he has built while taking the helm the UN. ""I will be able do that if I happen to be given the opportunity.""Ban also pointed out a series of the current government's policy mishaps, small or big, saying they must be redressed as the nation seeks to revamp the ailing shipbuilding and shipping industries.Later in the day, Ban visited the UN Memorial Cemetery in Busan and held a town hall meeting with university students.During a meeting with reporters at the cemetery, Ban commented on a 2015 deal between Seoul and Tokyo over Japan's wartime sexual slavery.He said if the deal entails an agreement to remove a statue symbolizing Korean victims, it would be ""wrong.""""My principle  is that it must be about addressing the victims' resentment,"" he said. Japan has demanded the removal of the monument in front of its embassy in central Seoul, saying it was part of the deal. Seoul has maintained it has no authority to move the statue set up by civilians.On the issue of regaining wartime operational control from Washington, Ban said when the security situation improves on the peninsula, Seoul should take steps towards regaining control. The OPCON transfer, which was previously set for 2015, was deferred amid Pyongyang's provocations. Seoul and Washington have agreed on the ""conditions-based"" transfer, which observers say could come sometime in the 2020s.Some observers said that Ban's visits to Geoje and Busan appear to have political undertones at a time when Ban is trailing Moon in various recent opinion polls. However, Ban's aides cautioned against attaching any serious political meaning to his trip there, saying it was just ""part of his onsite tour to check the reality of the economy and meet citizens.""This week, Ban also plans to visit Paengmok Port in Jindo, South Jeolla Province, the site near the 2014 ferry disaster; a recently burned traditional market in Daegu, the stronghold for conservatives; and other regions with different political views to highlight his desire for national unity.","ahead of presidential election ,monday continued his politically ,presidential election this year ,his politically tinged tour ,of presidential election","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', ""South Korea 's"", 'Geoje', 'Busan']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.554869    0.48103917

She had by then breastfed her infant baby for nearly three months. Her son went through a medical examination and no health damages were found. The doctor who removed the implant found that the silicone gel bag had ruptured.  “We will specifically investigate the case to figure out if implant materials such as silicone fillers are safe to use,” said the ministry’s researcher Yim Cheon-il. The ministry said it was the first reported case in South Korea of a rupture of breast implants leading to the infusion of silicone in a mother’s breast milk. “If there is a serious safety problem found in breast implants, the ministry will take due measures and may cancel the authorization of certain implant products,” Yim added.According to the ministry’s data, a total of 3,600 consumer complaints were reported on the side effects of breast augmentation over the past four years. Of them, 66 percent were about the rupture of breast implants.It is commonly believed among doctors and implant product manufacturers that breast augmentation does not affect breast milk if the breast prostheses are correctly installed. Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure to increase the size, shape or fullness of a woman’s breasts. The surgeon places silicone, saline or alternative breast implants under the chest muscles or breast tissue.Doctors mostly recommend using silicone implants since they have a natural form, similar to natural breasts.But since breast implants do not last permanently, they may affect the milk produced for breastfeeding, some doctors say.“Silicone-filled implants may rupture without symptoms,” said Koo Bon-sang, who runs a plastic surgery clinic in Apgujeong.“ all breast implants eventually rupture for sure. The possibility of the rupture of silicone-filled implants dramatically rises each year, from 0.5 percent two years after the surgery to 15 percent 10 years after the surgery, increasing the risk of disturbing mother’s mammary glands and milk ducts” Koo added. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration recommends performing MRI screenings of implants after three years to detect any silent rupture. The related breast implant manufacturing company declined to reveal the list of components in its silicone breast implant, citing commercial confidentiality.But industry insiders said that heavy metal content, such as platinum, nickel and chromium, are often included in the manufacture ofbreast implants, which may pose a threat to the safety of implant materials and its effects on breast milk. The ministry said the amount of such components is usually too small to cause health problems, but vowed to recheck the safety of such content.By Kim Da-sol","received breast enlargement surgery ,enlargement surgery in 2011 ,breast enlargement surgery in ,breast milk south korea ,breast implants under review","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug']",20,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ...  0.13720161 -0.03393543

Marijuana news outlets including High Times, Merry Jane and Green Rush -- along with British tabloids, which always love a good yarn -- are hailing the North as a pothead paradise and maybe even the next Amsterdam of pot tourism. They've reported North Korean marijuana to be legal, abundant and mind-blowingly cheap, sold openly to Chinese and Russian tourists at a major market on the North's border for about $3 a pound.But seriously, North Korea? Baked? The claim that marijuana is legal in North Korea is not true: The penal code lists it as a controlled substance in the same category as cocaine and heroin. And the person who would likely help any American charged with a crime in North Korea emphatically rejects the idea that the ban is not enforced.“There should be no doubt that drugs, including marijuana, are illegal here,” said Torkel Stiernlof, the Swedish ambassador. The United States has no diplomatic relations with the North, so Sweden's embassy acts as a middleman when U.S. citizens run afoul of North Korean laws. “One can't buy it legally and it would be a criminal offense to smoke it,” Stiernlof said. He said that if a foreigner caught violating drug laws in North Korea happened to be an American citizen, he or she could “expect no leniency whatsoever.”  In this Jan. 9, 2017, photo, a saleswoman holds up a locally produced t-shirt made out of Hemp in Pyongyang, North Korea, which has been getting some pretty high praise lately from the stoner world. Americans have been sentenced to years in North Korean prisons for such seemingly minor offenses as stealing a political banner and leaving a Bible in a public place.Even so, the claim that North Korea is a haven for marijuana smokers has cycled through the internet in various incarnations with great success over the past few years. Radio Free Asia, a U.S.-government-funded news service, lit up the latest round of stoner glee last month with a story that Chinese and Russian tourists are stocking up on North Korean pot by the kilo in Rason, a special economic zone on the country's northernmost frontier that has a large, bazaar-style marketplace. The same market was the setting for one of the earliest blogs on the topic, a first-person account of getting high in the North from 2013.Categorically confirming or denying such claims is difficult because foreigners' access to the market is restricted. But where there's smoke, there usually is at least a little fire.Troy Collings, a frequent traveler to North Korea and managing director of Young Pioneer Tours, offered a more mundane explanation: It's just hemp.Ditchweed. Nebraska no-high.“I've seen and even purchased hemp, but it doesn't contain any THC and is just sold as a cheap substitute for tobacco,” he told the AP in an email. “It grows wild in the mountainous regions of the North and people pick it, dry it and sell it in the markets, but it doesn't get you high no matter how much you smoke.”Hemp is grown in North Korea with official sanction. It's used to make consumer goods including towels, cooking oil and noodles, as well as and military uniforms and belts. It's also used as rabbit fodder. The rabbits are grown for food. But industrial hemp is generally so low in THC, the active ingredient found in its cannabinoid cousins, sativa and indica, that it's useless for medicinal or recreational purposes. It's even cultivated in a different manner, focusing on male plants that do not produce buds. It's the buds of female plants that recreational users are most after.The Pyongyang Hemp Processing Factory actively markets hemp products as “environmentally friendly” and “perfect for the 21st century.” An official at the plant told The Associated Press that while several varieties of hemp grow in North Korea, all are very low in THC. “No one smokes this in our country,” she said, requesting she not be named because of the sensitive nature of talking to the American media. “It's only used for making things.”North Korea grows something else that might be confused with marijuana: a mix of brown and greenish leafy tobacco that is used in pipes and sold openly in Pyongyang and elsewhere. Smoking a lot of that could certainly give someone a buzz -- and probably a bad headache. But from the nicotine.     Nevertheless, Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, another agency that specializes in bringing foreign tourists to the North, said the idea marijuana is legal in North Korea has become so widespread that it's not uncommon for prospective tourists to ask what to expect. “We apologize, but have to inform those enquiring about this that weed is not legal. They are not going to be able to get any there,” he said.“The idea that the country is full of stoners blissfully getting high in a legal-weed paradise is not an accurate one,” he added. “Not having seen or done something doesn't mean it is never seen or done, of course. But I have never seen this.”","the stoner world marijuana ,north korean marijuana ,reported north korean marijuana ,stoner world marijuana news ,stoner world marijuana","['PYONGYANG', 'AP', 'North Korea', 'Marijuana', 'High Times', 'Merry Jane', 'Green Rush', 'british', 'Amsterdam', 'north korean']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26040187  0.54367912

Experts say propofol abuse is growing because, unlike other hospital sedatives, it is quick-acting and rapidly leaves the system. It is also known as a ""milk injection"" because the color of the drug resembles milk. Also, the ministry will expand the adoption of the so-called ""one-strike system"" to forcibly revoke the business permits of food manufacturers that intentionally and habitually distribute substandard food. The government has been making efforts to eradicate the country's so-called four major social ills -- sexual violence, school violence, domestic violence and substandard food.","safety watchdog said monday ,korean food safety watchdog ,november in policy plan ,food drugs the south ,policy direction for 2017","['south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30844569  0.44862619

After his arrival, he is expected to first pay respects at the Seoul National Cemetery close to his residence in southern Seoul. ""It is right that  is weighing a trip to the two places in consideration of their symbolic meanings,"" Ban's aide told Yonhap News Agency over the phone, declining to be identified. ""But when to visit the places has yet to be decided."" The port has become a pilgrimage site for South Koreans commemorating the deaths of more than 300 victims in the disaster on April 16, 2014. It is located just 20 kilometers away from where the ship Sewol sank. Bongha Village is where former President Roh Moo-hyun is buried. Roh's wife Kwon Yang-sook still lives in the village where Roh, who ran the country from 2003-2008, committed suicide amid a sprawling corruption probe in 2009. Observers say that should Ban decide to make the politically tinged trip, it might come before the four-day Lunar New Year's holiday that begins on Jan. 27. The traditional holiday is an important period for politicians as families gather and tend to reshape their opinions. Last month, Ban said he would give his all if it would contribute to advancing his home country, the strongest indication yet that he will run for president.  Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban has recently been in second place in various opinion polls, trailing Rep. Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party and former presidential chief of staff to Roh. It remains uncertain which political parties he would join to run in the election. But most observers dismiss the possibility of him opting to become a standard-bearer of the ruling Saenuri Party that has lost public trust in the wake of the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her longtime friend.  Apparently preparing for Ban's presidential campaign, a group of some 10 aides has reportedly been holding daily meetings at a place near Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul. The group includes former South Korean Ambassador to the UN Kim Sook and former Ambassador to Australia Kim Bong-hyun. Ban is expected to open an office in Mapo, western Seoul. The group is likely to join the office, observers said.","his run for president ,president his possible trip ,of 2014 ferry disaster ,an aide said friday ,run for president his","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'the Paengmok Port', 'Jindo', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Bongha Village', 'Gimhae', 'South Gyeongsang Province']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2487632   0.22869325

They will launch their own group this month, tentatively named the New Conservative Party for Reform. While the party became the second-largest group within the National Assembly because of the defection, In insisted that loyalists must leave in order to respond to the public's backlash over Saenuri's link to the president, and its failure to check the abuse of power by Park's close friend. Among the list of the lawmakers to be purged was eight-term Rep. Suh Chung-won, who made clear he had no intention of accepting In's request Friday. Suh and In have been exchanging invectives against each other, rubbing salt into their wounds. Tens of lawmakers handed ""carte blanche"" to the party Thursday, requesting In to determine their fate. But some lawmakers said only a few lawmakers on the list were actually the targets of the purge. ""Suh and Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan are at the center, but the two are unlikely to resign,"" a loyalist lawmaker said. Another pro-Park lawmaker said Suh seems deeply disappointed and even feels betrayed by In's aggressive action. Choi has not commented on In's request.","monthslong factional feud ,loyalists to president park ,monthslong factional feud in ,the monthslong factional feud ,party by friday casting","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park']",20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50621176  0.45788363

Hens spend their entire lives in a sheet of A4 paper-sized cage with dust, ammonia gas and stink. 123rfExperts and animal rights activists have been demanding the authorities come up with regulatory improvements in Korea’s overall poultry farming systems and upgrade quarantine measures. Professor Kim Jae-hong of Seoul National University’s College of Veterinary Medicine said that “it would be strange if the virus does not spread in such a filthy environment. Damages  could have been minimized if there was an upgrade in farming systems that provides a healthy environment for poultry breeding, thinking animal health and welfare.” Experts said that breeding chickens in spacious environment, instead of cramped battery cages, can help preventing the spread of the virus, as well as strengthening veterinary surveillance.In other developed countries like Europe, where most of stockbreeding farms have abandoned conventional battery cages for animal welfare reasons, have seen low percentage of bird flu outbreaks.In 2012, the European Union Council banned the use of battery cages after scientists observed signs of extremely abnormal behaviors in caged hens. The number of eggs produced in battery cage-facilities in the EU has rapidly decreased since then. Within a recent decade, UK showed a total of three confirmed bird flu cases, Germany with 8 cases and Sweden with one case. “As long as the stockbreeding farms stick to mass breeding of egg-laying hens system, no quarantine measure will work,” said Park Choi-kyu, a professor of veterinary science at Kyungbuk National University. “The government should recheck quarantine capacity of poultry farms in the country and introduce stricter quarantine measures to prevent another massive epidemic,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","massive bird flu outbreak ,bird flu outbreak experts ,for massive bird flu ,massive bird flu ,influenza virus record number",[],20,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41818249  0.53868568
