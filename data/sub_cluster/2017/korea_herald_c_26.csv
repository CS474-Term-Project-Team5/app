Tillerson stressed the importance of the trilateral cooperation involving Japan in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, possibly a reference to the icy Seoul-Tokyo relationship following the Moon Jae-in government's recent conclusion that their 2015 agreement on Japan's wartime atrocity on Koreans was flawed. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha Kang shared Tillerson's understanding and stressed that South Korea-Japan cooperation in security and economy will be pursued in a stable manner despite their feuds over history, the ministry said. Kang also confirmed her participation in a foreign ministers' meeting in Vancouver on Jan. 16, which the US will co-host, in order to reaffirm solidarity against North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The meeting will bring together top diplomats of the countries that sent their troops to fight for the South in the 1950-53 Korean War.","held telephone conversation friday ,top diplomats of korea ,minute conversation foreign minister ,resolution of korean nuke ,conversation friday to mark","['South Korea', 'the United States', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson']",26,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.41123223  0.58896345

Some have argued Pyongyang seeks to possess nuclear-tipped long-range missiles for its regime survival, while others have said it wants to bolster its bargaining power in future negotiations with Washington or Seoul. Hong Joon-pyo, the leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, speaks during a lecture for university students at Busan City Hall in the southern port city, 450 kilometers south of Seoul, on Dec. 27, 2017. Concerns have also risen that the completion of the North's ICBM program could undercut the South Korea-US alliance, as it could put American cities at risk and thus weaken the credibility of Washington's security commitment to Seoul.During the lecture, Hong also pointed to the Donald Trump administration's ""America First"" mantra, raising doubts over whether Washington can quickly come to the defense of Seoul if it is in a security crisis.""The US is a country that puts the foremost priority on its national interests. The issue of South Korea comes next ,"" he said.Hong, in addition, said that the period between late autumn and early spring is when the likelihood of war rises, as he pressed the government to devise a stronger security policy against an increasingly provocative Pyongyang.""By March next year, the situation is the most dangerous.

Depending on statistics methods, the disparity could be wider.""   Referring to the new resolution's call for a further reduction of 500,000 barrels in petroleum supply for North Korea, the official expected a reduction of 90 percent in the annual supply volume.   The official also paid attention to the planned expulsion of overseas North Korean workers from U.N. member states within 24 months.   He predicted that the expulsion, if enforced thoroughly, will slash the North's foreign currency revenues by $200 million to $500 million a year.    Thus, the anticipated export loss and suspension of overseas labor dispatch are expected to cut Pyongyang's foreign currency income by $450 million to $750 million annually, the official forecast.","cut nk annual exports ,saturday north korean leader ,may cut nk annual ,250 mln seoul official ,latest united nations sanctions","['United Nations', ""North Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Yonhap""North Korea', 'U.N.']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.29416677  0.56238163

Citing unnamed government sources, a local daily reported that the measure is included in the draft of the Moon Jae-in administration’s “denuclearization roadmap.” The roadmap is one of the 100 tasks set out by the new administration in July.  A South Korean soldier is seen standing guard as three North Korean soldiers observe the south side of Panmunjeom in a photograph taken on Nov. 27. YonhapThe roadmap is said to be focused on South Korea taking the initiative in resolving inter-Korean issues, including the matter of Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions. As part of its plans to take the lead, Seoul hopes to prompt a response from Pyongyang by suggesting ways to ease military tensions on the peninsula. Aside from military talks, other possible measures contained in the roadmap include those aimed at easing tensions and preventing accidental clashes along the border. Offering humanitarian aid, reunion of separated families and other nonmilitary measures are said to be being considered as secondary options. The news follows days after President Moon Jae-in revealed that South Korea-US joint military drills scheduled to be held during next year’s PyeongChang Olympics could be pushed back. The Winter Olympics and Paralympics will be held from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25 and March 9 to March 18, respectively. In an interview with the US broadcaster NBC on Tuesday, Moon revealed that Seoul had suggested pushing back major joint military drills to Washington. Cheong Wa Dae, however, denied reports that the exercises -- Key Resolve and Foal Eagle -- will be scaled down.On Tuesday, however, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that he was not aware of any such developments during a joint press conference with Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland.“They’re carried out on a scheduled basis. We announce them in advance. There’s nothing surprising about them, and I’m not aware of any plans to change what is scheduled,” Tillerson said, saying that the exercises have been in place for a number of years. In response, Moon‘s chief press secretary Yoon Young-chan on Wednesday said that the matter was being discussed by South Korean and US militaries.Seoul had suggested military talks in July, but Pyongyang ignored the offer. Since 2000, when the first-ever inter-Korean defense ministers’ talks were held, the two sides have held 39 working-level military talks. The most recent working-level talks were held in February 2011, about three months after North Korea’s shelling of South Korea’s Yeongpyeong Island in the West Sea. The two sides also held the second defense ministerial talks in November 2007, and seven general-level talks.

""We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence and we do so with partners."" The announcement came hours after Bossert leveled the charge in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal late Monday.In the piece titled ""It's Official: North Korea is Behind WannaCry,"" Bossert slammed the attack as ""cowardly, costly and careless."" Citing the attack on Britain, he said, ""These disruptions put lives at risk.""Britain has already put the blame on the communist regime.On Tuesday, Bossert said Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan also agreed with the US conclusion and joined it in denouncing North Korea for the attack. He lauded ""corporate partners,"" including Microsoft and Facebook, for acting on their own initiative to disrupt the activity of North Korean hackers.""We don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behavior,"" the adviser said, arguing that Trump has used ""just about every lever"" short of starving the North Korean people to force the regime to change its belligerent course.Still, he said it is important to call them out and let them know they are responsible.""I think at this point, some of the benefit that comes from this attribution is letting them know we're going to move to stop their behavior,"" he added.While ransomware is often used to raise money, that did not seem to be North Korea's main goal.""It's interesting. We don't really know how much money they raised, but they didn't seem to architect it in a way that a smart ransomware attacker would do so,"" Bossert said.Victims were required to pay ransom money to unlock their computers, but once it became known that didn't work, the payments stopped.""I think in this case, this was a reckless attack. I think it was meant to cause havoc and destruction,"" Bossert said. ""The money was an ancillary side benefit. I don't think they got a lot of it.""North Korea is known to exploit various illicit channels to fund their nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

Wrapping up his four-day state visit on Saturday, President Moon received reassurance from the Chinese leaders that Beijing will resume economic and trade cooperation that has been suspended since South Korea pressed ahead with the much-controversial installation of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery.But challenges loom over South Korea’s future dealings with China, as Beijing appeared to argue that the agreement was only “condition-based” and still wants the eventual removal of THAAD, pressuring Moon to choose between economic ties with China and a military alliance with the US. “Although we have yet to resolve the THAAD issue completely, we expect there will be a dramatic decrease in the frequency and intensity of China’s mentioning of THAAD,” said a senior official from South Korea’s presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday, a day after Moon returned from his four-day visit to China. South Korea`s president Moon Jae-in shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping. YonhapThe official, who told reporters under the condition of customary anonymity, said Moon and Xi have managed to remove “hard feelings” over the THAAD dispute and build personal trust by holding extensive meetings in different settings.In a bid to reinvigorate stalled bilateral exchanges, the two countries decided to resume a total of 77 government-level talks between the two countries, including ministerial-level talks on economic cooperation, Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Yoon Young-chan said Sunday. The spokesperson reiterated president Moon’s pledge to link his economic policies to China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. China, for its part, gave assurance that many Chinese tourists would visit South Korea during the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.“The two countries agreed to restore stalled exchanges and cooperation and share a common understanding that they will continue to work on improving ties on practical matters,” Yoon said during the briefing. Despite the presidential office’s reiterations of mending bilateral ties, analysts remained cautious about the prospect of future relations as both countries have yet to resolve THAAD disputes completely amid mounting criticism against China’s assertive stance on security issues. One of their concerns is that the Chinese pledge to lift restrictive measures against the South Korean companies would be only “provisional,” depending upon the Moon administration’s stance over what China called “three no policies.” Following the agreement to patch up the THAAD dispute in October, controversy has since emerged over whether Seoul made a pledge that it will never deploy an additional THAAD battery, participate in a US-led strategic missile defense system or create a trilateral military alliance with the US and Japan.“It is a positive sign that both countries kicked off their efforts to improve bilateral relations, but given the apparent difference over THAAD, Seoul and Beijing must focus on managing their conflicts in the longer term.” Kim Han-kwon, a professor at Korea National Diplomatic Academy.While South Korea insists that THAAD is only aimed at North Korea’s missile and nuclear threat, China suspects that its powerful radar system could be used to spy into its territory. In an interview with the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV before leaving Seoul, Moon said Beijing did not need to worry about the anti-missile system because South Korea would ensure that its radar does not penetrate Chinese territory.By Yeo Jun-suk","beijing will resume economic ,visit on saturday president ,challenges linger president moon ,beijing ties but challenges ,better seoul beijing ties","['Moon Jae - in', 'China', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Beijing', 'Moon', 'chinese', 'Beijing']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.65821916  0.46982971

The agreement is meaningful as the two leaders joined hands to enhance regional peace and security.""Kang also said he expects some economic effects after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang mentioned re-operation of bilateral economic channels during his meeting with Moon on Friday.""Moon's visit provided a very important clue to the restoration of South Korea-China relations ruined during the previous government. The opposition parties should stop political offensive on the matter and both ruling and opposition parties should together pursue national interests,"" said the spokesman.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, however, continued its offensive against Moon's Chinese visit, calling it ""obvious damage to national dignity.""Liberty Korea Party's floor spokeswoman Shin Bo-ra said in a commentary, ""The  people were frustrated to see President Moon's frequent eating alone in China, Beijing's unilateral schedule changes and the beatings of Korean journalists.""""No joint statement was issued after Moon's summit talks with Xi.

We can talk about the weather if you want,"" he told a forum at the Atlantic Council think tank.It was widely interpreted as a departure from US demands that North Korea first halt its nuclear and missile testing and demonstrate its sincerity about denuclearization.Just two weeks earlier, the communist regime test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile it claimed was capable of carrying a nuclear weapon to all parts of the US mainland.That initially dashed hopes for a resumption of dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang, which had sprung out of a 75-day pause in provocations from the North. US officials had said a pause of 60 days would send a signal of Pyongyang's interest in talks.""I think Secretary Tillerson's remarks could have been potentially helpful because they would have clarified publicly that the US is willing to engage with North Korea without preconditions,"" said Frank Aum, senior expert on North Korea for the US Institute of Peace.""Making this statement publicly also would have put the US on the high ground and put the ball back in North Korea's court, giving them the responsibility of accepting or rejecting a peaceful overture,"" said Aum, a contributor to 38 North, a North Korea monitoring website.But the White House was terse.

Since North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile in the early hours of Wednesday, Moon and Trump has held two telephone conservations. After the first, held Wednesday, local media outlets reported that the US Navy was considering a complete naval blockade of North Korea, and that the move would involve the navies of South Korea and Japan.“A naval blockade was not mentioned in the conversation between the two leaders yesterday,” the official said on condition of anonymity. The official added that the two governments were not discussing a naval blockade, and that Trump made no mention of taking military action. “Plans for a naval blockade will not be announced in the future. A naval blockade would require new resolutions from the  Security Council, and its efficacy must be reviewed from multiple angles.” South Korea’s Minister of National Defense Song Young-moo, however, told lawmakers that while the US has made no such suggestions, his ministry would consider the option. The official also said that there were no disparities in Seoul and Washington’s views on North Korea’s latest missile. Although Seoul’s Ministry of National Defense has since assessed the missile to be capable of reaching Washington, Cheong Wa Dae has put forward a more cautious assessment. While acknowledging the apparent advancements in Pyongyang’s missile technologies, and the estimated range of the latest missile, Cheong Wa Dae has voiced doubt about whether North Korea is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead, and to bring the projectile back into the atmosphere. Following the launch, North Korea claimed that it has now completed IBCM development, and that it was now a nuclear state. Regarding the “red line” in North Korea’s provocations, the official said that the term and whether Pyongyang has crossed it have no significance under the current circumstances. During the press conference marking his 100th day in office, Moon had said that the “red line,” meaning the point of no return in the North Korean nuclear issue, was Pyongyang securing the technology to develop ICBMs with thermonuclear warheads. “South Korea and the US are applying the most stern pressures and sanctions, and all members of the international community is participating,” he said. “President Trump has even requested China to cut off its crude oil supply . Under such circumstances, it is not important what measures will or will not be taken based on whether the red line has been crossed.”","presidential official said friday ,not considering naval blockade ,friday denying related news ,trump did not discuss ,denying related news reports","['North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Cheong', 'Moon Jae -', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.65176064  0.52362239

Local news outlets also reported that North Korea operated radar equipment used to track missile trajectories on Monday, while communications within their missile base showed an unusual spike. An image from the footage of the Sept. 15 missile launch released by North Korea`s state news agency. YonhapThe US, for its part, has said that North Korea’s activities are being closely monitored. “We watch North Korea very closely. We‘ll continue to do so,” Army Col. Robert Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters. “The Republic of Korea  and US alliance remains strong, and capable of countering any North Korean provocations or attacks.”Manning also said that Washington continues to seek a diplomatic means to dismantling North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. “The State Department is working very hard to exercise those diplomatic options and initiatives and efforts with China,” Manning said when asked if China, North Korea’s main ally and economic benefactor, can still be trusted.South Korea’s military also said Tuesday that it is keeping a close eye on North Korea. “Our armed forces are closely following and monitoring  in cooperation with the US, leaving open all possibilities,” JCS spokesman Army Col. Roh Jae-cheon said Tuesday, declining to comment about Japanese media reports. Earlier in the day, Tokyo-based news agency Kyodo News reported that the Japanese government has detected communications signals indicative of a possible missile launch, citing a number of government officials. The report quoted Japanese government officials as saying that a launch could be possible within days, and added that the type of missile North Korea may fire is unclear. The report, however, added that as movement of missiles or mobile launchers have not been detected, the Japanese government has not ruled out the possibility that the signals may have resulted from military exercises. The reports come amid growing speculation over North Korea’s plans. North Korea has remained quiet for more than two months, despite its threats against the US and warning of retaliation following US President Donald Trump’s address to the UN General Assembly in September. North Korea’s most recent provocation came in the form of an intermediate range ballistic missile launch on Sept. 15. In his address, Trump said that Pyongyang was on a suicide mission, and that an attack against the US or her allies would result in total destruction of North Korea. In response, North Korea warned of retaliation of the “highest measure,” which according to Pyongyang’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho could take the form of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific.While Pyongyang remains quiet, a recent news report citing a Chinese official claimed that the regime’s nuclear weapons program is nearing completion, and that a nuclear weapons test -- the most powerful yet -- could be conducted in the near future.

North Korea’s exports to China in October dropped 62 percent on-year, amounting to about $90 million, showed Chinese customs data released Thursday. The figure also fell nearly 38 percent compared to $145.8 in September. The data also indicated that China has blocked all imports of key trade items from the North, such as coal, iron, lead, aluminum, zinc or copper, Bloomberg said Friday. The abrupt decline in the figures represents a whole month of China’s trade with North Korea, following the announcement of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, which came into effect on Sept. 5. The set of rules impose a total ban of coal trade with the North. China has also decided to “temporarily” shut down the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge, which has acted as a main gateway of trade between the two communist nations. The bridge, which links North Korea with the Chinese city of Dandong, will be closed for maintenance work on the North side, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Friday. However, a specific timeframe for the reopening of the bridge was not mentioned. The signs of tighter restrictions come amid declining ties between the neighboring communist countries. North Korea’s relentless nuclear and missile provocations have irked Beijing, media reports claimed. But hostility seems to be escalating on both sides with the North expressing distaste over Chinese President Xi Jinping’s support for North Korean sanctions, following a bilateral summit with US President Donald Trump earlier this month. In response to China’s latest move to dispatch a special envoy to Pyongyang, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un refused to talk to the envoy in person. Song Tao, the head of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, reportedly met with a few high-ranking North Korean officials, but failed to meet Kim as Song refused to comply with Pyongyang’s request to ease off its sanctions against the country, Japan’s Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Saturday, citing diplomatic sources. Meanwhile, Russia has decided not to assign a quota for North Korean workers next year, hinting that no new labor contracts will be further signed, Russia’s state-owned agency RIA Novosti said Friday.Around 30,000 to 40,000 North Korean migrants are believed to be legally working in Russia today. Moscow’s decision is largely viewed as efforts to uphold UN Security Council Resolution 2375, unanimously approved on Sept. 11, which aims to curb the hiring of North Korean laborers in foreign nations. The UN estimated the latest ban would slash North Korea’s $3 billion annual export revenue by a third.Earlier this month, North Korea called for an immediate halt of the sanctions against it, calling the measures “constituted genocide,” the North Korean mission to the UN in Geneva said in a statement.

35,35,"'Gap exists between Seoul, Beijing over THAAD'"," 　Despite the much-publicized deal to patch up ties, there still seems to be a “gap in understanding” between South Korea and China over the issue of a US advanced missile defense system deployed here, a Seoul’s senior foreign ministry official said on Friday. 　The official, who was present at a Wednesday meeting between South Korea’s Foreign Ministry Kang Kyung-hwa and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, said Be...","Despite the much-publicized deal to patch up ties, there still seems to be a “gap in understanding” between South Korea and China over the issue of a US advanced missile defense system deployed here, a Seoul’s senior foreign ministry official said on Friday. The official, who was present at a Wednesday meeting between South Korea’s Foreign Ministry Kang Kyung-hwa and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, said Beijing officials seemed to feel that they “gave up too much” to settle the dispute over Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. In the agreement reached last month, the two sides agreed to talk through military channels about the THAAD dispute, despite no apparent shift in their position. China reiterated its opposition on THAAD, saying the system’s powerful X-band radar could look deep into its territory, while Seoul insisted the system was for defense only. The military talks are yet to be scheduled, Seoul’s defense ministry said Friday. “I think that China feels burdened to act as if nothing happened,” the official told reporters, requesting anonymity. “It is apparent that there is a gap in the way the THAAD is perceived between the South Korea and China authorities. We acknowledged the gap.” South Korea`s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. YonhapChina’s ultimate goal, the official went on, is to have South Korea withdraw the THAAD battery, currently up and running in Seongju, consisting six interceptor launchers and a radar. But South Korea’s stance is it would not pull back THAAD unless the missile and nuclear threats from North Korea are resolved, the official added. Seoul has asserted that the missile shield is solely aimed at North Korea, not a third country such as China and Russia. “We made it clear that the THAAD deployment was a sovereign decision, only aimed to deal with North Korea and no other country,” the official said. The remarks came amid Beijing’s apparent attempt to pressure Seoul to uphold what they called the “three nos”: no additional THAAD deployments in South Korea; no participation in a US-led strategic missile defense system; and no creation of a trilateral military alliance with the US and Japan.In an editorial published Friday, the Global Times of China said, “If South Korea failed to honor  promises, the relations between China and Korea would drop to the lowest point and it will deal a critical blow to bilateral trust.”During the aforementioned meeting between two foreign ministers, China’s Yi pointed out that the two countries had agreed to resolve the THAAD dispute “in a step-by-step manner.”  “China attaches great importance that the  deployment of the THAAD system will not damage China’s security interests,” Yi said in his opening remarks. “We hope the South Korean side will continue to appropriately handle the matter,” he said. His remarks raised speculation here that China may make demands to South Korea such as measures to prevent the surveillance of its territory with THAAD radar or stop any further deployment of the system. The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Friday sought to contain such speculation, saying Wang’s “step-by-step manner” does not indicate a change in tone from Seoul’s official agreement with Beijing that they would move forward from past disputes over THAAD and restore exchanges. “We believe there is no shift from the two leaders’ positions that the agreement is about wrapping up THAAD disputes,” a Cheong Wa Dae official told the reporters under the condition of customary anonymity Friday. “There could be many conversations going back and forth between South Korean and the Chinese officials. But it was more like a tug-of-war between the diplomats. Our position is that we shouldn’t view them as an indication of change to the agreement. The Chinese government agrees with that.” The official also denied media reports that China had asked South Korea to install a wall to block the THAAD radar. Installed in the southern city of Seongju, the radar is suspected to have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers.President Moon Jae-in, during his visit to Southeast Asia last week, said South Korea and China have yet to resolve the THAAD controversy completely, describing it as being “sealed.”By Yeo Jun-suk","between seoul beijing over ,china over the issue ,wednesday meeting between south ,seoul senior foreign ministry ,seoul beijing over thaad","['South Korea', 'China', 'US', 'Seoul', 'South Korea ’s', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Kang Kyung - hwa', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.42893815  0.52392685

This undated file photo shows the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the now-shuttered inter-Korean industrial park in North Korea`s border city of Kaesong. ""The government is likely to hold a meeting for approval soon,"" the government official said. ""Compensation is expected to be delivered to firms by December.""Seoul's unification ministry said on Nov. 10 that it will increase support for local firms shouldering huge losses from their investments in inter-Korean projects suspended due to political tensions.""The measure is meant to fulfill the state responsibility for those companies that have suffered from unexpected business setbacks due to a shift in the government's policy decisions,"" the ministry said.A group of local firms investing in the Kaesong park said that government compensation is insufficient to cover what it claims to be more than 1.5 trillion won in losses. The government put the estimated damage at 786.1 billion won.Seoul said the resumption of the operation of the Kaesong complex will depend on progress over the resolution of North Korea's nuclear standoff.The resumption of the Kaesong complex is a tricky issue as it could violate U.N. sanctions resolutions aimed at curbing inflows of hard currency to North Korea.Former Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok raised the need for an early resumption of the factory zone at a forum Thursday.""As the Kaesong complex is a precious asset to us, it should be restarted as soon as possible,"" Lee said.

Song toured the mausoleum’s exhibition rooms containing medals and vehicles used by former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il and left a message in a guest book there that read, “I express heartfelt longing for Comrade Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il who were great leaders of the Korean people and friendly mates of China,” according to the KCNA report.Also on Sunday, the special envoy, accompanied by the Chinese ambassador to North Korea, laid flowers at a tower in Pyongyang that symbolizes the North Korea-China friendship, according to the report. Song also traveled to Hoechang County, west of Pyongyang, to tour what was Chinese military forces‘ headquarters during the 1950-53 Korean War, it also said.South Korea’s unification ministry said whether the Chinese envoy met with Kim Jong-un was unknown as of Monday morning. “Whether special envoy Song talked with Kim Jong-un or delivered President Xi‘s handwritten letter  has not be reported or confirmed yet, and  will continue to follow the development closely,” ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun said in a press briefing. The KCNA also made a brief report on Song‘s return to Beijing on Monday, but did not provide further details.","on friday chinese president ,friday chinese president ,friday chinese president xi ,beijing on monday ending ,korea on friday chinese","['China', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Song Tao', 'the International Liaison Department', 'the Communist Party of China', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Tao', 'Pyongyang']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.64407969  0.99524969

Kim Byung-kee of the ruling Democratic Party as saying.   A lawmaker studies the aerial shot of the Joint Security Area, through which a North Korean soldier defected sustaining gunshot wounds. Asked to elaborate on the punishment, the lawmaker said that the NIS is still trying to figure it out.The bureau is seen as an influential military institution as it leads the crucial personnel management of other military bodies such as the Ministry of People's Armed Forces. It was once headed by Choe.  The punishment against Hwang came as a surprise as he had been seen as one of the most powerful military figures.Hwang rose to prominence in 2014 as he took the helm of the bureau. He replaced Choe, sparking speculation that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un might be pitting them against each other to keep them in check and ensure their loyalty.  The NIS also reported that the North has been focusing on forestalling a possible negative impact of the tightening international sanctions on public sentiment. The isolated state has been under crippling sanctions due to its provocations, including its sixth and most powerful nuke test on Sept. 3."" has devised a system whereby party organs report people's economic hardships on a daily basis, and it has banned any gatherings related to drinking, singing and other entertainment and is strengthening control of outside information,"" the NIS said.The spy agency, in addition, said that it has been closely watching the possibility of a new missile test by the North this year to escalate its threat to the United States under the disguise of peaceful space development.As to the possibility of another nuclear experiment, the NIS said there has not been any sign of an imminent test.""But we forecast that depending upon North Korean leader Kim's determination, a nuclear test is possible any time,"" the agency said.It, moreover, said that Tunnel 3 of the North's Punggye-ri test site is available for a test, while the North has recently resumed construction on Tunnel 4 with Tunnel 2 left unattended.","officials south korea spy ,spy agency said monday ,korea conducts rare inspection ,key military organ spy ,korea is conducting rare","['North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Pyongyang', 'General Political Bureau', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'Kim Won - hong']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.24584275  0.20978361

Seoul officials noted Beijing has traditionally sent a ranking official to its communist ally to explain the outcome of its party congress. Song currently heads the international relations department at the Central Committee of the Communist Party.   However, his trip also follows Xi's bilateral summit with U.S.President Donald Trump in Beijing last Thursday. During his 12-day tour of Asia, which included visits to Japan and South Korea, the U.S. president called on China to do more to rein in North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile programs. Details about Song's itinerary have not been unveiled, but diplomatic sources said that he may make a four-day visit to the North, during which he could meet with North Korean leader Kim.   Seoul's unification ministry said that China's special envoys dispatched to the North after the party congresses in 2007 and 2012 met with former North Korean ruler Kim Jong-il and the current leader, respectively.  China's foreign ministry said that the two sides will exchange views on issues of mutual interest at the party and country level, and that Song will report on the outcome of China's party congress.   Experts say that the issue of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is likely to be discussed at a time when Pyongyang has suspended its provocative acts for more than 60 days.   Joseph Yun, the top U.S. nuclear envoy, reportedly said at a recent meeting that if North Korea halts nuclear and missile testing for about 60 days, that would be the signal Washington needs to resume direct dialogue with Pyongyang.   Yun was in South Korea's southern Jeju Island to have talks over North Korea's nuclear issue with his South Korean counterpart Lee Do-hoon.   The U.S. envoy said he hopes Song's trip would help ""forward""the goal of its denuclearization.   Lee also added that it could have ""a very significant meaning considering the current situation.""   Yun said in Seoul on Tuesday that he does not know the reason for North Korea's halting of provocations, but he called on the North to stay that course ""for a period of time.""   Meanwhile, North Korea's main newspaper said Friday that the country will not put issues directly linked to its core interests and its people's security on the negotiation table.   ""The United States should abandon its hostile policy toward North Korea. If Washington does not give it up, we will not budge by an inch from the path to strengthening our nuclear force,"" said the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.","north korea friday report ,to pyongyang recent nuclear ,korea friday report ,envoy of chinese president ,in north korea friday","['chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Japan', 'Kyodo News', 'Chinese', 'Song Tao', 'Choe Ryong - hae', ""Workers ' Party"", 'Pyongyang', 'song']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.54659688  0.71007293

""I am always going to put America first, the same way that I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first.""The president _ who pulled the United States out of the Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership _ said the US would no longer join ""large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible."" Instead, he said, the US will pursue one-on-one trade deals with other nations that pledge fair and reciprocal trade.As for China, Trump said he'd spoken ""openly and directly"" with Xi about the nation's abusive trade practices and ""the enormous trade deficits they have produced with the United States.""It was a stark change in tone from the day before, when Trump was Xi's guest of honor during a state visit in Beijing. There, Trump opted for flattering Xi and blaming past US presidents for the trade deficit.Trump said China's trade surplus, which stood at $223 billion for the first 10 months of the year, was unacceptable. He repeated his language from Thursday, when he said he did ""not blame China"" or any other country ""for taking advantage of the United States on trade.""But Trump added forceful complaints about ""the audacious theft of intellectual property,"" `'massive subsidizing of industries through colossal state-owned enterprises,"" and American companies being targeted by ""state-affiliated actors for economic gain.""US officials have raised similar concerns in the past about China, especially with regard to intellectual property.On Saturday, Trump opened a day of meetings with leaders of the 21-member APEC countries. Later in the day, he was to fly to Hanoi, the capital, to attend a state banquet before formal meetings Sunday with Vietnam's president and prime minister. Behind the scenes, White House officials quietly negotiated with the Kremlin over whether Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin would hold a formal meeting on the sidelines in Danang, with the Russians raising expectations for such a session.As speculation built, the two sides tried to craft the framework of a deal that Trump and Putin could announce in a formal bilateral meeting, according to two administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.Though North Korea and the Ukraine had been discussed, the two sides focused on trying to strike an agreement about a path to resolve Syria's civil war once the Islamic State group is defeated, according to officials. But the talks stalled and, just minutes before Air Force One touched down in Vietnam, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that the meeting was off.When asked about the outcome, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later snapped at reporters: ""Why are you asking me? Ask the Americans.""Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that even without a formal meeting, ""Both presidents are in town, and their paths will cross one way or another.""That they did Friday night during the summit's welcome gala: The two men, each wearing traditional Vietnamese shifts, shook hands and greeted one another as they stood side-by-side for the group photo of world leaders.In a major breakthrough, trade ministers from 11 nations remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership _ representing roughly 13.5 percent of the global economy _ said Saturday they had reached a deal to proceed with the free-trade pact after it was thrown into doubt when Trump abandoned it.Separately, a 16-member region-wide pact called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership was also under negotiation. It encompasses China and India but also does not include the US.","friday denouncing china for ,asia president donald trump ,friday denouncing china ,message friday denouncing china ,trump stood before summit","['Donald Trump', 'asian', 'America', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing', 'the United States', 'trump']",26,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.35803244  0.59919882

At that time, the conservative Park Geun-hye administration abruptly closed the complex, once a token of inter-Korean economic cooperation, in response to the North's fourth nuclear test. This file photo shows the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the now-shuttered inter-Korean factory zone in North Korea`s border city of Kaesong. An association of the relevant firms, mostly manufacturing such labor-intensive goods as clothes and utensils, claimed that they incurred more than 1.5 trillion won in losses. After its own survey, however, the government put the estimated damage at 786.1 billion won. With the additional support, the ministry said, 74.2 percent of the damage will be covered.The affected companies are not satisfied with the amount.""It falls far short of what we expected,"" said Shin Han-yong, the head of the association's emergency committee. He said the group will hold a meeting over the issue on Monday and deliver its stance to the government.Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung made clear that there is no plan for further state compensation."" will continue efforts to collect opinions and communicate with the companies, rather than  additional support,"" he told reporters.The new measure was based on ""sufficient"" consultations among relevant government agencies, he pointed out.He expressed hope that it will serve as a chance for the government and those companies to work together for the future of inter-Korean economic cooperation.The ministry also announced plans to help local companies, involved in other inter-Korean business projects, that have suffered losses from the 2008 halt to the Mount Kumgang tour program and the 2010 bilateral economic sanctions on Pyongyang, known as the May 24th Measure.It would mark the government's first direct financial support for those businesses harmed by political situations.""We have to conduct a related survey.

While the first two are important as institutional frameworks, the last is the most rudimentary and resilient element of ASEAN’s integration and global cooperation, analysts say. They point out that as the region develops economically, grassroots, bottom-up exchanges between people through culture, education and tourism will rise in number and importance. In this regard, the general positive perceptions identified in the survey betoken increasingly interactive ties between ASEAN and Korea, while leaving room for improvement in certain areas.  ASEAN-Korea Secretary General Kim Young-sun was the Korean Ambassador to Indonesia from 2011-14. The survey was conducted on over 1,000 Korean and 320 ASEAN students here between ages 20 and 35 from March through August. Of the key findings, both sides viewed their futures as positively entwined, with 64 percent of Korean and 82 percent of ASEAN students foreseeing an optimistic partnership.Koreans were concerned by international marriage, economic cooperation, overseas labor and tourism in order of importance regarding ASEAN, while Southeast Asians viewed economic cooperation, tourism, overseas labor, international studies, foreign investment and popular culture in order of importance concerning Korea. About 47 percent of ASEAN students said they came to Korea to study because of scholarship benefits and economic reasons. It was followed by 27 percent of them having “curiosity and intimacy” toward Korea; 10 percent following recommendations from families, relatives, friends and teachers; and 7 percent expecting employment benefits after graduation. A total of 58 percent of them said Korea benefits their countries’ development.“The report is meaningful in that it is the first-ever attempt at objectively analyzing the perceptions of Korean and ASEAN students in Korea,” said the center’s Secretary-General Kim Young-sun, former Korean ambassador to Indonesia from 2011-2014. “It is highly encouraging in that the youths who will lead the future of both regions have optimistic views of each other. We plan to expand the surveys from students to the general public, as well as from Korea to the whole of ASEAN, so that we can use these data as basis for various future endeavors and co-projects.”The administration of President Moon signaled the country’s intention to give more substance to its relations with ASEAN by dispatching first-ever special envoy Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon to the region in May. ASEAN and Korea first established a sectoral dialogue partnership in 1989, which was elevated to a full dialogue partnership in 1991 and strategic partnership in 2010. The current administration is committed to ASEAN as part of its diplomatic diversification strategy. Since the entry into force of the ASEAN-Korea Trade in Goods Agreement in June 2007, bilateral trade in goods has grown by 9.2 percent annually, reaching $125 billion last year, and making Korea ASEAN’s fifth-largest trade partner. ASEAN is Korea’s second-largest trade partner and top investment destination, and the two sides are working to reach $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. An outcome of the 1967 Bangkok Declaration, ASEAN was initially established as a bloc of Southeast Asian nations Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. It later expanded to incorporate Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.

""I believe the state visit by you  will help enhance peace in Korea and deepen trust between the two countries.""Kim then showed Melania the portraits of former South Korean first ladies hung on the walls of a meeting room in the presidential office.The two then took a stroll around the presidential complex strewn with autumn trees, flowers and fallen leaves. There, Kim reportedly introduced a number of South Korea's unique wildflowers.After their walk, the two were greeted by a group of children, including some from the families of US military and diplomatic personnel here.As a token of gratitude for the warm welcome, Kim and Melania gave them mufflers in white, red and blue -- the colors of the South Korean and US national flags -- and took photos, the presidential officials said.The two later entered Sangchunjae, a Korean-style house used to serve foreign dignitaries. There, they drank a type of black tea, named ""Serene Morning of PyeongChang."" The tea has been specially designed to promote the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.

Trump was welcomed by South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha and Cho Yoon-je, the recently appointed ambassador to the US at the Osan Air Base in Gyeonggi Province. Trump is on the second leg of his tour of Asian nations, and arrived here from Japan after a three-day visit to the country.    Trump’s state visit, the first by a US leader since 1992, comes at a time of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula, and when a number of difficult issues remain outstanding in Seoul-Washington relations. North Korea has engaged the US in an escalating war of words, and has taken its defiance of the international community to a new level, testing a hydrogen bomb, and firing a series of ballistic missiles. South Korea and the US are also in the process of modifying the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement. Trump, however, showed characteristic confidence ahead of his arrival. “Getting ready to leave for South Korea and meetings with President Moon, a fine gentleman. We will figure it all out!” Trump tweeted in Japan.Seoul’s plans to boost its own military capabilities is also in question. As part of the plans, the US has agreed to limit payload restrictions on Seoul’s ballistic missiles and to aid in developing advanced weapons systems. Trump’s tweet concerning his visit to Japan has set off speculation that the US leader could push for similar results in his talks with Moon.“My visit to Japan and friendship with PM Abe will yield many benefits, for our great Country. Massive military & energy orders happening+++!” Trump tweeted. As for Trump’s South Korean itinerary, the US leader’s first stop will be Camp Humphreys, in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where he will meet with South Korean and US troops. From there, Trump will travel to Seoul to attend the official welcoming ceremony at the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae. The ceremony will be followed by summit meetings -- one-on-one and expanded -- and a joint press conference later in the afternoon. In the evening, Trump will attend the gala dinner hosted by Moon to wrap up the first day of the visit. The event will be attended by key officials from the two sides including National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Se-kyun, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon and 20 government and military officials. Along with political and government officials, a number of members of the corporate community, culture figures and Korean and US citizens who have contributed to bilateral relations will also be invited. US officials attending the event will include chief of staff John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster. On the following day, Trump will address the National Assembly, and pay respects at the National Cemetery in Seoul before flying to China.","day state visit trump ,trump arrives for two ,us president donald trump ,president donald trump touched ,tuesday beginning his two","['US', 'Donald Trump', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Cho Yoon - je', 'US', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'asian', 'Japan']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.36240584  0.70275247

Jung Pak, SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution, speaks to reporters at the institution in Washington on Oct. 12, 2017. ""First, Trump and Moon do not have a close personal relationship,"" she wrote in comments to reporters. ""I think that Moon's dual-track approach to North Korea -- pursuing engagement with Pyongyang, even as his administration steps up the pressure, including the most recent unilateral sanctions -- is likely to cause some friction in the summit meeting.""Pak, currently the Korea chair at the Brookings Institution, said Trump is still expected to reinforce the US commitment to the bilateral alliance and praise South Korea's rise.""Trump's trip to South Korea is an excellent opportunity to showcase the strength of the alliance relationship,"" she noted. ""I am concerned about the potential for divergence, however, given Washington's repeated comments alluding to military strike options against North Korea and South Korea's desire to maintain peace and find ways to engage with the North.""Trade is also likely to figure prominently in the summit.""While I am hopeful that Trump will appreciate the visit to  Camp Humphreys -- a key symbol of South Korea bearing the costs of the alliance -- it is unlikely to mollify Trump's stance on  and his insistence on addressing trade imbalances,"" Pak said.","washington south korean president ,week former cia official ,cia official said monday ,korean president moon jae ,ex cia official warns","['WASHINGTON', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'CIA', 'Jung Pak', 'CIA', ""North Korea 's""]",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.80598068  0.81673384

Last week the neighbors reached a broad agreement to end more than one year of diplomatic friction over the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea.She said the government will work with China so that the deployment issue would not impede bilateral relations. It will also further step up cooperation with its neighbor to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue in a peaceful manner, she noted. Kang also hinted at Moon’s possible visit to Japan. The government “will push for the leader’s trip to Japan on the occasion of a Japan-hosted summit meeting of the three countries,” she said. Japan is reportedly pushing to host a much delayed trilateral meeting with South Korea and China by the end of this year. Seoul will also review “ultra powerful” punitive measures against North Korea, such as shutting off the oil supply to the country and a ban on the country’s export of workers, in the event of further military provocations, the foreign minister said. South Korea plans to capitalize on the country’s hosting of the 2018 Winter Olympics to secure international support and the momentum to improve relations with North Korea and denuclearize the country, she added.Bickering erupted between ruling and opposition party lawmakers during the committee’s meeting as opposition members denounced South Korea’s recent pledges made in the agreement with China. They said South Korea’s promises that it will not deploy additional parts of the THAAD system, will not join the U.S.Missile Defense and will not expand its military alliance with the U.S. into a trilateral alliance including Japan amount to giving up sovereign rights.“These are what the government has said openly and repeatedly and what are needed for national interest and security,” Kang defended the announcement. Asked whether Seoul will not install additional THAAD components in any case, she said further deployment “is not being considered for now.”","korea pushes for reciprocal ,exchange including president moon ,top diplomat said monday ,including president moon jae ,monday the government plans","['South Korea', 'South Korea', 'China', 'US', 'China', 'Moon Jae - in']",26,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.50062877  0.48418304

The US maintains 28,500 troops here under its joint defense treaty with South Korea.Trump's visit to Camp Humphreys comes in response to a request from the US side, but Cheong Wa Dae officials said the trip may help the new US leader understand South Korea's commitment to the alliance.The US president has voiced a desire for South Korea to shoulder a greater portion of the cost to maintain US troops here. Seoul insists its contribution must be measured by more than just the cash it pays, noting the construction of Camp Humphreys, which came as part of a base relocation plan, cost it nearly US$10 billion.Seoul and Washington are expected to begin their defense cost-sharing discussions later in the year or early next year.The issue will also likely come up at the Moon-Trump summit that will be held later Tuesday at Cheong Wa Dae.The meeting will mark the third bilateral summit between the two leaders following their meetings in Washington and New York. Their previous encounters also included two three-way talks involving Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.The North Korean nuclear issue will sit high on the agenda of the Moon-Trump summit as both countries seek to bring the reclusive North to the dialogue table and discuss its denuclearization.Pyongyang staged its latest nuclear test on Sept. 3, followed by two ballistic missile tests later that month. It has not staged any provocations since.The US and South Korean leaders will hold a joint press conference on the outcome of their bilateral talks here.Moon will later host a state dinner for the US president and his wife that will also likely be attended by dozens of top government officials and business leaders from both countries.On Wednesday, Trump will visit the country's National Assembly to offer a special speech on the alliance and their joint efforts to counter North Korean provocations. He will be the first US president to make a speech at the South Korean parliament in 25 years, according to Cheong Wa Dae officials.He will leave for China later Wednesday, when Moon will embark on his own trip to Indonesia.The two will meet again later in the week when they both attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Da Nang, Vietnam on Friday and Saturday.","trump due in seoul ,tuesday following his three ,korean officials said monday ,in seoul for summit ,donald trump will arrive","['US', 'Donald Trump', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', ""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'US', 'Japan']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.37798783  1.01605117

The 68-year-old was questioned by police last month. He has denied any wrongdoing, saying he had no knowledge of the misappropriation. The allegations were raised during a separate police investigation into possible tax fraud by an interior renovation company that works largely for business conglomerates.

Xi will remain in power at least until 2022.""I wish that under the new situation, the Chinese side will make joint efforts with the North Korean side to promote the sustainable soundness and stable development of the relations between the two nations,"" Xi was quoted as saying by the Korean Central News Agency.

They have not held summit talks with each other yet.The leaders' previous sending of friendly messages to each other came in July last year to celebrate the 55th anniversary of their mutual defense treaty.China, seeking to play a ""responsible"" role in the international community, is apparently annoyed by repeated provocations by its recalcitrant neighbor.Beijing has reportedly toughened sanctions on Pyongyang for its latest nuclear test in September.Emboldened by the start of another five-year term as China's leader, Xi appears to be reaching out to neighboring countries.  On Tuesday, China announced an agreement with South Korea to end their yearlong row over the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system here.""Clearly, China has become more active in its relations with South Korea. We need to pay heed to China's position on its ties with North Korea,"" a South Korean government official said, not wishing to be identified. He said a high-profile Chinese delegation may travel to the North in the near future for a briefing on the outcome of its communist party congress, as it did after the previous session in 2012.Experts pointed out Beijing is placing a priority on resuming denuclearization talks.

There is not enough time in the schedule,"" the official told reporters on background. ""It would have had to have been the DMZ or Camp Humphreys. No President has visited Camp Humphreys and we thought that that made more sense in terms of its messaging, in terms of the chance to address families and troops there.""About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Camp Humphreys, some 90 kilometers south of Seoul, was recently expanded to serve as the new headquarters of the US 8th Army, the backbone of US Forces Korea. US President Donald Trump. Trump's visit to the base will highlight South Korea's role in sharing the burden of the alliance, the official said.""The South Korean government paid the vast majority of the costs for building that base and repositioning some of the US forces and their families on the peninsula,"" he explained.Moreover, it is becoming ""a little bit of a cliche"" to visit the DMZ, the official added. Since the Trump administration came into office, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have all gone to the heavily fortified border.Trump's visit will include bilateral talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and a speech before the National Assembly. Security and trade are expected to top the agenda, as in other countries throughout Trump's 12-day swing through Asia.Seoul and Washington have already agreed to address US concerns about their bilateral free trade agreement, the official noted, and will continue those discussions during the presidential visit.Meanwhile, Trump still believes in using diplomacy to rein in the North Korean threat, the official maintained.""The president did not tweet that diplomacy is a waste of time. He tweeted that direct talks with North Korea was a waste of time,"" he said, citing the administration's campaign to pressure other countries to cut off ties to the regime.Trump drew criticism last month after he tweeted that Tillerson was wasting his time trying to talk with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.""Direct talks with North Korea are unwise at this time and for the foreseeable future,"" the official said, ""absent significant change in behavior by the regime.""""I would add to that that this administration from its earliest days made clear that the door was open for substantive dialogue with North Korea,"" he continued. ""North Korea has shown zero inclination to engage in substantive talks with anyone in the world on this subject -- not with South Korea, not with the United States, not even with China.""Trump will use his trip to Beijing, immediately on the heels of the Seoul visit, to seek China's cooperation in putting further pressure on Pyongyang, the official said.","trump not to visit ,government official said tuesday ,donald trump will not ,trump will not visit ,not to visit korean","['WASHINGTON', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Trump', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.47359928  0.9259268

Kang reiterated that the THAAD battery is aimed at defending South Korea and the US troops stationed here against the missile threats from the North.""Let me be clear on this.

This photo, taken Oct. 28, 2017, shows South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo  and U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis hosting a joint press conference following their annual Security Consultative Meeting at Seoul`s defense ministry building. In last year's SCM document, the allies' defense chiefs mentioned ""stable wartime OPCON transfer at a proper time.""The change in the wording appears to reflect South Korean President Moon Jae-in's pursuit of a transfer at an early date, observers said. During his election campaign, Moon pledged to push for the takeover within his five-year term, which ends in 2022. But he has recently referred to an ""early"" transfer, in an apparent reflection of North Korea's escalating military threats.During a joint press conference Saturday, Song cautioned against interpreting the change in the wording as advancing the timing of OPCON transition.""This is not to advance the timing, but it means that we will try to quickly make conditions  develop, and we will resume  when the time is right,"" Song said.Following Pyongyang's continued provocations, including its sixth and most powerful nuke test Sept. 3, conservatives here have renewed their calls for Moon to scrap his drive for an early OPCON takeover.The South handed over operational control of its troops to the US-led UN command during the 1950-53 Korean War. It retook peacetime OPCON in 1994, but wartime OPCON remains in the hands of its ally, the US.Seoul was supposed to regain wartime OPCON in 2015, but the transfer was postponed indefinitely, as the allies had agreed in2014 to a ""conditions-based"" handover in the wake of Pyongyang's continued nuclear and missile tests.OPCON transfer has long been a highly polarizing issue in South Korea. Those in favor of it -- mostly political liberals -- say that Seoul needs to reduce its heavy reliance on the US and strengthen its independent defense capabilities from the perspective of national pride. But opponents argue that Seoul's military leadership is not yet fully ready to confront the nuclear-armed North and that relying on the US, the world's strongest military power, is the most effective way to ensure national security.","leaders decision in june ,their annual defense ministers ,korea resumption of wartime ,released saturday at the ,after defense chiefs talks","[""South Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'Song Young', 'US', 'James Mattis']",26,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.46235463  0.56373626

It cited an anonymous source close to the committee.The IAC comprised of private-sector experts makes recommendations to the chief of UNESCO, who has a final say. It is said to be almost unprecedented for the committee to come out with a holding-off decision. ""Our government's stance has been consistent that lessons should be learned from the comfort women issue and efforts should be continuously made to let future generations know the truth,"" the official said on the condition of anonymity.  ""In this regard, all possible diplomatic efforts will be made for the comfort women-related documents to be fairly discussed according to relevant UNESCO procedures,"" he added. In May 2016, 15 civic groups from 8 countries, including South Korea and China, made an official request for the UNESCO listing of documents related to women, mostly Koreans, forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops during World War II. The victims are euphemistically called ""comfort women."" They include around 27,000 kinds of documents, including court records and materials given by victims.Though it has not been officially involved, the Seoul government has supported the civic group-led push for the listing, saying that lessons should be learned from the dark history and that efforts should also be made to let future generations know more accurately about historical facts. The Japanese have protested, in particular, with the government here that pushing for a UNESCO listing of such documents might run counter to the spirit of a controversial deal reached between the two countries to address grievances on wartime atrocities committed by Japan. In December 2015, the two reached the deal under which they agreed to ""finally and irreversibly"" resolve the comfort women issue. Tokyo gave an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.Historians said more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude in front-line Japanese brothels during World War II, when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony. Saying that the deal lacks a public consensus, the Moon Jae-in government is currently reviewing the process by which it was reached under the previous administration, hinting that it could be scrapped or revised. Japan says that both countries have to faithfully enforce what was agreed upon by their governments.","women documents south korea ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,ministry official said friday ,korea government supports civic ,comfort women documents south","[""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'UNESCO', 'UN', 'the International Advisory Committee']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.51166618  0.04532507

This week’s session will be the first SCM under the Moon Jae-in and Trump administrations.It comes ahead of Trump’s state visit to South Korea from Nov. 7-8.Key agenda items include the coordination on North Korea and the future of the alliance forged during the 1950-1953 Korean War.The two sides will have “in-depth” discussions on the North’s threats and related policy coordination, as well as on ways to enhance “extended deterrence” and on the push for an early transfer of conditions-based operational control, according to the Ministry of National Defense.In particular, they will talk about expanding the “rotational deployment” of so-called US strategic assets to Korea such as aircraft carriers, bomber jets and nuclear-powered submarines, a ministry official told reporters in a background briefing. Mattis is scheduled to arrive here early Friday morning and head to the truce village of Panmunjom inside the DMZ separating the two Koreas. The secretary will also drop by the nearby Observation Post Ouellette, he added.In what would be a highly symbolic gesture, Song proposed Mattis wear a Marine Corps combat uniform.

This photo taken Oct. 25, 2017, shows Chinese President Xi Jinping announcing a new lineup of members of the Politburo Standing Committee to reporters at a press conference. China wrapped up its weeklong 19th party congress Tuesday, in which Xi cemented his power as he entered his second five-year term. His name and ideology were enshrined in the country's constitution, elevating his status to that of Mao Zedong.North Korea's ruling Workers' Party of Korea last week sent a relatively short congratulatory message to China on the opening of the party congress amid strained relations between Pyongyang and Beijing.North Korea's ties with China, its main ally and economic benefactor, have been frayed over Pyongyang's persistent advancement of its nuclear and missile programs. China has implemented UN sanctions on North Korea over its nuke and missile tests.In an indication of the strained relationship, North Korea sent a shorter message this time than that sent in 2012 when Xi was first elected as the party's general secretary at the 18th party congress. It also left out North Korea's assessment of the two nations' traditional ties.","congratulated chinese president ,has congratulated chinese president ,congratulated chinese president xi ,thursday kim sent congratulatory ,wednesday after the chinese","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'Xi', 'chinese', 'the Central Committee of', 'the Communist Party of China']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39896998  0.59472173

The bill passed 415-2 following its unanimous adoption by the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month.""I do want it noted that the North Korean sanction legislation -- we have changed the name,"" Rep. Kevin McCarthy  told reporters ahead of the vote. ""We are going to honor Otto Warmbier ... who was brutalized and tortured by the Kim regime.""North Korea has come under growing sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests.In recent months the UN Security Council unanimously adopted two sanctions resolutions that aim to slash the regime's US$3 billion annual export revenue by a third and cap its imports of oil.The sanctions are expected to deprive Pyongyang of the means to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and force it to come to the table for denuclearization talks.Warmbier died in June, shortly after returning home in a coma. He was detained in Pyongyang for 17 months after being arrested on charges of trying to steal a political propaganda poster from a hotel during a visit to the country last year.","honoring late detainee washington ,korea for its nuclear ,of representatives on tuesday ,bill honoring late detainee ,late detainee washington the","['WASHINGTON', 'the US House of Representatives', 'North Korea', 'american', 'University of Virginia', ""North Korea 's""]",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.17009559  0.26607105

The investigation team at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office has reportedly figured out the amount of contributions based on recent interrogations of the people involved, the sources said. The team has taken charge of a broader probe into alleged political interference by the National Intelligence Agency during the previous governments led by then-Presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye.  The NIS is accused of running a series of secret operations online and offline intended to benefit the two conservative governments, while maligning their political opponents or those critical of their policies. Suspicions have risen that the spy agency had big conglomerates pay right-wing activist groups large sums of money for support. The spy agency is suspected of using key business lobbying groups as a channel for the implicit transfer of payments. An internal NIS task force has found some 11.8 billion won in funds were paid to conservative organizations between 2010 and 2012 to stage pro-government rallies and a campaign against the liberal bloc. Prosecutors are apparently set to file for an arrest warrant for a former NIS unit chief over a suspected role in arranging the illicit funding.","korea two largest conglomerates ,samsung sk funded conservative ,prosecution samsung and sk ,billion won 77 million ,prosecution sources said tuesday","['Samsung', ""South Korea 's"", 'Lee Myung - bak']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.32746807  0.76721126

The level 2 calls for increasing the number of guards at major state facilities and enhancing the security of hazardous materials that could be used in terrorism.The level 3 calls for further strengthening access control and guards at facilities vulnerable to terrorism, while level 4 calls for putting officials of relevant agencies on emergency standby and setting up a special office coping with terror incidents.","south korea decided tuesday ,decided tuesday to lower ,attacks in november 2015 ,korea decided tuesday to ,korea decided tuesday","['South Korea', 'Paris', 'Paris']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.367843    0.76519012

At the time there were two interceptor launchers stationed in the rural county. Four more were added last month. This file photo, taken Sept. 12, 2017, shows a launcher of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system being positioned at a US military base in Seongju, 300 kilometers south of Seoul. The US Army, which transported four additional THAAD launchers to the base Sept. 7, has installed them there and is ready to operate them, along with two of the six THAAD launchers previously installed. In September, South Korea announced that the deployment of a THAAD battery in the county had been completed in a ""tentative"" step to counter threats from North Korea. The battery has been operational, but the military unit and manpower operating it has not fully been in place.South Korea decided to deploy the US missile defense shield -- despite fierce protest from local residents and civic groups -- as a countermeasure to North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile provocations.In addition, the USFK and South Korea's military said they will create a joint security force to guard the Seongju base.

According to reports citing participants of the Moscow Nonproliferation Conference, North Korean Foreign Ministry’s Director General of North America Affairs Choi Sun-hee said that Pyongyang will not return to six party talks, and that the country will only negotiate with the US. North Korean Foreign Ministry’s Director General of North America Affairs Choi Sun-hee speaks at the Moscow Nonproliferation Conference on Saturday. Yonhap“Suggestions from various countries are welcome, but as the US is the country that is trying to pressure and to bring about the collapse of North Korea, the issue must be resolved with the US,” Choi was quoted as saying. Choi was responding to a question about Pyongyang’s stance on resuming the six party talks on North Korea’s nuclear program in the session on easing tension on the Korean Peninsula. According to reports, Choi also said that Pyongyang considers the six party talks to be invalid, and that nuclear armament was a “strategic decision” for North Korea. “The only way to defend sovereignty is nuclear armament, and we  will not follow in the footsteps of Iraq and Libya,” Choi said. “Nuclear armament is critical in facing the US policy of hostility, and the policy to crushing  through sanctions.”Choi also claimed that Pyongyang will strengthen its nuclear weapons program unless the US “makes the right choice of coexisting with us peacefully,” and that North Korea is unfazed by US President Donald Trump’s “crazy statements” hinting at possible military actions. Also on Saturday, North Korea’s state media reported that Pyongyang’s UN representative sent a letter to the UN Security Council urging it to discuss South Korea-US joint naval drills. “The joint military drills against the republic  that began during the Cold War have become bigger and more aggressive after the Cold War,” North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency quoted the letter allegedly sent on Friday. “According to Article 34 and 35 of the UN Charter, we demand that the UN Security Council discuss the US’s joint military exercise as an urgent issue.” Article 34 of the UN Charter states that the UN Security Council “may investigate any dispute, or any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute.” Article 35 states that any UN member can bring a situation referred to in Article 34 to the attention of the Security Council or of the General Assembly.The KCNA also claimed that should Pyongyang’s demands be refused, the UN Security Council would be proving that it has “forsaken its duties and the international society’s trust, and proving that it has become a political tool of a country.”The military exercise North Korea referred to is the five-day South Korea-US naval drill conducted off the country’s east and west coasts. The exercise involved some 40 vessels from South Korea and US navies, including the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan.","korean diplomat said saturday ,not resume six party ,nonproliferation conference north korean ,resume six party talks ,korea will not return","['North Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'north Korean Foreign Ministry ’s', 'North America Affairs', 'Choi Sun - hee', 'Pyongyang']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.62907982  0.56811649

CNN reported Park's international legal team led by MH Group plans to submit a document on her human rights situation to the United Nations Human Rights Council. They claimed that Park, who's standing trial for corruption and abuse of power, ""is living in a cell that's dirty, cold and constantly lit so she cannot sleep,"" according to the report.The team's draft report said the 65-year-old ousted leader suffers from a handful of chronic conditions and maladies.  ""Her condition is only getting worse, and there is no evidence that she is receiving adequate care,"" the draft said.The Ministry of Justice said the allegations are groundless. "" is being held in a room of an optimum size equipped with a television, locker, toilet and a heated floor,"" it said in a statement released to media. The Seoul Detention Center told Yonhap News Agency that Park has been provided a folding bed since she was first admitted, denying CNN's report. It added the heating system installed in the floor was activated last week given the seasonal change. The authorities said they provide every opportunity for Park to get medical treatment for her maladies that include back and joint pains, as well as time for a regular workout. ""She gets treatment from our internal medical staff whenever necessary, not to mention that she's been allowed out twice for hospital visits,"" the ministry said. The authorities also argued against the claim that light in the cell is disrupting her sleep.""We have the night lamps turned on for the night patrol,"" the spokesperson said. ""We cannot leave  in the dark."" The center stressed that any unfair treatment of the former president is unlikely given the high level of public attention and constant monitoring by Park's advocates.   Park's legal counsel in Korea said they had no knowledge of such allegations being raised by a foreign legal firm and its plan. One of her lawyers said he's never heard of MH Group. ""But I believe any action is possible from any group around the world since she has many supporters overseas,"" the lawyer said. The disgraced leader was arrested and indicted in March on charges of bribery and abuse of power. Following a court's extension of her detention last week, Park spoke out Monday for the first time since her trial began in May, accusing the judiciary of making her a victim of political revenge. She said she would give up her rights to counsel.","jailed ex president south ,her detention cell cnn ,ex president south korea ,of jailed ex president ,korea on wednesday denied","['South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'CNN', 'Park', 'MH Group', 'the United Nations Human Rights Council', 'Park']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59000504  0.36758804

According to government data released Tuesday by Rep. Park Byeong-seug of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, the nonprosecution rate for crimes committed by US military personnel here stands at a whopping 70.7 percent as of July this year, up from 58.2 percent in 2014.  Ministry of Justice The figure for violent crimes, including murder, rape and robbery, is even higher at 81.3 percent, meaning 8 out of 10 offenders do not go through the Korean system. This proportion is higher than in 2014, when the number stood at 63 percent. As for illegal drug use, which is strictly punished in South Korea, 42.9 percent of the accused members of US forces avoided indictment this year, up from 33.3 percent in 2014. Rep. Park pointed to the Status of Forces Agreement between the US and South Korea as the main reason behind the leniency. The agreement -- approved and enacted in 1967 and revised twice in 1991 and 2001 -- states that Korea recognizes that it is the primary responsibility of the military authorities of the US to maintain good order and discipline where people subject to US military laws are concerned, and will waive its primary right to exercise jurisdiction upon the request of the US, although it can choose not to. He did not give details on how the US military dealt with those crimes it took under its jurisdiction, or what proportion of nonprosecutions were prosecuted by the US military.“When such crime is committed by US soldiers, the US Army sends a request to South Korea’s Justice Ministry to give up the jurisdiction, and in most cases, we accept their request,” the five-term lawmaker explained. “SOFA should be revised immediately to protect our jurisdiction rights and lives and property of our citizens.”By Jo He-rim","government data released tuesday ,south korean authorities lawmaker ,in 10 criminal offenses ,over most usfk crime ,authorities lawmaker said tuesday","['US', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Park Byeong - seug', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'US']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.03850643  0.43089166

The ministry warned that the North should refrain from operating the complex without Seoul’s consent, stressing that South Korean firms hold the property rights to all factories and machines there. “The government takes the basic stance that North Korea should not infringe on South Korean firms’ property rights,” said a ministry official Tuesday. “We’ve made clear that all factories and machines in the zone belong to the companies here,” he added. Buses were spotted entering and leaving the complex and lamp posts were seen used for the past six months, the ministry revealed. However, the resumption of operations at the industrial park are still only “suspected,” as there is insufficient evidence, stressed the ministry. “Seoul plans to make a fact-finding effort to determine the situation. If local firms apply to visit North Korea to check their assets, the government will consider whether to approve their requests after gauging various factors,” the ministry official said. The North’s resumption of the Kaesong industrial park would be clear violations of the inter-Korean agreements that guarantee South Korean firms’ assets and the latest UN sanctions targeting the North’s textile exports. The US-backed Radio Free Asia recently reported that the North had started operating 19 textile factories within the complex. Reportedly, about 58 percent of the South Korean companies there did textile-related businesses. On Friday, North Korea’s propaganda outlet Uriminzokkiri hinted that North Korea had resumed operation of the Kaesong industrial park saying that “it’s nobody’s business” what it does in the zone, where its “sovereignty is exercised.” It also vowed to run the factories more actively and to show how its citizens are currently working “with confidence” there. Another government official added that there is a possibility that North Korea may be using its own electricity to power the complex, as South Korea cut off all water and electricity supplies after closing the industrial park in February 2016. Korea Electric Power Corp., South Korea’s state-run power provider said Tuesday that South Korea has not been providing electricity to the complex since its shutdown.It said that the 124 local firms that had operations in the industrial park have not been paying their bills since they evacuated the complex last year, therefore it was logical for the state-run provider to suspend all supplies to the zone.

The visit was arranged amid growing tensions caused by the North's Sept. 3 nuclear test and a series of ballistic missile launches. The recent exchange of bellicose rhetoric between the leaders of the US and the North has further escalated tensions.Earlier this month, the party sent a delegation to Washington to drum up US support for its policy line for redispatching the US nuclear arsenal withdrawn from here in 1991. The delegation only drew a negative response from Washington that holds fast to its principle of denuclearization and nonproliferation.The party is seeking to arrange meetings of Hong and top officials in the State Department and Pentagon, and leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives. Hong also seeks to meet experts from top think tanks, such as the Heritage Foundation and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.His itinerary also includes a visit to the US Pacific Command in Hawaii, his aides said.As the nuclear standoff with the North shows no signs of abating, Hong's party has ramped up calls for Seoul to explore nuclear options to achieve a ""balance of nuclear power"" with the North, which it says now enjoys a ""nuclear monopoly.""Seoul has rejected any tit-for-tat nuclear option, voicing concerns it could destabilize Northeast Asia and trigger a regional nuclear arms race.","party officials said wednesday ,next month to highlight ,korea party will embark ,opposition leader to visit ,united states next month","['the United States', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Hong', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'US']",26,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.68979257  0.83911145

According to members of South Korean parliamentary intelligence committee, however, North Korea may be incapable of detecting US Air Force maneuvers near its borders. Lawmakers on the committee told the media that Seoul’s National Intelligence Service reported that Pyongyang appears to have been unaware of Saturday’s operation involving B-1B bomber and F-15 fighter jets. The NIS also told the lawmakers that North Korean military took no measures in response around the time of the flight. “In short, North Korea took no actions when the B-1B  approached ,” intelligence committee chief Rep. Lee Cheol-woo said, citing information revealed by the NIS.Lee added that the US military informed the NIS that the flightpath of the B-1B was disclosed because North Korea appeared to have failed to detect the maneuver on its own, and appears to have conferred with China and Russia regarding the matter. According to the NIS, North Korea repositioned some military aircraft to the east coast, and carried out a surveillance flight in the region sometime after the US aircraft withdrew from the area. The revelation comes a day after Ri accused US President Donald Trump of declaring war on North Korea, giving his country “the right to shoot down US bombers even if they do not breach our airspace.” This US Air Force handout photo shows an Air Force B-1B Lancer receiving fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker near the East China Sea. / US AIR FORCERi claimed that it was a clear declaration of war, and that his country now has the justification to shoot down US military planes even if North Korea’s airspace is not breached. “This past weekend, Trump again declared war on us, saying that our regime will not last long,” Ri said, saying that the international community had hoped for the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang to escalate into actions. “These words were uttered by the incumbent president of the US, therefore it is a clear declaration of war. The world must remember clearly that it was the US that first declared war on us.” Ri was referring to Trump’s tweet on Sunday that reads “Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer,” again calling Kim Jong-un “Rocket Man.”The White House has been quick to dismiss Ri’s claims.“We have not declared war on North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. South Korea, meanwhile, continues to seek means to ease tension between Washington and Pyongyang. “It is imperative that we, Korea and the US together, manage the situation, in order to prevent further escalation of tensions or any kind of accidental military clashes which can quickly go out of control,” South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said in a speech in Washington, while warning that Pyongyang was likely to carry out more provocations. According to Seoul’s parliamentary intelligence committee, South Korean military and intelligence agencies are closely monitoring the North over concerns that another provocation may occur in October.

In comparison, Israel's defense sector accounted for 14 percent of all manufacturing jobs in the Middle Eastern country in 2014, with its defense expenditures amounting to 17 percent of its total budget.In particular, Israel's unemployment rate has fallen to 5.9 percent from 10.7 percent in 2003 on the back of its efforts to create jobs in the defense industry by boosting arms exports.The report also said the United States has been actively taking advantage of its defense budget to create more jobs. America's defense spending took up 15 percent of its federal budget in 2015, with the industry's employment accounting for more than 10 percent of all manufacturing payrolls.The Trump administration plans to jack up its defense spending by more than 10 percent next year in an effort to boost domestic demand and lower the jobless rate.Noting South Korea lacks a strategy to link its security environment with industrial development, the report called on the government to put more emphasis on the economic feasibility and efficiency of its massive weapons procurement projects so that they could contribute to employment.The report expected South Korea to spend more on defense down the road due to growing tension on the Korean Peninsula, with its defense spending likely to rise from the current level of 40.3 trillion won  to up to 59.3 trillion won in 2022.","job creation stays low ,seoul large defense spending ,korean defense industry job ,and israel despite seoul ,sunday south korea defense","['south korean', 'the United States', 'Israel', 'Seoul', ""South Korea 's"", 'the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade']",26,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.54259688  0.64075261

YonhapAccording to a survey conducted last month by professor Lim Dong-kyun from University of Seoul, 89.5 percent of some 1,202 respondents said that the new law was effective. Some 45.6 percent said the impact was little, while 5.6 percent said the changes were huge. Just 0.6 percent said there was no change at all.The “Kim Young-ran law,” named after the former Supreme Court justice who first drafted it, bars civil servants, journalists and teachers, as well as their spouses, from accepting meals and gifts worth more than 30,000 won  and 50,000 won, respectively. It took effect on Sept. 28 last year.The limits on the value of meals, gifts and congratulatory and condolence money effect some 4 million South Koreans.The report showed that 52.9 percent of respondents said they received less requests for recruitment favors. Slightly over 55 percent said they sent and received gifts less often after the law was introduced. About 36 percent said they dined less often with employees, while 43.6 percent said they paid bills separately more often compared to before. Almost half, 48 percent, said further revision is needed to strengthen the law, such as fixing the price ceiling of meals, gifts and congratulatory and condolence money. Among those under the direct effect of the law, 36 percent echoed the view. Rep. Kang Hyo-sang of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party proposed in June a revision bill to the current anti-corruption law, suggesting to raise the cap on the value of meals and gifts each to 100,000 won, while lowering that on congratulatory and condolence money to 50,000 won. Respondents, at the same time, said there are still uncertainties with regards to the scope and implementation.Around 37 percent said the standards of the legislation is too vague to be applied to real life, followed by those who said “punishment is weak and targeting only certain groups of people.” Kim Young-ran. YonhapWith the Chuseok holiday just around the corner, complaints of the price limits on meals and gifts have been growing, as many say the caps are set too low without considering market prices.Protests are strong especially from the agriculture and food industries, which say they have seen large decreases in sales after the law’s effectuation. Korea Rural Economic Institute data showed that seven major department stores saw a 14.4 percent on-year drop in sales of gift sets for the Lunar New Year holiday early this year. Sales of gift sets comprising agricultural products declined by 25 percent.However, in the above mentioned survey, about 70 percent of those who run their own business said that their income had not changed compared to a year ago, while only 8 percent said their income dramatically worsened. Professor Lim, who led the survey, said during a forum on the anti-corruption law hosted Wednesday that “it is undeniable that the anti-corruption law has made actual changes in Korean society in terms of social and culture aspects.”As of last month, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office had booked 109 people for violating the new regulations, with five of them indicted on criminal charges. By Kim Da-sol","law in 10 koreans ,corruption law in 10 ,koreans say anti corruption ,10 koreans say anti ,last month by professor","['Koreans', 'Lim Dong - kyun', 'Un']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56519645  0.52751875

The video-sharing website closed the North Korean account soon after the North conducted its sixth nuclear test Sept. 3, with no detailed explanation, just saying the channel violated its guidelines. Uriminzokkiri frequently posted videos of state TV news clips, including footage of missile launches and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's inspection tours. North Korea researchers were dismayed by the shutdown as the channel was a precious source for studying the reclusive country.

But pressure intensified from in and outside of the country to abort -- or at least suspend -- the plan. During a phone conversation after North Korea's fresh launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Moon to consider timing of Seoul's humanitarian aid to North Korea, according to Cheong Wa Dae. But President Moon Jae-in responded that aid should be extended regardless of political considerations, presidential officials said.Earlier in the day, North Korea fired an intermediate-range missile over Japan, demonstrating its determination to continue developing weapons of mass destruction. President Moon and Prime Minister Abe             “The government maintains its stance on humanitarian aid for the socially disadvantaged in the North regardless of the political circumstances,” Lee Eugene, deputy spokesperson for the Ministry of Unification, said in a regular briefing. As strong international sanctions are expected to have crippling effects on Pyongyang’s economy, the impact is likely to hit the socially disadvantaged there first, she explained.“The support program seeks to provide cereals and vaccines to the vulnerable social group in North Korea and we believe it does not violate the spirit of the United Nations,” Lee said. The ministry will make the final decision on the project at a scheduled meeting on Sept. 21, the spokesperson added. Humanitarian aid has been cut off since January last year under the former President Park Geun-hye administration after the reclusive regime conducted its fourth nuclear weapons test. The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the government had explained its plan to the United States and Japan beforehand. However, according to a report by the US’ Voice of America on Friday, the US Department of State spokesperson refused to comment on Seoul’s aid project and told the media outlet to inquire with Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was also reported to have expressed his opposition, Thursday, suggesting that such aid would weaken international efforts to pressure the recalcitrant regime.Lawmakers here are also divided over the issue, with opposition political parties lashing out over the appropriateness of the plan and its timing. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party made harsh comments against the government, claiming that it is “out of its mind.”“Is the government in its right mind to think to send money to the North right after the international community unanimously agreed to pass a UN resolution for stringent sanctions against the communist regime?” said Rep. Shim Jae-cheol of the conservative party at a press briefing Thursday. “When will President Moon Jae-in’s ‘crush’ stop for the ‘world’s troublemaker’ Kim Jong-un?”The minor opposition Bareun Party also said that while it is not against the idea of humanitarian aid, the timing does not seem appropriate. “There is a right time for everything. Describing the government as incapable of dealing with national security may be too much of a praise now. It has given up on dealing with national security,” acting Chairman and Floor Leader of the splinter conservative party Rep. Joo Ho-young said at a party meeting Friday. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea, on the other hand, welcomed the aid project. “While strong sanctions are needed, it is also crucial that the government continues to make various efforts to lead to peace,” the party’s spokeswoman Kim Hyun said. A civic group composed of 56 North Korea support groups here, the Korea NGO Council for Cooperation with North Korea, also expressed its support for the aid package.

""I share the view that the South has to increase its defense capabilities in response to the North's advancing nuclear and missile capabilities, but I don't agree to the idea of South Korea developing nuclear arms on its own or seeking the redeployment of tactical nukes,"" he said. This photo, taken on Sept. 11, 2017, shows President Moon Jae-in speaking during a meeting with his senior secretaries at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. ""It would be difficult to maintain peace between South and North Korea if we respond with the stance that we have to counter the North's nukes with our own. Moreover, it would undermine peace and stability in the entirety of Northeast Asia by triggering a nuclear competition,"" he added.The interview was conducted ahead of his visit to New York next week to attend the UN General Assembly.After the North conducted two intercontinental ballistic missile launches in July and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, conservative parties ratcheted up calls for Seoul to explore nuclear options, including the reintroduction of UStactical nukes withdrawn from here in 1991.Their demand is rooted in the belief that the South must seek a ""nuclear balance of power"" -- or ""balance of terror"" -- with the pugnacious neighbor, which they argue now enjoys a ""nuclear monopoly.""  Despite Pyongyang's relentless provocations, Moon said he would stick to his policy approach that critics here have written off as ""too dovish and tenuous."" His peace initiative seeks to reengage Pyongyang through a delicate mixture of dialogue and sanctions with the end goal of denuclearizing the communist regime.""Our North Korea policy line remains intact. If the North opts to take a path of dialogue, we have many dialogue options, including bilateral and multilateral ones, and we also have plans to help the North develop its economy and prosper once it returns to dialogue,"" he said.""But this is possible when it comes out for talks. The North should create conditions to enable the dialogue,"" he said, stressing current international sanctions and pressure are all aimed at avoiding the crisis of war and forcing the North out to the negotiating table.Moon's dialogue-based approach was seen running afoul of Trumps' hard-line stance. In a recent tweet, the US leader said that ""talk of appeasement"" with the North will not work -- a statement that triggered concerns about dissonance between the allies.Moon tried to quash such worries, saying he does not think the content of the tweet should be viewed in such narrow terms.""I believe what President Trump wanted to say was that, not only South Korea and the US, but also China and Russia all together need to respond very firmly against North Korea's nuclear provocations,"" he was quoted as saying by CNN. He added South Korea and the US are strongly cooperating on the framework of their bilateral alliance in the face of the North's nuclear and missile provocations.The liberal president also reiterated ""confidently"" that there would never be another armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula, while stressing Seoul would lead the efforts to resolve the nuclear standoff ""peacefully through diplomacy.""Commenting on the latest UN Security Council sanctions resolution to punish the North's latest nuke test, the president stressed that its unanimous adoption and implementation pledges from China and Russia underscore the international solidarity against Pyongyang's nuclear program.""Though it remains unknown whether the North would halt provocations with this resolution and it is a choice for Pyongyang to make, I believe  shows the whole world has made a significant start,"" he said.""If the North continues to launch provocations, the international community would widen the scope of oil shipment restrictions and this will definitely make the North have no other option but to stop provocations,"" he added.In August, South Korea and the US held a meeting to discuss an amendment to the five-year-old bilateral free trade agreement. The deal, which went into effect in March 2012, was intended to remove or lower trade barriers to markets that can fuel trade and generate more business opportunities. US President Donald Trump has blamed free trade deals, including the one with South Korea, for killing US jobs. Moon told CNN that South Korea and the US will begin discussions for a more mutually beneficial deal. Moon also voiced worries over negative assessments of the free trade deal between South Korea and the US before the two nations embark on negotiations to amend it. The trade volume between the two countries increased to $109.6 billion in 2016 from $100.8 billion in 2011, with South Korea's trade surplus reaching some $27 billion last year, up from $11.6 billion tallied five years earlier.Although the US has a deficit in goods trade, it has consistently enjoyed a surplus in the services trade with South Korea.","nuclear options against korea ,korea would destabilize northeast ,thursday dismissed mounting calls ,options against korea president ,against korea president moon","['Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'US', 'CNN', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Washington']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.44962043  0.56507909

117,117,Seoul eyes $8m humanitarian aid to Pyongyang,"South Korea said Thursday that it is planning an $8 million humanitarian aid package for North Korea, to be delivered via international organizations, amid a toughening mood globally toward the defiant communist regime.

The announcement, which came days after the United Nations adopted a tougher set of sanctions against the North, was met with immediate backlash from both within and outside the county. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reportedly expressed his opposition, saying it is not the time to provide aid, but to increase pressure. Earlier in the day, Pyongyang had threatened to sink Japan with nuclear weapons. “The current administration’s basic stance is that humanitarian assistance should be continued regardless of political considerations,” Seoul’s Unification Ministry said Thursday in a press briefing, stressing that the aid program will specifically target infants and pregnant women. A final decision on whether or not to proceed with the support plan is expected on Sept. 21, at a meeting presided over by the unification minister. According to the ministry, out of the planned $8 million, about $4.5 million is envisioned to go to the United Nations Food Program while the rest would be managed by UNICEF for its vaccine and other health care programs. The ministry said that the UN organizations have been consistently asking for government permission to restart their relief programs. The project, if realized, will mark the Moon Jae-in administration’s first state-backed humanitarian assistance to the North. South Korea, under the previous Park Geun-hye administration, cut off all aid to the reclusive regime after it conducted its fourth nuclear weapons test in January last year. Its last provision of aid through global organizations was the United Nations Population Fund’s research project in December 2015, in which Seoul chipped in $800,000. The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the government had explained its plan to the United States and Japan.However, speaking at a general briefing, Japan’s Suga said, “A resolution that carries strict sanctions against the communist regime has been adopted unanimously at the UN Security Council meeting. It is important to keep away from actions that can weaken the international efforts,” he was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency. When asked if Japan is willing to discuss Seoul’s plan, he said he would not answer now as the plan is yet to be officially confirmed. South Korea’s opposition parties strongly criticized the government, calling for an abortion of the plan. “It is already proven that lenient North Korean policies have been the source of the rogue state’s nuclear missile development,” the party’s spokeswoman Rep. Jun Hee-kyung said. “The $8 million plan should immediately be withdrawn, as it is the most inhumane and harsh treatment to prolong the Kim Jong-un administration for North Koreans.” The centrist People’s Party Chairman Ahn Cheol-soo said that while he agrees with the need for humanitarian aid, he questioned the timing. “We have to think carefully in proceeding with the aid project because the plan comes right after the North’s recent nuclear test and we are the biggest victim here,” he told reporters during his visit to North Jeolla Province on Thursday. A member of the parliamentary committee for foreign affairs and unification also said that the government’s stance could negatively influence the relationship with allies.“Even if it is funding mothers and children in North Korea through international organizations, we should reconsider the choice. The international society gave consent to pressure the North, and South Korea should not be the one to nullify it,” Rep. Cheong Yang-seog of the minor opposition conservative Bareun Party said.Stung by the criticism, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae reiterated the principle that humanitarian support should not be linked to political conditions. “Sanctions target the North Korean regime and the group that keeps the leadership intact, not its citizens,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said Thursday. “Providing assistance through international organizations is something other nations have been doing as well. We have decided to make this decision because  is verifiable and transparent,” the official added. Cheong Wa Dae also implied that its decision would not be affected by possible North Korean provocations in the future, in line with its two-track policy of dialogue and sanctions against the North.

According to data from the Asia-Pacific Port State Control, the number of North Korean vessels, which underwent PSC inspections last month, stood at 17, a sharp drop from 33 in the same month last year, Voice of America said. Of the 17, 10 were at Russian ports and seven at Chinese ports, compared with 11 and 22 a year ago, respectively, the broadcaster said. This file photo shows North Korean freighter Ja Ryok. This year's figures are a big change given most North Korean ships were found at Chinese ports in previous years, the broadcaster said, adding that the ratio of their navigation to Russia relatively soared.Such a phenomenon has something to do with the North's withered external trade amid UN punishments, the broadcaster said. The Chinese government has suspended the imports of North Korean coal, a major source of hard currency for the Pyongyang regime, since Feb. 18 to comply with the international sanctions. The suspension lasts until the end of the year.Citing its analysis of other data from MarineTraffic, the broadcaster said that 16 North Korean boats were spotted via the automatic identification system between Sept. 6-13. MarineTraffic provides live ship tracking intelligence worldwide. Of them, eight were discovered off the coast of China and seven near Vladivostok, it added.","overseas operation sharply curtailed ,psc inspections last month ,sharply curtailed amid sanctions ,sanctions on pyongyang missile ,us broadcaster reported thursday","['north korean', 'China', 'UN', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'north korean', 'PSC']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58153534  0.77066499

The move comes in the wake of the North's sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation test on Sept. 3. The UNSC also completely banned North Korea's export of textiles, regarded as yet another major source of hard currency for its regime, along with coal. The spokesman said that the latest UNSC resolution will inflict ""great pain"" on the North Korean regime by squeezing the money flow to its nuclear and ballistic missile development programs.Asked if the Seoul government would draw up its own sanctions on the North in line with the UNSC's latest step, he said that it is important to make sure that all existing resolutions and sanctions are faithfully implemented.","korea mulls diverse diplomatic ,tuesday diverse diplomatic measures ,pressure on north korea ,aimed at increasing global ,foreign ministry said tuesday","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Cho']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.40903848  0.80914724

The Security Council also imposed a complete ban on the North's exports of textile products seen as a major source of foreign currency suspected of being diverted to advance its nuclear and missile programs.The UNSC adopted the latest resolution following the North's sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation test on Sept. 3. This is the ninth sanctions resolution the council has adopted against the North since 2006, when it carried out its first nuclear test.""It could be meaningful in that the resolution includes restrictions on oil supplies , though it still falls short of our expectations,"" said Cho Bong-hyun, a senior analyst at IBK Economic Research Institute. ""More than others, the oil-related measures could have a psychological impact on the North."" This is the first time that the UNSC resolution has included restrictions on oil supplies to the North. Experts analyzed that it would lead to around a 30 percent reduction in total supplies of oil-related products to the North.The move is still not as tough as the US wanted. In its earlier draft, the U.S wanted to put a total ban on oil supplies to the North as it could have a crippling impact on its economy and be strong enough to prod Pyongyang to negotiate for its denuclearization.China and Russia, two of the five veto-wielding council members, reportedly balked at any move that could destabilize the impoverished country. China supplies most of the oil to its ally the North. ""It seems that the US and China, in particular, have reached a compromise in which the former wants to take tougher action against the North and the latter wants to avoid steps that could destabilize its ally,"" said Kim Keun-sik, a professor at Kyungnam University.""China wants to make the North feel the pain but doesn't want to be so tough that the North collapses. That will not likely change much in the future,"" he added.Experts said that China will likely implement what was agreed upon in the latest deal with the US ""for the time being,"" but it remains to be seen whether it will keep pressing the North in the long term. It is not clear whether the restricted oil supplies to the North would have its intended impact. Still, they noted that the measure could open the way for a complete oil embargo.""The resolution will cut the North's oil imports by around 29 percent, which will eventually put a brake on the North's consistent economic growth and raise the chances for its economic slowdown going forward,"" said Chung Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the South Korean think tank Sejong Institute.""Though such an action has obvious limitations of its own to make the North change its policy, it is very meaningful given that the UNSC action has opened the way for a complete suspension of oil supplies to the North down the road,"" he added. A North Korea expert who asked not to be named agreed with the view, saying that the US seems to have left its last cards to play in case the North continues with additional provocations.""The North is unlikely to come out to negotiate until it announces the completion of its nuclear capabilities,"" he said. ""Until that time, the US will continue to impose additional sanctions and the North will continue to seek provocations.Eventually, we will have to get to the endgame. Before that part comes, the US seems to have cards left that it can use,"" he noted.In an apparent hint that it will ramp up its provocative acts, the North warned on Monday that the US will suffer the ""greatest pain"" if it pushes ahead with new tougher UN sanctions over its sixth nuclear test, threatening that it will make Washington pay a ""due price.""","fresh sanctions against north ,tuesday on monday local ,sanctions against north korea ,of fresh sanctions against ,taken experts said tuesday","[""the UN Security Council 's"", 'North Korea', 'UNSC']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.3920202   0.78116763

""There is no change in the government's policy principle of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and we have never reviewed a re-adoption of the tactical nukes,"" a Cheong Wa Dae official said.On Saturday , a White House official said the administration is not ruling out moving tactical nuclear weapons to the South if Seoul makes a request, according to NBC.  The Cheong Wa Dae official stressed the redeployment will not only make the government's denuclearization policy ""a lost cause"" but could lead to a nuclear armament spree in the Northeast Asia region.Demand from the conservative bloc for the redeployment of the tactical nukes has grown since North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3.The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on a draft sanctions resolution proposed by the US on Monday that has tougher measures including an oil embargo and freeze of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's assets. The North, meanwhile, blasted the South for being in steps with the U.N. to further rein in the regime with tougher sanctions. A commentary by Rodong Sinmun, the state newspaper, called the move as ""treacherous acts"" and ""an unpardonable provocation aimed at doing harm"" to the regime. It also warned the South that it will ""meet stern judgment of history"" if it keeps up the steps aimed at stifling the North.","not considering tactical nuclear ,korea not considering tactical ,never reviewed re adoption ,the trump government ,presidential office said sunday","['South Korea', 'US', 'Trump', 'Seoul']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.57945597  0.8119868

But they also pointed out that the North could fire ballistic missiles at any time from mobile launchers, known as transporter erector launchers.""Our assessment is that the North can carry out a nuclear test at tunnel 3 or 4 of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site,"" a government official said on customary condition of anonymity. The official also said the North could choose the founding anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party, which falls on Oct. 10, to conduct a provocation. In an editorial marking the anniversary, the Rodong Sinmun, the North's main state newspaper, said that nuclear weapons make the country more secure, and that the country should develop more cutting-edge weapons and continue breakthroughs, such as its test-firings of ICBMs in July.In response to the North's sixth nuclear test, the US, South Korea and others have been pushing for a new package of powerful sanctions on the North, including banning crude oil supplies to the country and freezing the assets of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The US officially asked the UN Security Council to vote on a draft sanctions resolution Monday. The proposal calls for imposing an oil embargo on the North, freezing assets of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and banning textile exports from the North.Experts say the North could wait and see how the vote goes before carrying out additional provocations.","its sixth nuclear test ,provocations officials said saturday ,anniversary south korea military ,sixth nuclear test ,even another nuclear test","[""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.28215459  0.50894207

She, however, declined to provide any specific ""provocation-free"" date or duration, saying that it would rather decrease the ""flexibility of our government"" in dealing with the North Korean regime going forward.

The North conducted its two claimed intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, which prompted the UN Security Council to adopt a fresh resolution against its regime.After around a month hiatus, the North fired short-range missiles on Saturday in an apparent protest against an ongoing joint exercise by South Korean and US forces.Asked if the Seoul government will issue any statement condemning the North's latest provocation, Kang said that detailed countermeasures will be determined based on a thorough analysis of what was actually fired and in coordination with military authorities.","korea to stop provocations ,pyongyang stops additional provocations ,said monday reaffirming seoul ,on korea to stop ,korea to stop","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', ""South Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'communist']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.28043926  0.73800516

Under the bilateral missile agreement, South Korea is prohibited from developing ballistic missiles with a range of more than 800 kilometers and a payload of over 500 kilograms.But South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered consultations on such a revision after North Korea launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.In Washington, the State Department said Friday that Lim and Sullivan will discuss continued coordination on North Korea policy, bilateral issues, and trilateral cooperation with Japan on shared regional and global priorities.Sullivan will also reaffirm the United States' ""ironclad commitment"" to the defense of South Korea and its other allies against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, the department said in a news release.The talks will precede a meeting between the two countries' defense chiefs on Wednesday.South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo and US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are scheduled to meet at the Pentagon to discuss North Korea and the allies' combined defense capabilities.","saturday vice foreign minister ,this weekend for talks ,korean foreign vice minister ,senior officials on monday ,said saturday vice foreign","[""South Korea 's"", 'Washington', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'US', 'State', 'John Sullivan', 'south korean', 'Korea']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.5538857   0.6865809

The expertise cannot be carried in the heads of rogue scientists. The instructions are included in complex manuals locked in top-security facilities guarded by our security forces,” he said in a written interview with Yonhap News Agency, citing Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin‘s recent op-ed in the New York Times.  “Not only would it be virtually impossible for criminals to access these manuals, but also any effort could not go unnoticed by our government,” he added.Citing a study by Michael Elleman, a missile expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the New York Times reported on Aug. 14 that North Korea could have got its hands on technology needed for the success of the recent missile launches through black market purchases of rocket engines from Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has immediately denied the suspicion, with its Foreign Minister Klimkin in the mentioned op-ed, saying, “No evidence has been provided to support the claims.”It earlier launched its own investigation.“Ukraine has a reliable state export control system. Its long-term irreproachable operation allowed our state to become a reliable international partner and participant of all, without exception, international export control regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime,” Fedunkiv said.“Ukraine holds a responsible foreign policy in the field of military-technical cooperation and continues to modernize its own export control system with a view to reliably prevent any forbidden activity, strengthening the nonproliferation regime of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery,” he added.In July, the North claimed that it successfully test-fired two intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the continental US. It drew fierce condemnation from the international community and also sparked questions as to how it was possible for Pyongyang to make such a marked stride in its missile technology in a short period of time. Fedunkiv expressed suspicion that there might have been outside help to make it happen.“I am doubtful that North Korea could achieve what it has done without outside help. The global community must now come together to conduct an international inquiry to find out who was responsible,” he said. With regard to Russia throwing weight behind the allegation that Ukraine might have been behind the missile technology leaks to the North, the country called on Moscow to do its share of work to clear up any suspicion. “First of all, the same level of transparency should be demonstrated by the Russian Federation,” Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko earlier said, referring to his country‘s recent investigation on the issue.The acting ambassador renewed Ukraine’s support for “diplomatic” efforts to resolve North Korea‘s nuclear stalemate, along with the “strict” enforcement of sanctions on its regime.“Ukraine pays special attention to the settlement of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, in particular as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,” he said.“For Ukraine, the key principle of resolving the problems associated with the DPRK’s nuclear program is the continuation of the diplomatic dialogue and the strict observance of the sanctions regime from the very beginning of its implementation,” he noted. DPRK stands for the Democratic People‘s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name.","seoul on thursday denied ,ukrainian ambassador to seoul ,on thursday denied allegations ,denies involvement in missile ,in seoul on thursday","['Ukraine', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Ukraine', 'charge d‘Affaires', 'ukrainian', 'Seoul', 'North Korea']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.70382667  0.3899495

Online users have heavily condemned Tencent for the emojis’ insulting nature towards the surviving victims. Tencent, also the operator of WeChat, said it has taken down the emojis from the QQ platform and that it will run a review on its content examination regulations to prevent reoccurrence of similar problems.Tencent explained the comfort women emojis were made by Siyanhui Co, a third-party company that produces emojis for social media platforms. According to Tencent’s regulations, all users are allowed to upload emojis that have gained approval for “rich creativity, clear connotation” and “being able to add fun into a chat” while also abiding by moral codes, laws and regulations.The documentary film “Twenty Two” was released on Aug. 14 to coincide with the International Memorial Day for the Comfort Women. The title refers to the number of the women who share their accounts in the 90-minute movie. Only eight of these 22 women are still alive as of August, according to report by China Daily. A Korean survivor, the late Park Cha-sun, also appears in the film. Park stayed in China after the war ended, living by the name Mao Yinmei. She passed away on Jan. 8 in Hubei province in central China without returning to her motherland.","company apologizes for sex ,chinese documentary film twenty ,apologizes for sex slavery ,sex slavery emojis china ,tencent on tuesday apologized","['China', 'chinese', 'chinese']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22653461  0.35039562

Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts and ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs, said during a press conference in Seoul on Tuesday.   US Sens. Carolyn Maloney, Jeff Merkley, Edward Markey, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ann Wagner. “We must acknowledge that a preventive war cannot solve this problem and  make matters much worse,” he said. Markey said such action is not a solution to the current tensions surrounding the Korean Peninsula and vowed the US Congress would make certain the US president seeks its permission when making decisions. “Talking with North Korea is not a concession -- it’s the only way to reach agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and to reinforce that our military strength is there only to deter aggression and defend against attack.”The visit here from a US bipartisan delegation led by Sen. Markey comes amid heightened cross-border tensions in the wake of the annual South Korea-US Ulchi Freedom Guardian military exercise that kicked off Monday. The five-member delegation includes Sens. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, and Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, along with two members of the House of Representatives, Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, and Ann Wagner, a Republican from Missouri. “We have undertaken this mission because we all believe that North Korea is rapidly accelerating the level of nuclear weapons, and ballistic missiles pose an unacceptable risk to the US and to its allies, and to the entire world,” Markey said. “The US and allies must remain indivisible and ready to respond to aggression with overwhelming force -- Kim Jong-un is certainly homicidal, but not suicidal.”The US lawmakers acknowledged the importance of preventing a second Korean War on the peninsula, saying it could cost “the lives of millions of people here.”“We are prepared for war, but are not preparing for war,” said Wagner. “This delegation is committed to the de-escalation .” The bipartisan team also underlined China’s role in using its economic clout on North Korea to bring about the hermit state’s denuclearization. Markey said the delegation would return to Washington with the goal of constructing stricter legislation that targets nations maintaining economic and trade ties with the North. “North Korea’s trading partners must intensify economic pressure to bring North Korea to the negotiating table,” Markey said. “That starts with getting China to cut off the flow of oil to North Korea. That is the one sure way to have a decisive impact on North Korea’s decision-making.”In line with its plans, Markey stressed a “two-track approach” in which Washington and Seoul cooperate in leading negotiations with Pyongyang. “We must begin direct discussions with North Korea on two closely coordinated tracks,” he said. “On track one, the US would lead direct negotiations toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On track two, the Republic of Korea would lead direct negotiations toward social, cultural and intergovernmental relations necessary for the long-term well-being for the people on both sides of the border.”The US delegation met with President Moon Jae-in on Monday and Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Tuesday to discuss several issues, including the North’s weapons program, the shuttered inter-Korean industrial park and North Korean defectors here. The lawmakers will head to Dandong, in China’s Liaoning province near the North Korea border to discuss North Korean issues with Chinese officials.

This file photo unveiled by North Korea`s state news agency on June 3, 2013, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  inspecting a front-line military unit.  The supervision was seen as being conducted sometime before Aug. 14 when Kim inspected the command post of the Strategic Force.At that time, he delayed a plan to fire four missiles toward the US territory of Guam.For 15 days, he had not shown up in public since July 30 when Kim attended a banquet celebrating the country's test of an intercontinental ballistic missile days earlier.A military official said that the border unit inspected by Kim is surrounded by mountainous areas and streams, making it easier for the North Korean military to make surprise provocations.South Korean and US troops kicked off 10-day joint military drills Monday, which Pyongyang has denounced as a rehearsal for a northern invasion.Tensions between Pyongyang and Washington heightened after US President Donald Trump and the North Korean leadership traded bellicose rhetoric, with both floating talk of military options.Kim Jong-un last week held off on threats of ""enveloping"" missile strikes near Guam, but he vowed to make an ""important"" decision if the US continues its ""extremely dangerous reckless actions"" on the Korean Peninsula, apparently referring to the allies' drills.","government sources said tuesday ,aug sources north korean ,border earlier this month ,tuesday in early august ,sources north korean leader","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'inter - korean', 'Kim', ""South Korea 's""]",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.71825862  0.61844575

Moon came into office on May 10 with urgent missions to address North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile programs and find a way out of inter-Korean tension as well as untangle bilateral feuds with China which frets over Seoul's deployment of a US defense system, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.As Moon's 100th day in office falls on Thursday, his successful summit-level diplomacy figures prominently.He flew to the US in late June for his first summit with President Donald Trump less than two months after taking office. He then attended the meeting of leaders from the Group of 20 countries in Germany in July, putting South Korea's summit-level diplomacy back on track following a hiatus caused by former President Park Geun-hye's impeachment.In their summit with in Washington D.C., Moon and Trump reaffirmed strong alliance between their countries and joint efforts to deter North Korea's threats, a security guarantee that came as North Korea's continued ballistic missile tests unnerved South Koreans and their surrounding regions. South Korean President Moon Jae-in  shakes hands with US President Donald Trump during a joint press conference following their bilateral summit at the White House, Washington, on June 30, 2017 . Moon also had Trump's support for South Korea's ""leading role in fostering an environment for peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula"" written in their joint statement following the summit, gaining US backing for his pledge to be in the driver's seat in dealing with North Korean issues. The statement confirmed that ""President Trump supported President Moon's aspiration to restart inter-Korean dialogue on issues including humanitarian affairs,"" extending US support for Moon's initiative to use dialogue in denuclearizing North Korea, in addition to sanctions and pressure against the country. He rallied international support for his approach during the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany held from July 7-8. During his visit to Germany, Moon unveiled the outline of his North Korea policy, later billed as the ""Berlin initiative,"" in a speech in the German capital.There, Moon said he is willing to sit together with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to discuss cooperation and peace and will push for denuclearization of North Korea simultaneously with a peace treaty with the North.""The Moon Jae-in administration unavoidably had some difficulties in pursuing new diplomatic policy after it came into a diplomacy inheritance that was in a mess,"" Hong Hyun-ik, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, said. ""But he was quite successfully in recovering South Korea's place through summit diplomacy in a short period of time and asserting his peace initiative,"" Hong said. Despite Moon's efforts, however, the security condition of the peninsula is mired in higher-than-ever tensions as North Korea escalated its military threats instead of returning South Korea's calls for talks. In July, North Korea test-fired two Hwasong-14 missiles which the country declared were intercontinental ballistic missiles. It was the country's first tests of missiles that most analysts said are capable of reaching the mainland US Some said they could have reached as far as eastern part of the US if they were fired at a right angle.Last week, North Korea's military threatened missile strikes in the area around the US territory of Guam, drawing backlash from an angry Trump.""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely,"" Trump tweeted in reaction.Meanwhile, North Korea was unresponsive to South Korea's offers to hold talks between their militaries and Red Cross bodies, which were made in line with Moon's Berlin announcement.Amid deepening tensions, the United Nations Security Council adopted its latest sanctions resolution against North Korea in early August, imposing a blanket ban on North Korea's exports of coal, iron and iron ore, the country's major foreign currency sources.Resolution 2371 also placed restrictions on the North's foreign sales of lead, seafood and workforce, with an aim to cut the country's $3 billion annual export revenue by $1 billion, in response to the ICBM testsExperts said Moon's peace initiative is currently in a straitjacket against such a backdrop; Moon's much-promoted pledge to sit in the driver's seat in North Korean issues is going nowhere with the North seen to be occupied with tit for tat with the US, rather than Seoul's offers.The prospect of South Korea's diplomacy with China and Japan looks also gloomy. In the aftermath of the North's ICBM launch, Seoul reversed course and said it will resume the unfinished deployment of a THAAD battery, a move that would surely result in a major thorn in relations with China which explicitly opposes the military installation. An unresolved diplomatic dispute over Japan's colonial-era mobilization of Korean women for sexual services is also standing in the way of the South Korea-Japan relationship, with Seoul having recently launched a special probe into a so-called comfort woman deal the previous Park administration signed with Japan to settle the history feud. ""The backdrop isn't right at all for the Moon Jae-in administration to do what it has originally set out to do,"" Kim Joon-hyung, professor at Handong Global University, said. ""The most urgent task is to manage the tinderbox at hand.""While firmly sticking to his vision, Moon has to keep pushing for talks with North Korea as well as the US and China to achieve a breakthrough in the situation, Kim said, adding that ""If official dialogue is unavailable, then he should mobilize all other options possible including under-the-table negotiations in order to keep talks going.""","tensions with president moon ,100th day in office ,escalating tensions with president ,north korea advancing nuclear ,may 10 with urgent","['Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", 'inter - korean']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.3944549   0.20531656

South Korea’s point man on the North, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyun, was on vacation while much of this happened, returning to work Thursday from a weeklong holiday. On Wednesday, while Cho was gone, the North threatened to create “enveloping fire” around the US territory of Guam. The next day it unveiled a more detailed strike plan, saying it would fire four Hwasong-12 missiles.  The Korean Central News Agency said the regime is planning to finalize the plan for its leader Kim Jong-un to approve in mid-August,  just hours after President Trump said last week the North would be met with “fire and fury” if its threats continue.Kim Young-woo of the minor opposition Bareun Party, who chairs the parliament’s defense committee, slammed Cho, saying in a statement that “the sense of urgency to resolve imminent diplomatic and national security threats is missing.”President Moon, who enjoyed a weeklong vacation from July 30, has stressed that ministers and high-ranking officials should use their vacation days in order to create a workplace culture in which workers can take more holidays. Cheong Wa Dae hit back against the criticism, attacking opposition parties for fearmongering and saying that security is always the No. 1 priority of the Seoul government. By Bak Se-hwan","vacations amid global fears ,top diplomat canceled ,vacationing ministers blasted amid ,and top diplomat canceled ,sunday after criticism mounted","['Kang Kyung - hwa', 'the National Security Council Chung Eui - yong', 'Unification', 'Cho Myoung - gyun', 'Korea']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4268997   0.63618857

Mighty Mouth, a male duet made up of rappers Shorry J and Sangchu, was apprehended by the US military police of the 8th Army late Wednesday, according to the Yonsan Police Station.  A photo of Mighty Mouth, provided by YMC Entertainment, filed on Sept. 17, 2012. Two other staff members, including the director whose identity was withheld, were also arrested on-site. They were all sent to the Yonsan precinct and questioned by the police overnight before they were released, the local police said. They said they only booked the two staff member on charges of entering the protection zone in the camp in violation of a law regarding military facilities. The two rappers were sent home without being booked as they were not responsible for making arrangements for shooting venues, the police said. The police plan to talk to military officials in the US base to determine if the incident needs to be further investigated as a formal case. They all reportedly had visitors' passes on them but never obtained permission from the US military for the filming. The authorities said that any filming of the base or facilities in the camp is strictly subject to approval from the commanding officer.

The policy is contested by proponents of nuclear power, who claim that scrapping the reactors will raise the cost of electricity across the board while putting the country at risk of running short of power supply. They also do not want South Korea to give up the technology and know-how to build commercial reactors, an area Moon's predecessors had promoted as promising exports. Questions about power supply were raised when the government invoked the demand response market system twice in July, asking companies to cut down their energy use in return for financial compensation. The system was adopted in 2014 with companies voluntarily taking part. Opponents alleged that the government used it to artificially raise the power reserve rate to refute concerns over potential power shortage.The energy ministry denied the allegations and has issued nine press releases in a period of three days from Monday.The Korean Nuclear Society, a civilian academy on nuclear development, has been leading the campaign for the opponents of the government's drive, dismissing reports on the health risks of reactors and the cost of dismantling reactors and refuting other negative arguments.  KNS said it will ask the government to allow a visit to reactor construction sites by civilian representatives to help them make their own judgment about the country's atomic power policies.","relations battle on nuclear ,nuclear free policy officials ,battle on nuclear free ,wage public relations battle ,policy officials said thursday","['the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51494592  0.53369886

The council attributed the spike to the public's sense of a heightened threat from North Korea.The survey was conducted on a weighted national sample of 2,020 adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia between June 27 and July 19. Some of the respondents are presumed to have been aware of North Korea's first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4.The ICBM had the range to strike Alaska or Hawaii, according to experts.According to the survey, 75 percent of the respondents viewed North Korea's nuclear program as a critical threat, up 15 percentage points from last year and 20 points from 2015.The council said it was the largest on-year increase for a potential threat mentioned in this year's survey.North Korea's nuclear program ranked among the top threats facing the country, it added.On the policy options to stop the North's nuclear weapons program, imposing tighter economic sanctions on the country won the most support with 76 percent, followed by imposing sanctions on Chinese companies doing business with North Korea at 68 percent.The other options were conducting airstrikes on nuclear production facilities , sending U.S. troops to destroy nuclear facilities , accepting that North Korea will possess nuclear weapons in exchange for producing no more , and accepting that North Korea will produce more nuclear weapons .The council also compared Americans' views of South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.""In the United States, there is no love for North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un,"" it said. ""His frequent portrayals in the media cast him as a madman, making him notorious for missiles, nuclear weapons, threats to the United States, and human rights abuses.""As a result, 79 percent of the respondents had a ""very unfavorable"" view of him, followed by 12 percent with a ""somewhat unfavorable"" view, 4 percent with a ""somewhat favorable"" view, and2 percent with a ""very favorable"" view.""This makes him the least favorable leader included in the survey,"" the council said.Meanwhile, 54 percent of Americans had a ""somewhat"" or ""very""favorable opinion of Moon, against 41 percent with a ""somewhat"" or ""very"" unfavorable opinion.The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.","percent of americans favored ,americans support defending korea ,troops if north korea ,60 percent of americans ,korea survey showed monday","['WASHINGTON', 'Americans', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'asian', 'the Chicago Council on Global Affairs', 'the Korea Foundation', 'Americans', 'US', 'North Korea', 'South Kor']",26,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.59378755  0.82032794

Song Ok-joo of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea. It will focus on determining whether soil and groundwater have been polluted, the city said. Samples for analysis will be extracted from six of nine sites around the military base in Yongsan, including the main post and retreat center.The announcement came as the relocation program kicks into high gear. Early last month, the 8th Army unveiled its new headquarters in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, putting an end to its 64-year deployment at the heart of Seoul since the end of the Korean War. “We decided to conduct an investigation before the USFK completes its relocation by the year’s end, because the source of the pollutants near the US military base remains unknown, with some parts around the base remaining uninvestigated,” said Kwon Ki-wook, chief of the city’s water circulation safety bureau. Since 2001 when an oil spill was first reported near Noksapyeong Station, the US military has rejected requests by the city government and civic groups to run a comprehensive investigation. The military cited that the US is not required to reveal any information about such contamination, according to the Status of Forces Agreement. It also refused to disclose the details of its cleanup efforts. According to SOFA, the US military is only responsible for contamination within its camp. Last year, the city government’s internal inspection showed that the average benzene concentration near Yongsan Garrison recorded 8.811 milligrams per liter, approximately 587 times higher than the permissible level of 0.015 milligrams per liter. Benzene, a Group 1 carcinogen classified by the World Health Organization, was found at 10 spots around the camp. The city has reportedly spent over 7.8 billion won  in cleanup efforts over a decade.Civic groups claimed the actual contamination level is well above the currently recognized figure, criticizing the US Army for its lack of transparency and for dodging responsibility over environmental pollution around the base. Activists have also voiced concerns over the health effects of exposure to the contamination. Following the relocation of key military bases in central Seoul to Pyeongtaek by 2018, the city plans to turn the area into a public park.The city government will request the USFK jointly conduct a comprehensive investigation if the inspection results show the concentration of toxic chemicals is above average levels, the city said. The results are to be released in September.Last year, the Environment Ministry conducted inspections on soil and underground water contamination near Yongsan Garrison on three occasions and released one of three results, following the Supreme Court’s order in December to disclose its inspection result. The level of pollution from 14 sites inside the military base surpassed the average level of Benzene concentration, the result showed.

""Such discussion is currently going on, but further consultations are needed for the specific issues of when and how,"" he said. The resumption of the THAAD deployment came upon President Moon Jae-in's instruction in response to North Korea's second test-fire of an intercontinental ballistic missile Friday.  Moon called for the deployment of the remaining four interception missile launchers of a THAAD battery's total six launchers, reversing his previous decision to suspend the deployment until an environmental assessment is made. Two launchers are already operational at a new USFK base in Seongju, some 300 km southeast of Seoul.""Full-swing discussions with the US will also start soon for the deployment of additional launchers,"" Moon said, adding the discussion will be followed by the process of actual deployment. The timing of the deployment, however, is still undecided, he said.The military, meanwhile, is closely monitoring the possibility of North Korea's new nuclear test, he also said in response to a press question on whether the North is likely to make another nuclear detonation as an additional provocation.","korea has begun consultations ,defense ministry said monday ,thaad launchers south korea ,said in press briefing ,after consultations moon","['South Korea', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Moon Sang - gyun', 'the Ministry of National Defense']",26,"[ 2.          1.          0.         ... -0.54502428  0.77970076

The ARF is known to be a rare event joined by North Korea, along with the other five countries involved in the suspended six-party denuclearization talks on Pyongyang's nuclear program.South Korea, the US, Japan, China and Russia usually send their top diplomats to the gathering every year.""There are more than a dozen countries that we are currently discussing holding bilateral ministerial meetings with,"" a foreign ministry official said on condition of anonymity. ""We are working on holding a meeting with the US as well.""He said that the number could grow further. Kang held her first face-to-face talks with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington in late June, just ahead of a summit between their leaders. Their potential second meeting would come amid increased tensions on the Korean Peninsula following the North's claim on July 4 that it successfully test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile. Despite the latest provocation, the Seoul government recently made an offer to hold inter-Korean talks to ease tensions and resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.The North has stayed mum on the overtures. North Korea will also likely join the ARF with its Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho expected to lead its delegation. Expectations are growing of an encounter between Kang and Ri, as the Seoul government has not ruled out the possibility, nor has it confirmed any such plan. ""The government's stance is to make steady efforts to create an environment for the resumption of denuclearization talks by using diverse channels... while at the same time taking stern action against the North's provocations,"" Cho June-hyuck, ministry spokesman, said at a regular press briefing. ""At this moment, we do not have any detailed plan to hold foreign ministers' talks between the two Koreas,"" he added. A high-ranking ministry official also expressed caution against inter-Korean talks in the Philippines, saying that it would happen ""when conditions permit.""On the sidelines of the ARF held in Laos last year, then Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Ri exchanged just a brief greeting in an unexpected encounter. Meanwhile, citing an anonymous diplomatic source, a Japanese newspaper earlier reported that the US has been asking 27 ARF member states to prevent the North from joining the annual forum.Ministry officials close to the matter here have not commented on the report.","thursday foreign minister kang ,attend asean related meetings ,thursday foreign minister ,wha will attend asean ,said thursday foreign minister","[""South Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'ASEAN', 'Manila', 'Philippines', 'the ASEAN Regional Forum']",26,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.54738432  0.71539879

I hope this will help those regions in their recovery. I wish to once again offer my sincere consolation to the people in the regions,"" the president said while meeting with his top presidential secretaries in a weekly meeting held at the presidential office, Cheong Wa Dae.The three regions are Cheongju, Cheonan and Goesan, all located in the central Chungcheong provinces that were recently hit by heavy rains. Cheongju alone reported 57.3 billion won  in damage.As a special disaster area, the city with a population of some 830,000 and its people are now entitled to a wide range of government support, including a large support fund.However, some in the vicinity that are dealing with damage from the flood may not be able to benefit from such support should their homes be located outside of the administrative boundary of the areas declared a special zone, Moon noted.The president called for a revision of the law on government support for disaster areas to allow support for even a handful of people affected by a disaster even though the rest of their administrative town may remain intact, according to Cheong Wa Dae pool reports.His secretaries also noted the need to allow special support for residents who live in apartment buildings, noting the law currently only allows support for damage incurred on detached houses. President Moon Jae-in tastes fruits from flood-hit areas while meeting with his senior secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on July 27, 2017. Later, Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyn said the president has ordered Cheong Wa Dae to take charge of dealing with major accidents or disasters.""There have been claims that Cheong Wa Dae is not the control tower, but there is no way we can say Cheong Wa Dae is not the control tower in case of a serious disaster,"" the president was quoted as saying, apparently referring to such claims by the former administration.The ousted former president, Park Geun-hye, and her administration had made such a claim while arguing they cannot or must not be held responsible for the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 or the death of more than 300 passengers then.From now, the president said the government, under the leadership of the prime minister, will be responsible for dealing with all major accidents and disasters, and that the presidential office will take charge when such accidents or disasters exceed certain limits in scale and scope to be decided, according to the Cheong Wa Dae spokesman.The president also stressed the need to ensure what he called complete authority of officials and rescue workers dealing with accidents or disasters on-site, apparently noting critical decisions may often have to be made in a matter of seconds in such conditions.To this end, the president said the recently reestablished Korea Coast Guard must have such complete authority in dealing with events taking place out on the sea while the fire department will have the same authority in events on land.Also, noting the maritime police may need some time to get used to its newly reinstated operations, the president ordered Cheong Wa Dae to set up a special task force to handle major events or disasters that may take place during the summer, Park said.The Korea Coast Guard was reestablished earlier this week, nearly three years after it was placed under the leadership of the now-defunct public safety and security ministry in the aftermath of the 2014 ferry sinking.","president said while meeting ,disaster areas president moon ,rain disaster areas enabling ,declared three areas recently ,jae in said thursday",['Moon Jae - in'],26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53733999  0.84552109

The official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose details of the negotiations, said Washington floated the idea in the run-up to the two sides’ launch of a joint working group on the matter in March 2016. Wary of the controversy at home over the system’s efficacy and China’s potential backlash, Seoul turned down the offer and the allies eventually settled on installing six launchers. “The idea of forming a battery with nine launchers came up during discussions ahead of the signing of an agreement on the working group,” the source said. “But we felt somewhat burdened by the number because there was already the solid notion in our society that one battery would entail six launchers, as well as some skepticism about the system’s overall effectiveness relative to its diplomatic impact.” A launcher of the US` Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is seen in this photo taken in April at its site in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province. Since 2014, some top US commanders and officials had argued for THAAD’s stationing here to better fend off North Korea’s evolving threats. Then the Park Geun-hye government, which was initially cautious about the plan, initiated formal talks with Washington in February 2016 shortly after Pyongyang staged a nuclear and long-range missile test. A THAAD battery typically consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, a fire control and communications unit and an AN/TPY-2 X-Band radar. A string of controversies has been surfacing ever since, mainly over the number of launchers to be put in place and the decision-making process in the lead-up to the surprise announcement. Last month, the Moon Jae-in administration concluded that the Defense Ministry had deliberately concealed in its report that four THAAD launchers had been brought to the deployment site, not two as widely known. Following a probe, Cheong Wa Dae shunted the deputy defense minister and suspended the deployment process until an environmental review is completed.

The reports suggesting the halt of security investigations by the NIS came after the new head of the spy agency promised to prohibit the agency from meddling in internal politics, a key election pledge of President Moon Jae-in.Former NIS officials are suspected of working in favor of the former conservative government and its presidential hopeful Park Geun-hye in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election where Park emerged as the new leader.Such activities, if confirmed, may have violated the law governing the spy agency, which commands the agency's political neutrality.Unlike in local politics, the law requires the agency to actively investigate and gather information on anti-state activities by North Korean spies or pro-North Korea figures.South Korea and North Korea remain divided and technically at war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.","agency halting anti spy ,halt the security investigation ,halting anti spy activities ,dae dismissed reports suggesting ,spy agency halting anti","['the National Intelligence Service', 'NIS']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37339425  0.26513004

Those talks are “still going on,” a Security Council diplomat said. “There has not been any breakthrough despite a push by the United States in particular to do it more quickly than usual.”“It's fairly slow-going,” said the diplomat, who asked not to be named. Four other UN diplomats confirmed that the negotiations were moving at a slow pace.Asked whether there was progress in negotiations, China's Ambassador Liu Jieyi told AFP “not yet” and said he did not expect agreement on a draft resolution any time soon. “It's a complicated issue,” he added.One complicating factor has been Russia's contention that the July 4 launch was not an intercontinental ballistic missile, despite North Korea's claim that it had achieved that milestone in its military program.  North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un described the launch as a “gift” to Americans as they prepared to celebrate Independence Day and hailed a breakthrough in Pyongyang's decades-long drive to develop the capability to threaten the US mainland with a nuclear strike. Russia maintains that its defense ministry had determined, based on its tracking systems, that the missile was in fact of medium range.Russia's arguments challenge the US view that the stronger sanctions are necessary to confront the more dangerous threat posed by North Korea's newly-acquired ICBM capacity.US shows evidence of ICBM launchOn Monday, Haley invited all council ambassadors along with South Korea to a meeting at which US evidence was shared about the launch, refuting Russia's claims that it was an ICBM, diplomats said.The missile launched by North Korea “was almost certainly an ICBM, capable of achieving a range in excess of 5,500 kilometers. We have high confidence in this assessment,” said a spokesperson for the British mission.Ukrainian Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko, who attended the briefing, said Russia's envoy was not convinced by the US evidence and that the Chinese ambassador “did not say a word.”While Russia contends that the launch was not an ICBM, China is “slipping behind that as a way of not definitively saying that now is the right time for a resolution,” said a Security Council diplomat.A spokesman at the US mission declined to give details of the evidence presented at the meeting. “The United States continues to work toward a resolution that will address the escalation” from the ICBM launch, he said.At an emergency council meeting following the launch, Russia argued that sanctions were not the answer to rein in North Korea, and that talks, as advocated by Beijing, were needed.It remains unclear if the United States will become impatient and put forward a sanctions resolution that could be vetoed by either China or Russia.Such a move would clear the way for US unilateral sanctions against Chinese and Russian firms that continue to trade with North Korea.In all, six sets of UN sanctions have been imposed on North Korea since it first tested an atomic device in 2006, but two resolutions adopted last year significantly toughened the sanctions regime.","wednesday us ambassador nikki ,china on korea sanctions ,launch diplomats said wednesday ,security council two weeks ,said wednesday us ambassador","['UN', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'icbm', 'US', 'Nikki Haley']",26,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.41574693  0.64431375

The five goals span 20 strategies, under which 100 major tasks are grouped together. The 100 tasks are further divided into 487 smaller tasks. “The new government will continue the spirit of the candlelight revolution. Korea will be established as a just country whose people are the rulers, where unfair privileges, foul play and unfairness is removed, and  discrimination and disparity is resolved,” Moon said. Moon also revealed that ways to finance the plans will be discussed this week, the plans will be fine-tuned by concerned ministries and the government will brief the public on the progress annually. Many of the plans concerning political and social issues center on increasing transparency and communication with the public, elements considered severely lacking in the previous administration. Related tasks, grouped together under the goal of creating a “government ruled by the people,” include increasing the transparency of government, and civil service’s personnel management, and improving human rights conditions.  The goals also include reforming the police, Ministry of Justice and its subordinate organizations, the National Intelligence Service and introducing a fairer tax system. As part of the plans, the government plans to launch an independent anti-corruption body next year and to reorganize investigative powers of the police and prosecutors’ office. The anti-corruption measures will also see the establishment of a conference of concerned organizations to fight defense-related corruption. On economic issues, the plans support Moon’s idea of “income-led growth,” with many of the tasks aimed at creating jobs and supporting small merchants and businesses. Of the 26 economic tasks, eight concern job creation, while five – including bolstering fair competition and addressing large conglomerates’ shareholding structures – concern fair competition. The economic plans also include creating 810,000 public sector jobs – one of Moon’s main election pledges – and the introduction of job-hunting subsidies, as well as increasing state organizations’ quota for hiring young adults to 5 percent from the current 3 percent. The Moon Jae-in administration also plans to inject state funds into supporting the “fourth industrial revolution” and to boost subsidies for SMEs’ research and development, as well as for venture companies. Along with economic plans, which include 129 projects under 26 tasks, welfare and social security issues take up a large part of the five-year road map.  Key welfare and safety goals include providing more child care support, increasing state housing and renovating the country’s disaster response system, as well as reviewing the four-rivers project and reducing dependence on nuclear power. On the foreign policy and security front, the Moon administration will push for North Korea’s denuclearization and the establishment of a peace treaty in parallel, starting with the restart of regular inter-Korean dialogue on the military, economy and sports. A key initiative is the signing of a new basic inter-Korean agreement built on past accords. But Cheong Wa Dae stressed it is a long-term objective to be accomplished under the proper conditions, mindful of the drawn-out gridlock and sour international sentiment toward a thaw with the recalcitrant Kim Jong-un regime. With the alliance with the US remaining the mainstay of peninsular security, Seoul aims to fix a specific timeline for an early takeover of wartime operational control through consultations with Washington. The OPCON transfer was initially set for 2015, but was delayed until the 2020s under President Park Geun-hye. Moon has pledged to complete the transfer within his term. “We will accelerate preparations to retake OPCON at an early date, while resetting and improving the South Korean military’s core capabilities to steer the joint defense against North Korean nuclear and missile threats,” the text said. Moon’s vision to build an inter-Korean economic community with a “New Korean Peninsula Economic Map” is to be sustained despite its challenges. It envisions formulating joint industrial zones and traffic networks along the eastern and western coastal areas including by reopening the now closed Kaesong industrial park and Mount Kumkang, which critics say would help fatten Kim’s coffers and may breach international sanctions.Within the military, the government laid out reform plans under which the Joint Chiefs of Staff would transform into the tentatively named Joint Military Command and scale back the total number of troops to about 500,000 from the current 600,000. The administration is seeking to raise by 2022 the salaries for rank-and-file soldiers to 50 percent of the legal minimum wage, which was recently settled on 1.57 million won  a month for 2018. It will also allow the soldiers to transfer their mandate service to college credits, while expanding the female workforce and improving their working conditions.

""I think we need to approach a dialogue as a means to solve problems rather than as a reward for good behavior.... Neither the US nor South Korea should shy away from bilateral talks with North Korea,"" he added.Negroponte, who also served as director of national intelligence and ambassador to the UN, suggested the long-suspended six-party denuclearization talks might be one of the most effective options in tackling the prolonged nuclear stalemate. ""We need to have all the key regional players represented in any solution -- North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Russia, China and the US -- essentially the countries that were members of the six-party talks that took place in recent years,"" he said.""I think the six-party format or something like that has much to command it in terms of assuring that all the most important regional interests are involved.""The six-party talks started in 2003 to persuade the North to give up its nuclear aspirations but it has not been held since late 2008 when the North walked away from the negotiating table.North Korea conducted nuclear tests twice last year alone. On July 4, it claimed to have held a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, ratcheting up tensions surrounding the Korean Peninsula and drawing strong condemnation from the international community. South Korea recently offered to hold inter-Korean military talks on Friday to ease tensions along the tense border and Red Cross talks on Aug. 1 to resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.

The young ruler sent an “urgent directive” to the country’s overseas diplomatic missions while the Group of 20 conference was taking place in Germany on July 7-8, Japan’s Asahi Shimbun reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with North Korea affairs. It called for an initiation of negotiations for a peace treaty with the US by injecting conviction that it is “impossible” for Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program.“The Moon Jae-in administration is providing a golden opportunity for us. Before hostile forces cause a stir, we must realize our duty of reunification,” Kim was quoted as saying in the text.  This image captured from North Korea`s official Korea Central Television shows leader Kim Jong-un speaking at an award ceremony on July 13 for officials involved in the country`s test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4. The report could not be verified immediately. But if confirmed, it may indicate Pyongyang’s intention to take advantage of Moon’s pursuit of a recovery of inter-Korean communication channels and dialogue. The regime could also seek to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington, given the Donald Trump administration’s skepticism about the possibility for meaningful progress on denuclearization talks. As of Wednesday afternoon, Pyongyang remains mum about Seoul’s proposal on Monday for military and humanitarian talks.

The agreement forged under then-President Park Geun-hye was met with widespread public criticism, with many calling into question its legality and the sincerity of Japan's apology.In May, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a telephone conversation that most South Korean people could not ""emotionally"" accept the deal, strongly hinting at a possible renegotiation.The South Korean government also plans to launch an institute dedicated to research on Japan's wartime sex crimes by 2019 and build a museum to shed light on the atrocities by 2020.

Seek ways for Samsung to contribute more to the country’s economy,” according to Cheong Wa Dae’s spokesperson Park Soo-hyun. August 2014 is nearly three months after Samsung tycoon Lee Kun-hee suffered a near-fatal heart attack. He is currently still hospitalized. It is also one month before former President Park had a one-on-one meeting with Lee’s only son and Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong. Special prosecutor Park Young-soo, investigating the former president’s alleged corruption, attempted to search Cheong Wa Dae on suspicions of money-for-political favors deals between the then-state chief and major conglomerates, including Samsung, but couldn’t gain access due to the office’s rejection of the request. The former president, as well as the Samsung heir, is currently on trial on suspicion that Samsung provided bribes, disguised as donations and sports sponsorship, in return for the administration’s support of the group’s succession plan. August 2014 is also when Woo Byung-woo, pinpointed as a key figure in the former president’s scandal, was in charge of the civil affairs office at the Cheong Wa Dae.

A secondary boycott is intended to penalize third-country firms for doing business with the North. It has been cited as one of the most effective ways to force China to join global efforts to pressure the North given their close ties both in diplomatic and business areas. Her remarks came days after the North claimed on Tuesday that it successfully test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States. The latest provocation drew strong condemnation from the world and sending the international community scrambling to take tough countermeasures against its regime. The efforts to punish the North through the United Nations Security Council, however, appear to be facing a bumpy road as China and Russia apparently do not want to go as tough as the US and other countries. Observers say that it could take a long time before producing a consensus.  ""The US seems to be trying to maximize its economic sanctions  either through the United Nations Security Council or on its own,"" Kang said. ""If the outcome of the UNSC negotiations is not satisfactory, I think that the US could explore its own unilateral sanctions.""Kang assured lawmakers that the US surely will work with South Korea should it decide to seek to impose its own sanctions against the North.She also expressed willingness to consider pursuing ministerial talks with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho at the Associaton of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum in the Philippines slated for early next month. The ASEAN regional forum is almost the only multilateral summit that Pyongyang takes part. With regard to the apparent differences among the US, China, Russia and Japan on how to respond to the North's continued provocations, Kang noted that the four global powers along with South Korea have the same objective of ""completely"" dismantling its nuclear program. ""I think that there might be a little bit of differences in terms of methods of how to reach the objective,"" she said.

He explained that some 41 percent of the communist state, and among them 28 percent of the children under five years old, suffer from malnutrition, quoting data from this year’s UNICEF report.Only a day before Moon’s departure for Germany, North Korea launched yet another missile, claiming that the projectile was its first intercontinental ballistic missile.His statement goes in line with his more flexible approach to Pyongyang. Moon has reiterated on numerous occasions that his administration will seek dialogue while continuing with the sanctions.On Thursday, he unveiled a “comprehensive” approach in his address in Berlin that seeks to tackle the issue of denuclearization and promote a peace treaty at the same time. The South Korean president also stressed the role of World Health Organization as he addressed the global issues related to new infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. In the global forum, he revealed the plans to donate $100 million to 13 countries by 2020. “We need to increase our support for the nations that lack in medical treatments.

The trilateral summit, held at the US Consulate General over dinner, was Moon’s first official event since arriving in Hamburg after his initial two-day stay in capital Berlin.“Today’s summit dinner served as an opportunity for the three states to reconfirm their will for cooperation concerning North Korea’s nuclear, based on the momentum of the successful Korea-US summit last week,” Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said in a briefing.Attending the event alongside Moon were Kang, Deputy Prime Minister for economic affairs Kim Dong-yeon and National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong.“The trilateral summit dinner came in the wake of the United Nations Security Council’s urgent meeting concerning North Korea’s launch of a ballistic missile,” Kang explained.“Sharing the view that a joint response is needed, the three leaders spent most of their time on North Korea and its nuclear problem.”The reclusive regime launched another missile on Tuesday, the day before Moon set out for Germany, and touted it as an intercontinental ballistic missile which could hit the US mainland.“The three summits agreed that a priority issue is to deter the North’s further advancement in loading nuclear warheads on missiles,” Kang said.Seeking to increase pressure upon the North Korean regime and its leader Kim Jong-un, the three counterparts agreed that a stronger UN Security Council resolution should be adopted on the issue.The US proposed a UNSC resolution as part of “significant measures” against the North’s ICBM launch but was met with opposition from Russia, according to AP. China, a key ally to North Korea, has not officially voiced its complaint.Expressing regret at what they saw as connivance of North Korean nuclear development, the three countries in Thursday's meeting called for China and Russia to take more active roles.President Moon sat in a bilateral summit with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping earlier in the day in Berlin and is set to meet with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Friday afternoon.Trump and Abe are also expected to respectively attend a bilateral meeting with the Chinese leader during the two-day G-20 summit period.As for the burgeoning concerns on possible military clashes, however, the foreign minister denied, reiterating the president’s remark on a gradual, peaceful road map.“The US called for a ‘peaceful pressure campaign’ which means that a peaceful solution may prevent the introduction of military options,” Kang said.What the three summits, especially the US, did have in mind was the possibility of additional financial pressure upon the reclusive regime.President Trump also mentioned that the US is working on increasing the level of financial sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals that hold illicit transactions with North Korea, according to a senior government official who attended the trilateral summit.The three-party summit was confirmed last Thursday, during Moon's visit to Washington for his bilateral summit with Trump.By Bae Hyun-jungKorea Herald correspondent","stronger sanctions on korea ,donald trump and japanese ,in hamburg on thursday ,sanctions on korea hamburg ,negotiating table president moon","['hamburg', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Japan', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae -', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Hamburg', 'Group of 20', 'Ge']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.3767516   0.56062269

He will return to Seoul early next Monday morning.Moon’s trip to the European state comes just two days after his return from a summit with US President Donald Trump in Washington. President Moon Jae-in, along with first lady Kim Jung-sook, on Sunday returns to Seoul from his summit with US counterpart Donald Trump in Washington. “The G-20 summit will be President Moon’s first experience in multinational diplomacy so the most important thing is  to make acquaintance with various counterparts,” said an official of Cheong Wa Dae.“As for key partner states, he will have the chance to build friendship and trust through individual meetings.”This year’s G-20 summit, titled “Shaping an Interconnected World,” is to take place on Friday-Saturday to deal with global issues related to global economic growth, international trade and financial market regulation.Other issues which are closely linked with economic agendas -- climate change, labor policy, digital technology and counter-terrorism -- will also be laid out for discussion.On the sidelines of the main event, Moon is to spare a large part of his time and effort on China, Japan and the US. All three states have a stake in the Korean Peninsula’s core agendas, such as North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations, the consequential US anti-missile defense system or the settlement of Japan’s past wartime atrocities.The first of them is likely to be a bilateral summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping to take place Thursday morning in Berlin, with final details yet under discussion, according to National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong.The two countries have for some time been at odds over Seoul and Washington’s decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense on the Korean Peninsula so as to respond to plausible military offenses from the North.The Korea-China summit will then be followed by a trilateral dinner summit of Moon, Trump and their Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Hamburg.“The two leaders affirmed that trilateral security and defense cooperation contribute to enhanced deterrence and defense against the North Korean threat,” said the joint statement adopted by Moon and Trump in Washington last week.Moon will also meet with Japanese Prime Minister Abe in a bilateral talk on the following day, seeking to discuss in further details the North Korean nuclear issue and the trilateral talks involving China, according to the Blue House on Tuesday.One of their crucial topics is likely to be their disparity over the disputed 2015 deal on wartime sex slaves, which President Moon and his new Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha have been gesturing at revising.Moon will then meet with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the same day afternoon, as well as state chiefs of India, France and Australia on the following day, according to ChungBefore heading for Hamburg for the G-20 and the set of summits, Moon will spend the first two days of his trip in Berlin, to respectively meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.He is also slated to deliver a speech at the local Korber Foundation dealing with peninsular peace, inter-Korean relationships and unification issues.Speculations have been escalating that the president may issue an official statement there, to announce an end to the North Korean policies adopted by his two conservative predecessors and to vow for a peaceful paradigm for the peninsula.The late former President Kim Dae-jung, one of Moon’s liberal predecessors, had announced his Berlin Declaration in 2000, a stance that later led to the first-ever inter-Korean summit and a joint peace declaration.By Bae Hyun-jung","leave wednesday for germany ,attend 20 summit president ,monday morning moon trip ,20 summit president moon ,wednesday for germany on","['Moon Jae - in', 'Germany', 'Group of 20', 'US', 'Japan', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Moon ’s', 'european', 'US Presid']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80725485  0.86802286

However, a joint statement issued after the summit said the two sides ""further committed to foster a truly fair and level playing field"" without mentioning the renegotiation of the trade deal.On Saturday, Moon told South Korean correspondents in Washington that any talk of the renegotiation of the free trade deal is ""outside of the agreement"" he reached in summit talks with Trump.South Korea will closely look into the matter and take measures, a trade ministry official here said, noting Trump's intention over the free trade deal is not clear.During and after the talks with Moon, Trump vowed to seek a new trade pact with South Korea, blaming the current deal for enlarging American deficits. Trump said the trade deal has been rough for the US, noting that the US trade deficit with South Korea has increased by more than $11 billion between 2011, a year before the free trade deal went into effect, and last year.Lee Dong-bok, a senior official at the Korea International Trade Association, said Seoul and Washington could find common ground in partly amending the free trade deal in case the two sides renegotiate. He also said the US appears likely to address an imbalance in bilateral auto and steel trade.The association said an imbalance in bilateral trade stems from differences in economic and industrial structures between South Korea and the US, not from the free trade deal.The association noted manufacturing is the mainstay of South Korea's economy, and the growing US demand for imports amid its economic recovery is to blame for the trade gap.","us president donald trump ,trade deal south korea ,washington are renegotiating trade ,president donald trump said ,on friday that seoul","['South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Washington']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.65432376  0.77786648

The two leaders met for the first time in a welcoming dinner at the White House ahead of their official summit, slated for Friday. According to Cheong Wa Dae, Moon and Trump exchanged “very frank” views on a wide range of issues in Korea-US relations with “majority of issues raised” being mentioned. South Korean President Moon Jae-in  shakes hands with US President Donald Trump as he and his wife, Kim Jung-sook, arrived at the White House on June 29, 2017, for a dinner hosted by Trump and his wife, Melania, on the eve of the first Korea-US summit under the countries` new administrations. “Throughout the meeting, the two leaders’ conversation was serious and frank, and many issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula were discussed,” Yoon young-chan, chief press secretary to Moon, said.“The conversation was somewhat tense at the start, but as it progressed the tone became more amicable.” Officially, the summit is aimed at building trust and personal relations between the two leaders. However, a host of difficult issues ranging from North Korea and the deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system, and the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement have been mentioned as possible sticking points of the summit. The dinner was followed shortly by a tweet from Trump that prompted speculations that the Korea-US FTA could be up for a retune. In his latest tweet, Trump said that had just finished “a very good meeting” with Moon where many subjects were discussed “including North Korea and new trade deal!”Seoul’s presidential office, however, declined to elaborate.While Cheong Wa Dae focused on the overall tone of the meeting, emphasizing the friendly atmosphere, the outspoken character of the US leader displayed in the tweet was apparent from the start. President Moon Jae-in  meets with US President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, DC on Thursday. “I know you‘ve been discussing with our people some of the complexities of North Korea and trade and other things, and we’ll be discussing them all as we progress, and it could be very well late into the evening,” Trump was quoted as saying by US media. Trump was referring to Moon’s meetings with leaders of the Congress, held earlier in the day where he reiterated the goal of denuclearizing the North, saying that a solution was “likelier than ever” with Trump in office. “As it is a matter of top priority for President Trump, the possibility of resolving the issue is higher than ever. In the past, South Korea and the US placed importance in the matter but did not take concrete action.  plan to seek fundamental solutions with President Trump,” Moon said during his meeting with House of Representatives’ leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan. At the meeting, Moon also said that while China has had positive influence on Pyongyang in missile and nuclear issues, Beijing’s role in the issue has room to grow. Moon also ruled out resuming inter-Korean business projects without positive developments in the nuclear issue, reflecting his idea of “action for action” in dealing with the North. “Kaesong Industrial Complex and Mount Kumgang tours had the effect of educating  that market economy, and  South Korea is better,” Moon said. “However, the projects cannot be easily resumed.  can only be discussed when serious talks on ending the North’s nuclear program begins, and it must be considered within the framework of international cooperation, and requires close negotiations with the US.” Tours to Mount Kumgang was suspended in 2008 when a South Korean tourist was shot and killed by a North Korean soldier, and the Kaesong complex has been idle since early 2016.Moon’s visit leading up to the summit has been met with praise, but experts say that both sides have much riding on the summit, which comes at a difficult time.“This is a high-stakes visit, given the escalating tensions with North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and the signs of a divergence between the Moon and Trump administrations over how to deal with the North,” Alexander Vershbow, a distinguished fellow of the US think-tank Atlantic Council and former US ambassador to Korea. “One encouraging sign: President Moon Jae-in has taken steps in the lead-up to the visit to downplay differences surrounding the deployment of THAAD missile defense systems, which are vital for deterring North Korean aggression and protecting US troops stationed in the Republic of Korea.” Vershbow also projected that Moon and Trump would have difficulties seeing eye-to-eye on North Korea. Moon hopes to engage North Korea provided that Pyongyang cooperates in denuclearization efforts, while Washington considers similar approaches of past Seoul governments as an “utter failure” Vershbow said.By Choi He-suk Korea Herald correspondent","trump exchanged very frank ,at dinner in washington ,moon and trump exchanged ,pending issues at dinner ,washington president moon jae","['WASHINGTON', 'Moon Jae - in', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Washington', 'the White House', 'Moon', 'Trump']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68235838  0.65525782

The seals will be sent back home aboard the presidential jet when President Moon Jae-in heads back from Washington on Saturday, they said.The Royal Seal of Queen Munjeong is a gilt bronze seal made in the second year of King Myeongjong in 1547 to honor Queen Munjeong , the third wife of Joseon Dynasty's 11th King Jungjong. The Royal Seal of King Hyeonjong was created in 1651 to mark the installation of Hyeonjong as the crown prince of King Hyojong. The two seals have a square body with a turtle-shaped knob, but the latter one made of jade is slightly bigger.The two Korean artifacts were unlawfully carried out of the country at an unknown time and handed over to an American citizen living in Los Angeles. He sold the Royal Seal of Queen Munjeong to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2000 while keeping the seal of King Hyeonjong in his possession.The Homeland Security Investigations of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement seized them in September 2013 following the request from South Korea's Cultural Heritage Administration to investigate the circumstances surrounding the two artifacts. In July 2014, the CHA confirmed the authenticity of the two royal seals in the US But it took three years before the items could be transferred to South Korea through domestic legal procedures in the US.","looted korean royal seals ,looted korean royal ,ancient korean royal seals ,washington two ancient korean ,war officials said thursday","['WASHINGTON', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'the Royal Seal', 'Queen Munjeong', 'the Royal Seal of King Hyeonjong', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Washington']",26,"[ 3.          1.          0.         ... -0.34957618  0.76965982

The survey was conducted via phone on 1,000 adults aged 19 or older during June 1-3. It was unveiled days before President Moon is to meet his US counterpart Donald Trump in Washington later this week. ""This is a very significant change compared to the previous survey done in November last year in which as much as 64 percent of those polled expressed concerns about the bilateral relations,"" the research said in a report.The report attributed the higher level of optimism to the hopes that many South Koreans are pinning on the new president who took office in May.Of those polled, 30.6 percent said that the main focus during the upcoming summit between the allies should be placed on ""building trust,"" followed by 24.9 percent and 20.1 percent saying that economic cooperation and coordination against North Korea should be the top priority, respectively.About 19 percent cited the controversial issue of the deployment of the US missile defense system known as THAAD in South Korea should be the most important agenda item during the summit. Meanwhile, with regard to the THAAD issue in particular, 55 percent expressed support for its installation, but 63.7 percent said that it requires parliamentary endorsement.","five south koreans expect ,government survey showed monday ,koreans optimistic about relations ,of five south koreans ,five south koreans","['South Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Moon Jae -', 'the Asan Institute', 'South Korea', 'US', 'EPA']",26,"[ 2.          1.          0.         ... -0.52431852  0.83135766

The two countries are technically still at war after the 1950-53 war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon ""The international community is outraged about the latest death of American Warmbier,"" Lee said. ""North Korea should come forward for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and respect human rights."" Otto Warmbier, 22, died after he was flown to the United States following 17 months of detention for taking down a political propaganda sign from a hotel during a trip. There are three more Americans held in North Korea. Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old Korean-American, was arrested in 2015 and sentenced to 10 years of hard labor on charges of espionage and subversion.The two others, Kim Hak-song and Kim Sang-dok, were taken into custody earlier this year. They worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in North Korea.Pyongyang is also holding six South Koreans including three missionaries and one pastor.According to Japanese new media, the North is known to have asked the US to send one of its former presidents as an envoy for a negotiation to release the detainees. The US, however, sent Joseph Yun, US Special Representative for North Korea Policy, and brought Warmbier back home.","korea to free detainees ,stop developing its nuclear ,college student who died ,sunday urged north korea ,coma during ceremony marking","['Lee Nak - yon', 'North Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Americans', 'american', 'Lee', 'Pyongyang']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.27770931  0.66277349

For the DPRK, for us to engage in talks with the DPRK, they would have to denuclearize. And that is not something we're seeing them take any steps to do,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a briefing on June 16.DPRK is the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.North Korea is seeking to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile  capable of hitting the US mainland. It has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006 and fired numerous ballistic missiles.Conditions for dialogue have not been created with Seoul and Washington focusing on applying sanctions and pressure against the North.The latest death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was detained in North Korea until recently, lent support to voices in Washington arguing for a tougher stance toward Pyongyang. Warmbier was released in a coma on June 13 after 17 months of captivity.North Korea's top envoy to India Kye Chun-yong said Wednesday that North Korea can place a moratorium on its nuclear and missile tests if the US suspends its annual joint military drills with South Korea.It marked the first time that the North raised the possibility of the conditional suspension of its provocations since Moon took office in May.

""Kye's suggestion means the North has no intention to give up its nuclear weapons.""Both Moon and Trump stressed China's role in reining in North Korea as Beijing has leverage over Pyongyang as the main remaining ally and economic benefactor.""I believe China is making efforts to stop North Korea from making additional provocations, yet there are no tangible results as of yet,"" Moon said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.Trump recently said on Twitter that he appreciates China's efforts to pressure the North, but it has not worked out.""At the upcoming summit, Moon and Trump are expected to reaffirm a stern response to North Korea's threats,"" said Cheong at the Sejong Institute.

The government’s attitude has posed a substantial obstacle to the foundation‘s efforts to save ailing patients, prompting it to mull moving its headquarters overseas, its founder and chairman Stephen Linton said.Stephen Linton “If the government continues to tie humanitarian aid with politics and North Korean provocations, then we have no choice but to discontinue the project -- at least in South Korea,” he said at a news conference in Seoul. “We are even considering relocating our Seoul headquarters to another country, but our patients in North Korea prefer treatment supplies from South Korea over international organizations.“It would be heartbreaking to end the tradition that has lasted for more than 20 years since 1995 under South Korea’s unjust regulations.”With many North Koreans exposed to malnutrition, infectious diseases and adverse living conditions, civic groups at home and abroad have been carrying out relief programs. They are required to obtain the Unification Ministry’s approval to visit the North or communicate with its nationals. Amid a flare-up in tension last year, Eugene Bell was the only entity to have managed to secure the ministry‘s endorsement, thanks chiefly to its nature as an international organization. Established in 1995, the organization launched a specialized medical program to combat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 2007 upon the request of North Korea. It has recently returned from a three-week visit to assist its 12 tuberculosis centers scattered around the reclusive state, including Pyongyang and Kaesong. Linton suggested the Moon administration transform the current one-off approval system into a more institutionalized one under which it grants relief groups licenses and keeps tabs on aid supplies on a regular basis. “If the organization is not involved in any wrongdoing in North Korea and presents South Korea in a positive light, then the visitation rights to the North should be granted more flexibly,” he said. “If we continue to sit and wait for a better world to come, these people will all die -- why can’t we send them to treatment centers because of political interests?”He also took issue about the government’s demand for sensitive information after visits to the North, which could erode the organization‘s hard-won trust with Pyongyang authorities. “The South Korean government also asks us to submit private reports on our businesses and patients, but we have no legal authority over such documents -- the reports belong to the North Korean health ministry and the patients themselves,” Linton added. In response, Seoul‘s Unification Ministry reiterated its stance that it will pursue humanitarian assistance in a way that does not breach any international sanctions against the North. ”Our position remains unchanged that the current severance in inter-Korean relations is not desirable in ensuring stability on the peninsula, so that we will continue approving civilian exchanges within the extent that does not damage the sanctions framework,” deputy ministry spokesperson Lee Yoo-jin said at a regular news briefing on Friday.By Jung Min-kyung","thursday called for seoul ,reluctant to grant relief ,political consideration south korea ,north korea on thursday ,seoul to allow humanitarian","['the Eugene Bell Foundation', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'north‘s']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.30991918  0.28834638

He received 15 years in prison with hard labor for subversion after he tearfully confessed that he had tried to steal a propaganda banner.He was medically evacuated from North Korea and arrived in Cincinnati late Tuesday. His father, Fred Warmbier, told Fox News that his son was “terrorized and brutalized” and has been in a coma for more than a year.

Pyongyang fired multiple surface-to-ship cruise missiles from its east coast early in the day, in its fifth round of provocation since Moon was sworn in about a month ago, prompting him to preside over a meeting of the National Security Council for the first time.  President Moon Jae-in presides over a plenary meeting of the National Security Council at Cheong Wa Dae Thursday after North Korea fired missiles. “Through such a provocation, North Korea will only gain international isolation and economic difficulties, while losing the opportunity to develop,” the president was quoted as saying at the session, according to Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun. “I declare that our government will never take a step back nor compromise over national security and the people’s safety.” The North’s ongoing series of missile experiments is casting a shadow on the liberal leader’s vision for reconciliation with the communist neighbor. The South’s nascent leadership is expected to introduce its detailed North Korea policy in the coming few months, which would top the agenda for a planned summit between Moon and his US counterpart Donald Trump later this month in Washington. While maintaining a readiness posture against any further provocations, Moon pledged to pursue sanctions and pressure in parallel with the goal of the nuclear program’s “complete dismantlement.”“Denuclearization is an agreement between the two Koreas and a promise North Korea made to the international community. None of its claims would justify a contravention of that agreement and promise,” the president said. If the regime changes course and returns to the path toward denuclearization, Seoul will lead the way in rallying global support and cooperation, he said. Moon instructed related ministries to maintain close consultations with Washington and other partners in order for the international community to ensure a “stern response” to additional provocations. “At this point, it’s more important than anything else for us to find out creative and essential measures to resolve the nuclear problem,” he said. “We should gather wisdom to come up with an idea that could bring about a change in the North’s attitude and ultimately achieve a complete disarmament of its nuclear program.” By Shin Hyon-hee","moon blasts nk missile ,thursday issued stern warning ,on security president moon ,of provocation since moon ,north korea new missile","['Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Moon', 'the National Sec']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09907027  0.15014507

We will continue to work closely with the ROK Government throughout this process,"" Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency.""We have worked closely and have been fully transparent with the ROK government throughout this process. US Forces Korea confirmed in May 2017 that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is operational and has the ability to intercept North Korean missiles and defend the Republic of Korea,"" he said.During a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer said that the deployment of additional THAAD launchers will be delayed to watch an environmental assessment.""We'll go through those things that's required to meet the needs of Korea,"" he said.Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said the US will ""work through the issue.""""The THAAD is essential to protect US forces in Korea, but also South Korea as a whole and US forces in Korea are there in order to protect the entire country. So we'll work through that,"" Milley said, adding that he's confident US Forces Korea Commander Gen. Vincent Brooks and his staff ""will work through that with the government of South Korea.""The State Department said it hopes to continue close cooperation with South Korea's new government.""I'd have to refer you to the ROK regarding their assessment,"" a spokesperson for the department's East Asia and Pacific Affairs Bureau said of the South's decision to have an environmental assessment of the THAAD deployment. ""The United States and South Korea have worked closely together on Alliance issues and we look forward to continuing our close coordination with the Moon administration,"" the official said.The THAAD unit in South Korea reached its initial operational capability in late April after the US brought in two launchers in early March. Four additional launchers have since arrived in South Korea to add to the system for full deployment aimed at intercepting North Korean missile attacks.The arrival of the four additional launchers emerged as a top political issue in South Korea following revelations the Defense Ministry deliberately omitted the fact in a report to the office of new President Moon Jae-inThat raised allegations of a cover-up, with Moon expressing frustration and ordering a probe into how the omission happened. The probe determined that a senior Defense Ministry official ordered the deletion of the four launchers' arrival from the report to the presidential office.The THAAD deployment has become more unpopular in South Korea as the public raised questions about decisions made by former President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and then ultimately ousted from office on corruption charges. It was when Park was in office that Seoul decided to host the system.Her successor, Moon, has also been critical of the decision, saying it was made without due process to collect public opinion.US President Donald Trump fueled opposition to THAAD among the South Korean public by demanding Seoul pay for the $1 billion system. The demand runs counter to a deployment agreement under which the US agreed to pay for the system if the South agreed to host it and provide land.","wednesday after seoul suspended ,said wednesday after seoul ,environmental assessment seoul presidential ,wednesday after seoul ,seoul suspended the deployment","['WASHINGTON', 'the United States', 'South Korean', 'Pentagon', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",26,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.35093457  0.40465653

North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un allowed Catalina Devandas-Aguilar, the special rapporteur on the rights of people with disabilities, to visit Pyongyang and South Hwanghae Province.Considering the human rights situation in the North, Zeid said the visit to the North by the special rapporteur on the rights of people with disabilities doesn't make up for North Korea's lack of cooperation with the UN special rapporteur on North Korea, his office and the UN office on North Korea's human rights in South Korea.","reported wednesday voa korea ,wednesday voa korea service ,korean human rights report ,wednesday voa korea ,in geneva on tuesday","['United Nations', ""Zeid Ra'ad"", 'Al Hussein', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'north korean', 'Voice of America', 'VOA', 'Korea Service', 'Zeid', ""the UN Human Rights Council 's"", 'Geneva']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.33484209  0.46637183

South Korean people are still split over whether THAAD is a must for the defense of the country against North Korea's missile threats.The US Forces Korea has already stationed two THAAD interceptor launchers, together with a state-of-the-art X-band radar, at a former golf course in Seongju, about 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, under the 2016 deal.The USFK and South Korea's military said the THAAD system could reach full operational capability within this year.Earlier this week, however, Moon expressed displeasure after belatedly learning that four more launchers already in South Korea are waiting to be bought to the THAAD site.After an investigation ordered by Moon, the presidential office said Han's ministry intentionally concealed the presence of the additional launchers in the country.Moon also apparently suspects that THAAD equipment is being deployed with an incomplete or flawed joint environmental survey of the site.Moon's office, Cheong Wa Dae, said it's focusing on addressing issues related to domestic procedures and it does not want the move to spill over into any diplomatic dispute.","meet bilaterally on saturday ,friday he will clarify ,minister to clarify seoul ,bilaterally on saturday ,min koo said friday","['SINGAPORE', 'south korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'US', 'Defense', 'Jim Mattis', 'Singapore', 'Han', 'Moon Jae - in', 'US']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49705115  0.64227283

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system was at the center of new controversy Tuesday when the presidential office confirmed that four launchers, in addition to the two deployed in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, had been brought into the country. In disclosing the information, the presidential office revealed that the Ministry of National Defense and the Park Geun-hye administration’s national security advisers had not relayed the information.Members of the ruling Democratic Party`s special panel on the deployment of a US missile defense program hold a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on June 1, 2017. Accusing the Defense Ministry of hiding information, the Democratic Party vowed a thorough investigation through the proposed hearing. The party is said to be considering putting Minister of National Defense Han Min-koo, Minister of Foreign Affairs Yun Byung-se and former National Security Council chief Kim Kwan-jin on the stand. “It must be revealed who ordered the information about six THAAD launchers to be deleted and what the motive was,” the party said, calling the allegedly intentional omission “mutiny.”“Former acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, Kim and Han  take responsibility.” The committee’s chief, Rep. Shim Jae-kwon, said that the committee did not discuss the issue with the presidential office and the party, but he believes President Moon Jae-in and party leaders would share similar views. Regarding the timing of the hearing, Shim said that the committee hopes to open the hearing at the earliest possible date, but added it would be unlikely during the June parliamentary session. On Wednesday, the presidential office announced that its probe into the issue determined that the Defense Ministry deliberately omitted related information in briefing the new administration on May 26.According to Cheong Wa Dae, the Defense Ministry’s draft report included the phrases “six launchers” and “stored at a camp” that were later deleted. The probe also found that the defense minister indirectly denied knowledge of the matter when questioned by National Security Council chief Chung Eui-yong on Sunday. Han has since denied any involvement in the process of the report being compiled and said that Chung may have misunderstood him during their conversation. Meanwhile, the main opposition Liberty Korea Party is attempting to turn the issue against the presidential office and the ruling party. Speaking to reporters at the National Assembly, Liberty Korea Party Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik said that the Defense Ministry and Cheong Wa Dae engaging in a game of truth was “comedy” and that the ruling party was making a rash move. “ is not under consideration.  is acting inappropriately,  could reveal state secrets and damage Korea-US alliance,” Chung said. The People’s Party went a step further, accusing the administration of incompetence and of attempting to use the issue to cover political issues. “Raising a fuss over issues that have been reported by the media shows the Moon Jae-in administration’s incompetence,” said Rep. Park Joo-sun, the interim leader of the People’s Party. “THAAD is the biggest diplomatic issue in Korea-US and Korea-China relations. President Moon’s actions regarding national security and diplomatic issues are amateurish.”By Choi He-suk","of new controversy tuesday ,tuesday when the presidential ,parties accused the presidential ,new controversy tuesday ,of korea said thursday","['Democratic Party of Korea', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46974483  0.44098321

242,242,NK leader inspects test-fire of new anti-aircraft weapon,"North Korea's leader has recently inspected the test-fire of a new type of anti-aircraft guided weapon system, ordering its mass-production and deployment to bolster its air supremacy, Pyongyang's state media said Sunday.

The Korean Central News Agency said Kim Jong-un watched ""the successful test"" organized by the Academy of National Defence Science, without revealing the date and location.This photo carried by the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea`s main newspaper, on May 5, 2017, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  inspecting military detachments on two islets in waters off the country`s southwest front.  Kim told the Korean People's Army officials and those at the academy that the weapon system's capability has been upgraded compared with last year in terms of efficiency to detect and track targets, as well as strike accuracy, according to the KCNA. Kim previously guided the test of an anti-air guided weapon system in April 2016, and the latest test appears to be focusing on improving its surface-to-air guided missiles deployed last year.""Some defects in the weapon system, discovered last year, were perfectly overcome to stand the test,"" Kim was quoted as saying in English by the KCNA. ""This weapon system, whose operation capability has been thoroughly verified, should be mass-produced to deploy in all over the country like forests so as to completely spoil the enemy's wild dream to command the air, boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty.""Kim also emphasized that the communist nation should also pursue the development of a ""next generation"" anti-aircraft guided weapon system, according to the KCNA. The KCNA said Kim was accompanied by Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of the KPA, and Ri Yong-gil, vice chief of the KPA general staff.Given North Korea's state media usually reports Kim's inspections a day after they actually take place, the test of the weapon system is believed to have been conducted Saturday. It also comes after Pyongyang claimed a South Korean military unmanned aerial vehicle violated its airspace.The KCNA previously reported that the South's surveillance plane, called the Heron, flew over its western border area four times between 7:46 a.m. and 8:40 p.m. Friday.Military experts here said the surface-to-air missile tested appears to be the KN-06 with a maximum range of 150 kilometers, after analyzing photos released by Rodong Sinmun, an official daily of the North's ruling Workers' Party. They added that the latest test may have been conducted in South Hamkyong Province in the North's northeastern area, where the weapon was tested in 2016.North Korea first unveiled the KN-06 system during a military parade to mark the 65th founding anniversary of the Workers' Party in October 2010. It was also observed at a military parade on April 15 this year to mark the 105th birthday of late state founder Kim Il-sung.The Rodong Sinmun reported that the KN-06, considered the most powerful surface-to-air missile that North Korea possess, hit various flying objects in the air that were hypothetically designed as UAVs and rockets. The KN-06 system is an air defense system that mainly strike aircraft, but experts said it's still unclear whether the weapon can intercept ballistic missiles.","leader inspects test fire ,said sunday the korean ,aircraft weapon north korea ,of new anti aircraft ,state media said sunday","[""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Academy of National Defence Science']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.57119739  0.80599964

Joseph Yun, special representative for North Korea policy at the US State Department, introduced the plan to a group of visiting lawmakers led by Rep. Kim Kwan-young of the minor opposition People’s Party. The department established four principles on North Korea: it will not recognize the communist country as a nuclear weapons state; impose all available sanctions and pressure; pursue no regime change; and resolve the problem through dialogue. The guidelines reflect the department’s efforts to flesh out the so-called “maximum pressure and engagement” policy line unveiled earlier. US President Donald Trump approved a comprehensive report detailing the strategy about two weeks ago, Kim quoted Yun as saying. While leaving open the possibility for talks, Yun stressed the current focus should stay on sanctions and pressure and that there would be no dialogue before Pyongyang shifts its attitude toward denuclearization. “The department officials questioned the possibility that the North would agree to talks, saying we should continue the sanctions campaign given no change in the North’s position,” the lawmaker told reporters in Washington. This may indicate possible future discord between Seoul and Washington, with President Moon Jae-in looking to a restart of inter-Korean dialogue and economic and humanitarian exchanges including the Kaesong industrial park and tours to Kumkangsan. The lawmakers also expressed concerns about the confusion in South Korea over the ongoing deployment here of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. Moon has pledged to seek parliamentary approval for the program but his ruling Democratic Party of Korea remains opposed to it. “It seemed if the THAAD dispute escalates to the extent where the deployment decision may be reversed, the US officials would take it very seriously,” Kim said, noting that if put up for a vote, the plan will likely pass. “The US officials apparently didn’t understand why we debate about a defensive weapon,” said Rep. Jun Hee-kyung of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party. Democratic Party Rep. So Byung-hoon conveyed skepticism among US academics toward a resumption of the Kaesong and Kumkangsan initiatives in the face of North Korea’s provocations and nuclear development. “Some of those at think tanks were very negative about their restart, asking what economic benefits South Korea would gain from that,” So said. By Shin Hyon-hee","korean lawmakers said thursday ,until talks lawmakers washington ,lawmakers said thursday joseph ,pressure until talks lawmakers ,nuclear standoff through dialogue","['Washington', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Joseph Yun', 'North Korea', 'the US State Department']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.54619777  0.57427192

It is also the principles of the UN to  it separately from any political considerations, and I think that we should do so,"" Kang told reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul.Kang Kyung-wha  Kang made the remarks upon returning home from New York. She had worked at the United Nations for about 10 years.Asked whether she believes humanitarian aid to the North should be provided despite Pyongyang's continued provocations and nuclear aspirations, she said yes, adding that it is in line with the spirit and principles of the UN to extend help to those in need. Since liberal President Moon took office May 10, there has been a change in mood regarding providing help and assistance to the impoverished Northern neighbor.Moon has said that he will push for a ""two-track"" approach toward the North in which he seeks sanctions against provocations and at the same time engagement and dialogue aimed at tackling the nuclear stalemate.In line with Moon's policy, she said, ""Should there be additional provocations, I think more powerful sanctions are needed.""She didn't go into details, saying she will share her thoughts on major pending issues, including the North's nuclear and missile threats after studying more.Kang's nomination, announced Sunday, came as a surprise as she, if confirmed, would be the first female foreign minister in South Korea and also the first time in 14 years in which the ministry would be headed by a person who didn't start as a career diplomat.Kang is known for having in-depth understanding of human rights as she worked at the UN for years in relevant fields. But some critics worry that she lacks experience in handling the North's nuclear and other major challenges.She dismissed the concerns, saying that she had experience in dealing with the North and its nuclear problem up close when she served as an interpreter for three years for the late President Kim Dae-jung known for his ""sunshine policy"" of engaging the North.Asked about her stance on a controversial deal that South Korea and Japan reached in 2015 to put an end to their long-running row over the ""comfort women"" issue, Kang didn't respond, only to say that she needs to ""study"" major diplomatic issues.Comfort women refer to the victims, mostly Korean women, who were forced into front-line brothels for Japanese troops before and during World War II. Japan ruled Korea from 1910-45.In December 2015, the Asian neighbors reached a deal to resolve the long-running dispute once and for all. Under the deal, Tokyo expressed an apology and agreed to donated 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to help the victims.It still has ignited protests in Korea with critics doubting the sincerity of Japan's apology and claiming that it was hastily arranged without sufficiently seeking the opinions of victims. They called for its nullification.In a telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after his inauguration, President Moon made clear that most South Koreans cannot accept it emotionally.Kang's nomination has beefed up expectations that the government would seek to renegotiate the deal given her career mostly focused on human rights.Her confirmation hearing will likely be held in mid-June at the latest though parliamentary approval is not required.Family issues, such as her daughter's dual nationality and a fake residential registration, mostly used in Korea for a favorable school assignment for children, are expected to be targets of attacks during the hearing. Kang said that she will provide detailed explanations on such issues during the upcoming hearing. The nominee will start preparations for the hearing at a temporary office set up in central Seoul right away, government sources said.Later in the day, Kang said she will meet with the victims of Japan's sexual enslavement, suggesting her interest in the human rights issue.""During my last vacation here, I tried, but failed to meet with  ... I'm certainly going to make it when there's a chance,"" she told reporters on her way to her office set up to prepare for the parliamentary hearing.","powerful sanctions against north ,top diplomat said thursday ,sanctions against north korea ,provocations incheon president moon ,seek more powerful sanctions","['INCHEON', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'North Korea']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.58287287  0.59710485

Several objects were detected breaching the Military Demarcation Line near Cheorwon Country, Gangwon Province, between 5 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, inducing the South Korean Army to broadcast warnings and then fire hundreds of rounds of K-3 machine gun, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.South Korean Defense Ministry`s spokesman Moon Sang-gyun “Based on various monitoring equipment we assess that they were North Korean instruments designed to spray anti-South leaflets,” ministry spokesperson Moon Sang-kyun said at a news briefing. “The objects appeared to assume the form of balloons, and most of them were moving from west to east according to the direction of the wind before they disappeared.” Shortly after the incident, speculation aroused the objects may possibly be unnamed aerial vehicles flying in from the North, which have in the past fueled criticism over Seoul’s lax air defense. The military said it had trouble making its initial assessment due to bad weather conditions. The JCS also dismissed the possibility that the balloons were launched by South Korean civic groups, citing its radar imagery that showed different looks -- North Koreans typically use round bags, unlike the South‘s rod-shaped ones. On Monday night, a group of South Korean activists flew 10 balloons carrying about 300,000 anti-Pyongyang flyers, 2,000 US dollar bills and 500 booklets from Paju, Gyeonggi Province. ”In addition to the balloons’ sphere form and irregular movment, we witnessed their explosion, as well as the fallen leaflets afterward,” a JCS official told reporters on condition of anonymity, noting the devices were apparently designed as self-destructive. North Korea has long been sending propaganda leaflets toward the South, even after the inauguration of President Moon Jae-in, who signaled a shift in Seoul‘s approach toward dialogue with Pyongyang. On May 14, South Korean police said they found about 10,000 brochures in northern Seoul which carried messages calling for “building a strong nuclear state” and “fighting against the US.”“Regardless of the government change, North Korea will continue to do what it has done before. If a similar situation occurred, we would postulate the worst-case scenario and respond as we did before by treating such objects as UAVs,” the JCS official added.By Yeo Jun-suk","leaflets against south korea ,wednesday the flying vehicles ,korean army to broadca ,tuesday inducing the south ,defense ministry said wednesday","['Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'South Korea', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'Cheorwon Country', 'Gangwon Province', 'the south korean Army']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.37285915  0.7283935

Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Liu Jieyi enters a Security Council meeting about North Korea at UN headquarters, Tuesday. The United States, Britain and France have been pushing for a new UN resolution with tougher sanctions against North Korea.But Liu said China ""first and foremost"" wants to see the six sanctions resolutions against North Korea already adopted by the council fully implemented.""Meanwhile, we should also work to reduce tension, to de-escalate and also to try to achieve denuclearization through dialogue by political and diplomatic means,"" he said. ""Dialogue should take place because we can only resolve the issue through dialogue.""The Security Council late Monday strongly condemned North Korea's ""flagrant and provocative defiance"" of UN sanctions banning ballistic missile tests and again vowed ""to closely monitor the situation and take further significant measures including sanctions.""It also welcomed efforts by council members and others to facilitate ""a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialogue"" with North Korea.Last Friday, North Korea's deputy UN ambassador Kim In Ryong told UN correspondents that the government will rapidly strengthen its nuclear strike capability as long as the United States maintains its ""hostile policy"" toward the country. He said that if the Trump administration wants peace on the Korean Peninsula it should replace the Armistice Agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War with a peace accord and halt its anti-North Korea policy, ""the root cause of all problems.""The Trump administration has said there should be no talks until North Korea takes steps toward getting rid of its nuclear arsenal. During Tuesday's Security Council meeting, members were briefed by UN political chief Jeffrey Feltman, mainly on technical aspects of the weekend launch.Uruguay's UN Ambassador Elbio Rosselli, the current council president, said it was the 11th this year ""which basically means a quantum leap and determined effort to acquire aggressive capabilities, and that is of major concern.""Japan's UN Ambassador Koro Bessho told reporters afterward that ""North Korea is acting in triumphant and emboldened manner by this most recent launch, and is now clearly demonstrating that it is determined to further bolster its nuclear build-up.""Calling the provocations ""an enormous global threat,"" he said ""the international community must not leave this total defiance of the Security Council unanswered.""Bessho said Japan hopes the council will ""strengthen the measures and strengthen the sanctions mechanism.""He said Japan is talking to the US, South Korea, and close neighbors Russia and China to make sure pressure on the North is continued ""and even strengthened so that North Korea will change its policy.""","korea on eliminating nuclear ,korean nuclear and ballistic ,un ambassador said tuesday ,north korea on eliminating ,north korea on nukes","['UNITED NATIONS', 'China', 'UN', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Liu Jieyi', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'korean']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.50955313  0.6843313

The list includes luxury products mainly related to sports and recreation, said Radio Free Asia, adding that Russia has notified the committee of its decision to limit their direct and indirect export and transportation to the North on May 3, Radio Free Asia said. Circled in red in the top photo is a glimpse of a luxury yacht that NK News, a website focused on North Korea, reported on June 18, 2013, as belonging to the country`s leader Kim Jong-un. The photo released by the North`s Korean Central News Agency is dated May 28 when Kim toured a military fisheries facility. According to NK News, Kim used the US$7 million yacht for the 10-day tour of the east coast in May. The bottom photo is a Princess 95MY, the model presumably owned by Kim. Among the banned products are all kinds of yachts, crystal glassware products, rowboats, canoes, snowmobiles and billiard-related products, according to the broadcaster. Equipment related to gymnastics, athletics, table tennis and swimming, jewelry and all kinds of watches decorated with jewels are also on the list. The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1718 to punish the North's first nuclear test in 2006, and launched the sanctions committee. The resolution requires all UN member nations to not export luxury goods to the North and submit their lists of embargoed luxury goods to the committee.Russia's notification made China a sole member nation of the stalemated six-party talks on ending North Korea's nuclear ambitions which has yet to submit its embargo list.

A set of photos carried by North Korea`s main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, on May 22, 2017, shows the test-firing of a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, known as the Pukguksong-2, in North Korea.  The missile, which was fired Sunday from the country's western province, flew more than 500 kilometers, according to the South Korean military.The missile is the same type that was launched Feb. 12. The model, also known as a KN-15 missile, is an upgraded version of a submarine-launched ballistic missile and is launched using solid fuel engine.The North's leader approved the deployment of the Pukguksong-2 for action, calling it a ""successful strategic weapon,"" the KCNA said.""This type of missile should be rapidly mass-produced in a serial way"" to arm the strategic force of the Korean People's Army, Kim was quoted as saying by the report. He set forth the strategic tasks for bolstering the country's nuclear force, it added.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  The launch came just one week after the North test-fired another new mid-to-long-range missile, called the Hwasong-12, which it claims can carry a heavy nuclear warhead.The test marked North Korea's second missile launch since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office May 10.North Korea's continued missile launches are likely to test Moon, who earlier vowed to seek a dual approach to the North's denuclearization and inter-Korean dialogue. On Friday, North Korea condemned Moon's policy, saying dialogue can never be compatible with confrontation.The provocations came despite the US top diplomat's latest assurance that the US has no intention to seek a regime change in North Korea. Shrugging off what appears to be Washington's conciliatory gesture, North Korea said Saturday that it will develop and produce more powerful weapons.South Korea strongly condemned the North's missile test, calling it a ""reckless and irresponsible"" act. The United Nations Security Council will convene an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss it.North Korea has claimed that its development of nuclear weapons is a deterrent against what it calls Washington's hostile policy toward it.North Korea is seeking to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can carry a nuclear warhead and reach as far as the US mainland.The North's leader said in January that his country has entered the final stage of preparing to launch an ICBM.Experts said the North's reckless provocations seem to be aimed at seeking dialogue with the US on equal footing by strengthening its nuclear capabilities.Meanwhile, North Korea unveiled images of the Earth that it said were captured from a camera mounted on the missile's warhead.The photos are presumed to be taken when the missile was apparently re-entering the atmosphere.Technology for ""atmospheric re-entry"" is a key element in developing an ICBM as the missile needs to withstand heat and pressure when it re-enters the atmosphere from space.""The latest test appears to be aimed at securing the missile's reliability and stability for deployment after improving problems found in the February launch,"" said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Kyungnam University.","monday north korea leader ,deployment of new missile ,new missile for action ,missile for action north ,said monday north korea","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'the Korean Central News Agency']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.39629012  0.81053162

South Korea and Japan agreed to the deal in December 2015 under which Tokyo provided 1 billion yen  to support the lives of South Korean victims.

On Friday, the UN Committee against Torture said that the deal is not enough to help the victims, calling on the two sides to revise the deal to ""ensure that the surviving victims of sexual slavery during World War II are provided with redress, including the right to compensation and rehabilitation and the right to truth, reparation and assurances of non-repetitions.""""We bear in mind ,"" Cho June-hyuck, foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing. ""Relevant ministries and agencies are currently reviewing what was recommended.""Calls for renegotiating or scrapping the deal have been growing in South Korea especially since President Moon Jae-in was sworn in last week. On the campaign trail, Moon had promised to seek a renegotiation of the agreement that his impeached predecessor Park Geun-hye reached with Japan. In his telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, Moon said that most South Korean people cannot accept the sexual slavery agreement, hinting that his government might be seeking to renegotiate the controversial deal.Japan remains adamant that the deal should be respected. Japan's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women has been a thorny issue between the two Asian neighbors. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II. Around 40 surviving South Korean victims are mostly in their late 80s.","women deal south korea ,south korean victims critics ,its wartime sexual slavery ,tokyo provided billion yen ,foreign ministry said tuesday","[""South Korea 's"", 'UN', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'south korean']",26,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.61293405  0.78296983

""First, they agreed that their ultimate goal was the complete disposal of North Korean nuclear weapons. Second, they agreed to mobilize all available means, including sanctions and dialogue,"" the South Korean official said.Tuesday's meeting involved NSC's senior director for East Asia Matt Pottinger and NSC director Korea Allison Hooker. Chung Eui-yong, Seoul's former ambassador to Geneva, headed the South Korean side. Chung currently heads a special advisory group for President Moon Jae-in on security and diplomatic issues.The sides said dialogue with the communist North was possible under the right conditions, Yoon said.However, Pottinger, speaking to reporters later, said now may be not be the right time for dialogue.""Right now, we certainly do not see the right conditions in light of the provocations,"" he said.North Korea launched what is believed to be an intermediate-range missile on Sunday, prompting fresh condemnation from both Seoul and Washington, as well as the UN Security Council.""We would want to see concrete movement to reduce the threat.

""That is a settled matter,"" he said, being asked about the defense system. ""We look forward to continuing the conversation.""During his presidential campaign, Moon vowed to review the deployment decision made under his predecessor Park Geun-hye. Key elements of the THAAD battery were installed in the host county of Seongju last month and the initial operational capability has been achieved. ""I am happy to report that the status of the alliance is strong. I am fully confident that it's only going to grow stronger between our administrations,"" Pottinger added.Touching on South Korea's recent transition of power following the impeachment of the former President Park, Pottinger said, ""I really feel a sense of awe about what South Korea has achieved over the past couple of decades... South Korea makes democracy look easy.""I have to say how impressed I am with how smooth the transition is going here. It makes me a little jealous.""Pottinger arrived in Seoul for a two-day visit on Tuesday to prepare for the first meeting between the South Korean and American leaders.One day after taking office as president, Moon talked to Trump over the phone on Thursday to reaffirm the countries' alliance and close collaboration to denuclearize North Korea. Pottinger was dispatched to Seoul to follow up on the Moon-Trump talks.Moon has said he will continue to seek dialogue with North Korea to resolve the security issues stemming from the North's prohibited nuclear weapons development, a clear departure from the sanctions-only approach under Park toward North Korea.In the latest of its continuous provocations, North Korea test-fired what it claimed a new mid-to-long-range ballistic missile that can carry a large nuclear warhead on Sunday. The missile had the US mainland within its striking range, the North claimed.","north korea recent provocations ,pyongyang white house official ,korea affairs said tuesday ,korea recent provocations the ,reporters after holding meeting","[""North Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'Pyongyang', 'White House', 'Korea', 'Matt Pottinger', 'the National Security Council']",26,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.48925823  0.70514452

It is up to the president and the legislature to motion and submit ,” Lee said.“I only meant to suggest a realistic solution as to who should  as the parliament may end up with several versions instead of one.”Renewal calls have been ongoing upon the nation‘s Constitution, last revised in 1987 when the former President Chun Doo-hwan’s military government was in power.President Moon’s blueprint on the issue is to alter the current five-year single-term presidency to a four-year double-term one and to reinforce the autonomy of local governments.“There have been talks of putting the constitutional revision bill to national referendum in next year’s local elections  but such timeline is quite pressing,” the prime minister nominee said.“In order to make it possible, leading political figures should make bold decisions and fast actions so as to reach a consensus in time.”The nominee also pointed out that the upcoming revision is to be the first time for South Korea to change its basic law through a legitimate process.“The nine constitutional revisions in the past were without exception triggered by external factors such as revolution, coup and uprising, but this time it will be based on communication within the political circles,” Lee said.“Because it has never taken place before,  is all the more difficult, so I have realized over past years .”Meanwhile, the parliament’s approval over Lee’s nomination is to be decided on May 31, after it reviews the outcome of next week’s confirmation hearing.He is anticipated to meet with the president as early as within this week to discuss the upcoming hearing.“I have not yet received ,” he said in answer to reporters’ question.“I believe that there are many things I should get ready for.”By Bae Hyun-jung","president to present revision ,the president to present ,his upcoming confirmation hearing ,pm nominee the constitution ,yon told reporters tuesday","['Lee Nak - yon', 'the Korea Banking Institute', 'Seoul', 'Lee']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13677545  0.74469048

Oh Young-hun said in a briefing.He criticized the former administration for racking up a national debt of 682 trillion won  and passing on only an “empty shell” to its successors.  “Any problem that occurs because we cannot review the previous processes and deals made before, would only be harm to the citizens,” he said. The party also raised the possibility that the Park administration tried to conceal their works and documents. “Twenty-six shredders were in the last year’s equipment purchase list of the presidential office. It would be a serious crime violating the record management law if they destroyed  with intent,” he said.The party urged the National Assembly to work to make some of the data that has been sealed as presidential records open for view as well.

The previous session was held in Geneva, Switzerland.Dialogue between North Korean government officials and US civilian experts opened on Monday in a suburb of Oslo and it will continue through Tuesday , a source said.This composite image provided by Yonhap News TV shows North Korean diplomats Choe Son-hui , head of the foreign ministry's North America bureau, and Jang Il-hoon, deputy ambassador to the UN. The North Korean delegation is reportedly led by Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North America bureau chief of the communist nation's foreign ministry. Her counterpart is Suzanne DiMaggio, director and senior fellow at New America, a think tank based in Washington DC, according to another source.DiMaggio is known as an Iran specialist well versed in the Obama administration's nuclear talks with the Middle Eastern nation.This week's meeting comes amid a let-up in military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The North did not conduct a nuclear test or a long-range rocket launch in April despite a view that it may take such a provocative act to mark a series of key political events in the month.In South Korea, its people are about to pick their new president, with expectations running high over a change of mood in inter-Korean ties that have long been frosty.The US government will not attach any special meaning to the Track II dialogue.""Track-two meetings are routinely held on a variety of topics around the world and occur independent of US government involvement,"" a State Department official said.But North Korea watchers took note of the timing of the meeting this time, saying it may provide the two sides with a chance for a type of ""exploratory"" talks.The venue is also symbolic. Norway is known for efforts to promote peace in the world, as demonstrated in the Oslo Accords, a set of peace agreements signed in 1993 and between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.Norway facilitated the historic deal that marked the start of the Oslo process, a peace initiative aimed at achieving a peace treaty.Pope Francis stated last month that a third country, like Norway, should mediate between North Korea and the US to resolve their stand-offs.US President Donald Trump  and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are both shown on either side of a 3D outline of North Korea skinned with the North Korean flag. US President Donald Trump often talks tough about North Korea, emphasizing the need to put more pressure on the Kim Jong-un regime.He recently said, however, he would meet Kim ""under the right circumstances.""""If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,"" Trump said in a Bloomberg interview earlier this month.Citing diplomatic sources, Japan's Kyodo news service offered some details of the preconditions set by Trump.He reportedly told China that he is open to meeting Kim in the U.S. if the North abandons its ambitions for weapons of mass destruction.""The idea is part of a set of proposals that the United States floated during recent discussions with Chinese officials on how best to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue,"" Kyodo reported.If the North scraps its nuclear and missile programs, according to the U.S. proposals, the Trump administration would not seek a regime change, regime collapse, an ""accelerated"" reunification of the two Koreas, or American troops' advance northwards to cross the inter-Korean border, said Kyodo.China apparently conveyed the message to Pyongyang, it added, while many observers are skeptical about any significant denuclearization deal between the two sides.South Korean government officials said the Kyodo report seems untrue.""It's an issue that the US side will have to confirm. But as far as we know, it's not true,"" a foreign ministry official in Seoul said. Since the launch of the Trump administration, the allies are maintaining watertight coordination on the North Korea issue through an ""unprecedented"" level of bilateral communications in frequency and intensity, he added, indicating that Washington would not have made such an important offer without consultation with Seoul.","american experts in oslo ,diplomatic sources said tuesday ,oslo north korean officials ,experts in oslo oslo ,experts opened on monday","['north korean', 'american', 'Oslo', 'Norway', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Geneva', 'Switzerland', 'north korean', 'US', 'Oslo']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19355737  0.95852005

Trump also said he would be ""honored"" to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un if such a meeting takes place under the right circumstances. Choe reportedly planned to visit New York in March for similar unofficial talks. But the US denied visas for a delegation of North Korean diplomats set to travel to New York following the killing of the half brother of North Korea's leader in February.In November, Choe was in Geneva for informal talks with former US government officials, including Joel Wit, editor of the website 38 North.

""A relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes,"" it added.The two-paragraph report gave no further details of the latest arrest.But it said Kim had been working for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology -- an institution founded by evangelical Christians from overseas and opened in 2010, which is known to have a number of American faculty members. Pupils are generally children from the North's elite.A State Department official in Washington on Sunday issued a terse comment about the American's reported detention.""We are aware of reports that a US citizen was detained in North Korea,"" the statement said.  ""The security of US citizens is one of the Department's highest priorities. When a US citizen is reported to be detained in North Korea, we work with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which serves as the United States' Protecting Power in North Korea,"" the State Department official said, adding that no additional comment was being offered ""due to privacy considerations.""Kim is the second of the university's personnel to have been detained in as many weeks.Accounting professor Kim Sang-Duk, or Tony Kim, also a US citizen, was held on April 22, the North confirmed last week, for trying to ""overturn"" the regime.He was detained at the capital's airport as he tried to leave the country after teaching for several weeks at the university.KCNA said he had been held for ""committing criminal acts of hostility aimed to overturn the DPRK,"" using an abbreviation for the country's official name.Using similar phrasing to Sunday's dispatch, it added that Kim was ""under detention by a relevant law enforcement body which is conducting detailed investigation into his crimes.""PUST officials could not immediately be reached for comment in connection with Saturday's arrest.In a statement in late April the university said Tony Kim's arrest was ""not connected in any way with the work of PUST.""Pyongyang is engaged in a tense standoff with the administration of US President Donald Trump over the North's banned missile and nuclear weapons programs. The North, which is widely seen as making progress toward building a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the US mainland, has carried out a series of launches this year. It has also warned that it could carry out a sixth nuclear test at any time.But no blast took place during symbolic anniversaries in April, and its key ally and diplomatic protector China has urged restraint. Trump has suggested military action could be on the table but has softened his message more recently, saying he would be ""honored"" to meet the North's leader Kim Jong-Un under the right conditions.North Korea has arrested and jailed several US citizens in the past decade, often releasing them only after high-profile visits by current or former US officials or former US presidents.Two more US citizens -- college student Otto Warmbier and Korean-American pastor Kim Dong-Chul -- are currently being held in the North after being sentenced to long prison terms. The pastor was sentenced last year to 10 years of hard labor for spying. Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years in 2016 for stealing a propaganda banner and for ""crimes against the state."" Pyongyang last week accused the CIA and the South's intelligence services of conspiring to assassinate Kim Jong-Un using a biochemical weapon.The claim came just months after Kim's half-brother was murdered by two female agents at Kuala Lumpur airport using a banned nerve agent, in a killing widely blamed on Pyongyang.","sunday its second arrest ,loggerheads over pyongyang nuclear ,arrest of an american ,north korea has detained ,saturday the official korean","['North Korea', 'US', 'American', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Kim Hak - Song', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'Korean Central News']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.1532865   0.68891537

The fine dust warning is issued when an hourly average dust concentration of more than 300 micrograms per cubic meter  is expected to last for more than two hours. The concentration of more than 150 ㎍/㎥ lasting longer than two hours leads to an advisory.When these warnings or advisories are in place, people are advised to stay indoors or wear protective masks if they must venture outside The Korea Meteorological Administration said dust particles are expected to remain on the peninsula through Sunday.Originating from the deserts in southern Mongolia and northern China, the dusty air flew into the Korean Peninsula on a strong wind over the weekendAs of 9 am, Seoul’s atmospheric concentration levels of “particulate matter-10” pollutants reached 235 ㎍/㎥.PM-10 refers to airborne particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter. Epidemiological evidence indicates that exposure to such pollutants causes cardiac and respiratory problems.A study conducted from May 2015 to December 2016 showed last Thursday that 55 percent of the fine dust particles in the capital come from abroad, up from 49 percent in 2011.Saturday is the second day of a three-day weekend, which began with Children’s Day on Friday.

Gen. Lee Sun-jin , chairman of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and USFK commander Gen. Vincent K.

Walter ""Skip"" Sharp, who commanded the USFK from 2008 till 2011, has been named the first head of the association.""As the biggest pro-South Korean group in the US, it's expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening the alliance,"" the ministry said in a statement.Actively communicating with local opinion leaders, it added, the organization plans to focus on making the case for a stronger alliance between the two countries.Before attending the ceremony, the ministry's chief Park Sung-choon also described the creation of the club as a ""historic moment"" for the alliance to move toward a new future.""The South Korea-US Mutual Defense Treaty laid the groundwork for their alliance on the military level. The launch of the KDVA is tantamount to the signing of the second mutual defense treaty to lay another foundation for the alliance on the non-military level,"" he said.In April 2014, former and current USFK commanders agreed to join hands to set up the association.The launching ceremony will be attended by more than 150 dignitaries including Pentagon and State Department officials and congressional leaders.Last week, some pro-alliance figures in Seoul established the Korea-US Alliance Foundation in Seoul with the aim of financially supporting the KDVA.The South Korea-US alliance dates back to the 1950-53 Korean War, in which the US-led UN forces fought alongside the South against an invading North Korea.   Thousands of American troops have since been stationed here on a permanent basis, as the conflict ended in a truce, not a formal peace treaty.","veterans to launch fraternity ,south korea said tuesday ,usfk veterans to launch ,will launch new fraternity ,launch new fraternity","['South Korea', 'US', 'Forces Korea', 'Washington DC', 'pro - seoul', 'the Korea Defense Veterans Association', 'south korean', 'US', 'Minist']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.18235676  0.5301587

South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se Talks for the sake of talks are not an option for the international community, he added, urging it to apply additional, tougher sanctions on Pyongyang to help dissuade it from provoking and coax it into returning to the bargaining table.""In order to change the strategic calculus of Pyongyang and induce changes from within we could take potent measures such as halting the export and supply of crude oil to North Korea, completely cutting off North Korea's hard currency earnings by, for instance, suspending all imports from North Korea, and seriously consider whether North Korea, a serial offender, is qualified to be a member of the United Nations as well as downgrading diplomatic relations with North Korea,"" he told the audience, including US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.""Let me be clear, our goal is not to bring North Korea to its knees, but to it bring it back to the negotiating table for genuine denuclearization,"" Yun added.He emphasized that the world should not repeat past failures in negotiations with the unpredictable regime.Yun held a separate meeting with Tillerson on the sidelines of the UN session to discuss the North Korea issue.The minister also explained Seoul's position on President Donald Trump's controversial comments that the Northeast Asian allies should pay for the cost of the THAAD missile defense system to be operated by US troops in the country, diplomatic sources said.The South Korean government maintains that it has already done its part financially for the THAAD deployment and it has no additional burden to bear.The South has faced diplomatic and economic pressure from China for its THAAD decision.The Chinese foreign minister used the UN session to highlight Beijing's protest against it.""I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the deployment of the US THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea,"" Wang said.""This move has undermined the strategic security of China and other countries in the region, and it has also damaged trust and cooperation among parties to the Korean Peninsula issue.""He added it will neither help efforts to denuclearize the peninsula nor help ensure long-term stability in the region.","international community against rushing ,tougher sanctions on korea ,his ministry said saturday ,meeting on north korea ,korea top diplomat warned","[""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', ""the UN Security Council 's"", 'North Korea', 'New York', 'Yun Byung - se']",26,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.45174134  0.69576931

It is the first-ever UNSC meeting arranged over the issue of the denuclearization of the country, the foreign ministry here has said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and diplomats from the council's 15 members will join the meeting. North Korea's key April anniversaries passed without a nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile test which the country had been widely speculated to be preparing. The North marked the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army on Tuesday and the birthday of North Korean founder Kim Il-sung on April 15. ""The most important purpose of discussing the North Korean issue at the UNSC is to preemptively deal with exactly this possibility of North Korea's provocation,"" Yun noted.  ""I can clearly tell you that if North Korea conducts an additional provocation, it will face unbearable punitive measures, as South Korea, the US and the international community have warned,"" he noted. The hosting of the first-ever UNSC meeting dedicated to the North Korean issue is ""evidence that the international community is taking the nuclear and missile threats posed by North Korea more gravely than ever,"" the top diplomat said. For the new US administration, the North Korean nuclear issue is the top priority, and the country is closely cooperating with its allies and partners including South Korea to resolve the issue, he said.

And so I would hope that the president's relationship that he developed down in Florida with the Chinese leader will yield some benefits in breaking this continued progress towards this capability of threatening the United States of America,"" he said, referring to President Donald Trump's summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.China should understand that th US ""cannot live with a situation where North Korea has this kind of capability."" Since his first summit meetings with Xi earlier this month, Trump has repeatedly praised China for trying to increase pressure on the North, citing Beijing's decision to return coal imports from the North as an example. Trump has also held out the prospect of a better trade deal with the US if China solves the problem.China is North Korea's last-remaining major ally and a key provider of food and fuel supplies. But it has been reluctant to use its influence over Pyongyang for fears that pushing the regime too hard could result in instability in the North and hurt Chinese national interests.Analysts doubt how far China can go in pressuring Pyongyang, saying China has often increased pressure on the North in the past, especially when Pyongyang carried out nuclear and missile tests and other provocative acts, but it never went as far as to cause real pain.","mccain china should suffer ,china should suffer penalties ,china should suffer ,shut down their economy ,john mccain said wednesday","['WASHINGTON', 'the United States', 'China', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'John McCain', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Korea']",26,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.44242606  1.17771733

""The government views enhancement of North Korea's human rights as a major factor in crafting a unification policy,"" the ministry said in a statement.""Seoul will seek to induce North Korea to protect and improve human rights by taking the dual-track approaches of employing pressure and strategic engagement such as inter-Korean dialogue on the rights issue,"" it said.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world. The North does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.Under the law, the government launched an agency to investigate and collect data on Pyongyang's rights situation. But the government has yet to launch a foundation to support relevant civic groups' activities and do research on Pyongyang's human rights record due to a delay of the parliamentary process to file candidates for board members.The three-year blueprint contained seven policy goals including helping North Koreans get access to outside information, the ministry said.""The government plans to help guarantee North Koreans the rights to know,"" it said. "" to help North Koreans contact the outside world and increase the inflow of outside information to the North.""The government earlier said that it will push for projects that will help raise North Koreans' accessibility to outside information if the foundation is launched.But Seoul said it won't support civic groups that send up anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons, one of the main sources of tensions between the two Koreas.North Korea is sensitive to Seoul activists' move to send anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets and does not want ordinary North Koreans to know the truth about its repressive regime.The government also said that it will push for providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people including infants and pregnant women.Seoul will seek to hold inter-Korean dialogue on human rights to get North Korea to change its course. It plans to encourage North Korea to accept the talks by offering technical cooperation in the human rights field.Detailed action plans to implement the blueprint are expected to be drawn up under the next administration following the May 9 presidential election, the ministry added.","unveiled three year plan ,tuesday unveiled three year ,korea unveils year plan ,ministry on tuesday unveiled ,on tuesday unveiled three","[""South Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'the Ministry of Unification', ""North Korea 's""]",26,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.08012232  0.47555158

Lindsey Graham  made the argument during an interview with NBC News, saying that war would be bad for South Korea, Japan and other countries in the region, but won't reach the US, while an intercontinental ballistic missile could do. ""It would be terrible but the war would be over here , wouldn't be here,"" Graham said with a gesture with his fingers. ""It would be bad for the Korean Peninsula. It would be bad for China.It would be bad for Japan, be bad for South Korea. It would be the end of North Korea.

The move came amid growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. There is speculation that it may carry out its sixth nuclear test or launch an intercontinental ballistic missile.At the military parade Saturday, North Korea unveiled what appeared to be three types of ICBMs in a show of force, vowing to respond with nuclear attacks to Washington's possible pre-emptive strike.During the performance, North Korea also unveiled a song about the country's artillery unit in charge of ballistic missile launches.The song extolling missile launches carried out by the Hwasong artillery units of the Strategic Force under the Korean People's Army was released.Footage of an intermediate-range Musudan ballistic missile, called Hwasong-1 in North Korea, being launched was shown on the screen at the hall, according to the TV broadcaster.The lyrics for the song include ""Our proud Hwasong rocket blasts off"" and ""It flies as quickly as a flash of lightning to challenge imperialism.""North Korea skipped provocative acts on the founder's birthday, but there is still the possibility of a nuclear or missile test around the 85th anniversary of the KPA's founding which falls on April 25.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's message that the country has entered the final stage of preparing to launch an ICBM capable of hitting the US mainland.","missile crossing the pacific ,pyongyang media reported wednesday ,media reported wednesday footage ,reported wednesday footage of ,reported wednesday footage","['North Korea', 'the United States', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Pyongyang', 'US']",26,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.06471237  0.81173307

China's trying to help us. I don't know if they are going to be able to or not, but do I want to start heavy, heavy trade or currency manipulation statements against somebody who's out there trying to stop what could be a very bad situation?"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News.Trump held his first summit talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month with a focus on North Korea. He has since praised China for trying to increase pressure on Pyongyang.Trump has also decided against labeling Beijing a currency manipulator, saying it could jeopardize efforts to solve the North Korea problem.Trump said he has a good chemistry with Xi.""He understands it's a big problem. He's working on it. Now, what am I going to do, start a trade war with China in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea?"" Trump said. ""We'll see what he can do. Now maybe he won't be able to help. That's possible. I think he's trying, but maybe he won't be able to help and that's a whole different story.""Trump said China has never dealt with the North in a way that it is dealing right now.""He's working so nicely that many coal ships have been sent back. Fuel is being sent back. They're not dealing the same way. Nobody's ever seen it like that. Nobody's ever seen such a positive response on our behalf from China,"" he said.Asked about military options on the North, Trump declined comment.""I don't want to telegraph what I'm doing or what I'm thinking. I'm not like other administrations, where they say we're going to do this in four weeks,"" he said. ""It doesn't work that way. We'll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there's going to be peace.""Pressed for what he'll do in the event of another missile launch by the North, Trump only said, ""We'll find out.""""You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed. They've all been outplayed by this gentleman,"" he said.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have sharply spiked in recent weeks as Washington and Pyongyang have rattled their sabers against each other, with the US sending a massive aircraft carrier strike group to waters off the Korean Peninsula and the North responding with a missile launch attempt, even though it ended in failure.The two sides have also engaged in a war of words, with American officials repeatedly saying that all options are on the table in an apparent reference to military strikes, and North Korean officials also churning out highly belligerent rhetoric.On Monday, the North's deputy UN ambassador, Kim In-ryong, told reporters that the US has ""created a dangerous situation in which thermonuclear war may break out at any moment on the peninsula."" Kim said the North is ready to react to any ""mode of war"" from the US and will respond in kind to any US missile or nuclear strike.Earlier Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence said during a visit to Japan that what the US and other countries are concerned about are the ""reckless and irresponsible actions of the regime in Pyongyang."" ""The time has really come for North Korea to get the message. As the president says, it's time for them to behave, to listen to the world community, to set aside their nuclear ambitions, their ballistic missile ambitions and be willing to join the family of nations,"" Pence said on CNN.""For my part, in some odd way, it's encouraging that they're getting the message and my hope is that they will continue to get the message, not just from the United States, here in Japan and in South Korea, but on an increasing basis from China and countries all over the world that long ago committed to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,"" he said.","trade war with china ,war with china ,donald trump said tuesday ,war with china when ,to start trade war","['WASHINGTON', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'China', 'Beijing', 'US', 'North Korea', 'China']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.47307751  0.84162146

Carl Vinson is on its way to the Western Pacific after “transiting the Indian Ocean” on Saturday, according to the US Pacific Fleet Command’s Flickr account. “The US is coordinating with the South Korean government about a combined drill which the Carl Vinson Strike Group can join,” said a Seoul official on the condition of anonymity. The dispatch comes as part of increased US Navy presence in the region around the Korean Peninsula. Besides the forward-deployed Yokohama-based USS Ronald Reagan, the US has also dispatched the USS Nimitz air-craft carrier toward the Western Pacific, bringing the number of aircraft carrier groups heading to the region to three.In a tweet posted Monday morning, Korean time, US President Donald Trump boasted his military’s assertiveness, saying “Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before. Frankly, we have no choice!”North Korea’s state-run Rodong Shinmun criticized the dispatch of aircraft carriers as a “step for a pre-emptive attack” and blamed the US for “engaging in an act of reckless aggression.” The newspaper even compared the aircraft carrier to a “gigantic mutant animal.” The US announced its decision to divert the Carl Vinson Strike Group toward the Korean Peninsula on April 9, days after it launched a missile strike against a Syrian government air base of warplanes that carried out chemical attacks on civilians. The Carl Vinson Strike Group was initially thought to arrive in South Korean waters Saturday, when North Korea held a massive military parade at Pyongyang to celebrate the 105th birthday of its late founder Kim il-sung. Deployed from San Diego to the West Pacific since January, it has participated in bilateral exercises with the South Korean and Japanese militaries as well as routine patrol operation in the South China Sea.By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday seoul in growing ,arrive next tuesday seoul ,next tuesday seoul ,next tuesday seoul in ,said seoul officials monday","['North Korea', 'the United States', 'Carl Vinson', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Nimitz', 'USS Carl Vinson', 'the south korean Navy']",26,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.47625887  0.72462726

The expected tally, consisting mainly of students from the two neighboring countries slated to visit on school trips, has far outpaced some 400 recorded in the same period ending April 13, 2016, according to the Korea Tourism Organization. Last year's total for excursion groups from Taiwan and Hong Kong stood at 1,407. The increase came as the KTO has been bolstering marketing efforts on individual tourists from countries other than China amid a diplomatic row over a US anti-missile system. South Korea has seen the number of Chinese inbound travelers tumble by more than 30 percent since March 15, when Beijing banned tour agencies from selling packages to its neighboring country in an apparent retaliation for the planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system on the Korean Peninsula. At the present pace, South Korea is likely to lose about half of its Chinese travelers this year, whose portion took up around 50 percent of foreigners who visited the country last year. ""Students that are coming on school trips are regarded as individual travelers with a high possibility for a revisit in the future since their first impression of South Korea will likely be positive,"" the KTO said in a release.Helped by aggressive marketing, the organization has also secured over 3,500 Japanese students scheduled to come on school trips this year, which it hopes will benefit the local tourism industry struggling to reduce dependency on Chinese demand, it added. The KTO said it plans to further expand marketing efforts to get more people from various countries to visit South Korea.","inbound tourists from taiwan ,decline in chinese tourists ,chinese tourists the expected ,hike in inbound tourists ,tourism organization said monday","['Taiwan', 'Hong Kong', 'chinese']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28040195  1.09139395

Kim expressed satisfaction, saying, ""Bullets seemed to have their eyes, and they were crack shots never missing targets"" after watching automatic rifle firing by combatants of the special operation battalion under the direct control of KPA Unit 525, it said.The contest is viewed as a drill for the North Korean military's rear area infiltration into South Korea via helicopter, experts say.There is speculation that North Korea could soon conduct its sixth nuclear test or launch a long-range rocket around key anniversaries in April.The country will mark the 105th birthday of late founder Kim Il-sung on Saturday, and April 25 is the 85th anniversary of the KPA's creation.The United States has sent the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group again toward the Korean Peninsula in an apparent effort to counter North Korea's threats. The North vowed to take tough countermeasures, calling the dispatch a ""reckless"" act.Concerns are also growing here that the US may conduct a pre-emptive attack on the North similar to its latest airstrike against Syria.Washington has said ""all options"" are available, including possible military actions, to counter North Korea's threats.In December, KPA Unit 525 conducted a simulated drill aimed at destroying South Korea's presidential office and other specific targets, which was also observed by the North's leader.Seoul and Washington are conducting two-month joint military drills that will wrap up at the end of April. North Korea called the move an operation intended to ""decapitate"" the North Korean leadership.","contest north korean leader ,state media said thursday ,forces target striking contest ,striking contest north korean ,targets pyongyang state media","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', ""the Korean People 's Army"", 'Ko']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50369525  0.61492956

""We will first check the exterior condition of the hull tomorrow and go on cleaning and disinfecting it, and then carry out safety checks on the following day.""The search for the remains of the nine missing people that may still be inside the wreck will start early next week, he said.The official said divers will keep looking for any remains that may be at the bottom of the sea where the ferry sank. Underwater fences surrounding the area have been set up to prevent any items from drifting away.The ferry capsized in waters near Jindo Island, some 472 kilometers southwest of Seoul, on April 16, 2014, claiming the lives of 304 people, most of whom were high school students on a school trip.In order to recover the remains and conduct a detailed investigation into the disaster, the South Korean government decided to pull the ferry from the water intact in 2015, with the 85.1 billion won  project going to a Chinese consortium led by state-run Shanghai Salvage.After months of preparation, the operation to raise the Sewol, lying about 40 meters under water, began on March 22. After the ferry was raised, it was loaded onto a semisubmersible transport ship, and arrived in port on March 31. Even after its arrival in Mokpo it took more than 10 days to move the ship to a dry dock, mainly because of its weight.Over the three-week period, 20 animal bone fragments and some 100 items including a passport, bags and other personal belongings have been recovered from the wreck.The passport was found to be that of Lee Joon-seok, the Sewol's 70-year-old captain who is serving 36 years in prison for criminal negligence and dereliction of duty.","tuesday we finished moving ,country worst maritime disaster ,salvage operation told reporters ,missing victims begins sejong ,the government said tuesday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Mokpo', 'Lee Cheol - jo']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.54917759  0.68309903

US President Donald J. Trump  and Chinese President Xi Jinping ""We will not sort of broadcast talking points of the president in advance but of course the question of sanctions generally is very much a live one,"" the official said during the Foreign Press Center briefing to preview the Trump-Xi meetings set for Thursday and Friday.Secondary sanctions, also known as a ""secondary boycott,"" are considered one of the last-remaining sanctions tools against the North, and calls for penalizing companies doing business with Pyongyang. Chinese firms are expected to be subject to the measure as most of the North's dealings with the outside world are with China.Former US President Barack Obama was reluctant to impose secondary sanctions out of fear of souring relations with China.But Trump is widely expected to pursue those measures as he has been strongly critical of Beijing for not helping resolve the North Korea problem.Trump has made it a top priority to get China to exercise more of its considerable leverage over the North as the main provider of food and energy for the impoverished nation that has been under a string of international sanctions for many decades.Pottinger said that applying more pressure on Pyongyang is ""something that China has the ability to bring to bear in a way that no other single country can.""""We'd like to see China working closely with the US to address the menace emanating from North Korea, their weapons programs, the provocations that we've seen every week, missile launches, including one that we had not too many hours ago,"" he said, referring to the North's latest missile launches early Wednesday .""There's an opportunity for that to be an area of cooperation and to grow that. I think it's in Beijing's interest. I think that North Korea long ago ceased to be a strategic asset for China. It is now quite clearly a strategic liability and it is one that is having an impact on the region. It is one that has the potential to destabilize not only the peninsula but really the region as well,"" he said.The Trump administration has shown increasing impatience with the North, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson openly mentioning the possibility of using military options during his trip to South Korea last month. After the North's latest missile launch, Tillerson also issued an unusually blunt statement expressing displeasure.""North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment,"" he said in the statement.A senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the summit with Xi, also said Tuesday that the clock for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue ""has now run out,"" and the US is looking at ""all options on the table.""The official also said how to deal with North Korea is a ""test of the relationship"" between the US and China.","trump holds summit talks ,house official said wednesday ,trump xi summit senior ,donald trump holds summit ,for trump xi summit","['WASHINGTON', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'White House', 'North Korea']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.42729828  0.38215071

North Korea will be one of the most important topics for their discussions as Trump is determined to use Chinese influence over the North to rein in the provocative regime in Pyongyang.On Sunday, Trump said in an interview with the Financial Times that China should help with the North Korea problem by using the ""great influence"" it has over Pyongyang, warning that if it doesn't, the U.S. will solve the problem on its own, and that won't be good for anyone. Trump also said he will use trade as an incentive for China to take action on the North.On Tuesday, Trump said the North is a ""humanity problem,"" and he will talk about the issue with China's Xi.""North Korea clearly is a matter of urgent interest for the president and the administration as a whole. I think the president has been pretty clear in messaging how important it is for China to coordinate with the U.S. and for China to begin exerting its considerable economic leverage to bring about a peaceful resolution to that problem,"" the White House official said.""Certainly, it is going to come up in their discussions.Somewhere in the order of just shy of 90 percent of North Korea's external trade is with China. Even though we hear sometimes that China's political influence may have diminished, with North Korea, clearly its economic leverage has not. It is considerable and so that will be one of the points of discussion,"" he said.The Trump-Xi meetings will also be watched closely as to whether the U.S. stands up to China for bullying South Korea for hosting the U.S. THAAD missile defense system designed to defend better against ever-growing missile threats from North Korea.The White House official said that the deployment will go ahead as planned.""We are familiar with China's objections to THAAD. The United States will always act to defend our allies and to defend our homeland against any threat, particularly one of the nature of the North Korean regime with the kinds of terrible weapons that they're developing. There will be no move away from protecting our South Korean allies and the United States,"" he said.The official also said that China's retaliation against the South is ""disturbing.""""South Korea is a responsible, friendly, economically dynamic democracy that is seeking together with its ally, the United States, to put in place defensive systems. It doesn't make much sense and at some levels even is disturbing to be punishing South Korea for wanting to do that,"" the official said.""If THAAD is a problem to other countries in the region, they need to look to North Korea,"" he said.","resolving korea nuclear problem ,upcoming summit between president ,for resolving korea nuclear ,house official said tuesday ,north korean nuclear issue","['WASHINGTON', 'Yonhap', 'north korean', 'the United States', 'White House', 'Donald Trump', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'North Korea']",26,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.25639614  0.52960676

I think it is still years away before that technology is developed,” Swift said during an interview with The Korea Herald and other news outlets at the US Naval Forces Korea command in Seoul.“It’s more important to focus on the general ballistic missile capability that North Korea is developing,” said the admiral, referring to Pyongyang’s latest launch of medium-range ballistic missiles that used SLBM technology and solid fuel technology.The admiral was in Seoul as part of a three-day trip to South Korea. On Tuesday, he attended an international forum to discuss amphibious operation in the Asia-Pacific region and met with South Korea’s military leadership, including Gen. Lee Sun-jin, chairman of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. Despite speculation the North has inched closer to completing SLBM technology, he stressed that Pyongyang has yet to secure key elements crucial for a successful launch: the missile technology and the miniaturization of nuclear weapons. “There are two broad elements to focus on. One is missile technology itself: both the physics of developing the missile and its reliability as well as accuracy of the missile. The other element is miniaturization of nuclear capability.” Confronted with North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threat, the commander has been expanding the role of the 3rd Fleet by forward deploying its strategic assets to the 7th fleet, whose area of operation mostly encompasses South Korea, Japan and China. Last month, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson was deployed to the Korean Peninsula after departing San Diego, where the headquarters of the 3rd Fleet is located. After entering the 7th Fleet area of operation, The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier remains under the 3rd Fleet’s command and control. But the admiral said although the US Navy will continue to expand its involvement in the Asian-Pacific region, there would be no additional “forward deployment” of US aircraft carriers and other strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula. Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet “One of the great advantages of naval power is its flexibility to deploy, but I don‘t see any additional carriers being forward deployed. ... The challenge we have is the facility for maintaining and sustaining our ships.” “We will reach 60 percent of naval forces present in the Pacific by 2020. And all those decisions have been made and investments have been made. It‘s probably 57 or 58 percent. But it fluctuates from day to day.” When asked about whether the US Navy would dispatch its stealthy destroyer Zumwalt -- an idea reportedly floated by Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific Command, during a meeting with South Korean lawmakers, Adm. Swift expressed skepticism, but added “anything is possible.’ “Anything is possible. We can have the entire US Navy move somewhere. But it is very, very premature to discuss the probability of that. I would not recommend forward deploying it until we have fully have worked through challenges,” he said.By Yeo Jun-suk","navy official said tuesday ,despite north korea accelerating ,years away from mastering ,herald interview nk slbm ,land based ballistic missiles","['North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'US Navy', 'Scott Swift', 'the US Pacific Fleet']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51748061  0.55295283

The Rodong Sinmun, the country's main newspaper, reported that a photo exhibition kicked off in Pyongyang to mark the upcoming events.On display were photos featuring Kim issuing the order to conduct the fourth nuclear test last year and his announcement of building Ryomyong Street, a new residential area under construction in Pyongyang.Photo exhibitions to mark Kim's assumption of key posts have been held every April, but this year North Korea is ramping up the campaign for his personality cult.Analysts said that the move is aimed at highlighting the legitimacy of the three-generation rule that started from late founder Kim Il-sung.Kim Jong-un assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il.The country's state media has begun to call Kim the ""respected supreme leader"" since Dec. 17 last year, the fifth anniversary of his father's death.North Korea's April calendar is dotted with major anniversaries including the 105th birthday of Kim Il-sung, which falls on April 15.The country will mark the 85th anniversary of the creation of the Korean People's Army on April 25 when a massive military parade is likely to be held.North Korea usually holds big military events or parades on anniversaries whose final numbers end in a five or a zero.","next week major anniversaries ,celebrate the fifth anniversary ,pyongyang will also celebrate ,north korea said tuesday ,anniversary of kim election","['North Korea', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'North Korea', 'Kim', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'Pyongyang']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.78518128  1.00811481

They were believed to be hiding at the embassy in Kuala Lumpur after Malaysian police named them as the suspects.The Thursday agreement effectively ended the diplomatic row over Kim's death, which brought the two nations to the brink of their relationship being severed.Malaysian police earlier said that eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in the killing. North Korea claimed that Malaysia colluded with South Korea to manipulate the probe.Malaysia canceled its visa-waiver program with North Korea and kicked out North Korea's top envoy to Malaysia in response to the North's ""diplomatically rude"" behavior.Pyongyang imposed a temporary exit ban on nine Malaysians staying in the North, taking them as diplomatic hostages. In a tit-for-tat action, Malaysia banned North Korean diplomats from leaving the country.But both nations agreed to lift a travel ban imposed on citizens staying in each other's countries. They also decided to ""positively"" discuss the re-introduction of the canceled visa-waiver system. Hyon Kwang-song , a suspect involved in the killing of Kim Jong-nam, and a North Korean diplomat are seen at an airport in Beijing on March 31, 2017, as he was allowed to leave Malaysia under a diplomatic deal between North Korea and Malaysia. Under the deal, the nine Malaysians were released from Pyongyang and arrived in their home country, according to Malaysian reports.The two countries said that Kim's body will be delivered to ""the family of the deceased"" in North Korea, spawning speculation that it would be the North's leader Kim Jong-un.The whereabouts of Kim Jong-nam's family members are not known after they reportedly left their home in Macau.Kim Han-sol, known as the second son of Kim Jong-nam, appeared in a YouTube video clip in early March, saying that his father had been killed.","two north korean suspects ,suspects leave for pyongyang ,killing of kim jong ,added on thursday malaysia ,the slain half brother","['BEIJING', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Malaysia', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Malaysia']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.37677816  0.7366026

In addition, a legal officer with a more than seven-year career is needed to take charge of setting up the archive and integrating and preserving information and evidence, plus an information officer with over five years of experience.Three additional experts, well-versed in the international criminal system, South Korean criminal law and legal interpretation, are also needed for the UN Human Rights Office set up in Seoul in 2015 to collect evidence on the North's rights violations, the report said.","us broadcaster reported friday ,the latest un resolution ,evidence detailing north korea ,broadcaster reported friday ,broadcaster reported friday the","[""North Korea 's"", 'the Office of the UN', 'Geneva', 'UN', 'US', 'the UN Human Rights Council']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.66136229  1.11677694

They will be added to the elementary school curriculum from 2020 and to the middle school curriculum from 2021.""The government strongly denounces the Japanese government for finally approving the education guidelines for its elementary and middle school social studies that include its unjustified claims to our inherent territory of Dokdo despite our repeated warnings,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""And we demand its immediate withdrawal"" ""We warn Japan to bear in mind that if it pushes again to inject inaccurate historical perceptions following the wrongful claims to Dokdo, which was the first victim of Japan's imperialism, in its newly authorized textbooks, its next generations will learn false history,"" it added. The ministry called in Hideo Suzuki, a minister at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul who is currently serving as acting ambassador, to lodge an official protest. He didn't respond to reporters requesting comments on his way to meet Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Jeong-Kyu.Dokdo, a set of rocky islets lying closer to the Korean Peninsula in the East Sea, has long been a recurring source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since its liberation from Japan in 1945 and has made clear that Tokyo's claims are utterly groundless.Last week, the Japanese education ministry announced the list of its newly authorized textbooks to be used from April next year for high school sophomores.Of the 24 newly approved social studies textbooks, 19, or nearly 80 percent, claim that Dokdo is Japanese territory. Some state that South Korea is illegally occupying Dokdo, called Takeshima, in Japan. Japan's repeated claims to the South Korean territory are expected to worsen the frayed diplomatic relations between the two neighbors as they have been at odds for months over a recently erected statue of a girl that symbolizes Tokyo's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women.

He's front-running in the presidential race, according to opinion polls.Some THAAD equipment arrives in South Korea. Despite such a setback, the US military announced earlier this month that the ""first elements"" of the THAAD system have arrived in South Korea.Those include two THAAD missile launchers known to be stored currently at a USFK base, which is not that far away from Seongju, while both South Korean and US defense officials remain guarded about further details.South Korea picked a civilian golf course in the southeastern town as the site for the THAAD battery and secured the land from Lotte Group in a property swap. Seoul and Washington are pushing for a joint environmental assessment in advance of construction work. But a group of local residents has blocked the entry of vehicles carrying relevant equipment into the site.The ministry official requested their cooperation, saying the THAAD system is aimed at defending South Korea against the North's upgraded nuclear and missile programs.""The military is pushing for the THAAD deployment with the perception that national security is most important,"" he said.","dismissed news report thursday ,korea defense ministry dismissed ,ministry dismissed news report ,defense ministry dismissed news ,news report thursday","[""South Korea 's"", 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'the US Forces Korea', 'the Ministry of National']",26,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.15213729  0.366061

The South Korean firms annually provided about $100 million in total to North Korean workers for wages.Earlier in the day, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo visited the headquarters of a local electronics parts manufacturer which ran factories at the Kaesong complex in a bid to appreciate its self-rescue effort to normalize business operations.""The government will continue to make efforts to support the firms at the zone in a principle-based manner,"" Hong said.The shutdown is believed to have caused 1.5 trillion won  in losses, according to a group of the firms, adding that the government's financial support measures are not sufficient.North Korea has condemned Seoul's unification ministry for severely straining inter-Korean ties.

Kim is currently in prison, as she was found to have conducted spy activities after posing as a defector entering the South.""North Korea calls on the CSW and UN member nations to condemn the allured abduction and forcible detainment of the woman and girls as outrageous human rights violations, crimes against humanity,"" the delegate was quoted as saying.","wednesday north korean delegate ,female defectors at un ,reported wednesday north korean ,wednesday north korean ,13 north korean restaurant","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'UN', 'north korean', 'the UN Commission', 'UN']",26,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.64192867  0.58132517

So, you won't be surprised to learn that North Korea policy is, of course, subject to a broad review that does very explicitly look at the whole spectrum of possibilities,"" Ford said during the discussion organized by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.""Don't have answers on what will come out of that review but you may see something sooner rather than later on that,"" he said.""The NSC's Asia Director was one of the first out of the box in policy review terms and starting to work on North Korea review through the interagencies.""Ford also stressed the seriousness of the North Korean threat.""It's got an unchecked nuclear weapons program, an accelerating missile-testing program that is increasingly poised to deliver a nuclear weapon over intercontinental ranges to the US It clearly presents a threat that we can't ignore,"" he said.The official reacted negatively to calls in South Korea for nuclear armament, saying the long-standing US objective has been to make sure ""those questions never need to arise on their own merits and to make sure that the circumstances that might drive that kind of consideration don't come about.""Earlier, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the US in coordination with allies ""is exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures in response to the grave and escalating threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""No details were given as to what those measures will look like, but the new package of options is expected to center on ramping up pressure on Pyongyang, rather than reopening negotiations. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during a trip to South Korea and Japan last week that two decades of diplomatic efforts to disarm the North have failed, and there was no point in pursuing the diplomatic path any longer. He also said that the US was considering a wide range of options, including the use of military force.In response, the North said it is fully ready for ""any war"" with the US.On Monday, US President Donald Trump called the North Korean situation ""disgraceful,"" arguing that he's inherited a lot of problems from the previous administration.""The fact is we inherited a mess. It's a mess,"" Trump said in an address in Kentucky, picking the Middle East and North Korea as examples of such problems. ""North Korea, I'll tell you what, what's happening there is disgraceful and not smart, not smart at all. So many different problems.""It was the latest in a series of remarks Trump has made about the North in recent days. On Friday, Trump tweeted, ""North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!"" He also said on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is acting ""very, very badly.""That appears to show the problem weighs on Trump's mind.

It is known to have been renamed the Second Academy of Natural Science after the 1970s in a bid to disguise its work on weapons development.""North Korea internally calls the agency the ANDS, but when it needed to conceal the organization's identity, it used the name of the Second Academy of Natural Sciences,"" said Lee Choon-geun, a senior research fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un watched a ground jet test of a new type of high-thrust rocket engine newly developed by the ANDS, according to the Korean Central News Agency.The state media's report on the agency indicates North Korea would not hide its intention to develop advanced weapons with the goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile.The North's leader said in his New Year's message that the country has entered the final stage of preparing to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile.South Korea's defense ministry said that North Korea's latest engine test was a ""meaningful"" advance in its weapons of mass destruction development program.The Second Academy of Natural Sciences was blacklisted by the UN Security Council in 2013 as an agency engaged in or providing support for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs through various means, including illicit ones, according to the UN website.In November 2016, Jang Chang-ha, the head of the agency, became one of 11 individuals who were newly added to the UNSC's sanctions list.","last year north korea ,research source said monday ,year north korea returned ,korea has recently changed ,korea returned the second","['North Korea', 'North Korea', 'the Second Academy of Natural Sciences', 'the Academy of the National Defense Science', 'north korean', 'ANDS']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.67028004  0.9816168

Choung Tae-ok, a spokesperson of the conservative Liberty Korea Party, said. The party also emphasized that he reaffirmed the alliance between Seoul and Washington will remain strong.The Bareun Party, which spun off from the former ruling party earlier this year, echoed the view.“We are sending strong support to Tillerson’s pledge that the U.S. will increase sanctions against North Korea,” party spokesman Rep. Lee Ki-jae said.Meanwhile, the liberal bloc expressed caution about his signal of a tougher U.S. approach to the North.The largest Democratic Party said it is opposed to any measure that can spark military tension on the divided peninsula, stressing the need to seek a mix of pressure and dialogue to resolve the North‘s nuclear and missile programs.“We are supporting the U.S.’s move to strengthen the effectiveness of sanctions against the North through cooperation with relevant countries,” party spokesman Rep. Koh Yong-jin said.“But we cannot help expressing concerns about the U.S. stance that there will be no dialogue until North Korea gives up .”“Seeking both sanctions and dialogue in parallel is the most effective way in curbing North Korea‘s nuclear and missile program development,” he added.North Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year alone following those in 2006, 2009 and 2013. It has also fired off more than 20 ballistic missiles, including intermediate-range Musudan missiles.The United Nations Security Council slapped tougher sanctions on the North twice last year in response to its provocations.","against south korean political ,korea the top diplomat ,reporters in seoul ,top diplomat told reporters ,mixed reactions on friday","['south korean', 'U.S.', 'State', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang']",26,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.75494552  0.81418669

His trip to Korea is the second leg of his three-country Asian tour which will also take him to China this weekend. Right after landing at the airport, Tillerson headed to the Demilitarized Zone on the inter-Korean border, the first major schedule of his visit to the ally.While touring the DMZ, he was said to have been briefed at the truce village of Panmunjom and had lunch with troops at Camp Bonifas.Accompanied by USFK Commander Gen. Vincent K. Brooks and South Korean Army Gen. Lim Ho-young, Tillerson was also said to have walked near the military demarcation line bisecting the two Koreas.Some North Korean soldiers were seen watching the visiting delegation and taking pictures of the secretary.Tillerson didn't send any message or issue any statement. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn exchanges a handshake on March 17. During a meeting with Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn later in the day, Tillerson reaffirmed the two countries' ""ironclad"" security partnership.""I am here to express and reaffirm the ironclad alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea which serves as a linchpin for security and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said.""I also want to stress the importance of our strong people-to-people ties, growing economic cooperation and, as you mentioned, our strong alliance for security in response to the growing threat from North Korea,"" he added.Hwang took over as the acting president in December after then-President Park Geun-hye was impeached over a corruption scandal.Tillerson's visit to Korea is part of his three-country Asian tour that will also take him to China this weekend. This marked his first trip of this kind since taking office as top diplomat under the Donald Trump administration.Tillerson came amid mounting anxiety over additional provocations by the North and deepening friction between South Korea and China over the deployment of a US missile defense system called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.In particular, the message that the former Exxon Mobil executive will deliver will be closely scrutinized for any hints at how the US government will deal with the North given that Washington is in the final stages of its policy review on Pyongyang.During a press conference held after meeting Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo on Friday, Tillerson told reporters that US efforts over the past 20 years to denuclearize the North have failed, calling for a ""new approach"" in dealing with Pyongyang.The secretary didn't provide details on what the new approach would be but noted that he exchanged views on it with Japan and will do so with his counterparts in South Korea and China. He is to fly to China on Saturday.","south korea on friday ,begins trip to korea ,in tokyo on thursday ,korea on friday ,his two day trip","['US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Tillerson', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo']",26,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.44606858  0.84404415

Kim was holding a diplomatic passport bearing the name Kim Chol when he was attacked Feb. 13 at Kuala Lumpur's airport by two women who smeared the banned VX nerve agent on his face, officials say. He died within 20 minutes.  Malaysia's deputy national police chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim  speaks in the press conference. Deputy national police Chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim said Kim's family will let the government decide what to do with his body.  ""I was made to understand that they are leaving it to our government to deal with it  ... yes, they have given their consent,'' Noor Rashid said. He said any decision will be subject to negotiations between the two countries amid a diplomatic standoff over the killing. Kim was the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, and relations between Malaysia and North Korea have deteriorated sharply since Kim's death, with each expelling the other's ambassador. North Korea blocked Malaysians from leaving the country until a ``fair settlement'' of the case is reached. Malaysia then barred North Koreans from exiting its soil. The two countries have also scrapped visa-free travel for each other's citizens. Noor Rashid declined to comment on whether the two women had been given different components that would form a binary version of VX, but described it as a ""professional job.'' National police chief Khalid Abu Bakar separately told reporters that four North Korean suspects who left Malaysia on the same day as the killing have been put on Interpol's red notice list, which is a request to locate and hold a person pending extradition. Police say three other North Korean suspects, including a North Korean diplomat and an employee of Air Koryo, North Korea's state airline, are believed to be in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. There are currently nine Malaysians in North Korea -- three embassy staff members and their family members. About 315 North Koreans are in Malaysia. Although Malaysia has never directly accused North Korea of being behind the attack, many speculate that it must have orchestrated it. Experts say the VX nerve agent used to kill Kim was almost certainly produced in a sophisticated state weapons laboratory, and North Korea is widely believed to possess large quantities of chemical weapons. In Beijing, a North Korean diplomat said Thursday that the killing was a political conspiracy engineered by Washington and Seoul.  Pak Myong Ho, a minister at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing, said the death was a ""despicable and extremely dangerous'' plot by the US and South Korea aimed at smearing North Korea's image and subverting its regime.","dna from his son ,malaysian officials said thursday ,malaysia local media reported ,was killed last month ,hamidi said police confirmed","['malaysian', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Malaysia', 'Ahmad Zahid Hamidi', 'Kim', 'Malaysia', 'Kim', 'Kim Chol']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40816271  1.06630528

Once the strategy is finalized, the White House is expected to pass it to government agencies handling the problem, rather than making it public, they said.According to the Wall Street Journal report, Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland convened a meeting two weeks ago with national security officials across the government and asked them to put forward proposal on how to deal with the North, ""including ideas that one official described as well outside the mainstream.""The request was for all options, ranging from US recognition of North Korea as a nuclear state to military action against Pyongyang and McFarland's directive was for the administration to undergo a comprehensive rethink of America's North Korea policy, the paper reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the process.This week, officials reported back to the White House with their ideas and suggestions, the paper said. In recent discussions with allies, US officials have also underscored the possible military dimensions of their emerging strategy, including when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the US earlier this month for talks with Trump.During Abe's visit, US officials told Japanese officials that all options were under consideration, the paper said. Sources were also quoted as saying that it was clear to Japanese officials that those options ""encompassed a US military strike on North Korea, possibly if Pyongyang appeared ready to test an ICBM.""Trump has expressed significant concern about North Korea.After North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile, Trump said it ""won't happen"" for the North to develop a nuclear missile capable of striking the US homeland.Trump's concern deepened after the North fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Feb. 12. In a media interview last week, Trump said he is ""very angry"" at the North's missile launch, and that it's too late to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He called the situation ""very dangerous"" and said China can solve the problem ""very easily if they want to."" In a dinner with reporters on Monday, Trump also called the North ""a world menace"" that should be dealt with soon.Earlier this month, he called the North ""a big, big problem,"" a ""really, really important"" subject, and said he will deal with it ""very strongly.""

It allows such objects to be sensed and controlled remotely.North Korea has a track record of waging cyberattacks against the South in recent years. North Korea launched a cyberattack against South Korea in July 2009, two months after its second nuclear test. It also hacked South Korean media organizations in March 2013, a month after its third nuclear test.","science ministry said tuesday ,gov to monitor cyberattacks ,ministry said tuesday ,ministry said tuesday set ,tuesday set of measures","['the Ministry of Science', 'ICT', 'Future Planning', 'the Korea Internet and Security Agency']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29556203  0.30997235

Malaysian police named eight North Koreans, including a diplomat, as suspects, though Pyongyang denies its involvement. ""There have been moves to redesignate the North , but momentum was not created,"" the senior official said on background. ""Due to the North's recent moves, I think the momentum  would be strengthened.""A House bill has already been submitted that calls for adding the North to the terrorism list, he said.The recent killing, coupled with the North's test-firing of an intermediate-range ballistic missile earlier this month, has raised fresh calls in Congress for putting the communist regime back on to the list of states sponsoring terrorism.On Wednesday, Sen. Cory Gardner, a leading voice in Congress for greater pressure on Pyongyang, called for the North's redesignation, telling Yonhap News Agency that the murder ""is yet another reminder of North Korea's brutality.""The North was put on the US terrorism sponsor list for its 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Airlines flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the US administration of former President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Last month, Rep. Ted Poe introduced a bill in the House of Representatives calling for adding the North to the terrorism list.

Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il, was killed at an airport in Malaysia last Monday after two Asian women sprayed an unidentified poisonous substance in his face. He was at the airport for a flight to Macau to return home.Malaysian police said Sunday that at least five North Korean suspects appeared to be involved in Kim's death.Police arrested Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old North Korean man, on Friday night following the arrest of three others, including the two Asian women. They said they are looking for four more North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of Kim's death.South Korea's unification ministry said Sunday that it believes the North Korean regime is behind the murder of Kim as the five suspects are North Korean nationals.The ministry said that Seoul is closely watching the latest ""reckless and horrible"" incident with grave concern, given North Korea's record of involvement in terrorist acts and crimes against humanity. ""It is highly likely that the North Korean regime is behind the assassination,"" Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo told foreign correspondents in Seoul on Monday.""The whole world has already regarded the North Korean regime with suspicion from the very beginning of this incident.""Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn called on government officials Monday to seek international cooperation to make North Korea ""pay a due price for its terrorist act.""Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, declined to comment on what consequences Pyongyang would face. But he raised the need to stay alert against North Korea's possible security threats, citing its latest test of a new ballistic missile.""We could clearly understand the latest incident reaffirmed the unpredictability and brutality of the North Korean regime,"" Jeong told a press briefing Monday.Malaysia's foreign ministry recalled its top envoy to Pyongyang and summoned North Korea's Ambassador to Kuala Lumpur Kang Chol on Monday in connection with Kim's death.   Following the closed-door meeting with Malaysian officials, Kang told reporters that North Korea ""cannot trust the investigation by the Malaysian police.The diplomat accused the police investigation of being politically driven, demanding that Malaysia allow a joint probe into the murder with the North Korean government. He also claimed that South Korea conspired with the Malaysian government to lay the blame on Pyongyang.Kang said Friday that North Korea won't accept the result of the autopsy as it was performed without Pyongyang officials in attendance.He demanded that Malaysia immediately hand over his body, accusing Malaysia of trying to deceive Pyongyang and colluding with what he calls ""hostile forces"" to do the North harm.Malaysian police said Sunday they would give two weeks to Kim's next of kin to claim his body.","wednesday report malaysia ,autopsy on north korean ,news report showed monday ,reporters that the autopsy ,as wednesday report malaysia","['Malaysia', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Malaysia', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Reuters', 'Malaysia', 'Noor Rashid Ibrahim']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45360687  0.66187143

Kim Jong-nam, 46, was targeted Monday in the shopping concourse at the airport and had not gone through immigration yet for his flight to Macau, said the senior government official, who spoke on co...","The half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was assassinated at an airport in Kuala Lumpur, telling medical workers before he died that he had been attacked with a chemical spray, a Malaysian official said Tuesday. Kim Jong-nam, 46, was targeted Monday in the shopping concourse at the airport and had not gone through immigration yet for his flight to Macau, said the senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case involves sensitive diplomacy. He was taken to the airport clinic and then died on the way to the hospital, the official said.  Kim Jong-nam Kim Jong-nam was estranged from his younger brother, the North Korean leader. He had been tipped by outsiders to succeed their dictator father, but reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He was believed to have been living recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia.Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said Kim Jong-nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents. They fled in a taxi and were being sought by Malaysian police, the reports said.A Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a 46-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970. “Investigation is in progress and a post mortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said.Ken Gause, at the CNA think tank in Washington who has studied North Korea’s leadership for 30 years, said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong-nam has traveled under. He is believed to have been born May 10, 1971, although birthdays are always unclear for senior North Koreans, Gause said.Mark Tokola, vice president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in Seoul, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong-nam was not killed on the orders of his brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong-nam in the past.“It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un,” Tokola wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his brother.In Washington, the State Department said it was aware of reports of Kim Jong-nam’s death but declined to comment, referring questions to Malaysian authorities.The reported killing came as North Korea celebrated its latest missile launch, which foreign experts were analyzing for evidence of advancement in the country’s missile capabilities. For the next several days, North Korea will be marking the birthday of its late leader Kim Jong-il, the brothers’ father, though they have different mothers. The major holiday this Thursday is called the “Day of the Shining Star” and will be feted with figure skating and synchronized swimming exhibitions, fireworks and mass rallies.Since taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a “reign of terror.” The most spectacular was the 2013 execution by anti-aircraft fire of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, once considered the country’s second-most-powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason.Gause said Kim Jong-nam had been forthright that he did not have political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his brother’s legitimacy in the past.Kim Jong-nam had been less outspoken since 2011, when North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot him in Macau, Gause said, though the details of the attempted killing are murky. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organize a hit-and-run accident targeting Kim Jong-nam in China in 2010.Despite the attempts on his life, Kim Jong-nam had reportedly traveled to North Korea since then, so it was assumed he was no longer under threat. Kim Jong-nam may have become more vulnerable as his defender in the North Korean hierarchy, Kim Kyong Hui _ Kim Jong-un’s aunt and the husband of his executed uncle, Jang Song-thaek _ appears to have fallen from favor or died. She has not been seen in public for more than three years, Gause said.Kim Jong-il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong-nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong-chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong-un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended Eric Clapton concerts in London in 2015. It’s unclear what positon he has in the North Korean government. A younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, was named a member of the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. She has a position in a propaganda and agitation department and is known as Kim Jong-un’s gatekeeper, Gause said.While the most likely explanation for the killing was that Kim Jong-un was removing a potential challenger to North Korean leadership within his own family, he could also be sending a warning to North Korean officials to demonstrate the reach of the regime. It follows the defection last year of a senior diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in London who has spoken of his despair at Kim’s purges.Evans Revere, a former US diplomat and specialist on East Asia, said the killing did not mean the North Korean regime was unstable. He said it showed Kim Jong-un’s brutal control and ability to eliminate opponents or perceived opponents. Victor Cha, a former White House director for Asian affairs, disagreed. “He sacks the minister of state security last month and now kills the elder brother.  Doesn’t look so stable to me,” Cha said.","brother slain at airport ,korea leader brother slain ,slain at airport malaysia ,assassinated at an airport ,malaysian official said tuesday","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'malaysian', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Macau']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17938308  0.59642178

The leaders of South Korea and the US, too, would not be able to bear massive risks to strike such a deal at a time when they lack any authority or mechanism to inspect the reclusive country. “It’s never about the quantity or quality of incentives. … Kim will never engage in any act that may pose threats to his long-term rule,” he said, referring to offers from Russia and China to build a gas pipeline and railroad running through the peninsula from there. The one-day seminar also brought together dozens of former top policymakers and prominent scholars at home and from the US, China, Japan and Russia. They trade views on the prospects for the security situation in Northeast Asia and especially on the Korean Peninsula in the face of evolving North Korean threats and the Donald Trump leadership. Lee Sang-hyun, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, said Pyongyang is presumed to have expanded its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to 280 kilograms and weapons-grade plutonium to 52 kilograms, with its arsenal reaching as many as 45 nuclear bombs. “Given the stockpile estimates and that one nuclear warhead generally requires 2-6 kilograms of plutonium or 15-20 kilograms of HEU, it’s possible for North Korea to have built 22-45 nuclear weapons,” Lee said. “Especially if nuclear boosting technologies are employed, it would help with not only the warheads’ miniaturization but also in making more weapons with relatively small amounts of nuclear materials.”Lee Sang-hyun, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute Ruan Zhongzhe, vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, expressed concerns over uncertainties posed by the new US administration, calling it “Trump shock.” The past Barack Obama administration’s Asia policy, which focused on alliance-building “raised more questions than answers” by leaving the peninsula “more divided” and fanning military tension. The plan to station a US missile shield here has “antagonized” two powers -- China and Russia -- and “divided“ the neighbors, he said, calling it a “wrong answer” to address the North Korean nuclear issues.Yet Trump has “gotten much further than ever before,” taking advantage of the uncertainties as “weapons to scare almost everyone,” he said.“As a matter of fact, everybody is confused and confounded because of the huge ‘Trump shock.’ What would be the US’ future foreign policy is really unknown,” Zhongzhe said. “Furthermore, Trump’s ‘America First’ slogan has brought a backlash form the rest of the world. That kind of protectionist rhetoric goes against globalization and economic integration in East Asia.” Despite signs of US-Russia rapprochement that may result in China’s withered clout, he said Beijing remains open to greater bilateral and trilateral cooperation. “ US-Russia relationship is not against anybody else -- it’s motivated by domestic needs,” Zhongze said. “There’s no zero-sum game here, I don’t have much concerns. On the contrary, I’d love to see a friendly, positive relationship between Washington and Moscow.” Thomas Spoehr, director of national defense at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, acknowledged the Trump factor, raising concerns about a potential reemergence of voices in South Korea for a reintroduction of US tactical weapons or creation of its own nuclear program Spoehr pointed as another challenge to the impeachment campaign against President Park Geun-hye, which may lead to a reversal of decisions such as on the missile shield deployment. He also called for Seoul and Tokyo to overcome historical tension and “cooperate and counteract” in the face of uncertainties.By Shin Hyon-hee","great fraud any restart ,nuclear program massive political ,korean diplomat said thursday ,program massive political risks ,great fraud due to","['Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'US', 'north korean', 'London']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49741185  0.47926429

Former Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae Friday marks the first anniversary of Seoul's shutdown of the complex in North Korea's border city of Kaesong in response to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests early last year.South Korea did not close the factory zone even when North Korea staged deadly attacks against the country in 2010. But in April 2013, Pyongyang abruptly shut it down for about five months, citing what it called heightened tension sparked by a joint military drill between Seoul and Washington.Ryoo said it is regrettable that the complex was shut down, given that the government made an effort to resume operations in 2013.The former minister said that he suspects the existence of a behind-the-scenes power broker as the decision-making process at the National Security Council did not appear to smoothly go.His remarks appear to be aimed at Choi Soon-sil, who is the long-time friend of President Park and is at the center of the corruption scandal that led to Park's impeachment in December. Choi, who holds no government post, allegedly received and edited drafts of presidential speeches before they were publicly delivered.""Major decisions over diplomacy, security and inter-Korean affairs are made at sessions of the NSC,"" he said. ""After the NSC's session, details over policy are decided, but this process did not seem to proceed smoothly.""South Korea's unification ministry earlier dismissed allegations that Choi influenced Seoul's decision to shut down the Kaesong complex, saying that the decision reflected strict security concerns.","unification minister said thursday ,south korean unification minister ,closure of the park ,minister calls for resumption ,minister said thursday","['south korean', 'inter - korean', 'weekSeoul', 'the Kaesong Industrial Complex', 'inter - korean', 'Unification', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4026739   0.31298456

""It's not an easy process to say exactly what WTO rules are in breach,"" the official said.The South Korean government, moreover, is trying to determine which actions taken by Beijing were in retaliation for THAAD or part of a growing discriminatory treatment of foreign companies in general, the official added.","retaliation official south korea ,ranking official said tuesday ,china recent trade actions ,china recent trade ,currently reviewing if china","['South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'US', 'the World Trade Organization', 'chinese']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.4692111   0.59180498

The case came to light as a result of a nationwide survey on children who failed to enroll for school in time or had been absent from school for a long time.The death sparked public anger and demands for the education authorities to increase monitoring for child abuse to respond more proactively to long absences from school.  According to the ministry, elementary schools nationwide will gather information about would-be enrollees through preliminary meetings in February and will take steps to deal with children whose whereabouts are not accounted for by then. The school will first try to contact parents or guardians, and if this is not possible, will ask the district office’s social welfare manager to visit the children at their registered addresses.“Authorities will closely cooperate with the police as well when something strange is discovered,” the ministry said.  The number of reported child abuse cases has nearly doubled over the last 10 years in South Korea.

Russian President Vladimir Putin In July, South Korea and the United States announced a plan to set up a THAAD battery by the end of this year to better cope with the growing military threats from North Korea. China and Russia have strongly opposed the plan, saying it could hurt their strategic security interests.Earlier in the day, US Defense Secretary James Mattis visiting Seoul reiterated Washington's stance, saying that deploying the THAAD anti-missile unit to South Korea is to protect America's allies and its own troops.Timonin said he does not want to elaborate on what impact the THAAD deployment will have on Russia-South Korea relations, adding that Moscow is still hoping that the decision could be withdrawn. The ambassador, however, made it clear that the reason why Russia is opposed to THAAD is because it is regarded as part of the US' global missile defense system that surrounds its own borders. ""We see it as a threat to our national security,"" he said.He admitted that the cacophony over THAAD could affect Russia-South Korea relations but still drew attention to the importance of economic cooperation between the two countries, hinting that the impact will not go as far as to hurt their ties in business.""Our bilateral economic cooperation is important as much as the THAAD issue. It could be more important than that,"" he said, adding in Korean, ""Don't worry.""Regarding the North, he reiterated Russia's commitment to UNSC resolutions adopted to penalize Pyongyang for its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons but underlined the need for talks, as well as trying to find a ""peaceful"" solution.""Russia is willing to take every possible measure in accordance with UNSC resolutions and no progress has been made in cooperation with the North in military and political areas,"" he pointed out.

Mattis made the remarks during a five-minute press briefing before he began talks with Defense Minister Han Min-koo, which began at 9:40 a.m., to discuss ways to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region at the defense ministry in Seoul.The retired Marine Corps general arrived here on Thursday for a two-day visit for talks with top Seoul officials. On Thursday, he met with South Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to underscore the ""priority"" that the Donald Trump administration places on the South Korea-US alliance. US defense secretary James Mattis and foreign minister Yun Byung-se shake hands It is his first overseas trip since he took office less than two weeks ago. The US' decision to select South Korea as the first stop in its defense secretary's first overseas trip clearly shows the new US government's full commitment to the defense of South Korea and its allies, Han said. ""The defense ministers' talks here in itself indicates trusted bonds between the allies and will definitely serve as a stern warning toward the provocative North,"" he said. Mentioning ways to counter saber-rattling by North Korea, Mattis said, ""Due to North Korea's threatening rhetoric and destabilizing behavior, we are taking defensive steps like deploying the highly effective THAAD anti-missile unit to South Korea to protect its people and our troops that stand with our ally."" In July 2016, Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy the THAAD system to South Korea this year to better defend against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. But China has opposed the deployment on concerns that the move could hurt its strategic security interests. The US has repeatedly stressed that the system is defensive and aimed only at deterring North Korean threats. In other efforts, Mattis stressed the need to expand ""trilateral venues of cooperation with Japan, where the mutual defense of the three countries is best served through teamwork.""In November, Seoul and Japan formally signed the information sharing accord, known as the General Security of Military Information Agreement, the first military pact between them since South Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. Washington welcomed the deal as it expects to bolster security cooperation among the three countries as a counterbalance to China's rise. ""The United States stands by its commitments -- and we stand with our allies. Our alliance is a testament to mutual commitment and respect, and it is a linchpin of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,"" Mattis said.He is scheduled to depart for Japan Friday afternoon after paying his respects to the National Cemetery in southern Seoul. Tensions are running high on the Korean Peninsula after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's Day address the country is close to test-firing an intercontinental ballistic missile. Last year alone, Pyongyang conducted two nuclear tests and test-fired 24 ballistic missiles to achieve its stated goal of developing an nuclear-tipped long-range missile that could strike parts of the US mainland.","friday reiterated washington security ,korea uses nuclear weapons ,ironclad any attack ,to seoul and vowed ,if korea uses nuclear","['US', 'James Mattis', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'the United States']",26,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.62910402  0.83161908

He added its stance on the matter ""remains unchanged."" State prosecutors, who handed over the case to the independent counsel team last year, attempted to raid the presidential compound. But the presidential office denied them entry, citing security concerns, and instead voluntarily turned over some documents requested by the prosecutors.The probe team reiterated that it will carry out the raid based on relevant law, regardless of the presidential office's stance.  This file photo, taken on Nov. 30, 2016, shows a group of tourists looking at the main gate of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. Its spokesman Lee Kyu-chul said during a regular press briefing that the offices of senior presidential secretaries, the medical room and the security service office can all be subject to its shakedown.Under the country's law, military facilities and other areas that handle confidential information cannot be raided without approval from the person in charge of the location. Yet, the law also prohibits the person from refusing to grant such consent unless it infringes upon key national interests.The two sides are in talks over when and how to carry out a face-to-face interrogation of Park, who is now awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on her impeachment. She has been accused of letting her close friend Choi Soon-sil meddle in state affairs and amass personal profits using her ties to the president.Both Park and Choi have been flatly denying the allegations. The spokesman Lee earlier said it plans to complete the questioning by early this month.

UN Security Council ministerial-level open debate on conflict prevention and sustaining peace held in January Pak Chan-mo, an honorary president of the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, said in an interview with Voice of America that the university's students have been unable to leave for the European countries due to the visa issuance refusal. ""We are considering ways to send them to Brazil, Russia or China rather than Europe down the road,"" Pak was quoted as saying.According to VOA, the students gained admission to universities such as the University of Gottingen in Germany and the University of Sannio and University of Brescia in Italy, but their plans to study abroad fell through due to the governments of these countries refusing to issue them student visas. In an email to VOA, the German foreign ministry said it is a basic rule for the German government to receive North Korean students in areas of study where the two countries have a mutual understanding. The ministry, however, has decided not to accept North Korean students in particular fields of study that might help the North's development of nuclear weapons, missiles and weapons of mass destruction.In March last year, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution subjecting North Korea to the harshest round of sanctions ever after it carried out its fourth underground nuclear test in January and launched a rocket using ballistic missile technology the following month.Under the UN Security Council Resolution 2270, UN members are required to not provide North Koreans with education and training related to nuclear and missile development.Pak also said the imposition of the sanctions has put the university in dire straits, as it has received fewer donations than ever and faced difficulties in hiring professors.The university, which opened in 2009 after being jointly set up by North and South Korea, attempted to implement a plan to establish a medical college last year. But the financial difficulties compelled the school to ditch the plan. ""The opening of the school is virtually shelved as we have no remittances and ways to secure medical equipment due to the UN sanctions,"" said Ro Dae-yong, chief of the planned medical college.","university students report germany ,refused to issue visas ,students report germany italy ,students report germany ,wednesday un security council","['Germany', 'Italy', 'Poland', 'north korean', ""the UN Security Council 's"", 'US', 'UN Security Council', 'Chan - mo', 'the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51346868  0.51840389

""Our government is closely watching the relevant developments,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cho June-hyuck said at a regular press briefing here. ""If the media report turns out to be true, our position is that we will not tolerate Japan's unjustifiable sovereignty claims over Dokdo, which belongs to South Korea.""He added that the Japanese government should withdraw the plan immediately.Dokdo, which lies closer to South Korea in the East Sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, has long been a source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on the islets since 1954 and has made clear that Tokyo's claims are utterly groundless.Diplomatic tension between the two neighbors has deepened recently amid Tokyo's repeated claims over the islets.The Dokdo issue has also been intertwined with a row over a girl statue recently installed in front of Japan's consulate in South Korea's southern port city of Busan. The statue, the second of its kind after the one set up in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, has been a sensitive issue for Tokyo as it symbolizes its wartime sexual slavery of Korean women.Japan is demanding its immediate removal, while the South Korean government is keeping its distance, saying that it does not have the authority to interfere with actions taken by a civic group. In protest, Tokyo recalled its ambassador to Seoul. The top envoy has been absent from his post for more than 20 days.In particular, Japan has been renewing its territorial claims over Dokdo since a provincial council here pushed to install yet another statue on the islets.

""It appears that they have reduced ships  bound for Korea, as it has become difficult to get permission to travel to the country amid deepening tensions over THAAD.""Tianjin, along with Shanghai, are major Chinese ports from which cruise ships leave for South Korea, taking mostly Chinese tourists.Late last year, other cruise operators such as Princess Cruises and NCL took similar action by reducing their Korea-bound services from China significantly. This move is the latest in a series of what appears to be China's retaliatory measures against South Korea for its decision in July to allow the US anti-missile defense system called THAAD on its soil.China has openly opposed the decision, saying THAAD's powerful radar system could compromise its national security. South Korea and the US say that the deployment is intended only to target missiles from North Korea.Though China has not officially admitted to taking any retaliatory action, it is believed here that Beijing is getting tough on South Korea in many areas ranging from culture, entertainment and cosmetics to tourism. The tourist industry is one of the hardest hit, as China is said to have ordered Korea-bound tourists be reduced by around 20 percent, saying that it is part of efforts to cut down on low-cost traveling. It is also known to have rejected South Korean airlines' requests to fly chartered flights from China to Korea ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday.In the face of mounting pressure from China in the economic and business sectors, the Seoul government earlier said that it is preparing diverse countermeasures including possibly taking the THAAD row with China to the World Trade Organization.","spills over cruise trips ,beijing retaliatory steps against ,retaliatory steps against seoul ,industry sources said tuesday ,steps against seoul planned","['China', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'US', 'MSC', 'northeastern chinese', 'Tianjin', 'South Ko']",26,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.41791716  0.26881993

Pyo Chang-won of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea on Wednesday promised to make a public apology over the exhibition of a naked satirical portrait of President Park Geun-hye.His remark was deemed a move to quickly resolve the dispute before it inflicts a blow on the party’s leadership or its presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in ahead of the upcoming election.“I have been told that women were largely offended  and for this reason I shall make a sincere apology in public,” Rep. Pyo told reporters.“Artists are entitled to their freedom of expression but the exhibition not only brought shame on my party but also hurt the feelings of women.”Rep. Pyo Chang-won of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea on Wednesday answers to reporters' questions on the disputes concerning the exhibition of a satirical nude photomontage of President Park Geun-hye The first-term lawmaker had come under fire the previous day for holding a satirical art exhibition at a parliamentary building. The disputed piece, titled “Dirty Sleep,” showed Park lying down naked on a couch, in a parody of the renowned “Olympia” by French artist Edouard Monet.The event was the opposition lawmaker’s gesture to support the so-called “blacklist artists,” referring to those who were identified by the Park administration for their anti-government stance and excluded from subsidies and key projects.The allegation that the incumbent government kept under surveillance certain artists is considered a crucial factor in the ongoing investigation into the president’s wrongdoings.But despite its intention to depict Park’s dereliction of duty and her inappropriate ties with her confidante Choi Soon-sil, the photomontage piece immediately came under fire for its sexually discriminative portrayal of the female president.“This is not just misogyny but a disgrace to our nation’s dignity,” said Kim Sung-eun, a member of the ruling Saenuri Party’s emergency council, demanding the Democratic Party expel Rep. Pyo and the latter step down from his parliamentary seat.Kim also extended the blame to Moon, the opposition party’s former chairman, for recruiting Pyo ahead of the general election last year.“Moon, too, should express his apology and take active measures to calm the dispute.”The Bareun Party, which officially set sail Tuesday after splitting from Saenuri, also called for self-control and dignity in freedom of artistic expression. “Artists may certainly satirize politicians without restraint, but politicians should not make use of them for political purposes,” said Rep. Choung Byoung-gug, the newly elected chairman of the party.Facing disapproval from the political circle and the public, the Democratic Party also set about taking measures.“The party is considering holding a disciplinary meeting to decide on Rep. Pyo’s sanctions,” chief spokesperson Rep. Youn Kwan-suk told reporters.“We believe it will be best to round off the talks before the Lunar New Year holiday, as early as tomorrow if possible.”Floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho defined Rep. Pyo’s involvement in the exhibition as a “punishable act.”“If someone had drawn a nude painting of former President Roh Moo-hyun during his  impeachment, we would not have remained silent,” he said during a party meeting.The former liberal president was impeached in 2004 over allegedly breaching political neutrality but was later reinstated by the Constitutional Court.This was not the first time that Rep. Pyo -- a former professor at the National Police University -- has faced a dispute since he joined politics last year.Last year, he vowed to go public with a list of Saenuri lawmakers who voted against Park’s impeachment bill.More recently, he suggested that elected public posts should only be allowed to those aged 65 or under, apparently targeting potential conservative presidential candidate Ban Ki-moon, aged 72.His argument led to backlash from the conservative camp and their support base which said Rep. Pyo was discriminating against senior citizens.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition lawmaker to apologize ,apology over the exhibition ,satirical portrait of president ,presidential front runner moon ,korea on wednesday promised","['Pyo Chang - won', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon Jae - in']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49965161  0.41877833

Korean presidency,"Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s return home Thursday has brought him closer to his much anticipated bid for South Korean presidency, signaling a tough few months ahead for other presidential aspirants.

It also means a whole new political ordeal for the 72-year-old former diplomat, who now enters domestic politics for the first time as a rookie in the electoral game.Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks to reporters before boarding a flight at the JFK International Airport Ban’s greatest strength is undoubtedly the public’s recognition of his prestigious career as the first-ever South Korean national not only to take UN’s top post, but to have served in it for two consecutive terms.Also, his overseas position has largely kept him away from the political commotion here, particularly the extensive corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye, which might result in a premature end to the incumbent administration. But the longtime absence from his home country is also a weakness for Ban who, unlike his potential rivals, has had little time to gear up for the presidential election, which is likely to take place earlier than scheduled, possibly in around April. Who is Ban Ki-moon?Born in 1944, in Eumseong-gun in North Chungcheong Province, Ban began his career as a diplomat by passing the nation’s Foreign Service Examination in 1970.He swiftly built up his career in the Foreign Ministry and consecutively filled key posts such as director of American affairs and chief of foreign policy.But he faced challenges in 2001, when he was pushed to step down from a vice ministerial post, taking responsibility for aggravated Korea-US bilateral ties.Ban then took the post of protocol secretary for Han Seung-soo, then chairman of the UN general meeting -- a transfer deemed a demotion for a former vice minister.It was the former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun who brought Ban back to domestic affairs by appointing him as presidential assistant for foreign affairs in 2003.Though he was at times criticized for his allegedly excessive pro-US stance, Ban soon gained credit in the Roh administration for his negotiating skills, which he had the chance of proving over a number of diplomatic agendas. Of them was the six-party talks which kicked off in 2003 to address North Korea’s nuclear armament issue.Backed by the Roh government’s full-fledged support, Ban was named the 33rd secretary-general of the United Nations in 2006, becoming the first Korean to take the post.His elite career, along with his biography titled “Study Like a Fool, Dream Like a Prodigy,” has inspired South Korean youths over the years.Rising to the presidential raceThough his history largely associates him with the Roh government, Ban is known for his amicable ties with all South Korean presidents, regardless of their respective political tendencies. He is also noted as a rare high-profile civic servant who has served four separate administrations, from the military dictatorship of the Chun Doo-hwan government to the progressive Roh administration.It was such apparent neutrality, as well as his publicity, which made Ban an appealing presidential successor for President Park and her ruling conservative Saenuri Party. The plausibility of this happening expanded further, as most of the pro-Park figures lost their political momentum upon the party’s crushing defeat in the parliamentary election last year.Amid speculations on Ban’s likely bid for South Korea’s presidency, the UN chief official met with Park during her visit to the UN headquarters in 2015.His favorable remarks over the Saemaeul Movement -- one of Park’s flagship projects to develop rural areas -- and his close-door meetings with the president further boosted the rumors of his political aspirations after returning home.But with the president currently facing impeachment and the Saenuri camp divided in factional feuds, it is yet uncertain whether the diplomat will create a new political entity or join hands with existing groups.What seems to be certain is that the former UN official is determined to take on a political career upon returning home.“I am ready to give my all, if only my experience and insight from my 10 years in the UN may contribute to South Korea’s development,” Ban told Korean media correspondents late last year, just before his tenure was to end.Also, a group of his aides recently started a headquarters in Seoul and held a press conference there, boosting expectations of Ban’s imminent announcement on his presidential bid.Integrity tests lying aheadDespite the uncertainties and challenges, Ban nevertheless remains one of the top two front-runners to contend in the upcoming presidential election.For this reason, a number of political groups have increasingly been seeking to recruit him to their camp or at least to form solidarity in the election.Standing first in line is the Barun Party, which split away from Saenuri amid efforts to draw a line between the feud-ridden President Park and her loyalists.But a critical roadblock for Ban is the dispute concerning his integrity, as he is to face a public who is utterly disappointed and infuriated over the president’s corruption scandal.A survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter in the second week of January showed Ban to have 20.3 percent in approval rating, down 1.2 percentage points from the previous week. Moon Jae-in, former chairman and top presidential candidate of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, took the lead with 27.9 percent.Ban’s slight downtrend is attributable to the allegations, raised by a Seoul-based weekly magazine, Sisa Journal, that he received bribes worth $230,000 between 2005 and 2007.This scandal, combined with his brother and nephew’s indictment in New York -- also over bribery charges -- seems to have dampened the public’s enthusiasm over the returning diplomat.Another controversy for Ban is the UN resolution, which recommends retired secretary-generals to refrain from government posts in their home state for a while.Though the clause is considered non-binding, its underlying intention was enough to bring criticism on Ban for stepping into the presidential race immediately after his UN tenure.A number of opposition figures, such as Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung and South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung, have raised their voices to condemn what they see as Ban’s premature presidential ambition.By Bae Hyun-jung","korean presidency signaling tough ,year old former diplomat ,moon return home thursday ,new political ordeal for ,road to korean presidency","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon ’s', 'south korean', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48121151  0.55017483

""Also the country's exports to China, sales of weapons and all of its practice of collecting hard currency from overseas including repatriation of wages earned by laborers were squeezed."" The UNSC adopted the sanctions resolution 2270 the punish Pyongyang for its nuclear and missile tests conducted in early 2016. In November, it again slapped a set of sanctions to penalize North Korea for another underground nuclear weapons test in September. The institute's calculation is the same as that unveiled by the government on Dec. 2 following the announcement of its fresh unilateral sanctions against Pyongyang. ""North Korea is likely to further sustain foreign currency loss as the UNSC imposed a significant cap on Pyongyang's exports of coal by adopting resolution 2321 late last year,"" Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at Seoul's unification ministry, told a press briefing. The new sanctions were slapped to close loopholes found in the previous resolution, under which North Korea's coal exports for ""livelihood"" purposes were allowed, an exception that has been exploited by the country. More than 50,000 North Koreans are working overseas, mainly in China and Russia, and they are forced to send money earned back to the Pyongyang regime. The reclusive country is estimated to earn more than $200 million per year through labor exports. The report said that countries including China and Kuwait are tightening their regulations on North Korean workers' entry and stay in an apparent move to avoid employment of North Koreans. In the face of the hard currency squeeze, the North regime is pressing its officials and ordinary people give more money to the state, fueling more grievances, it said. ""It is important to consistently implement the sanctions as they affect the North Korean economy and the management of the regime,"" it added.","wednesday the sanctions dented ,sanctions dented north korea ,it hurt pyongyang exports ,the sanctions dented north ,currency loss for nine","['North Korea', 'the UN Security Council', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'China']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.45320764  0.55508327

Kim also said he is scheduled to hold meetings with other senior Trump administration officials but did not elaborate. Kim's visit came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's Day address last week that the country has reached the final stage of preparation to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile. The remark was a thinly veiled threat that Pyongyang is close to developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the continental US, after five underground nuclear blasts and a series of ballistic missile and rocket launches over the past decade. On the planned deployment of the USTHAAD missile defense system in the South, Kim said the deployment should go ahead as planned in an unwavering manner as the system is a defensive measure. Kim said he plans to convey this position to US officials. Kim's visit also came as historical tensions flared anew between South Korea and Japan over the installation of a girl's statue symbolizing victims of Tokyo's wartime sexual slavery in front of Japan's Consulate in the South. Japan has demanded the statue be removed, calling it a violation of the 2015 agreement that the two countries reached on resolving the sexual slavery issue. In protest, Tokyo has also recalled its ambassador from Seoul. Kim said the South intends to abide by the 2015 agreement.","with north korean threats ,in washington for meetings ,incoming us administration calling ,korea nuclear and missile ,sunday that north korea","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Security Office', 'Kim Kwan - jin', ""North Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'Kim', 'Washington', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'north korean']",26,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.58402693  0.65504014

Thae Yong-ho, who defected to South Korea in August while serving as a minister at North Korea's embassy in London, speaks about his defection and the reality of the Kim Jong-un regime during a meeting with a press corps covering the Unification Ministry at the government complex in Seoul on Dec. 27, 2016.  “North Korea has set the goal of developing miniaturized nuclear weapons that can fit atop a missile capable of reaching the US by the end of 2017 or early 2018 as it takes into account political transitions in South Korea and the US,” Thae said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency. “Whether North Korea test-fires an ICBM this year or its possible launch could be successful will depend on Seoul and Washington‘s response to this issue,” he added.Pyongyang is known to be developing a road-mobile ICBM, known as the KN-08, which may have a range of more than 13,000 kilometers, making it sufficient to hit the US. The North has yet to carry out a test of the missile.North Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year following other tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013. It also launched more than 20 ballistic missiles including intermediate-range Musudan missiles and those launched from a submarine.Pyongyang claims that it has the technology to make a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a missile, but many military experts have said the repressive regime is still a few years away from mastering such a capability.“Kim’s message indicates that North Korea has completed the development of mid-range missiles with only  ICBMs being left. It raises questions over what Seoul and Washington will do,” Thae said.In his New Year’s speech, the North’s leader vowed to bolster the country’s capacity to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes if South Korea and the US do not suspend their annual joint military exercises.Thae said the North will say it has the intention to freeze nuclear and missile programs if Seoul and Washington halt the military drills and lift sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.“But even in that situation, North Korea will not put a satellite launch on the negotiation table,” he said, referring to a long-range rocket launch.This will permit it to develop the necessary technology for ICBMs while claiming it is only developing space vehicles for peaceful purposes, he added.Thae has recently started public activity in earnest since he defected to South Korea in late July with his wife and two sons. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un His defection has attracted considerable attention, as it showed that even North Korean elites are becoming disillusioned with the country.He said North Korean diplomats live on a tight budget at their overseas missions with even ambassadors receiving monthly salaries of $900-$1,100.They are also under high pressure to send hard currency to North Korea as Pyongyang’s foreign currency earnings are being squeezed by tough sanctions.“North Korea does not have a system to support medical bills. ... North Korean diplomats cannot even think of getting regular medical checkups,” Thae said, citing the example of North Korean top envoy to Italy Kim Chun-guk who died of liver cancer last year.“If  wants to receive proper treatment, money equivalent to the whole budget for an overseas mission is needed,” he said.Touching on international sanctions, Thae said that their effectiveness could be gauged by a change in the sentiment of ordinary North Koreans and the North’s policy failure, not just by statistical numbers.The United Nations Security Council imposed stringent sanctions on North Korea twice last year to punish it for its nuclear and missile provocations.Thae said that the set of sanctions put severe strain on Kim Jong-un’s policy enforcement including the construction of a new developed district in Pyongyang, named “Ryomyong Street.”“Whether sanctions will be further strengthened hinges on China. ... I think that Seoul and Washington should mobilize all available means to stifle North Korea with sanctions including a secondary boycott,” Thae said of penalizing third-country entities involved in business dealings with Pyongyang.The former minister said the North Korean regime ostensibly stands on firm footing, but ordinary North Koreans are waging a form of “resistance” in economic areas.“Despite crackdowns in markets, North Koreans are vehemently resisting security officials’ move to take away what they sell,” Thae said. “North Koreans are aware that as their leader and the ruling party cannot protect them, they should find their own way for survival.”He stressed the need to make outside information available to more North Koreans to help them to know the reality of the regime.“An inflow of outside information needs to focus on revealing the fallacy of the Kim family’s three-generation succession and doubts about Kim Jong-un’s identity as royal blood,” he added.As Thae has started a new life here, he showed willingness to visit the US to speak of North Korea’s nuclear problems to Americans and policymakers.“I will not hesitate to visit the US if my trip helps  get to know North Korea’s real intent to develop nuclear weapons and establish its North Korea policy in a reasonable and precise manner.”Thae said he hopes to devote his life to bringing forward inter-Korean unification, regardless of whether a liberal or conservative administration takes office in South Korea.“I will make efforts to save Korean people from a possible disaster coming from Pyongyang’s nuclear aspirations and liberate North Koreans living like slaves from their regime,” he added.","korean defector said sunday ,2017 ex diplomat north ,to complete icbm development ,accelerating its nuclear weapons ,said sunday north korea","['North Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un']",26,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.58210337  0.67380393

Song Young-gil of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea is currently visiting China. The group, which includes Park Sun-won, a former unification and security secretary to former President Roh Moo-hyun, said it would address Beijing’s ongoing economic retaliation against the plan to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system But the trip has kindled backlash, as the party has adopted opposition to the THAAD program as part of its platform. The ruling Saenuri Party and other lawmakers, such as Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the to-be-launched New Conservative Party for Reform, likened the visit to “selling out the country.”  The outrage intensified after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the delegation Thursday the deployment process should be “delayed and frozen” if South Korea wants to expand cooperation with Beijing. If Seoul accelerates the process, it will “provoke” China, which is “unwise and not good,” Wang said. “Any issue subject to military and national sovereignty cannot be compromised in any case anywhere. Their act of humiliating diplomacy shows that it’s extremely dangerous to entrust national security to such people,” Yoo said at a party meeting Thursday.  “If you set this kind of diplomatic precedent, China would seek to damage our sovereignty again with financial pressure. China knows well about our internal situation and is trying to divide, alienate and shake us.”  Saenuri Party Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik also slammed the lawmakers for “bargaining” over the nation’s military sovereignty.  “The Democratic Party lawmakers simply asked to lift the retaliatory measures on trade without presenting their own position on the THAAD issue, which represents absurd, humiliating diplomacy beyond toadyism that they try to barter national security in return for money,” he said at a separate party meeting. Seoul‘s Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Hyoung-zhin called in Chinese Ambassador Qiu Guohong earlier in the day apparently to raise issue with Wang’s remarks and also discuss illegal fishing by Chinese ships and this year’s 25th anniversary of bilateral ties.  “The envisioned deployment of the THAAD system is a sovereign, self-defensive measure to defend national security and people’s lives from North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said at a regular news briefing.  “We believe that any certain issue must not affect the development of a bilateral relationship and economic, cultural and people-to-people exchanges should be steadily improved and strengthened.” After years of cordiality, relations between Seoul and Beijing have been icy since the THAAD deployment decision was announced last July.   Signs of economic retaliation have also risen, along with complaints from South Korean businesses in China. Cultural exports have taken a direct hit, with rumors of an unofficial ban on Hallyu spreading.  Meanwhile, China has since virtually brushed off requests for related discussions from Seoul and its embassy in Beijing. Ambassador Kim Jang-soo last met with Wang during a visit by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn in June.  Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se has said the government is working to devise intra-agency steps to cope with Beijing’s perceived retaliation.  The progressive party also triggered criticism when six of its first-term legislators traveled to Beijing in August last year.  During their three-day stay, the delegation held a seminar with a state-run think tank and a dinner meeting with scholars. On Friday, it is scheduled to meet with Kim Jang-soo and Fu Ying, a former vice foreign minister who now chairs the foreign affairs committee of the National People’s Congress, before returning home.  By Shin Hyon-hee","over lawmakers china visit ,controversy brews over lawmakers ,beijing taken by opposition ,brews over lawmakers china ,shunning official diplomatic consultations","['Beijing', 'chinese', 'South Korea ’s', 'US', 'Song Young', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'China', 'Park Sun - won']",26,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58851475  0.24576314

It also launched around 20 ballistic missiles in 2016 including the intermediate-range Musudan and those launched from a submarine.The United Nations Security Council slapped tough sanctions on the North twice for its nuclear tests in January and September.Thae Yong-ho, a high-profile North Korean defector and former ranking diplomat, said last week that the North's leader is determined to complete the development of nuclear weapons by the end of 2017.Last year, inter-Korean ties fell to one of the lowest points due to North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations.In February, Seoul shut down a joint industrial complex in the North's border city of Kaesong, ending the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.The government said that North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons should take precedence if the two Koreas are to hold meaningful dialogue.""North Korea does not seem to have an interest in denuclearization, as Kim's New Year message showed. At the current stage, we are not considering proposing dialogue to the North,"" Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo told reporters.
