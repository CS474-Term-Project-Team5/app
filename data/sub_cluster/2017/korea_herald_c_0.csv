Former lawmaker Chung Bong-ju The list came as somewhat a surprise as many had hoped, if not expected, the list to include those close to President Moon Jae-in, such as Lee Kwang-jae, a former lawmaker and governor of Gangwon Province who also worked as a presidential secretary under the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, along with Moon.The Cheong Wa Dae official said Lee would not have made it onto the list as the president has pledged to exclude anyone convicted of corruption from receiving a special pardon.Lee was convicted in 2011 of receiving illegal political funds in 2009.""This time, the government excluded those convicted of election law violations as a basic principle,"" the Cheong Wa Dae official said.The list included Chung Bong-ju, a former lawmaker convicted of election law violations for raising false corruption allegations against former President Lee Myung-bak ahead of the 2007 presidential election.The Cheong Wa Dae official explained Chung was the only politician left not reinstated from convictions from the 2007 election, while all else have been pardoned and thus reinstated through two special pardons under the former Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.","444 convicts to be pardoned ,lawmaker convicted of election law ,corruption allegations against former president ,said friday the special pardon ,former lawmaker convicted of election","['the Justice Ministry', 'Chung Bong - ju', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee Kwang - jae', 'Gangwon Province', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Chung Bong - ju', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Chung', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun']",2,"[ 1.          2.          1.         ... -0.30768317 -0.01278514

Instead of playing with friends during break, students are pushed to excel academically by volunteering, attending foreign language camps and preparing for next semester’s classes. Children have no time to spare, as parents organize activities that take place throughout the day, while asking them to maintain good health, a sound mind and autonomy. All of this may be asking too much of children to handle all at once. On Dec. 17, I flew to Tokyo, Japan, to hear and learn more about the experience of a community and the revival of cities. I was able to ponder about the meaning of “space and free time” after visiting Shibuya’s Haru-no-ogawa Adventure Park and Tokyo Toy Museum.  President of Gyeonggi Do Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning Kim Gyeong-pyoHaru-no-ogawa Play Park was established in 2004, when CEO Komizu realized his dream of offering children a place to roam freely, play creatively in nature and think independently. The park is located within a residential section of Shibuya, Toyko, allowing parents and children to walk to the park conveniently. Parents do not have a role in this park as children run around barefoot and roll around in the dirt. In contrast to Korean children, the Japanese children play around with tools, such as saws and hammers, or fire, which might be banned from playgrounds in Korea. Some children create their own secret hideout using different tools. Despite the potential danger posed by these tools, Shibuya’s adventure park has been safely managed for 13 years, mainly due to play leaders who are always there for the children. Play leaders are responsible for watching the children play. They also play with them sometimes and eliminate danger, such as nails sticking out from the ground. When a child gets hurt, play leaders must respond quickly with emergency medical attention to protect the child. The play park also provides parents with free time. Adults can gather in small groups to share their daily life experiences and enjoy leisure activities. Both children and parents can benefit from the space and free time outside of their busy schedules. Tokyo Toy Museum allows the same benefits of space and free time. Rebuilt from a school that closed down years ago, the museum welcomes 150,000 visitors annually. All toys housed in the museum are hand-crafted out of trees grown in Japan by professional toy craftsmen. Situated at the city’s core, the museum provides a space where children and parents can play with trees. Here, children can touch anything, lie down, sit and roam freely. Parents are there to merely watch out for their children’s safety. This is exactly what I mean by a “museum with space.” Instead of play leaders, Tokyo Toy Museum hires volunteer workers, who are mostly parents living in the neighborhood. “The greatest assets of our museum is the relationship between the volunteer and children as well as volunteer and parents,” the museum’s director said. As a child grows up, the relationships that are kept intact through many years essentially foster support among neighbors and the community. Boasting a decade of experience, both places succeeded in bolstering ties with nearby schools and currently manage schools through an extensive play-education program. This partnership in turn created a close-knit social network in the neighborhood and allowed everyone to feel included. Many countries including Japan have started to embrace the revival of cities and communities, using old, abandoned schools and transforming them into cultural places. The adventure park and toy museum overlap in their key principle of “we raise our own children,” handing the residents of neighborhoods the power of control and responsibility. Both places reflect what residents have always wished for -- free time and space in their busy lives. Furthermore, by enjoying the space, people can start focusing on the vital relationships in their lives. To know when a village with “space” is successful, it is important for all local residents to feel at home when visiting these public spaces and to be able to forget at least temporarily the difficulties of everyday life. If various facilities provide the right space efficiently, then the absence of a revival program itself could become a program. A “program-less program” could allow residents to nurture their creativity and freedom. Therefore, I hope a village of this kind can be established around us, enriching our lives with warmth.

The examinations had been scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. but were delayed by a few hours as it took more time to review medical records and interview family members.The bodies were examined in the order the babies received CPR treatment, officials said. Five doctors were assigned to the case, with three of them jointly examining the bodies one by one and the two others continuing to review medical records, said Yang Kyoung-moo, chief of the forensic medical team at the NFS Seoul Institute.""As it's been well known, we have a shortage of forensic doctors. But we assigned as many doctors to the case as possible because this is a case shocking to the medical society, and there is a high interest among the people,"" Yang said.Possible causes could include viral or bacterial infections, malfunctioning incubators or medical malpractice. Earlier, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that bacterial infections could have caused the deaths, citing results of blood culture tests conducted before the babies died.Officials said it will take about a month before the full autopsy results are finalized.The Seoul city government, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health authorities are also conducting examinations on the hospital's ICU for newborns.Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon ordered a thorough and swift investigation to determine the cause.""A tragic incident that shouldn't have happened has happened.

The equatorial country -- hence the name “Ecuador” -- offers the rule of law, political stability, a dollar-based growing economy, and an abundance of natural resources, Ecuadorian Minister of International Trade, Pablo Campana Saenz said in an interview with local media on Dec. 5.“Our government under President Lenin Moreno is leading our country based on pragmatism, and considers Korea one of our strategic economic partners,” he said at the Ecuadorian Embassy in Seoul.“Ecuador is a land of opportunity for Korean conglomerates, small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs. We are trying to make Ecuador a hub of investment in Latin America, particularly in the services, tourism, and hospitality and hotel industries.”Ecuadorian Minister of International Trade, Pablo Campana Saenz , speaks to local media alongside Ecuadorian Ambassador to Korea Oscar Herrera Gilbert at the embassy in Seoul on Dec. 5. During his visit here, Campana met with governmental, political and financial leaders, as well as corporate executives in hydroelectricity, hydro resources, mineral resources, construction, airports and other sectors.He encouraged investments by presenting portfolios worth over $20 billion unveiled by the government. He proposed finishing negotiations on the Strategic Economic Cooperation Agreement before the Group of 20 Summit in Argentina in July next year, to which Korean President Moon Jae-in has been invited. In particular, Campana elicited Korean companies to participate in the planned construction of Pacifico Eloy Alfaro Refinery and Petrochemical Complex near Manta on the Pacific Coast through a consortium. The scheme will be the region’s largest petroleum refinery, producing over 300,000 barrels of refined oil daily. Opportunities for bilateral economic cooperation also lie in processed food, petrochemicals, energy and mining, according to the businessman-turned-bureaucrat. Campana was a professional tennis player prior to launching a career in business. He was a national player partnering Nicolas Lapentti in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, as well as playing in the Davis Cup. He achieved business success in sugarcane, soft drinks, real estate and other sectors prior to joining the government in May.Although Ecuador is not sizeable, it has a diverse climate with four topographical regions -- the Pacific coast; Andean and Inter-Andean highlands called the Sierra; Amazon jungles; and the Galapagos Islands, he noted. “You can move from one region to another in one hour by plane, with each region providing strong climatic characteristics and great biodiversity -- perfect for leisure and ecotourism,” he said. Ecuador also offers up-to-date transport infrastructure, a business-friendly environment, the same legal protection to outside investors as national investors, and tax incentives for foreign direct investment, the minister said.Several Korean companies, including Dongwon Enterprise, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Hyundai Motors and SK Construction, have invested in the Ecuadorian economy, which is largely based on petroleum, agriculture, aquaculture, timber, tourism and bio industries. Ecuador is a major exporter of shrimps, bananas, flowers and cocoa as well as the region’s leading producer of coffee, rice, potatoes, cassava, plantains and sugarcane. The country’s livestock sector produces cattle, sheep, pigs, beef, pork and dairy products.The Ecuadorian government announced a $7 billion program for the country’s energy transformation in August, 2015, with an aim to source over 90 percent of electricity from hydropower. The country is also stepping up investments in wind power and solar energy.

In the ruling, the highest court upheld the decision made by the Seoul High Court in February last year that the DSME has paid properly as it set the prices in close consultations with the subcontractors.The ruling paved the way for the shipbuilder to get back about 30 billion won in fines and interest.""We are pleased that the Supreme Court has recognized our efforts to improve competitiveness through enhanced productivity amid the suffering of the shipbuilding industry,"" a DSME official said.","fined the shipbuilder 26 billion ,30 billion won in fines ,won court battle against corporate ,ftc fined the shipbuilder 26 ,thursday in the suit filed","['Daewoo Shipbuilding', 'Marine Engineering Co.', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'the Seoul Appellate Court', 'FTC', 'the Seoul High Court', 'the Supreme Court']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2348571   0.25815088

Lee Cheol-jo, the chief of Sewol ferry search team, and Kim Hyun-taek, the team's second in command, were stripped of their duties last month after it was revealed they had kept secret the finding of bone pieces on Nov. 17 from the victims' families. They came under fire for trying to put an early end to the search, which had been under way since March.""They didn't immediately notify the discovery of the bones to the families who were unable to recover remains of their loved ones, and delayed reporting the fact to the minister,"" the ministry said in a release. Though the officials were late in filing the report, the ministry claimed they didn't intentionally conceal the search results. A DNA analysis showed that the bone fragments belonged to a woman whose family held a funeral for her last month, after receiving part of her remains in May.  A funeral car passes by the wreck of the Sewol ferry at Mokpo port, 410 kilometers south of Seoul, on Nov. 18, 2017. The discovery came a day after the families of five victims who are still missing gave consent to halt the search, raising suspicions that they feared that the finding could spark calls for the continuation of the operation. The 6,800-ton Sewol sank on April 16, 2014, in waters off the country's southwest coast, claiming the lives of 304 people, most of them teenage students on a school trip.

Kim, with her husband of seven years, had initially postponed having kids as they wanted to be more financially stable and able to settle down.""I never thought that having a baby would be this difficult, as I mistakenly thought I could always have one whenever I desired,""Kim said. ""I did not think for a moment that we would be labeled as infertile.""  According to data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of couples seeking medical help for infertility increased from 178,000 in 2006 to 215,000 in 2015. More than 200,000 Koreans are diagnosed with fertility problems annually.Infertility is defined clinically in women and men who cannot achieve pregnancy after one year of having intercourse without using birth control, and in women who have two or more failed pregnancies. Kim, who has tried for nearly a year, recently visited a genetic counselor to learn more about various infertility treatments, which range from freezing embryos while waiting for a child to the more radical treatment of in-vitro fertilization. In a move to tackle the chronic low birthrate and aging population that may hurt Asia's fourth-largest economy by reducing its workforce and driving up welfare costs, the government in recent years has provided subsidies for infertility treatment for more couples. The state is footing a greater cost for treating infertility through national health insurance, which includes three rounds of artificial insemination and a maximum of four sets of external fertilization procedures.Seoul, in addition, has expanded time off work for women expecting babies and has pushed to get more women to take maternity leave.Despite such efforts, an all-time low of 406,300 babies were delivered in South Korea last year, and the fertility rate was 1.17, the lowest number in seven years. Many are predicting that this year's numbers may be even worse, with little prospect of things picking up in the near future.""As a couple, our annual income is above average, so it is welcome news that the government is expanding coverage for everyone, as it costs around 6 million won for the three sets artificial insemination,"" Kim said. Six million won is around US$5,300. In the past, state support was only offered to low income families.Separate ministry data showed that the government provided funding assistance to 87,155 cases of infertility in 2016, an increase of 35.1 percent from five years ago. The success rate in 2016 was 29.5 percent, similar to the 28.1 percent of 2012. The government started to help recipients of treatment from 2006 and has spent 821.81 billion won up to this year. Between 2010 and 2016, 100,761 babies were born through the procedure.However, more couples have asked the government for expanded benefits, as it can cost up to 20 million won per year if the initial trials fail and couples seek help from Korean traditional medicine and various nutritional supplements.Another want-to-be-mom recently posted her story on the online community of the nation's largest portal site, Naver.""I spent more than a total of 20 million won last year. ... I had to seek a part-time job as, in the end, I could not support the treatment with my husband's salary alone,"" she said on her post.She also noted that at some fertility clinics located in the upscale southern Seoul district of Gangnam, fees for fertility testing, insemination and IVF are almost double the cost of the national average.""Despite such steep prices I have no choice but to visit such clinics, as I am that desperate,"" she said. She hopes the government will take measures against that trend.Many of the couples, however, point out that they are fighting a bigger battle: taboo and social stigma.An industry survey showed that six out of 10 couples hid their infertility from family and friends and more than half of the women fighting with infertility did not share the issue with their mothers.""Just because we cannot conceive a baby naturally does not mean that we should be ashamed and hide the fact,"" Kim said. ""I think openness is important.""  Choi Hwa-yeoung, an infertility expert at Obstetrics Maria Branch located in Seoul, said most of her patients complain about their battle against cultural taboos.""In our society, it is often blamed on women when they cannot conceive babies in a natural way,"" Choi said.

This was because the North increased the cost of electricity to a level that the poor cannot afford, the Asahi Shimbun said, adding that the gap between the rich and the poor has widened due to Pyongyang’s partial adoption of the market economy.While international sanctions have deepened the North’s shortage of foreign exchange, the government’s exploitation of the people was getting worse, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the situation in Pyongyang. Asahi also said drugs were widely spread among North Koreans.“Seventy percent of the people living in provincial areas are contaminated with drugs,” a North Korean defector was quoted as saying by the newspaper. The Asahi also said that a series of purges including the dismissal of Kim Won-hong as the minister of state security early this year has heightened a sense of insecurity among the top brass in Pyongyang. Senior North Korean officials were often punished for disrespect for the supreme leader, accumulation of wealth through illegal means, or jealousy among themselves, and cases of officials snitching on each other about their disrespectful attitude were frequent, according to the newspaper.By Kim So-hyun","poor cannot afford the asahi ,on tuesday wealthy residential areas ,pyongyang are suffering from severe ,insecurity among the top brass ,the poor cannot afford","['Pyongyang', 'Japan', 'Asahi Shimbun', 'Pyongyang', 'the Asahi Shimbun', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Asahi', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'Asahi', 'Kim Won - hong', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim So - hyun']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59066534  0.96037453

Among Japan’s 23 facilities designated as UNESCO World Heritage in July 2015, seven were involved in its mobilization of forced labor from Korea and other Asian nations before and during World War II, including the famous Hashima Island. Japan’s capital city of Tokyo is nearly 1,200 kilometers away from the now-uninhabited island, also known as Battleship Island, which was once a densely populated coal mining site. The document also claimed that Korean laborers “supported” Japan’s industrial growth instead of using the phrase “forced labor” to describe those who were drafted against their will. Although South Korea expressed disagreement over Japan’s initial move to list the facilities in 2015, the Japanese government has insisted they are a symbol of its industrialization. UNESCO granted the world heritage status on the condition of admitting the use of conscripted labor. The Paris-based UN cultural organization also asked the Japanese government to shed light on the “full history” of the sites. A compromise was reached on July 15 between Seoul and Japan after a Japanese government representative said many Koreans were “forced to work under harsh conditions” at some of the sites during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.But South Korea prodded Japan to carry out its promises during a UNESCO session in July over the lack of action taken to remember the forced labor victims. A report published in 2012 by the Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Colonialism, an affiliate of the Prime Minister’s Office, showed that 122 of 600 Korean forced laborers died after being conscripted to Hashima Island.Historians estimate millions of Korean men had been drafted into the Japanese workforce during the Japanese colonial era.

His father had gone to jail for refusing to take up arms, and his three older brothers chose the same path when the time came for them to serve their mandatory military service. Baek Jong-keon works as an assistant at a law firm in Seocho-dong, southern Seoul. Bak Se-hwan/The Korea HeraldIn a country where all able-bodied men are required to serve in the military to defend against North Korea’s 1.2 million-strong armed forces, it seemed like a bleak future awaited him, too. “I grew up watching my father -- and my three brothers -- go to jail for objecting to the mandatory military service. It was hard to overcome the fear and the pain as a kid,” said Baek, 33, in an interview with The Korea Herald. “That’s why I wanted to become a lawyer -- to change the situation.” Baek also chose the life of a conscientious objector in South Korea -- or the life of a convicted “draft dodger.” He was sentenced to 18 months in jail by the Supreme Court in 2016. He served his prison term and was released in May this year. The Korean Bar Association suspended his lawyer’s license for five years, a possibility that he had known since he was preparing for the bar exam. All this, however, does not mean Baek is accepting things as they are. Now working as an assistant at a small law firm, he is fighting to regain his license. He has been rejected once, but is still fighting. He is also fighting for the sake of other conscientious objectors to have the government and society recognize their freedom of conscience and offer them alternative ways to serve the country. “Roughly 400 young conscientious objectors are currently in jail. I think that we should seriously consider giving them alternative forms of military service instead of just treating them as outlaws,” he said. Since 2013, nearly 2,500 people were prosecuted for failing to enlist in the military, according to data from the Military Manpower Administration. The military service law mandates a prison sentence of up to three years for men who avoid the draft. A majority of the 2,500 are Jehovah’s Witnesses, who object to any form of militarism. Of the total, 15 are unreligious, objecting conscription based on their personal beliefs and the principles of “no violence” and “no war.” But there are growing signs that the judicial system may be easing its stance on conscientious objectors. This year alone, 40 acquittals were made at lower courts for conscientious objectors, five times more than in 2016, reflecting a possible change in legal perceptions. Although no final decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the acquittals has been made yet, the repeated rulings in favor of the objectors are pressing the government to react.The Constitutional Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the conscription law, with several complaints filed regarding conscientious objection.During his confirmation hearing at the National Assembly last month, new Constitutional Court chief Lee Jin-sung hinted at the need to change the long-entrenched judicial practice against conscientious objection. “We should take the situation seriously where people endure being sent to prison for their adherence to their conscience,” Lee said. Views on conscientious objection seem to be changing as well.According to a survey by the National Human Rights Commission, 46.1 percent of people said last year the government should allow conscientious objection, up 12.8 percentage points from 33.3 percent in a 2011 poll. “The answer is simple,” Baek said. “We just have to adopt legislation that allows conscientious objectors to carry out an appropriate alternative service of a length comparable to that of military service.” Three bills are pending at the National Assembly seeking to add alternative options to the mandatory military service system. Critics argue it is premature to adopt an alternative service program, especially amid ongoing threats from North Korea. It would also affect the morale of conscripted soldiers to see those citing faith -- which is hard to prove -- being allowed to avoid the tough life in barracks. “We do not ask for special treatment,” Baek said. “Some people wrongly assume that we would be exempted from the national duty mandated to all male citizens of South Korea once the court rules in favor of conscientious objection.“But we are willing to serve our country once an alternative service for objectors is introduced. That will allow us to contribute to the community in a way that does not conflict with our conscience, for instance, in the areas of public health, social welfare, the environment and labor,” Baek added. He also believes that religious conscientious objectors have an important role to play. “It is our part not to give up and to keep hope alive. I hope they do not resign themselves to be sent to jail, but keep appealing against the prison term to bring about change,” Baek said.

McMaster warned, as the North continued its rhetoric against Seoul and Washington. In an interview with Fox News, McMaster said that North Korea is making progress in its long range ballistic missile program and that the international community must cooperate in convincing the North’s leader Kim Jong-un that his actions are headed to a “dead end.” North Korea`s Hwaseong-15 missile is seen taking off in a photograph released by North Korea. Yonhap“What is clear is that every time, every time he conducts a missile launch and nuclear test, he gets better,” McMaster said in the interview. “And whether it’s a success or failure isn’t as important as understanding that over the years, he’s been learning from failures, improving, and thereby increasing his threat to all of us.”McMaster went on to say that China has “tremendous coercive economic power over North Korea,” and that Pyongyang’s longtime ally is changing its stance on North Korea. According to McMaster, Beijing is “wholly committed” to the denuclearization of North Korea, and Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed this stance during his recent meeting with US President Donald Trump. He added that it is “in China’s urgent interest” to take measures that go beyond the UN Security Council resolutions in pressuring North Korea, and that completely cutting the country off from fuel is essential. Pyongyang, meanwhile, continued to attack South Korea and the US, accusing the allies of increasing tension on the Korean Peninsula through their military drills. In an editorial, North Korea’s state-run Rodong Sinmun described the Vigilant Ace South Korea-US joint air drill as a “detonator” that could launch a nuclear war. After its launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile Wednesday, Pyongyang claimed that its missile and nuclear programs have been completed. The latest missile is thought to be significantly more advanced than those of Pyongyang’s previous launches. North Korea said after its nuclear test in September that it had secured the technology to mount thermonuclear devices on ballistic missiles. The editorial came a day after the North Korean Foreign Ministry released an official statement condemning the joint military exercise.In the statement, the North Korean Foreign Ministry accused the US of increasing tension on the Korean Peninsula, and justified the country’s nuclear and missile programs as a means of defense. “ is engaging in  dangerous nuclear gamble on the Korean Peninsula, begging for a nuclear war,” the statement said. “Nuclear armament is aimed at preventing and repulsing US attack on the republic , and taking a retaliatory strike that will annihilate the origin of the attack.” By Choi He-suk","continued to attack south korea ,peninsula begging for nuclear war ,korea posing the greatest threat ,in dangerous nuclear gamble ,of war is growing daily","['North Korea', 'US', 'H.R.

Seven have been rescued, but two others including the boat’s captain were missing. Officials from Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency on Monday morning search the coastal area of Ongjin County, Incheon, for two missing persons from a fishing tour boat that capsized Sunday after colliding with another vessel nearby. The 9.77-ton recreational fishing vessel Seonchang-1 carrying two crew members and 20 anglers crashed with the 336-ton Myeongjin-15 tanker near Yeongheung Island while trying to pass a narrow channel at around 6 a.m. on Sunday.The captain of the tanker who had been steering at the time of the accident told the Coast Guard during questioning that he saw the fishing boat, but thought it would steer clear of the tanker.The Incheon Maritime Police were set to request for a warrant Monday afternoon to detain the tanker’s captain and another crew member who was not in the steering room despite being on duty. The two were arrested on charges of professional negligence resulting in death.On refueling vessels, two people normally work as a team on night duty. While one of them steers, the other is supposed to watch ahead and notify him of any emergency situations.The Coast Guard said they have interrogated 27 people involved in the accident, including the owner of the tanker.The Coast Guard, along with the Korean Register, was set to run a forensic investigation on board the Seonchang-1 which has been towed to the pier of the Incheon Maritime Police. Based on the results of the forensic examination and analysis of the Myeongjin-15’s GPS plotter data and CCTV footage, the Coast Guard plans to find out whether the captain of the tanker is responsible for speeding.A total of 67 vessels, 15 airplanes and 82 divers were mobilized in the search for the missing people at sea, while some 1,380 people including 740 police officers and 130 soldiers were assigned to search the shores.The Coast Guard has requested fishermen on the nearby islands for their cooperation as bodies can be found in the nets in fish farms.The Coast Guard is under fire for being slow in its response. The Coast Guard received the first report about the accident from one of the passengers on the fishing boat at 6:09 a.m., but a rescue vessel left at 6:26 a.m. and arrived at the scene at 6:42 a.m., 33 minutes after the first report.Hwang Jun-hyun, chief of the Incheon Maritime Police station, told the media that the rescue boat didn’t have a nighttime navigation system and had to stop many times on its way because of a thunderstorm. The vessels with nighttime navigation were being repaired, he said.The first divers able to explore the waters around the sunken boat arrived nearly 70 minutes after the first report.Sunday’s tragedy was the worst involving a recreational fishing tour boat since 15 people were killed and three went missing in a similar accident in waters near Jeju Island in September 2015.Accidents involving fishing boats have increased from 77 cases in 2013 and 86 cases in 2014 to 208 in 2016. Most of these fishing boats depart early in the morning and return around 4-5 p.m. They often sail at full speed in order to claim good fishing spots.The Coast Guard said it planned to make fishing vessels undergo a mandatory safety inspection every year, instead of the current 2 1/2 years.

The team tasked with searching the wreckage of the Sewol ferry found a piece of bone from the ship on Nov. 17, but its chief told team members to keep the finding secret from the victims' families in a suspected attempt to put an early end to the search. The examination of the wreck has been going on since the vessel was raised in March.The discovery came a day after the families of five victims who are still missing gave consent to halt the search. Ministry officials apparently feared that the finding could spark calls for the continuation of the operation.The ministry's internal auditor said a DNA analysis showed that the bone belonged to a woman whose family held a funeral last month, after receiving part of her remains in May.  Ryu Jae-hyung, an internal auditor of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, speaks during a press briefing at the government complex in Sejong on Nov. 28, 2017. In light of the rising public criticism, the ministry said it will carry out a major reshuffle of the search team and improve the transparency of its operation.""We will reorganize the search team's structure and staff to better meet the demands of families who have not been reunited with the remains of their loved ones,"" Song Sang-heun, a ministry spokesman, said in a briefing.

The 6,800-ton Sewol ferry sank on April 16, 2014, in waters off the country's southwest coast, claiming the lives of 304 people, most of them teenage students on a school trip.

The Suneung, similar to the SAT examination in the US, plays a large part in determining what university a student will be accepted to. Some students have even described the exam as ”the chance to make or break one‘s future.” Because the national exam is administered only once a year, senior high school students face significant pressure to perform well. According to South Korea’s Ministry of Education, approximately 25 percent of students taking the Suneung this year are “re-takers,” slightly more than the 24 percent that retook the exam last year. One fire fighter later confirmed seeing the student hurry off to the test site in her mom’s car.

Since then, she had been out of education. Now 12 years old and resettled in South Korea, Yana said she wants to study more and become an interpreter here in the future -- an opportunity that seemed out of reach in Syria where a 6-year civil war has left many children and youth without an education. Sadeed, Yana, Bakri and Park Jung-eun “In Syria, I was kept away from school for my own safety. But here, I get to learn three different languages, including Korean. I also get to enjoy lots of cultural activities, like going to museums, and learn new things every day,” Yana said in perfect Korean during at Daehwa Elementary School in Daejeon. “I think girls, too, should get more education. They usually get married young and drop out of class in my country,” Yana said, bubbly and cheerful. Her two younger brothers, Sadeed, 9 and Bakri, 8, also attending the same school, said they wish not to go back to Syria. A huge fan of Psy and BTS -- two of the biggest names in K-pop -- Sadeed said he wants to “become a singer like Psy” when he grows up, and get famous here. The three learn fast and get along with friends well as they show lots of interest in school work and the new culture, said their guiding teacher Park Jung-eun. “Adapting to school life in a new environment is hard for anyone, let alone students who have fled war at home,” Park said. Precarious status, precarious dream Erupted in March 2011, the Syrian civil conflict is globally recognized as the largest refugee and displacement crisis of the modern era. Over 5 million Syrians have fled their country as refugees, over 6 million displaced within the country, while hundreds of thousands have died. Yana’s family arrived in South Korea in April 2016.She couldn’t remember details about the path her family took or the year they fled Syria, except that they came via China. Since 2013, a total of 1,160 Syrians sought asylum here, applying for the refugee status and protection. As of September this year, only four of them are recognized as refugees.And they are not Yana’s family. Her parents are “humanitarian-status holders,” like nearly 1,100 other Syrians who have fled here. Recognized refugees are entitled to stay permanently here and the same social security benefits as South Korean nationals. Humanitarian status holders are allowed to stay for just one year, renewable multiple times, and not entitled to any welfare benefits. “They are excluded from the refugee benefits, such as living expenses support,” a Justice Ministry official explained. “They are permitted to find jobs here.” But, the future is a big question mark. Will they be allowed to stay in South Korea and continue to pursue their dreams even after the war ends in Syria? The response from the ministry official was that humanitarian status holders can stay here by renewing the one-year stay permit, “as long as there are reasonable grounds to believe that their life or basic rights are to be threatened” back home. “So many refugees looking for asylum here are denied refugee status by the Korean government,” said Kim Sung-in, secretary-general of the nonprofit Center for Refugee Rights. He called for an overhaul of the country’s tough refugee policy based on the Refugee Act. In a written response to a question why so few are given refugee status, the justice ministry said they review individual cases thoroughly. “ most people from conflict areas who applied for refugee status here did not come to South Korea directly from their home country,” the ministry said. “They were already staying here on work visas for some time when they applied for the status.” Adjusting to Korean schools To be sure, the parents’ legal status does not affect Yana’s and her brothers’ access to education right now. In South Korea, primary and middle school education is compulsory and free for all, regardless one’s visa status. Children of illegal immigrants are provided with the same education opportunities. But, not every refugee child fits into the public school system as successfully as they did. Before joining regular classes, Yana and her brothers had a six-month adjustment period, undergoing a special program designed to help foreign students with limited or no Korean language skills. Their school -- Daehwa Elementary School -- is one of 165 schools nationwide designated by the Education Ministry that run the 6-month preparatory course for foreign students, including those from immigrant and refugee families, along with regular curriculum for local students. A total of 179 classes are being run under this program, but due to the ever-growing number of students needing it, they are already overcrowded, with up to 50 students in one class, according to the ministry. Still those are the lucky ones. Many start right away with regular classes at regular schools that have very few, if not any, language and cultural programs for them. Regarding the lack of educational support, Oh Shin-jong, the director at the multicultural education division of the Education Ministry, said it is “practically impossible” to run Korean language and culture classes at all schools. The government instead provides part-time Korean language teachers for refugee and immigrant students who have to attend regular schools upon entering the country. The government also matches them with local college volunteers through a mentoring program, he added.Data on the number of students with refugee or humanitarian holder statuses was not available. Together with immigrants and children of temporary foreign residents, there are about 20,000 foreign students attending school here, the ministry said. “More government support is needed as regular school can’t afford to run Korean culture and language programs for refugee and immigrant students because of the tight budget. Other problems include that those schools usually have a low level of understanding of how to teach diversified classrooms,” said Jung Yun-sung, vice-principal at another multicultural public school Incheon Hannuri School.“These student often ends up not pursuing education, because their parents struggle to make a living and can’t afford to provide further education for them,” he said. For Yana, school seemed so much fun, but there was one thing that she was not happy with -- the lack of halal options in school meals or snack stalls near school. “I eat alone at lunch because I’m not supposed to eat most of the menu in the school meal,” she said. Yana, Sadeed and Bakri are not their real names. The names were changed on request. –Ed.

28,28,[Video] Students take delayed suneung exam after earthquake,"Hundreds of thousands of South Korean students took the national college entrance examination, or suneung, on Thursday, a week after it was postponed following an earthquake last week. 

Over 600,000 high school seniors began arriving at their designated test venues as early as 7 a.m. for the exam -- the equivalent of the US’ SAT -- which lasted nine hours starting from 8:40 a.m.

(Shot by Lim Jeong-yeo / Edited...","Hundreds of thousands of South Korean students took the national college entrance examination, or suneung, on Thursday, a week after it was postponed following an earthquake last week. 

Over 600,000 high school seniors began arriving at their designated test venues as early as 7 a.m. for the exam -- the equivalent of the US’ SAT -- which lasted nine hours starting from 8:40 a.m.

 

In many parts of the country, it was a cold winter morning, dipping up to minus 7.9 degrees Celsius in some areas. But well-wishers still gathered early in the morning near test venues to wish test takers good luck, handing out traditional sticky snacks like yeot and rice cakes, as “stick” in Korean is the same word as to “pass” a test.

“I hope they do as well as they can, so I wanted to wish my school’s seniors the best of luck. I have been out here since 6 a.m.,” said Ha Seung-joo, a second-year student from Baemoon High School, who was in front of Yongsan High School, one of the test venues in Seoul. Ha will take the exam next year. 

Emergency officials on motorcycles were also seen near the school. They were among the nearly 15,000 officials dispatched on roads near schools to drive exam-takers rushing to get to their test venues at the last minute. 

The highly competitive annual exam is the focus of 12 years of education leading to university. Students, as well as parents, often go to extreme lengths to prepare for the all-important event.







Well-wishers cheer for suneung test takers as they enter Yongsan High School in Seoul on Thursday. 





Each year, authorities take nationwide measures to support test takers, as admission into top-tier universities is often considered a pathway to success in life. This year, extra measures were also put in place for test takers in the quake-hit region. 

A 5.4 magnitude earthquake and a series of aftershocks that struck off the southeastern city of Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, last Wednesday, had left cracks and damage in the walls of hundreds of schools in the coastal region. 

The coastal region has a total of 6,098 students taking the exam at 14 test venues. One-third of them were placed in other schools adjacent to the initially designated places due to safety concerns. 

At each venue, 13 emergency officials and 244 vehicles were dispatched as part of measures to prepare for possible aftershocks during suneung. 

“I was worried at the time of the earthquake that postponed the exam, but eventually I made the most of the extra time for the best result,” a test taker at one of the venues in Pohang told local news outlet Kyunghyang Shinmun. 

Due to the earthquake last week, over a thousand people have been displaced and are living in 13 temporary shelters in Pohang. Students had taken shelter at evacuation centers and continued to study despite fears of aftershocks.

YonhapOn Tuesday at the National Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, lawmakers from the conservative opposition Liberty Korea Party refused to discuss any bills related to the creation of the new body, casting a dark cloud over the plan. It was a day after Cheong Wa Dae, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea and Justice Ministry, after a government-party policy coordination meeting, announced a plan to push for legislation of relevant laws within the current parliamentary session. Rep. Kim Jin-tae, one of six Liberty Korea Party representatives in the 17-strong committee, said, “It is our party’s official platform to reject the idea. We will not participate in any discussion on this matter.” The ruling party controls seven seats in the committee, with the remaining divided by two lawmakers from the centrist People’s Party and two from a group that is not a parliamentary negotiation bloc. “It will be like giving a new blade to a regime that likes to wield a knife against political opponents,” he said.Moon, elected to office in a by-election in May following the ouster of embattled President Park Geun-hye, has vowed to eradicate “accumulated evils” of the society. High-profile corruption investigations followed, implicating mostly figures from the past two conservative regimes. In the latest such probe by the prosecution, the home and office of the Liberty Korea Party’s Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan, who served as the vice prime minister and finance minister under Park, were raided Monday on allegations he had received illicit funds from the National Intelligence Service. Liberty Korea Party floor leader Chung Woo-taik also warned at a party meeting Tuesday that the envisioned entity runs the critical risk of being used as a “political tool” for the president, as its special prosecutors can target opposition politicians. Hong Joon-pyo, the party leader, echoed the view, labeling the Moon administration as “obsessed with political revenge.”Several bills in relation to the new body are pending at the parliament. One of those submitted by the ruling party’s Rep. Park Beom-kye envisions the body as having up to 20 special prosecutors with the authority to investigate former and current presidents, court justices, prosecutors and lawmakers. In Monday’s meeting with government officials and lawmakers, Cho Kuk, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, said the new body, when introduced, will be “a symbol of the reform of the prosecution” that has long been accused of wielding too much power and being politically skewed. The establishment of the anti-corruption body is one of the key initiatives put forward by President Moon Jae-in who was elected on pledges to stamp out graft and irregularities among top government officials, lawmakers and, often, prosecutors themselves. State prosecutors have often been criticized for their extensive power granting them the exclusive right to indict criminals. Critics say it is crucial to prevent them from abusing their own authority while ensuring the body’s independence from political power.Moon’s reform drive is a reminder of public distrust within the country’s society, politics and the law enforcement body almost a year after a massive influence-peddling scandal brought down former President Park Geun-hye and her closest allies in March. Public frustration has been mounting especially over the prosecution’s several failures earlier this year to arrest and detain Park’s former prosecutor-turned-presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo, despite evidence linking him to her scandal.Woo, dubbed the “emperor” for his extensive grip on power while in office from early 2015 until his resignation the following year, is accused of abusing his power to purge officials uncooperative with Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil, and of neglecting his duty to monitor irregularities surrounding the presidential office.Some critics and left-wing lawmakers also see the prosecution as directly responsible for late President Roh Moo-hyun’s suicide in 2009 following a criminal inquiry under conservative President Lee Myung-bak, who served as president from 2008 to 2013. They say the inquiry was set up to purposely humiliate the progressive Roh after he stepped down. Current President Moon served as Roh’s chief of staff. In line with calls to disperse prosecutorial power, the liberal Moon administration is now pushing to change the enforcement body’s monopolistic position, while empowering police, who currently conduct investigations only under the prosecution’s supervision and without indictment authority.

Kim Dong-cheol , the floor leader of the minor opposition People`s Party, speaks during a party meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on Nov. 14, 2017. ""There is resistance from within the People's Party, and there isn't sufficient consensus from people, including those in the Honam region,"" Kim told Yonhap News Agency over the phone.""Now is not the time for discussions over the merger between the two parties, and we have to wait until the time becomes ripe for it,"" he added.The merger issue came amid the emerging prospect of a major political realignment ahead of next year's mayoral and gubernatorial elections seen as a crucial referendum on President Moon Jae-in's first year in office.Senior party members, mostly loyalists of late former President Kim Dae-jung, have been leery of the merger drive, as it could damage the liberal icon's legacies such as the ""Sunshine Policy"" of engaging Pyongyang with unconditional largess. The Bareun Party has long opposed such engagement, saying it has contributed to the North's advances in its nuclear and missile programs.Amid the pushback, Ahn has recently been soft-pedaling his integration agenda, saying he would, for now, explore the possibility of just policy or election-related collaboration with the minor party. He plans to discuss the issue during a meeting of all party lawmakers late this month.As Ahn insists on seeking ties with the Bareun Party, opponents have blamed Ahn for eroding the party's support base and failing to boost its approval rating, with some hinting they could defect.In the latest survey conducted last week by local pollster Realmeter, the People's Party gained only 5.3 percent, the lowest among the five major parties. Meanwhile, the Bareun Party, hit by mass defections, is exploring ways to survive in times of political flux. Yoo Seong-min, its new leader, said that his party would create dialogue channels with the main opposition Liberty Korea Party and People's Party to discuss the possibility of political cooperation.Later in the day, Yoo visited Ahn and reaffirmed his resolve for cooperation with the People's Party in policy or other areas.""I have come here to discuss in earnest the possibility of cooperation between the two parties,"" Yoo told Ahn.""Given that we both are opposition parties to keep in check and criticize the Moon government, and put forward alternatives, I want to discuss how we can work together to play this role,"" he added.","party sought tuesday to defuse ,opposition people party sought tuesday ,stiff resistance from party seniors ,tuesday to defuse growing rift ,people party sought tuesday","[""People 's Party"", 'Ahn Cheol', 'Honam', 'Bareun Party', 'Kim Dong - cheol', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', ""the People 's Party"", 'Honam', 'Kim', 'Yonhap News Agency', ""Moon Jae - in 's"", 'Kim Dae - jung', 'the "" Sunshine Policy', 'Pyongyang', 'the Bareun Party', 'Ahn', 'Ahn', 'the Bareun Party', 'realmeter', ""the People 's Party"", 'the Bareun Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Liberty Korea Party', ""People 's Party"", 'Yoo', 'Ahn', ""the People 's Party"", 'Yoo', 'Ahn', 'Moon']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.61962384 -0.18468419

""We will strive for a grand integration to unite all conservative forces to fend off the surge in populism by the Moon Jae-in government and the escalation of the security crisis."" Joo Ho-young, the floor leader of the minor opposition Bareun Party The lawmakers also voiced their dismay at the Bareun Party's unfruitful efforts to position itself as a promising conservative alternative to the LKP."" has tried to be a center of new conservatism, but the Bareun Party has failed to win overwhelming support from citizens,"" they said. ""As a result, what we have been left with is conservatives' division and ensuing responsibilities.""The lawmakers plan to submit to the Bareun Party their written notifications for defection Wednesday and take formal steps to join the LKP the following day. They include Reps. Kim Moo-sung, Kim Young-woo, Kang Ghil-boo, Kim Yong-tae and Hwang Young-cheul.On Sunday, party lawmakers held a meeting in last-ditch effort to reconcile their differences over the merger issue but failed to reach any agreement.The announcement came three days after the LKP decided to expel corruption-tainted former President Park Geun-hye, a step that some Bareun Party members had demanded as a precondition for any tie-up with the LKP.The minor party splintered off from the LKP late last year amid a factional dispute over the massive corruption scandal involving Park and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.Those who want to remain in the Bareun Party still view the LKP as an outdated old guard tainted by the disgraced former leader, and they stress the need to focus on creating ""transparent, reformist"" conservative forces.Shortly before the announcement on the defections, three contenders dropped out of the Bareun Party's leadership race, hoping that their withdrawal could create the momentum for party unity. Their exit leaves Reps. Yoo Seong-min and Ha Tae-kyeung and former Rep. Chung Moon-hun in the contest.The LKP has much to gain from the shifting political dynamics. The addition of nine lawmakers would bring the number of its parliamentary seats to 116, compared with the ruling Democratic Party's 121.The LKP has been pushing to merge with the splinter party to cement its parliamentary foothold, as the ruling party is struggling to win opposition support for its legislative goals, such as retooling the tax code.The LKP also seeks to have conservatives coalesce behind it ahead of next year's gubernatorial and mayoral elections, which are seen as a referendum on President Moon's first year in office.Choo Mi-ae, the ruling party leader, decried the defections as a ""regressive political regrouping.""""Such a political regrouping without any reform can't be accepted by citizens,"" she said during a party meeting.","embattled party legislators to 11 ,monday their defections if finalized ,party concludes its leadership contest ,written notifications for defection wednesday ,party announced their decision monday","['Bareun Party', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Joo Ho - young', 'National Assembly', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Bareun Party', ""the Bareun Party 's"", 'LKP', 'the Bareun Party', 'the Bareun Party', 'LKP', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim Young - woo', 'Kang Ghil - boo', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Hwang Young', 'LKP', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Bareun Party', 'LKP', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'the Bareun Party', 'LKP', ""the Bareun Party 's"", 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Ha Tae - kyeung', 'Chung Moon', 'LKP', ""Democratic Party 's"", 'LKP', 'Moon']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41207001  0.24307086

She also reiterated that the country won’t participate in the US-led missile defense networks. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha answers lawmakers during a parliamentary audit at the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul on Monday. Yonhap“We are not considering any additional THAAD deployments,” Kang told a parliamentary audit of the Foreign Ministry in Seoul.The THAAD battery, comprising six interceptor launchers and a radar, has been deployed by the US military in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province. “There is no change on our stance that we will not participate in the US’ MD networks,” said Kang, while stressing that Seoul will focus on the early establishment of the Korea Air and Missile Defense system, South Korea’s independent missile shield. “Let me be clear on this. As explained on many occasions before, the THAAD system is a self-defense measure that has nothing to do with the MD,” the minister added. The South Korean military has been scrambling to establish its own anti-missile system by the 2020s, and the US has agreed to remove limits on South Korea’s missile payloads, which has limited the weight of warheads to 500 kilograms. On differences South Korea and China had over the deployment of THAAD here, Kang said there is “nothing to apologize for” and Seoul plans to talk with Beijing to organize President Moon Jae-in’s visit there soon. The two nations have frequently discussed major issues “at various levels,” said Kang. China has strongly opposed Seoul‘s decision, citing national security concerns and later launching economic retaliation against South Korea for it. The minister also said that trilateral military cooperation between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo would not extend into a military alliance. “The security cooperation among South Korea, the United States and Japan operates within the frame of effectively countering and deterring North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats -- It will not develop into a military alliance,” she said. The three nations recently participated in a two-day missile warning drill in waters off the coasts of South Korea and Japan. The drill focused on training for the detection of warships and tracking incoming missiles through radar. The exercise took place after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The missile landed in the Pacific Ocean on Sept. 15. Kang also highlighted the need for strategic dialogue among Seoul, Washington and Beijing and that Seoul will seek ways to establish the necessary framework.Last week, President Moon labeled South Korea’s relationships with the US, Japan, China and Russia as the foundation of its foreign relations with the common goal of bringing about the peaceful denuclearization of North Korea.

49,49,[Frome the Scene] Pilot ‘right to die’ program gets warm reception,"Park Chung-nam has decided to refuse medical care for life extension if he becomes terminally ill. “I believe it’s not up to doctors to decide whether to prolong suffering in my final days.

If I become terminally ill, medical aid options could extend my life, but not save it,” said Park, 72, adding that as a church elder, he has seen several members of his church die in hospitals. “I’d rather die with dignity.”Park Jung-nam, 72, signs an end-of-life care agreement at Kakdang Social Welfare Foundation on Tuesday to confirm he would reject life-prolonging treatment in a severe medical condition. Park was one of three people who The Korea Herald met at Kakdang Social Welfare Foundation, a local welfare center in Seoul, and who signed a written request for “the natural way of dying.” It was Tuesday, the second day into the government’s pilot program that enables individuals to choose how they want to approach the end of their lives -- with or without life-prolonging medical treatment when there is no chance of recovery. Kakdang, located in Jongno-gu, central Seoul, is one of the five places designated as consultation centers for the program. Anyone aged over 19 can submit a written form of their intention to exercise the right to die in the future, if diagnosed by two doctors as terminally ill.Once you sign up, hospital staff will not do artificial life-prolonging treatment on you, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hemodialysis, the use of respirators or anti-cancer drugs, under severe medical conditions. Heo Jung-guk, 46, who visited the center after work at 7 p.m., said he has interest in both good health and a “good death.” “My grandfather and my father died early, so I inevitably became interested in the way of life and the way of death, although I’m relatively young to think about such issues,” Heo said after he finished filling out the form. Another visitor, Choi In-ja, 64, said she has two daughters, one of whom is married. She said she does not want to be a burden on them in the future after a 30-minute consultation with the center’s staff members. “I’m not sure how to talk to my family about my decision, but it’s my own life and I’d like to decide how to end it when the time comes,” Choi said. Manager of the welfare center Lee Hye-won, who also provides consultation to applicants, said the center has received lots of phone calls from those who want to schedule visits and those asking how to sign the agreement.“Most of them are elderly, but we also have visitors in their 30s and 40s or those calling to make appointments,” Lee added.As of Tuesday, 37 people had submitted the form against the use of artificial life-prolonging treatment, and the number is expected to keep rising, said the Ministry of Welfare, which is in charge of the end-of-life care program. In South Korea, the idea of seriously ill people embracing death has been uncomfortable for many. Cancer patients -- even in very advanced stages -- would continue chemotherapy until their final days, as they are encouraged not to give up. Embracing death was deemed as disrespect for life and as being against Confucian values. Today, the ageing population and increasing longevity have led to a shift in the attitude, raising demand for end-of-life care, or the so-called “well-dying” -- a play on well-being. A survey conducted by the state-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs in 2014 showed that 88.9 percent of 10,452 people aged 65 and over said they object to continuing medical care to prolong life without the possibility of recovery, while 3.9 percent chose to support continued treatment. Another set of data from the institute also revealed that over 80 percent of 300 elderly people responded in 2015 that they would “accept death and spend their final days preparing to die a natural death,” while the rest said they would fight it with every medical aid available. In light of the reality, the National Assembly passed a law that allows incurable patients to reject life-prolonging treatment last January, a milestone in a country where euthanasia is strictly prohibited.The law will take effect from February next year, following a three-month pilot run which began Monday. Professor Yu Eun-sil of Seoul Asan Medical Center’s pathology department said it is time for South Korea to look at the matter of death more liberally. According to Yu, who has authored and translated books on how to die well, South Koreans spend almost the entirety of their lifetime medical expenses in the final year of their lives -- half of them in the last three months just to prolong life. “The issue of death was always seen as a taboo in the country. But the launch of the end-of-life care will help Koreans have more discussions about it,” Yu said in interviews with local media. “Even my fellow doctors who have to deal with death every day, or people with terminally ill family members have little time to think about it for themselves. I recommend them to read and think about death in advance,” Yu added. Critics, however, say the new law must be implemented carefully to avoid ethical problems. How to define “terminally ill” for patients wanting death over treatment is one of the problems, says professor Heo Dae-seog of Seoul National University Hospital’s hematology and oncology department. “The law applies to terminally ill patients who are expected to die within a period of time. But, technically speaking, it is extremely difficult to define who falls under the categories of the terminally ill,” Heo said. President of the Korean Bioethics Association Koo Young-mo also said that in the trial period, the government must handle cases of patients wanting to end their lives very carefully to protect the basic values of human life. An official from the Ministry of Welfare said the country “already went through many debates” over the past decade on whether to allow patients the right to end their life. “It is our understanding that the majority in our society demands alternative options in their final days of life for more dignity, and the law strictly limits this to certain cases of patients who have consulted doctors, and most importantly, out of their own will,” the official added.

""Can't we just make after-hour messaging illegal so that it would at least teach people some manners?"" the 36-year-old PR agent told Yonhap News Agency. ""KakaoTalk has destroyed the concept of time restrictions and it just drives me crazy.""She is an ardent advocate of a recent government move to guarantee the right to disconnect by restricting off-hours company messaging to employees. Cyberstress from round-the-clock orders from superiors has surfaced as a growing social issue in a country plagued by a mix of its notorious hard-work culture and advanced digital technology. Last month, the labor ministry requested Kakao Corp., the operator of the No. 1 mobile messenger, add a new function to allow users to put off after-hours message transmission until the next morning.Kakao snubbed the suggestion. The app already has functions designed to assist users with off-hour settings and resolving the issue is not a matter of a new tool or a particular platform, it said.""But we do welcome the proposition from the government about guaranteeing the right to disconnect,"" it said in a press release.Korea has notoriously long work hours. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  in 2016, Koreans logged an average of 2,069 hours per individual annually, the third longest after Mexico and Costa Rica. The OECD average was 1,764 hours. And digital technology and social media have given Koreans more reasons to work harder, even remotely. A 2016 study by the Korea Labor Institute  showed that seven out of 10 office workers worked on their smartphones after work hours. They spent an extra 1 1/2 hours on average working via their digital devices on tasks that were not at all urgent. ""Off-hour work is a habitual practice in Korea,"" said Kim Ki-sun, a KLI researcher. ""Working in the office as long as you can is considered a virtue and a way of proving your loyalty and integrity. This perception is deeply rooted in work culture."" In defiance of the exhausting custom, both public and private sectors have been scrambling to cut off-hour work. Rep. Shin Kyung-min of the Democratic Party proposed a bill last year seeking to ban any work-related communication including phone calls and mobile messaging after hours. Supporters praised him for taking up the issue to the legislature, while opponents criticized it for being unrealistic. ""They might as well ban KakaoTalk, LINE and everything else, while we all migrate to Snapchat,"" said Kim Hyun-joon, 32, who works in the IT field. ""Good luck with banning that."" LINE is a messaging application made by Naver, while Snapchat comes with a self-deleting feature.Skeptics pointed out that any policy push for limiting mobile access in off hours is of no use, as situations vary across different industries. Any hasty move to prevent mobile communications at work will only undermine productivity in certain fields, they said. As a more realistic alternative, Rep. Lee Yong-ho of the People's Party in August proposed a revision in the Labor Standards Act to oblige employers to pay an overtime allowance for off-hour work on mobile platforms.The Seoul Metropolitan Government has announced an ordinance recommending its staff not to give orders to subordinates via mobile messenger apps after work hours. Some businesses have also joined the move. Mobile carrier LG Uplus Corp. has adopted a new company policy that can penalize staffers for giving online orders during off hours. CJ Group, a food and entertainment conglomerate, has also launched a campaign to ban off-hour mobile texting. Experts said the moves reflect a growing demand for changing the work culture to improve the balance between work and life. But some disagree with the idea of banning after-work messaging by law, citing low efficiency and the indispensability of smart devices in today's society. Experts proposed that the government and parliament draw up legislation that obligates a labor-management agreement over after-hours mobile contact.""A law that compels companies and unions to set voluntary rules, depending on their work environment, is worth being considered,"" Park Ji-soon, a professor at Korea University Law School, said. He also underlined the need to hold legally accountable abusive managers who harass staff with excessive numbers of off-hour messages.

In his pursuit of future-oriented education, the governor has pushed for the renewal of an existing English immersion institute in the province into a new education center, dubbed “Change Up Campus.”“Change Up is a new brand that carries the values of evolution and revolution,” Gov. Nam said Sunday at the opening ceremony in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. “The new campus will become an institute that will establish a firm foothold in the field of creativity education, and cultivate students of talent.”  Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil speaks at the opening ceremony of the Change Up Campus in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. Formerly Paju English Village, the center had only taught English. It had grappled with growing deficits due to a shortage of students. Under the change, 16 new programs are being introduced, including classes on creativity and special training for teachers. New courses will cover topics such coding, design thinking, drones, 3-D printing and culture education. Public school students and teachers will be offered opportunities to attend classes there. The campus consists of 23 classrooms in two main buildings, which have been renovated to fit technology-based teaching and learning. “In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, a challenge spirit is more important than ever,” Nam said, highlighting his education philosophy that focuses on nurturing the creativity of the students.“Students nowadays should learn to become pioneers and not pursuers, such as the entrepreneurs who established corporates such as Google, Apple, Facebook and YouTube,” he added. Nam said that he had faced many difficulties in the process of changing the village into a new education center. The result reflects his best efforts to gather a consensus from all parts of the provincial government and the education office there, he added. The new institute plans to reflect the opinions and ideas of provincial residents in its education programs. It will focus on programs intended at fostering skills that will be important in the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Nam was formerly a four-term parliamentarian from a constituency in Gyeonggi Province’s Suwon city. He began his term as governor in 2014.

The Pentagon stressed a day later the classified scheme remains secure, though it declined to confirm whether there was a breach. However, concern continues to grow over the regime’s evolving hacking technology and cyberwarfare capabilities. “There is cyberwarfare occurring between South Korea and North Korea every hour, every day,” said Rep. Rhee Chul-hee of the ruling Democratic Party, who revealed the hacking incident, in an interview with local broadcaster CBS on Wednesday.North Korean residents gather at the statue of the North late leader Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il. YonhapAccording to the April report by the Korean Institute for National Unification, North Korea has been operating a total of 7,700 professional hackers, including those belonging to seven hacking organizations under the regime’s ruling Workers’ Party and Korean People’s Army. South Korea’s Unification Ministry has witnessed 4,000 hacking attempts over the past five years, with about 40 percent of them originating from China, which are suspected to be linked to North Korean hackers, said Rep. Park Joo-sun, a lawmaker of the People’s Party. Seoul’s central bank might have been targeted as well, lawmaker Rep. Shim Jae-cheol claimed, citing data that showed the Bank of Korea has seen an “unusual surge” in cyberattacks this year. Compared to 38 cyberattacks in 2015 and 44 in 2016, the number of hacking attacks this year stood at 116 in August. “With military tension reaching its peak following North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, North Korea would have conducted a series of cyberattacks targeting South Korea’s central bank and financial institutions,” Shim said. In recent years, North Korea has shifted its focus in cyberattacks. Not only has the North attempted to snatch classified military or government data to bring social disruption, it appeared to focus more on raising foreign currency under the chokehold of economic sanctions. A hacking group with ties to North Korea, Lazarus, was suspected of being linked to an $81 million cyber heist at the Bangladesh central bank in February 2016. The money was fraudulently transferred out of the bank’s account at the New York Federal Reserve and moved to Sri Lanka and the Philippines. The communist regime has even appeared to rely on digital currency – such as Bitcoin -- as a means of evading tightening sanctions.  South Korea’s National Police Agency confirmed last month that North Korean hackers had sought to steal bitcoins from cryptocurrency exchanges here. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, the hackers targeted 25 South Korean employees at four different exchanges. “Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining or activity involving cryptocurrency is a way for North Korea to generate funds and get around some of the sanctions,” Priscilla Moriuchi, a director from Recorded Future, an intelligence research firm, said in an interview with Voice of America. “What we have come to know over time is that they are sophisticated actors. They do have an in-depth understanding of internet networks and communication.” Last month, Korean National Police arrested a group of South Korean and Chinese people for working with North Korean hackers to steal bank card information by hacking into automated teller machines. The arrested group then used it to withdraw cash. By Yeo Jun-suk","korean hackers to steal bank ,north korean hackers to steal ,month that north korean hackers ,hackers targeted 25 south korean ,korean hackers to steal","['North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pentagon', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Rhee Chul - hee', 'Democratic Party', 'CBS', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - il', 'the Korean Institute for National Unification', 'North Korea', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Korean People ’s Army', 'South Korea ’s Unification Ministry', 'China', 'north korean', 'Park Joo', 'the People ’s Party', 'Seoul', 'Shim Jae - cheol', 'the Bank of Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Lazarus', 'Bangladesh', 'the New York Federal Reserve', 'Sri Lanka', 'Philippines', 'South Korea ’s', 'National Police Agency', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Priscilla Moriuchi', 'Recorded Future', 'Voice of America', 'Korean National Police', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'north korean']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40766257  0.62182009

This keeps him safe, but also makes him frustrated at the same time,” TV Chosun, a media outlet here said Monday. A video released online in March features a man claiming to be Kim Han-sol “He has been telling the people around him that he is glad that his family is safe, but the protection program is suffocating. He has been also been consuming alcohol often during the daytime while saying that he had more freedom working in Macau,” it said. Kim Han-sol, along with his mother Ri Hye-kyong and his 19-year-old sister Kim Sol-hui, has been on-the-run from the North Korean regime after his father, Kim Jong-nam, was killed at a Malaysian airport in February. Kim Jong-nam, who was the half brother of North Korea’s current strongman was murdered with the banned VX nerve agent in broad daylight, in what appears to be an assassination plotted by Kim Jong-un. Kim Han-sol and the rest of the family were reportedly residing in Macau at the time, where he worked as an employee at a nearby hotel. Kim Jong-nam and his family had been living a life of exile from North Korea since 2001. The trio’s current whereabouts are unknown, although the respective governments of the Netherlands, China, the United States, and a fourth unnamed nation had offered help to them, according to Cheollima Civil Defense, an organization keeping the family under Pyongyang’s radar. The group is believed to be formed of North Korean dissidents. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the North Korean regime may be targeting Kim Han-sol, and that there were “attempts by several parties to interfere” with the family’s evacuation from Macau, citing an unnamed Cheollima source. The source also revealed that Canada was among the nations that refused to assist to the family. Kim Han-sol is believed to be the last surviving male of the “Baekdu” descent, the direct bloodline of North Korean state founder Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, which could make him a potential threat to his uncle Kim Jong-un. North Korea’s current leader has been consistently eliminating such threats since he rose to power in 2011. In an interview with Finnish media in 2012, Kim Han-sol openly criticized the reclusive regime and the government saying that he has always dreamed that one day he will return to his homeland to “make things better.”At the time of the interview, Kim was studying at an international school in Bosnia and had undergone an educational experience in France.

It came as the regime faces growing global pressure to curb its weapons drive following recent nuclear and missile tests.  Tensions soared as Kim traded verbal threats with US President Donald Trump, who tweeted on Saturday that ""only one thing will work"" to tame the isolated nuclear-armed state.  The sister, in her late 20s, hasfrequently been seen accompanying her brother on his ""field guidance trips"" and other events and is known to have been involved in the party's propaganda operations. Both were born to the late former ruler Kim Jong-Il and his third partner, former dancer Ko Yong-Hui.The family has ruled North Korea since its creation in 1948. The current ruler came to power after the death of his father in December 2011.Since then he has overseen four of the country's six nuclear tests -- most recently in September -- while cementing his grip on power through a series of purges, including those targeting his uncle and half-brother. The uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, was executed in 2013 for treason and the half-brother Kim Jong-Nam was killed by a toxic nerve agent in a Cold War-style assassination at a Kuala Lumpur airport in February. Both the North's missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have made significant progress under the current Kim, despite a growing layer of UN sanctions.During Saturday's party meeting, Kim acknowledged the country faced with ""ordeals"" under a ""stern"" situation, but claimed that its economy had grown this year despite ever-tighter sanctions.He described the North's atomic weapons as a ""treasured sword"" to protect it from aggression.""The nuclear weapons of the DPRK  are a precious fruition borne by its people's bloody struggle for defending the destiny and sovereignty of the country from the protracted nuclear threats of the US imperialists,"" Kim was quoted as saying.","nuclear armed state the sister ,during saturday party meeting kim ,weapons drive following recent nuclear ,president donald trump who tweeted ,promoted his sister to senior","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Yo - Jong', 'KCNA news agency', 'Kim', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Kim Jong - Il', 'Ko Yong - Hui', 'North Korea', 'Jang Song - Thaek', 'Kim Jong - Nam', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Kim', 'UN', 'Kim', 'US', 'Kim']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56712574  0.68442005

Officials have since been carrying out thorough inspections of the entire port but found no additional fire ants. At the meeting, the vice minister-level officials of the related ministries decided to expand monitoring traps at 22 sea ports across the country and two inland ports, located in the central city of Uiwang and the southeastern city of Yangsan.Following last week's discovery, the government immediately put a lockdown on containers at the Gamman port. On Tuesday, the government began allowing containers to leave the port following thorough inspections and disinfecting measures.Officials also said that they will step up efforts to determine where the fire ants came from and how they arrived in the country.The highly invasive alien red ant species has a sting that can cause severe allergic reactions, including breathing problems that sometimes lead to death.","held an emergency meeting tuesday ,tuesday after some 25 fire ,an emergency meeting tuesday after ,an emergency meeting tuesday ,emergency meeting tuesday after","['South Korea', 'Busan', 'Busan', 'Uiwang', 'Yangsan', 'Gamman']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08642726  0.39598852

Speaking ahead of the Day of German Unity on Tuesday, German Ambassador Stephan Auer stressed the two nations have always shared these values as middle powers and like-minded partners linking Europe and Asia. To help turn the tide in a world order blighted by territorial revanchism, diplomatic retrenchment and economic recession, they can defend and shape globalization for a shared sustainable future, he said. “The election outcome means there will be continuity in our foreign and European policies as well as bilateral relations,” he said at his residence last week, saying that German foreign policy has long put democracy and human rights, free trade and international engagement at the forefront. The German federal election on Sept. 24 saw Merkel -- chancellor since 2005 -- ensure a fourth consecutive term by securing 33 percent of the vote for her center-right Christian Democratic Union and conservative Christian Social Union parties’ alliance. The Alternative for Germany -- a right-wing nationalist party previously unrepresented in the Bundestag -- entered the federal parliament as the third largest group with 12.6 percent of the vote. German Ambassador to Korea Stephan Auer Deflecting concerns that Germany will be more inward-looking as a result of the election, Auer asserted that there was still plenty of potential for further enhancing collaboration with Korea, especially in the fourth industrial revolution sector, energy transition and educational and economic reform, among others. The Day of German Unity commemorates the anniversary of national reunification in 1990, when the goal of a united Germany that originated in the mid-19th century was realized again. “Whereas the Korean Peninsula’s division is ongoing over seven decades, the separation between East and West Germany was four decades long. There were constant exchanges between East and West Germans through Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik, which gave people a vision of where they wanted to go forward,” noted Auer. “Our reunification happened because the East Germans stood up against the communist dictatorship and demanded democratic and economic freedom. It was difficult to stop people’s aspiration that was set in motion. Externally, the decline of the Soviet Union also created a favorable environment for thawing tensions.”Since the reunification, Germany’s political and economic weight has grown substantially in Europe and the world, said the diplomat, claiming his country has also assumed more global responsibilities. Angela Merkel, German chancellor and chairwoman of Christian Democratic Union party “In order to live up to our responsibilities as expected by the international community, we have played a key role in the Iran nuclear deal and Ukraine crisis,” the envoy highlighted, citing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed and implemented since 2015 under the auspices of the “P5+1” countries of China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States plus Germany and the European Union, as well as Germany’s diplomatic intervention in the wake of Russia’s armed takeover of Crimea to fulfill the peace accord agreed in Minsk in 2015. In addition, he said, Germany has carried out numerous peacekeeping and security operations around the world, including the conduct of reconnaissance, monitoring and surveillance of illegal crossings in the Aegean sea in the aftermath of the migration crisis; the deployment of 980 soldiers in Afghanistan -- the second-largest contingent -- as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Resolute Support mission; and the second-largest contribution to NATO’s Kosovo force with 550 troops deployed there for Kosovo’s peace and security. But Auer stressed that Germany was more of a facilitator rather than a heavyweight in interventional affairs, and that cooperating with close allies like Korea is fundamental to actualizing common objectives. Germany is aiming for a nonpermanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for 2019-20. Twenty-seven years has passed since the historic event in Berlin, and Germany has gone a long way bridging its East-West divide and integrating newcomers into the fold of its society, observers say. The political and institutional integration occurred first, with Merkel and former German president from 2012-17, Joachim Gauck, both of whom hail from East Germany, being the “living proof” of German political unity.A statue of late chancellor Willy Brandt  is seen in the background as people react to the first preliminary results at the headquarters of the Social Democratic party in Berlin, Germany, Sunday, Sept. 24, 2017, after the polling stations for the German parliament elections had been closed. “Forty years of separation means that we need another 40 years to integrate and overcome remaining challenges,” Auer said. He acknowledged extant discrepancies in the quality of economic and social life between the former two regions. “It is an ongoing process. We have also had economic success stories coming from regions in East Germany, particularly Saxony-Anhalt.” In Germany, where vociferous calls for nationalism have generally been taboo, people have proudly celebrated their regional and local identity, a legacy of its decentralized power. Since joining the European Union -- whose roots lie in the European Coal and Steel Community established in 1952 -- Germans have cherished their European identity, he explicated. “Europe is our future. Our history has taught us that we need to work closely together with our European partners,” he underlined, saying friendship and reconciliation with the Poles, French, Czechoslovakians, Soviet Russians and others “whom we conquered and brought so much suffering to” was possible by their acceptance of Germany’s olive branch.Noting Germany belongs to all major EU associations -- chiefly the single market, European Economic Area, eurozone and Schengen Area -- Auer said Berlin is committed to further strengthening European integration, a goal shared by the French administration under President Emmanuel Macron. German Chancellor Angela Merkel  and French President Emmanuel Macron at the Tallinn Digital Summit in Tallinn, Estonia, 29 September 2017. The Tallinn Digital Summit is a platform to launch high-level discussions on further plans for digital innovation with the aim of keeping Europe ahead of the technological curve while becoming a digital leader, globally, in the years to come. Germany and Korea had a trade turnover of $30 billion last year, with Korea registering a trade deficit of $11.3 billion, according to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. Currently, some 500 German companies operate in the Korean market creating more than 100,000 jobs.“Korean and German companies do compete in many areas, but our economies are also complementary in many ways,” Auer said. “We can work together for mutual benefit in the automobile sector, particularly in the electronic and autonomous vehicles, renewable energy transition and the fourth industrial revolution. We can shape industrial standardization processes through partnership arrangements.”Germany’s vocational schools offer over 400 different training programs for jobs, combining theory and practice for flexible application in the future’s economy. The education sector has also launched a platform to discuss and prepare for upcoming disruptive changes with all stakeholders. Germany, once called the “sick man of Europe” for its economic lethargy, has been able to rebound and recoup competitiveness following a series of reforms under former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. In the late 1990s, the foreign press often labeled the sputtering German economy with this term, the consequence of astronomical reunification costs in estimate of over 1.5 trillion euros. The identification continued into the early 2000s, when the German economy entered a recession in 2003.Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder during his speech at the annual meeting of the German Insurance Association  in Berlin, Germany, 27 September 2017. Schroeder was elected chairman of the board of Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft on 29 September 2017. Schroder, who visited Korea in early September, executed the now-celebrated Hartz Reform, a set of recommendations to reform the German labor market in 2002, named after the reform committee’s head, Peter Hartz. “The set of reforms made our economy much healthier and more competitive, and brought down unemployment,” the ambassador explained, adding the initiative targeted social welfare, labor market, health care and pension and corporate taxation.The crux of the reform centered on making the labor market more flexible and social welfare system more efficient. By introducing more part-time work and short-term contracts, it made it easier for companies to hire and entrepreneurs to launch new businesses. Redundancy payments and benefits to the unemployed were trimmed down. The state pension fund was supplemented by a system of private pension funds, and the retirement age was increased to 67. Public coverage of health care services was reduced. “All in all, the reforms made German companies more competitive, helping them grow and employ more people. This brought down unemployment and increased consumers’ purchasing power, unleashing a virtuous cycle that lifted our economy out of recession.” Former German President Joachim Gauck  speaks to guests at a reception marking the 25th anniversary of German reunification at Grand Hyatt Seoul in October, 2015. Also in the picture are former German Ambassador Rolf Mafael , now serving in Kazakhstan, former Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea and the president’s spouse, Daniela Schadt. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the government has provided subsidies to companies to keep their employees, rather than fire them. Auer highlighted the success of German small and medium-sized enterprises, which generate more than half of annual economic output and employ over 60 percent of the workforce. With 99 percent of companies being SMEs, they are the “backbone of the competitive, flexible and resilient Germany economy,” he said. The SMEs work within an ecosystem of free and fair competition with large corporations under the watchful eye of the Federal Cartel Office, Germany’s national competition regulator. “There is a good balance between large corporations and SMEs in Germany,” according to the diplomat. “The Federal Cartel Office ensures that the rules of free market are respected and enforced without powerful companies domineering others. It’s about levelling the playing field.” By Joel Lee","unity on tuesday german ambassador ,vote german ambassador to korea ,german companies more competitive helping ,cartel office germany national competition ,the reforms made german companies","['Angela Merkel', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'german', 'Stephan Auer', 'european', 'german', 'german', 'Christian Democratic Union', 'Christian Social Union', 'Germany', 'Bundestag', 'german', 'Korea', 'Stephan Auer', 'Germany', 'auer', 'Korea', 'German', 'Germany', 'West Germany', 'West Germans', 'Willy Brandt ’s', 'auer', 'East Germans', 'the Soviet Union', 'Germany', 'Angela Merkel', 'german', 'Christian Democratic Union', 'Iran', 'Ukraine', 'China', 'France', 'Russia', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Germany', 'the European Union', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'Crimea', 'Minsk', 'Germany', 'aegean', 'Afghanistan', 'the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ’s Resolute Support', 'NATO', 'Kosovo', 'Kosovo', 'Auer', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Germany', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'german', 'Joachim Gauck', 'East Germany', 'german', 'Willy Brandt', 'the Social democratic party', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'german', 'auer', 'East Germany', 'Saxony - Anhalt', 'Germany', 'the European Union', 'german', 'european', 'european', 'Poles', 'French', 'Czechoslovakians', 'Soviet Russians', 'Germany', 'note Germany', 'EU', 'European Economic Area', 'Schengen Area', 'Auer', 'Berlin', 'european', 'french', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'german', 'Angela Merkel', 'french', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Tallinn', 'Estonia', 'the Tallinn Digital Summit', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Federal Statistical Office of Germany', 'german', 'korean', 'german', 'auer', 'Germany', 'Gerhard Schroder', 'german', 'german', 'German', 'Gerhard Schroeder', 'the German Insurance Association', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'russian', 'Korea', 'Hartz Reform', 'german', 'Peter Hartz', 'german', 'german', 'Joachim Gauck', 'german', 'german', 'Rolf Mafael', 'Kazakhstan', 'Education', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Daniela Schadt', 'german', 'Germany', 'the Federal Cartel Office', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'the Federal Cartel Office', 'Joel Lee']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.87005848  0.65552753

Park was grilled by ruling and opposition parties over his qualifications Monday, leading to a parliamentary committee calling him ""unfit"" in a report. Park Seong-jin, the nominee for the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, closes his eyes during a parliamentary hearing Sept. 11, 2017. His appointment does not require parliamentary approval, but disapproval often imposes a political burden on the president and the nominee.""It was hard for me to accept the parliament's decision over my lack of qualifications, especially since I devoted most of my time to explaining my vision for the job and my personal religious beliefs during the hearing,"" Park said in a statement. ""But I decided to step down voluntarily out of respect for the National Assembly's decision.""One of the disputed remarks was that South Korea was founded in 1948, a view strongly advocated by the ousted former leader Park Geun-hye and the country's conservatives. President Moon Jae-in and liberals have insisted the national foundation dates should be pushed back to 1919, when the country's provisional government was established in Shanghai during Japan's colonial rule.The 48-year-old was also attacked over his past activity as a member of the Korea Association for Creation Research, an entity that some argue denies the theory of evolution and specializes in creation science. He resigned from a senior post at the association two days after his nomination.","history took flak from lawmakers ,parties over his qualifications monday ,creation science he resigned from ,smes and startups closes his ,his controversial views on religion","['Ministry of sme', 'Startups', 'Park Seong - jin', 'the Pohang University of Science and Technology', 'the Ministry of sme', 'Startups', ""the National Assembly 's"", 'South Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon Jae -', 'Shanghai', 'Japan', 'the Korea Association for Creation Research']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20139086  0.73711306

The mother alerted the bus driver of the situation but was only let off at the next stop.  The incident was shared on the bus network’s online bulletin board by another passenger on the bus who had witnessed the mother weeping in distress wanting to leave the bus to find her daughter.After criticism exploded over social media, Seoul Metropolitan Government called the driver of the bus and inspected CCTV footage from the vehicle. The bus had kept the exit door open for 16 seconds before shutting it and taking off on a 10-meter drive to an inner lane and then a 20 seconds further drive to the next stop.“Based on the video recordings, it appears that the bus driver only became aware of the situation after the bus changed lane. He seems to have decided it was safer to let the woman out at the next designated stop,” said a city official in a statement to the media. The official added that the inspection had only just begun, and that more details of the incident would be examined over time to determine the safety issues that had been at stake.","bus came under fire monday ,mother alerted the bus driver ,city bus came under fire ,the mother alerted the bus ,the mother weeping in distress","['Seoul', 'Konkuk University Station', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'CCTV']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52957737  0.44920266

On Thursday, four more Terminal High Altitude Area Defense launchers were deployed at the site in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province against resistance from activists and local residents. China has been quick to criticize Seoul’s decision, raising concerns that it will carry out further economic retribution against South Korean entities operating in the country. A US chopper flies above the Seongju military base Chinese authorities lodged a formal complaint Wednesday with Seoul’s ambassador to China, Kim Jang-soo, and on Thursday Beijing’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on Seoul and Washington to call off the THAAD deployment. Chinese media outlets have also attacked development, with one daily claiming that THAAD will become a “cancer that damages regional security” along with North Korea’s nuclear program. After Seoul decided to bring the US missile defense system to Korea, Chinese authorities subjected South Korean firms’ Chinese operations to various regulatory measures, while some consumer groups boycotted South Korean products, and businesses. The government maintains that Thursday’s deployment is temporary, but the move has been taken as the first step toward a permanent decision. Critics say that Moon has broken his promises on the issue, which included conducting a full environmental impact study and giving the National Assembly the final say in the matter. While some Moon supporters who oppose THAAD deployment accuse the president of “betraying” them, the government and the presidential office maintains that the move was unavoidable, and necessary in light of the growing North Korean threat.Cheong Wa Dae also refuted claims that the president had gone back on his word, citing the position Moon took on the issue in his election campaign. During the election campaign, Moon stated that deploying THAAD is an option if North Korea conducts another nuclear test, and if Pyongyang cannot be controlled by China. Regardless of Cheong Wa Dae and the government’s attempts to appease the public, Moon’s approval rating has taken a hit, falling to the lowest level since he took office on May 10. The latest Gallup Korea poll showed that Moon’s approval rating fell to 72 percent, while the figure came to 69 percent in a poll by Realmeter. With conflict over the US missile defense system continuing, Moon is said to be mulling over whether to make a public address. “ is considering a message  regarding THAAD deployment,” a high level Cheong Wa Dae official said. He added that the time, and format of the message have not been decided, and that the president will address the issue if the “right message” is drawn up.The ruling Democratic Party of Korea, which has opposed THAAD deployment from the start, defended the decision saying that it was unavoidable in light of recent developments. “The deployment of THAAD was an unavoidable choice to secure national security,” Democratic Party floor leader Rep. Woo Won-shik said on Thursday at the party meeting held after THAAD launchers were taken to the Seongju site. With the exception of the left-wing Justice Party, the move has been welcomed by the opposition parties. The conservative main opposition Liberty Korea Party, which has opposed and criticized Moon’s every move, has welcomed the decision while maintaining its attack on the administration. “The Democratic Party should dismantle its THAAD committee immediately,” Liberty Korea Party Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik said. “Deploying THAAD has taken 462 unnecessary days. The Democratic Party and President Moon Jae-in must apologize for fracturing Korea-US alliance, damaging Korea-China relations, and causing discord in the country.”The Justice Party, for its part, accused the administration of double standards, with its members meeting the Minister of National Defense Song Young-moo on Friday to convey the party’s position.

Politicians appear to concur. Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party, highlighted the need to revise the Juvenile Act, which covers criminal offenders aged 10 to 18 and allows them to receive more lenient treatment. Minors under 14 do not face criminal trials at all, while those under 18 are punishable by a maximum of 20 years in jail. “There is growing demand from the general public for an amendment of the Juvenile Act,” she said during a party meeting Wednesday. “Harsh punishment won’t be a fundamental fix to the problem, but it looks certain that we need to face up to the reality where youth crimes are becoming ever more brutal and ruthless,” she said. Rep. Choo’s remarks appear to sum up the sentiment among parliamentarians across the aisle, who are sharply divided over most other issues. Minor opposition People’s Party Chairman Ahn Cheol-soo said a day earlier on Twitter, “Youth should be protected, but we shouldn’t allow the Juvenile Act to continue to be taken advantage of.” The conservative splinter group Bareun Party is organizing a forum Friday to discuss possible policy measures against the rising wave of youth crimes. A capture of the leaked CCTV recordings A photo of a blood-covered 14-year-old girl, who it was claimed was attacked by her middle school peers with glass bottles and other objects, went viral on social media this week, sparking angry responses from the public. In another high-profile crime involving teens, a high-school dropout, then aged 16, killed and dismembered an 8-year-old girl in March in a quiet residential town in the western city of Incheon. State prosecutors asked the court to sentence the suspect to 20 years in jail, the heaviest penalty under the juvenile act. For her accomplice, who is accused of instigating the killing, but did not actually participate in the act, prosecutors sought life imprisonment, as she turned 18 during the trial and accordingly is not covered by the juvenile act. The court is to rule on the case later this month.","recent brutal crimes involving minors ,party meeting wednesday harsh punishment ,toward juvenile offenders politicians ,teens high school dropout then ,brutal crimes involving minors calls","['South Korea', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Democratic Party', 'harsh', 'Choo', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Bareun Party', 'CCTV', 'Incheon']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35705486 -0.07120561

The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is looking into levels of volatile organic compounds, including a variety of chemicals that may cause health problems, potentially contained in the menstrual cups by an American brand. “We decided to inspect whether VOCs are contained in menstrual cups, what kinds of VOCs and whether they are harmful to human health, given heightened anxiety over the safety of menstrual products,” an official from the ministry said.  VOCs are at the center of safety concerns, as a growing number of women have reported symptoms such as fluctuations in menstrual cycle and volume after using Lilian brand sanitary pads. The pads were revealed to contain the highest concentration of VOCs among those in a recent study of 10 sanitary pads sold here. In safety test results of 10 disposable sanitary napkins and panty liners released in March by the Korean Women’s Environmental Network, all the products contained more than 200 different VOCs, including cancer-causing benzene. Tampons were not tested.“After reviewing the inspection results and what harmful impacts VOCs have on human health, we will decide whether to approve the menstrual cups for sale,” the official said.The inspection on the menstrual cup brand will last for about a month. Its safety was already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, according to the ministry. The Drug Ministry, already under fire for its belated response to the crisis, is running safety inspections on all sanitary pads sold here to determine the levels of VOCs in the products and their impact on human bodies. The report is to be released by the end of September. There are currently no regulations on potentially harmful VOCs in either Korea or abroad. Many women here, however, have already turned to alternatives such as menstrual cups and reusable cotton pads amid fears over possibly toxin-ridden sanitary pads. According to a survey by the Drug Ministry released in May, some 81 percent of women in Korea use sanitary pads, with only 11 percent using tampons. While just 1.4 percent used menstrual cups, 41 percent were aware of them. Malltail, which provides delivery services for Korean consumers shopping directly from overseas sellers, says sales of menstrual cups on its affiliate site Vitatra soared 470 percent during the week of Aug. 18-24, compared to the previous week.","cancer causing benzene tampons ,checks on menstrual cups before ,safety checks on menstrual cups ,including cancer causing benzene tampons ,the menstrual cups for sale","['the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'american', 'lilian', 'the Korean Women ’s Environmental Network', 'the US Food and Drug Administration', 'the Drug Ministry', 'Korea', 'the Drug Ministry', 'Korea', 'Malltail', 'korean', 'Vitatra']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5225724  -0.26318428

Each with a magnifying glass in hand, the children freely explored their surroundings, poking at a slug and shrieking in delight at finding a spider hanging on a web in a tree. Amid the drone of city life and strictly planned classroom culture, more parents are turning to educating their children in forests, where they can roam freely through nature.Seoul Metropolitan City was the first local government to create forests for children in 2011. There, instead of toys and books, nature provides the learning materials. Adults are only there to assist.“We sought to break the monotonous learning culture of children being trapped inside classrooms, and to foster the creativity of children by allowing them to explore nature and mingle with one another on their own,” Bae Si-yeon, the manager of the city project, told The Korea Herald.The city’s forest playgrounds are located in urban parks and woodlands, with 41 of them in Seoul now. The goal is to create 400 such places by 2023 and offer wider access to the city’s 7,500 infant education institutes. From 2012 to 2016, over 51,000 citizens visited the educational forests, according to the city’s data. This year, the city started a program that regularly invites classes from 200 local kindergartens to visit the parks once a week. “It would be nice if more children got the chance to play in forests, and we encourage that. But our program aims to bring in the same children regularly to the forests to see their development,” Bae said.Seoul hires at least one special instructor in each park to lead kids in different programs, but their roles are meant to assist, not to lead the children’s play.“There are a lot of things a child can learn from nature. They learn to respect and cooperate with others in the forests, where they help each other walking up the hills and when they meet small challenges,” said Lee Kyung-a, the head of Myungrun Care Center in Jongno. The kindergarten has been participating in the program since February. “It is important that these children are exposed to nature at this stage when their characters and moral standards start to develop,” she added. As the kindergarteners lined up to walk on the soil wet from yesterday’s rain, the area was filled with endless questions about spider webs, flowers and red ants.According to Heinz Hafner of the University of Heidelberg in Germany, children who graduate from forest kindergartens, or “Waldkindergarten” in German, show superiority in cognitive tasks and controlling their emotions. Many researchers and experts also back the idea that children exposed more to nature in their childhood show high scores in creativity and physical ability.Six months into the program, Lee has seen a change in the mindsets of parents who were initially unsure about forest education.“Many parents are very worried about the safety of the children. Some do not like their kids playing in dirt, and others worry about insect bites. But the parents in my institute have become much more enthusiastic about forest trips, as they see their children becoming brighter and more talkative about their days in kindergarten,” Lee said. Aware of such benefits, Kindergartens and nurseries have added more activities involving greenery in their curriculums. The Korea Association of Forest Kindergartens, which kicked off in 2010, now has 762 member kindergartens across the nation, with 92 of them located in Seoul.Lee Il-hwan, who came to drop his daughter off at the park, said he was satisfied with the forest education. “It is good to see children mingling with nature, insects and animals, and it is much better than commercialized playgrounds. Children observe the seasons changing with their own eyes,” the 34-year-old father said.Shin In-san, 5, took a break from making a stone and twig insect house to say how much he likes the forest.“Making houses for insects is fun. I want to come to the forest every day,” he said.

Parents and children can bond over skating and water activities at the Culture and Arts Park located at the heart of the forest. The Eco Forest is a natural habitat for deer, elks, chipmunks, ducks and many other animals, while the 70,000-square-meter Experimental Learning Park has an insect botanical garden and a wetlands flower garden. The forest’s observatory deck stands high above ground, waiting for visitors seeking an aerial view of the autumn foliage. After sunset, the deck boasts a view of Seoul’s nighttime city-lights gleaming next to a sea of trees. The forest is next to the Han River, where visitors can enjoy a fall picnic on the grassy river banks. Admission is free and wheelchair rental services are available at the visitor’s center in the Culture and Arts Park. An aerial view of the Dream Forest’s observatory deck. SeoulDream ForestOnce an amusement park, the Seoul Metropolitan Government transformed this northern Seoul area into a woodland in 2009. Parents and children can interact with deer at a petting zoo, which is by far the forest’s most popular attraction. The observatory deck within the park is famous as a location for an episode of a 2009 Korean drama series Iris, starring pan-Asian stars Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee. The glass elevator that carries viewers up to the deck moves diagonally, offering viewers a unique journey along the way. The art gallery nearby offers a rest stop with a cultural edge. The forest is one of the most eco-friendly areas in Korea, with solar panels and a rainwater harvesting system. It can be reached through a brief taxi ride after getting off at Miasageori Station via Subway Line 4 or Dolgoji Station via Subway Line 6. Seoulites enjoy activities at Yangjae Citizens’ Forest. SeoulYangjae Citizens’ Forest Yangjae Citizens’ Forest located near Yangjae Tollgate is the largest man-made forest in Seoul. It was created in 1986 to celebrate the Seoul Asian Games that year and the Olympic Games two years later. The forest is a popular spot for dates. It has an outdoor wedding venue, a walking trail where visitors can walk barefoot in the forest and blend into the surrounding nature, and a statue and memorial hall for Yun Bong-gil, a Korean pro-independence activist during the 1910-1945 Japanese colonial rule. A barbecue area is available from March to November. There are six outdoor tables equipped with grills, and reservation can be made via the forest’s official website or phone.

The agency has referred the 30 team leaders to the prosecution for investigation.On Wednesday, prosecution investigators raided 30 locations across the country, five or six of them either the homes or offices of some team leaders, and seized documents, computer hard disks, ledgers and mobile phones, officials said. The locations also included the office of an organization comprising retired NIS officials as well as the office of a conservative civilian organization made up of supporters of former President Lee Myung-bak, they said.Prosecutors have also banned the 30 team leaders as well as former and incumbent NIS officials suspected of involvement in the scheme from leaving the country. Investigators are tracing bank accounts to track down the money flow between the agency and the secretive teams.Depending on the results of the investigation, prosecutors could press additional charges against then NIS chief Won Sei-hoon. Won is on trial for allegedly pulling the strings of the cyber operations to help then-conservative candidate Park Geun-hye.Another focus of the probe is how far it will go, including who else, in addition to the former NIS chief, will be investigated.

One of her achievements includes the adoption of a revised bill that requires companies to reveal information about chemicals they import, manufacture and transfer.

It will sit next to a statue of a girl representing the victims of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery.Created by sculptor Cho Won-suk, the “Hunch of Liberation” has a width of 4 meters and a height of 3 meters. It depicts two laborers -- a father and his daughter -- during Japan‘s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Citizens donated 100 million won  to the construction of the statue.The statue is modeled after Ji Young-rye, a survivor of forced work at an arms factory, the group said. This photo, released by a South Korean civic group on Aug. 3, 2017, shows a statue representing Korean victims of forced labor under Japan`s colonial rule. Representative of South Korea’s two umbrella labor groups -- the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, set up a similar statue at the Tanba Manganese Memorial Hall, which is dedicated to Korean forced workers, in the Japanese city of Tanba, northern Kyoto Prefecture, in 2016. But such a statue has yet to be installed in South Korea.The planned installation comes after South Korean civic activists moved earlier this year to erect statues symbolizing Korean victims of forced labor near Japanese diplomatic missions, which will likely be a development to irk Tokyo.In April this year, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called the civic group‘s move to install a statue for forced labor a “big problem,” saying Tokyo has expressed a strong objection. He called on Seoul to take necessary action through diplomatic channels. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 during which historians say that millions of Koreans were coerced into labor.They also estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II.","seoul next week to commemorate ,week to commemorate korean victims ,next week to commemorate korean ,west of seoul next week ,korean civic group said friday","['south korean', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'the Japanese Imperial Army', 'Japan', 'Cho Won - suk', 'citizen', 'Ji Young - rye', 'south korean', 'korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'the korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Tanba', 'Kyoto Prefecture', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Yoshihide Suga', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'japanese']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55050659  0.75743103

The dessert, called Dragon's Breath, causes people who eat it to exhale smoky nitrogen vapor.This file photo, dated March 29, 2017, shows a cupful of nitrogen-chilled puffy cereal that a tourist bought from an eatery in Seoul. He was rushed to a general hospital in the city where doctors found a 5-centimeter hole in his stomach and took him to surgery before placing him in intensive care. He has now been transferred to a general ward. The hospital's medical staff believes he may have consumed liquid nitrogen in the last mouthful of the treat. Nitrogen, with a temperature of minus 200 C, is injected into this kind of treat. The boy is believed to have consumed residual liquefied nitrogen at the bottom of the cup after some nitrogen appeared to have melted, they said.Consuming liquefied nitrogen can deal lethal damage to internal organs.A health official at the city's Southeastern Ward office said it has asked police to investigate the case following the tipoff from the boy's family.The police are investigating the owner of the eatery on suspicions of professional negligence resulting in injury after the boy's parents filed a complaint. The eatery, which is now closed, had been operating without a business license, they said.During Friday's meeting, the prime minister also ordered the ministries of industry and environment as well as the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to examine child-related safety issues and come up with measures to strengthen children's food security.","boy receiving emergency surgery after ,old boy receiving emergency surgery ,boy receiving emergency surgery ,friday meeting the prime minister ,receiving emergency surgery after consuming","['Lee Nak - yon', 'Cheonan', 'Seoul', 'Nitrogen', 'Southeastern Ward', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11730357  0.48349983

A sense of devotion and achievement were her rewards, or at least that's what her company wanted her to believe.""Then, I was happy when my clients were happy. There often were many unfair or unreasonable demands that I would have said no to had it not been for my company or my colleagues who had a stake in what I did,"" the 39-year-old recalled.Cho was a typical Korean employee finding virtue in hard work and being able to provide for their families. She quit the company in April 2010 when she reached a point where her body simply could not afford to be abused any longer.Then in September, a former client asked her to do a simple job, and she got back in the business with her own small agency.She now works only about three hours a day, compared with 15- or 16-hour workdays at her previous job. ""Now I make much more than what I would have had I stayed with my former employer, and have all the time I need for myself and family,"" she said. What Cho has is a dramatic example of what many South Koreans, especially the young, want for themselves -- a work-life balance, or ""Wolibal""  in Korean.The importance of personal life or time for oneself from work may have been long stressed throughout the world with leading global firms, such as Google and Facebook to name a few, seeking ways to further cut down on their working hours that already last only about eight hours a day on average.Surprisingly, the people here are only starting to catch up.Some blame the high unemployment rate, while others point to the stunningly high cost of living in Asia's fourth-largest economy.The country's jobless rate stood at 3.8 percent in June, but the unemployment rate of those aged between 15 and 29 years has remained at around 10 percent after reaching 12.3 percent in February, the second highest in the country's history.""The truth is that Wolibal still isn't the top priority while looking for a job because a nice paying job is so hard to come by these days. But it certainly is a high priority, and people will often debate over which job is better in terms of personal time and opportunities to grow given that the jobs available pay about the same amount,"" Yoo Jung-hoon, 23, said.Yoo was lucky enough to find a full-time job at a local newspaper as soon as she got out of school, but she said how much it paid and what time she would get off from work certainly played a role in her decision.""In an online forum for jobseekers I used to go to, people often exchange information and hold discussions on which company has the best environment to realize Wolibal,"" she said. This photo, taken July 28, 2017, shows a large number of people lined up for security checks before their departure from Seoul`s Incheon International Airport. A record 6.84 million South Koreans are estimated to head overseas for summer vacation, with the number of South Koreans going overseas in the entire year also expected to reach a record high. Local firms are catching up too.Olive Young, a medium-sized cosmetics firm, has extended the period of paid leave for its male employees to two weeks from three days when they have a new baby.Male and female workers at CJ Group, a major business conglomerate here, may take up to one month off when their children begin elementary school.Those who seek to find an optimum balance between how much they make and how much they spend at work differentiate themselves from a growing number of people pursuing what is known as a YOLO  lifestyle.Yoo noted a YOLO lifestyle focuses more on what one wishes to do with his or her life, whereas ""Wolibal"" emphasizes making a decent living: financially, physically and emotionally.""People still have to consider making as much as they can, but more seem to think entirely giving up their personal life may not be worth it,"" she said.President Moon Jae-in apparently is no exception.The new president began his five-day summer break at the start of this week. Earlier he said he planned to spend all his paid leave days, which could make him the first South Korean president to do so.Yoon Young-chan, Moon's chief press secretary, said doing so would be as important for the president as it would be for the rest of the people.""President Moon and the administration have been and continue to be sending a consistent message; that we need to have a better life,"" he told Yonhap News Agency.Though never explicitly said, most of Moon's new policy initiatives certainly focus more on income and reduced working hours -- the basic ingredients of balance between work and life.In 2015, South Korean workers put in an average 2,113 hours a year at work, the second highest among all member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and347 hours more than the OECD average of 1,766 hours in the same year, according to an earlier report.Moon seeks to set the minimum wage at 10,000 won  per hour by 2020, up from the current 6,470 won per hours, while reducing the average working hours.He has also vowed to enforce a minimum 12-day paid leave for all salaried workers. In 2013, each South Korean worker had an average 14.2 days in paid leave available. They only spent 8.6 days in leave that year.","korean employee finding virtue in ,largest economy the country jobless ,koreans especially the young want ,korean employee finding virtue ,workdays at her previous job","['Cho Soo - kyung', 'Cho', 'korean', 'Cho', 'South Koreans', 'Korean', 'Wolibal', 'Yoo Jung - hoon', 'Yoo', 'Wolibal', 'Incheon International Airport', 'South Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Young', 'CJ Group', 'Yoo', 'yolo', 'Moon Jae - in', 'south korean', 'Yoon Young - chan', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Moon', 'south korean', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and347 hour', 'OECD', 'Moon', 'south korean']",13,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.98723513  0.66465431

Since last year’s assessment, the province has made specific efforts to make improvements in areas with low scores, the governor stressed. They include health and hygiene, environment and safety managements. In particular, Gyeonggi’s effective waste management program has led to improvements in the environmental field, with a twofold increase in the per-capita recyclable waste collection last year.

Among his lesser-noticed promises was a vow to improve quality of life in a society of long hours and hard work _  to help break the chains to people's desks, to let them take a breath and relax a bit. And what Moon Jae-in preaches, it seems, he also practices. Even if, in the aftermath of North Korea launching its second ICBM, that means telling the leader of the free world: I'll get back to you. I'm going on vacation for a week. So while US President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had an emergency phone call Monday, the South Korean leader's office said Moon and Trump will likely talk after Moon enjoys some previously scheduled R&R;, which ends this weekend.   It might seem an odd decision by a relatively new president in the midst of arguably the world's biggest crisis, and certainly South Korea's: Namely, North Korea's march toward an arsenal of nuclear missiles, highlighted by its second ICBM test late Friday night. But it fits nicely into Moon's efforts to show South Koreans that it may actually help their work, not to mention the economy, to take a break from it, even if that work takes place at the highest levels of statesmanship. It's also part of Moon's desire to draw, whenever possible, a clear line between himself and his currently jailed predecessor, conservative former President Park Geun-hye, who was seen as stiff, even imperial, and who now faces a corruption trial. Moon, for instance, recently adopted a shelter dog rescued from possible slaughter, and last week orchestrated a carefully staged photo op that featured him in shirt sleeves hoisting beers with businessmen. When Park's dictator father led the country's economic rise in the 1960s and `70s after the destruction of the Korean War, working long hours and sacrificing time with family were seen as necessary to national success. Even now, South Korea is near the top of the list of rich countries working the longest hours, and South Koreans reportedly only use about half of their annual paid leave days. Despite the long hours, however, the country's reported labor productivity is relatively low. Moon vowed to use all his vacation this year to set an example. He may also just want to take a break when everyone else does _ or inspire those who don't. The last week of July and first week of August, when schools are out, are when many South Koreans take holidays. Though attitudes are changing, it is still considered taboo by many to leave work before your boss. A vacation by Moon, arguably the boss of bosses, amid all the pressures of his job, sends a powerful message. ""It has long been a habit to regard as a virtue burying oneself in work without going on a vacation,'' the Seoul-based liberal Hankyoreh newspaper said in an editorial Sunday. ""A president going on a summer vacation and using annual holiday can create an atmosphere where ordinary people rightfully go on their own vacations.'' The decision hasn't been universally admired. ""The Korean Peninsula currently faces its worst-ever  situation,'' Lee Jong-chul, a spokesman for the conservative opposition Bareun Party, said, according to the Yonhap news agency. ``I wonder whether our people can understand why President Moon went on a vacation only a day after he responded to the North Korean provocation.'' US presidents are also often criticized for going on vacation in the midst of the near-constant stream of crises they face. Golf is often the lure. In Moon's case, it's not as if he'll be sailing his way through some distant tropical archipelago. His holiday spot of choice is a military-run vacation facility in southern South Korea, where he can be debriefed and communicate with officials by teleconference in the event of North Korean provocations, his office says. So, like so many of his fellow South Koreans _ and their counterparts elsewhere _ he'll be going on vacation and bringing his work along with him, too.","korea latest leader took office ,korea launching its second icbm ,north korean provocation us presidents ,monday the south korean leader ,second icbm test late friday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'south korean', 'Moon', 'Trump', 'Moon', ""South Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'Moon', 'South Koreans', 'Moon', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Hankyoreh', 'Lee Jong - chul', 'Bareun Party', 'Moon', 'north korean', 'US', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'South Koreans']",16,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.45826852  0.60814148

According to the panel, the ministry is scheduled to increase its spending on elementary, middle and high school students from low-income households to help them purchase school supplies and materials beginning next year.  The Ministry of Education building in Sejong City, South KoreaUnder the support program, the ministry will provide 66,000 won  a year for elementary school students of low-income households as subsidies for purchasing school textbooks, and 50,000 won for school supplies. The figure was 41,200 won this year for textbooks subsidies, while no subsidies were provided for elementary students to buy school supplies. For middle and high school students, they will receive 162,000 won a year, a 70 percent increase from this year’s 95,300 won. The ministry plans to roll out the new support package by the ministry next year, expecting to benefit about 380,000 students whose households make less than 2.26 million won a month.At the high school level, the ministry will fully cover school and admissions fees for students from national and public schools as well as the cost of school supplies, the panel said. They now receive 1.52 million won a year from the government upon entering high school. The ministry added that it would work closely with local governments to offer more educational opportunities for students from low-income households and cover their expenses, from field trips and extracurricular activities to school uniforms.Monday’s announcement came after Education Minister Kim Sang-kon vowed to bring about equal opportunities for all students in education. Here, households with monthly salaries of 7 million won or more spent 443,000 won a month on private education last year, according to the ministry’s data. The figure is nine times as much as families bringing in 1 million won or less.More support for education is also part of the Moon administration’s efforts to focus on better social safety measures which were recently announced through its five-year policy road map. President Moon Jae-in promised to provide more child care support, focus on the welfare of the people and renovate the country’s disaster response system, including the reducing of energy dependence on nuclear power.By Bak Se-hwan","000 won for school supplies ,50 000 won for school ,school uniforms monday announcement ,purchasing school textbooks and 50 ,won month on private education","['South Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Education', 'the Ministry of Education', 'Sejong City', 'Kim Sang - kon', 'Moon', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Bak Se - hwan']",17,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.43429127 -0.07138567

Unfortunately, it is also the time when most drownings occur. That is where water survival classes come in.Teachers practice survival floating techniques at Daecheon Beach on the west coast on July 19. “Basic floating techniques can prevent many deaths,” said Ryou Sun-mi, a qualified aquatic instructor and vice principal of Myeongsin Elementary School.“But without training, children easily panic in deep water, get hypothermia and, as a result, struggle to stay afloat or tread until someone can rescue them,” Ryou said.Drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental death in South Korea, accounting for 3,133 deaths in the last five years, according to Statistics Korea. An average of more than 600 drown to their death every year. However, the lifesaving skills of rolling onto one’s back, floating in a position that keeps the airway clear and waiting until help arrives are not taught at schools or even at paid swimming classes that teach all the strokes from freestyle to butterfly. To change this, the Ministry of Education has since last year been campaigning to spread water survival tips, offering teachers the chance to participate in two-day training sessions. The intention is to help teachers instruct students on how to survive in the water. “Through the course, teachers are expected to enhance their teaching skills in water survival techniques and raise awareness of water safety,” Nam Bu-ho from the ministry said. “In line with the training of teachers, the ministry is planning to improve students’ access to swimming facilities in cooperation with cities and provinces,” Nam said. Most public schools in South Korea do not have a swimming pool. On July 19 at Daecheon Beach on the west coast, 60 teachers gathered under the warm, afternoon sun. Divided into groups of 10, they boarded a rubber boat to deep water, guided by an aquatic expert -- to try for themselves what they learned in theory that morning. “Wearing a proper life jacket is critical, regardless of how well you swim. A fun swim could turn into a disaster due to conditions such as waves, currents or exhaustion,” Kim Min-soo, one of the lifeguards who led the outdoor session, said before demonstrating how to float on your front and back in the water. Teachers also tried group-floating -- holding one another by the hands or lower arms and forming a circle while trying to hold their own upper arms tightly to their sides. This simple and easy technique can save energy and help them stay warm while waiting for rescue, increasing the chance of survival, the instructor said. “It is vital that you conserve energy and warmth, and the best way to do that is to use the buddy system when you are in a group,” he said. Adopting a crouch posture when alone prevents body heat loss from such areas as head, neck, armpits and groin, according to the instructor. Han Byung-joon, 32, one of the participants and a teacher at Jochiwon Daedong Elementary School in Sejong, said he had slipped in a pool and briefly experienced what it feels like to drown when he was a young child. “From then on, I was just fearful. Fearful of what could happen even after so many years. I learned how to swim after that, and I want my children and students to learn how to be independent and have a gut instinct of what to do if they were in a sticky situation,” said Han. Another teacher from Yongam Elementary School, Lee Ae-ri, said she would like to bring her students to open water for practice, not a pool. “It’s a whole lot different in open water than in a pool. I wish the school could provide an outdoor program to teach students,” Lee said. Water survival lessons not only allow young students to acquire skills to avoid drowning, but could lead to a rise in the popularity of swimming, said Ryou. “Schools without swimming pools can work with local swimming centers to provide kids chances to learn how to swim with minimal fees. This in turn would make them potential swimmers in the long run,” she said. Ryou stressed the necessity of water survival classes for adults as well. A drowning incident sparks panic for kids and adults alike, she said. “Anybody can be under the worst case scenario, without supervision or anything to hold onto in the water, even if you are a swimmer. In such incidents, it is critical to stay calm, roll onto your back and try to breathe for a few seconds. Then look for the nearest way to get out.”By Bak Se-hwan   and Park Ju-young","have swimming pool on july ,drowning incident sparks panic for ,swimming classes that teach all ,swimming pool on july ,drowning incident sparks panic","['Daecheon Beach', 'Ryou Sun - mi', 'Myeongsin Elementary School', 'South Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'the Ministry of Education', 'Nam Bu - ho', 'Nam', 'South Korea', 'Daecheon Beach', 'Kim Min - soo', 'Han Byung - joon', 'Jochiwon Daedong Elementary School', 'Sejong', 'Han', 'Yongam Elementary School', 'Lee Ae - ri', 'Lee', 'Ryou', 'Bak Se - hwan', 'Park Ju - young']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53659356 -0.0585514

YonhapThe businessmen who attended Friday’s meeting were Korean Air President Cho Won-tae, Hyundai Heavy Industries Chairman Choi Gil-seon, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman Park Yong-mann, GS Group Chairman Huh Chang-soo, Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin and KT Chairman Hwang Chang-kyu. “The government has announced 100 tasks and its economic policy direction, and the economic paradigm must be changed to one focused on the people, jobs and income-led growth,” Moon was quoted as saying by Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun. “ well aware that there are concerns that the burden on companies and the economy will grow. However, there is no other way to revive the economy,” Moon said, according to Park.“ request business leaders to share the new government’s economic ideals and to work together to achieve the goals. Corporations contribute to the national economy, and the government aids businesses through policies -- the government and corporations are partners.” Following Moon’s remarks, SK Group’s Chey requested the government to give social enterprises wider access to public procurement projects and highlighted the group’s efforts to aid smaller companies. The KT chairman followed with a suggestion of a project designed to nurture talent for the “fourth industrial revolution,” which would be funded by the government and corporations. While the majority of the businessmen in attendance focused on their companies’ projects that fall in line with Moon’s economic goals, GS Group’s Huh touched on the issue of tax rates. “ has endeavored to create jobs and to pay lots of taxes, and will continue to do so.  request that the government actively support the corporations,” Huh said, in an apparent reference to the proposed hike in corporate tax rates. While the government has taken a back seat on the issue, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea has proposed to raise the tax rate on the highest earning companies. Regarding the ailing shipbuilding industry, Moon said that the government will roll out measures to support the sector until conditions improve.“It is projected that the industry will see improving conditions from 2019, but until then the government will consider buoying demand through public contracts” Moon said in response to related comments from HHI’s Choi.According to the Cheong Wa Dae spokesman, Moon ordered government officials present at the meeting to develop measures to provide smaller shipyards with financial support.

Faced with unexpected hospital fees and double efforts needed for child care, Lee sought out additional support offered by the government. Government support for parents of twins is growing as the number of twins rises in Korea, including paid maternity leave and free nutritional supplements for expecting mothers. According to Statistics Korea, the number of multiple-birth children such as twins and triplets more than doubled in the past 25 years to reach 16,166 children in 2015. Multiple-birth children made up 3.7 percent of newborns in 2015, the latest year for which official statistics are available.The rise can be seen in shopping trends as well. According to online open market 11st, sales of strollers for twin babies rose by 70 percent on-year in 2017 and 73 percent on-year in 2016, although sales of strollers in general have stayed relatively steady.The increasing number of multiple-birth children is widely attributed to the rising number of children conceived via in vitro fertilization as the average age of marriage and childbirth continues to go up in Korea.Recognizing that parents of multiple-birth children generally spend more money on hospital care, the government increased its financial support for prenatal care from 700,000 won  to 900,000 won starting this year.  Mothers with twins can also register with local clinics to receive additional supplies of iron and folic acid, beyond the basic nutritional kit currently supplied to all pregnant women.Maternity leave is also extended for twin mothers, taking into account that it often takes multiple-birth mothers longer to recuperate after giving birth. Single-birth mothers receive basic maternity leave of 90 days, while multiple-birth mothers can take up to 120 days off around the time of giving birth. Parents of twins can also receive double the regular child care leave, which is one year per child. If both parents are working, they can take up to a combined four years off from work with partial pay to take care of the children.However, despite these additional services, mothers say that they are not enough. “Most of the policies you see add just a little bit to the regular support policies for single-birth mothers, but that hides the fact that mothers with twins face completely different challenges,” said Lee. For example, she said, it is more difficult to find prenatal health insurance for twins or triplets because of the increased risks associated with multiple-child births.Finding help for postnatal care is also more difficult as postnatal facilities tend to prefer single babies and hired care takers often shun families of multiple-birth babies despite proposals of higher pay, citing added burden.“Rather than simply increasing the monetary amount or time given to parents of twins, future policies should focus more on educating expectant mothers about how to prepare for having twins and helping them to receive specialized care.” By Won Ho-jung","having twins she felt overwhelmed ,all pregnant women maternity ,also extended for twin mothers ,unexpected hospital fees and double ,twin babies rose by 70","['Lee Hye - jeong', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Won Ho - jung']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26207784  0.49989888

Her death shrank the total number of such survivors to just 37, who are in their 80s and 90s. More than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, are believed to have fallen victim to Japan's wartime atrocity.   Some 1,000 students call for Japan`s apology for its war crime during a weekly rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on July 26, 2017. Kim was sent to a Japanese military brothel in China's northeastern Jilin province at 17, and attempted suicide seven times during her three years there. In February 2007, she testified about Japan's war crime at a US congressional hearing for the first time.At the Wednesday rally, the 1,293rd, Kim's portrait, along with a chrysanthemum, was placed, with Kim Won-ok, another surviving 89-year-old comfort woman, on hand amid the sweltering heat. ""We pray for the soul of the late Kim Kun-ja who had suffered unbearable suffering as a human,"" said Kim Joo-eop, the leader of a union of public servants. Yoon Mi-hyang, chairwoman of the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, criticized the government for just saying it will ""review"" a 2015 Seoul-Tokyo deal on comfort women first instead of declaring it invalid.""The government should immediately dismantle a reconciliation foundation launched by the deal, and President Moon declare its invalidity as he promised to do so during the presidential election,"" she said.Some 1,000 elementary, middle and high school students, who are now on summer vacation, attended the rally, calling for Japan's official apology and compensation. The Korea Council launched the weekly rally in January 1992 when then-Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visited the country. Since then, the rally has been held at noon every Wednesday in front of the Japanese Embassy. In March 2002, the gathering was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest rally on a single theme.","at weekly rally against japan ,war crime during weekly rally ,women drafted for military sexual ,on wednesday kim died sunday ,weekly rally against japan wartime","['Kim Kun - ja', 'Japan', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Kim', 'the House of sharing in', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'japanese', 'China', 'Jilin', 'Japan', 'US', 'Kim', 'Kim Won - ok', 'Kim Kun - ja', 'Kim Joo - eop', 'Yoon Mi - hyang', 'the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Japan', 'the Korea Council', 'japanese', 'Kiichi Miyazawa', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'the Guinness Book of Records']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33148831  0.265423

But they reportedly concern the construction of Lotte World Tower in southern Seoul by retail giant Lotte Group, and include information on dealings involving a former Navy chief and the defunct STX Group.“The document related to Lotte Group is about their construction consent on the Lotte World Tower,” a Cheong Wa Dae official was quoted as saying by the Yonhap News Agency.While the presidential office told the Korea Herald it could not confirm the content of the documents, pundits view the documents as linked to the construction permit that was granted to the conglomerate long after the request, when the Lee administration took power in 2008.  Lotte World Tower The construction of the 555-meter Lotte World Tower in Jamsil, Seoul, had been a decades-old dream of Lotte Group Chairman Shin Kyuk-ho, who bought the plot of land in 1987. Its construction, however, was only permitted in 2010. The skyscraper project had faced strong opposition from the Air Force, which said the building would hamper operations of nearby Seoul Airport, a military installation in Gyeonggi Province. As the construction consent was made on the condition the runway angle of the airport be tilted by three degrees, the Lee administration then came under fire for possible links with the corporation. No evidence supporting such allegations was uncovered. The STX Group document is thought to contain information about the former Navy chief pressuring the business group in 2008 to offer 770 million won  to his son’s yacht company in exchange for business favors. Jung Ok-keun, chief of naval operations from 2008 to 2010 was sentenced to four years in prison. Cheong Wa Dae is believed to be weighing the options of opening them to the public, as the documents contain evidence of previous government misdeeds. “Opinions are divided inside on whether to reveal to the public or to let it be known through prosecutorial investigation,” Yonhap quoted an unnamed presidential officer as saying. It had previously revealed some of the documents compiled by former President Park Geun-hye, found in other offices of the presidential aides, and submitted the copies of the documents as evidence to special prosecutor Park Young-soo, who investigated the former president during her impeachment. The revealed documents hinted at links between Park and Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, and suggested Park provided backdoor support for a smooth leadership transfer of Lee. The two are currently detained and standing trial on bribery charges. An official at the presidential office put tape on the box containing presidential documents found in the offices of presidnetial secretaries, to deliver them to the Presidential Archive at the Blue House on July 14. The original documents discovered in the office of the presidential secretary for national security are expected to be transferred to the presidential archives, while copies related to the misdeeds would likely be submitted to the prosecution. The conservative parties that formed the previous administrations have lashed out at the government for leaking information about the secret presidential documents, accusing it of carrying out a political vendetta against the former governments. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party filed a complaint against presidential spokesperson Park Soo-hyun on July 19 for violating the Management of Presidential Archives Act, which prohibits concealing or divulging of presidential records without permission.By Jo He-rim","dae on tuesday discovered documents ,the secret presidential documents accusing ,on tuesday discovered documents ,tuesday discovered documents from the ,on tuesday discovered documents from","['Lee Myung - bak', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Seoul', 'Lotte Group', 'Navy', 'STX Group', 'Lotte Group', 'the Lotte World Tower', 'the Yonhap News Agency', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Jamsil', 'Seoul', 'Lotte Group', 'Shin Kyuk - ho', 'the Air Force', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee', 'the STX Group', 'Navy', 'Jung Ok - keun', 'Dae', 'Park Geun', 'Park Young', 'Park', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Lee', 'the Presidential Archive', 'the Blue House', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Park Soo - hyun', 'the Management of Presidential Archives Act', 'Jo He - rim']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23071666  0.37515372

The decision was made at a meeting attended by all 14 justices at the top court. Whether to approve the live TV coverage is up to the presiding judge. Verdict hearings can be broadcast live even without the defendants’ consent, but strictly in cases in which the live streaming serves the public interest, according to the court. So far, the court has prohibited recording, filming and televising of hearings in lower courts. The Supreme Court has televised major hearings that can greatly affect the public since March 2013. The Constitutional Court has filmed the hearings and released them online.Supreme Court Chief Justice Yang Sung-tae has pushed for the televising of major trials to enhance the public’s right to know and understanding of the judicial system. According to a survey conducted by the Office of Court Administration on 2,900 judges nationwide last month, 687 of the 1,013 respondents said that the live streaming of some or all court proceedings should be permitted. But concerns remain over possible infringement of privacy and defense rights as well as the impact that the televising can have on the neutrality of trials. The main opposition party blasted the decision, expressing worries that trials could be swayed by the public sentiments. “The live coverage of trials can excessively affect judges’ judgement that should be based on law and conscience. It can violate human rights of defendants when the hearings are open to the public against defendants’ will,” the conservative Liberty Korea Party spokesperson Jun Hee-kyung said, apparently mindful of the upcoming ruling for former President Park. Park, who remains in detention, is on trial over a total of 18 charges including bribery and abuse of power in connection with the corruption scandal that removed her from office in March. A ruling on Park is expected in October. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea and the centrist People’s Party hailed the decision. “Allowing the live TV coverage of major rulings will be a chance to restore public trust in the judiciary and guarantee people’s rights to know,” Democratic Party spokesperson Baek Hye-ryun said.By Ock Hyun-ju","the supreme court decided tuesday ,court has televised major hearings ,tuesday to allow verdict hearings ,court decided tuesday to allow ,900 judges nationwide last month","['the Supreme Court', 'Park Geun', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Verdict', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Supreme Court', 'Yang Sung - tae', 'the Office of Court Administration', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Jun Hee - kyung', 'Park', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Democratic Party', 'Baek Hye - ryun', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34571627  0.50284654

But China has repeatedly pressed South Korea to withdraw the THAAD system out of concern that the deployment could hurt Beijing’s security interests.Qiu also reiterated that Beijing is against North Korea‘s missile and nuclear programs, though he said sanctions cannot fundamentally settle the issue.China is North Korea’s most important trading partner and key source of food and fuel, giving Beijing significant leverage over Pyongyang.Critics claim that China has been reluctant to enforce tougher U.N. sanctions against North Korea apparently out of concerns that such a move could destabilize its communist ally.","korea called saturday for solution ,koreans say beijing is retaliating ,tougher sanctions against north korea ,beijing is retaliating against seoul ,quickly end monthslong diplomatic row","['china‘s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Qiu Guohong', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'South Koreans', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Qiu', 'South Korea ’s', 'Jeju', 'China', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'North korea‘s', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'Qiu', 'Beijing', 'North Korea‘s', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'U.N.', 'North Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83234739  0.66867667

""This is a reassuring step forward to lower tensions.""Quintana wrapped up his five-day stay here on Friday aimed at collecting information about human rights violations in North Korea by meeting with government officials of relevant ministries, experts and those who defected from the communist state. This is his second trip to Seoul since taking office in August last year. He is to submit a report on the human rights situation in the North at the UN General Assembly to be held in October.His visit coincided with an offer from the Moon Jae-in government to hold military talks with the North and Red Cross talks to discuss reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. There has been no official response from the North on the overtures.""I very much hope that the DPRK  will respond positively to the Moon initiative in the interest of long-term peace, security and humanitarian cooperation between the two countries,"" he said. ""At the same time, let me emphasize that the protection of human rights should be central to this policy of rapprochement.""Citing his conversation with government officials, experts and some North Korean defectors, Quintana expressed concerns over widespread corruption in the North, among other things. He also voiced worries about a surge in detentions and forced repatriations of North Koreans caught in China. ""I shared these concerns with the Chinese authorities recalling their obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention as well as relevant parts of the UN system,"" he said. ""I urge them again to address this problem by giving special protection to DPRK citizens who transit through China's territory.""He also urged both South and North Korea not to ""politicize"" the 12 North Korean restaurant workers who came here from China last year. The North claims that they were kidnapped by the South but the Seoul government says that they defected to the South of their own will. The North has conditioned the resumption of reunions of separated families on their return.""Whereas I am pleased to learn that these women are safe and not held in detention, I see inconsistencies in the narrative concerning their cases, and will be following up with cornered governments,"" he said.""Here let me urge the two Koreas to avoid politicizing the situation of these women and strictly focus on their interests, protection needs and the needs of their families,"" he noted. Quintana explained that the ""inconsistencies"" in the narrative with regard to the 12 North Korean restaurant workers stemmed from his government sources and non-government sources. He didn't want to elaborate further.He, meanwhile, hoped to travel to the North where he wants to meet both its authorities and ordinary citizens and know much more about the reality that many of them are facing in their daily lives, though he said that Pyongyang has not allowed his trip to the reclusive state so far. ""I am still trying to pursue engagement in this respect. I understand this might take time. And I am sure that the authorities here in the Republic of Korea also have the same understanding of what entails in a process of engagement,"" he said.","welcomed the south korean government ,repatriations of north koreans caught ,situation in north korea welcomed ,dialogue with pyongyang on friday ,to seoul since taking office","['UN', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'North Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'the UN General Assembly', 'the North and Red Cross', 'Moon', 'north korean', 'Quintana', 'North Koreans', 'China', 'chinese', 'UN', 'China', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'Quintana', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'the Republic of Korea']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45890945  0.6151402

""It is difficult to believe the veracity of their testimonies in light of objectivity and details of the statements,"" the top court said in the ruling. The defendant was indicted in 2013 on charges of robbing and raping an 18-year-old college student, only identified by her last name Chung, in 1998. The belated indictment came as the DNA of the defendant, who was arrested for soliciting prostitution to a minor, was found to match that left on Chung's underwear.   Officers take the Sri Lankan charged with robbing and raping a South Korean college student in 1998, to the Daegu High Court for an appeals trial on Aug. 11, 2015. Chung was found dead on Oct. 17, 1998, after being hit by a 25-ton dump truck on a highway in Daegu, some 302 kilometers southeast of Seoul. The police had suspected rape as they found her lingerie 30 meters away from the site of the accident, but concluded it was an accidental death. In the fresh investigation, the prosecutors found that Chung jumped into the road as she ran away from her attackers in fear and had lost sense of direction in the dark. The prosecutors indicted the Sri Lankan and two other accomplices of the same nationality on counts of special robbery and rape in 2013. It was about the only criminal charge they could lay against them since the statutes of limitation for rape and special rape in Korea are set at five years and 10 years, respectively. The lower court and appeals court found the defendant not guilty, saying that the evidence was insufficient to prove the charges. The prosecution managed to call a witness to the stand who testified that the defendant had told him in person about committing the rape. But the appeals court dismissed the testimony citing a lack of credibility. The Sri Lankan will be extradited to his country as South Korea is bound by law to send back a foreign criminal who's been given a suspended sentence. He was convicted of sexually harassing a woman in 2013 and driving without a license a few years before that.The two other accomplices in Chung's case were expelled from the country in the early 2000s due to the illegal stay.","raping south korean college student ,tuesday in the final twist ,convicted of sexually harassing woman ,and raping south korean college ,raping young south korean woman","['Sri Lankan', 'south korean', 'the Supreme Court', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Sri Lankan', 'south korean', 'Daegu High Court', 'Chung', 'Daegu', 'Seoul', 'Chung', 'Sri Lankan', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Chung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33311537  0.27047983

Opening a hatch in the wall, she put her inside, turned around and walked away.She ran her hands over her head but did not look back, surveillance camera footage showed. She may never see the girl again.South Korea has risen from the ruins of war to become Asia’s fourth-largest economy and a member of the OECD club of developed countries. It was for a time one of the world’s biggest sources of unwanted children, driven by poverty, a light regulatory touch, and a culture of racial purity, family bloodlines, and shame. Around 110,000 South Koreans have been adopted to the United States alone since the 1950s but numbers have fallen in recent years. Birth rates have plummeted to the world’s lowest with factors such as high child-rearing costs and a workaholic culture affecting the situation.But the number of abandoned babies has jumped in recent years in the wake of a law intended to protect children.Now more changes are mooted, for similarly well-intended reasons, that campaigners say could make the situation even worse.Buried aliveThe woman in the video footage was among the latest of more than 1,000 to have made their way to a house in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Seoul. Converted into a shelter by a small Seoul church, a temperature-controlled chamber built into the wall functions as a baby box, enabling unwanted newborns to be taken in without parents having to identify themselves.New arrivals -- almost 200 last year, an average of nearly four a week -- are deposited covered in blood, wrapped in material, sometimes with the umbilical cord still attached.Pastor Lee Jong-rak of the Jusarang Community Church set up the facility after hearing reports of babies being abandoned in the open air or in public restrooms, where they risked dying of hypothermia.“Some teenagers give birth to babies in empty houses or in public toilets. They wrap them in old shirts or towels and bring them to us,” he told AFP.On one occasion, a young couple brought in a baby covered in dust. The father had been planning to bury it alive, he explained.“When the father started shoveling earth over it, the mother could not bear it anymore and rescued the baby.”Social stigmaIn 2010, its first year of operations, just four babies were placed in the box.At the time, South Korean women who wanted to give up unwanted babies were obliged to give adoption agencies their written consent, but often gave false details or no records, and operators looked the other way.But two years later the country adopted a law banning adoption agencies accepting undocumented babies, in line with the Hague Convention, which aims to give adoptive children the right to trace their birth parents. It also required all adoptions to be court-approved.In 2013, 224 babies were abandoned at the centre by parents desperate to hide their identities. Almost all who do so are poor single women. More unmarried mothers are keeping their children in South Korea, but face social ostracism and struggle to find husbands willing to accept such a past. Even employment checks often go into family background, and would show that a woman had had a child and given it up.The box operates in a legal grey area.Authorities are fully aware of it, and the welfare ministry -- which has a specific category for it in its statistics -- neither supports it nor opposes it as, according to official Kim Hye-ji, “it saves the lives of newborn babies”.But the Gwanak district office has repeatedly urged Pastor Cho to shut it down. “We see the baby box as an illegal facility that encourages baby abandonment,” said local official Min Seo-Young.Blank sheetThe shelter looks after new arrivals for a few days until they are moved to orphanages to await new families.But a stigma remains around adoption in Korea, where a focus on preserving family bloodlines makes the idea of raising someone else’s child anathema to many.It also has a long history of taking pride in its racial homogeneity -- many of the first international adoptees were the mixed-race children of American servicemen and Korean mothers.International adoptions slumped by three-quarters in the wake of the 2012 law -- which tightened requirements from natural and prospective adoptive parents -- going from 916 the previous year to 236 in 2013.Now Seoul says it aims to ratify the Hague Convention, which says children should preferably be adopted by families in their home country, by the end of the year.Officials say that will see authorities regulate all stages of the adoption process, including the reasons children are given up, the qualifications of adopting parents, and ensuring that as adults, adoptees will be able to trace their birth families.Pastor Lee’s colleague Cho Tae-seung is concerned that the regulations resulting from the convention could backfire by driving women to abandon unwanted babies illicitly and dangerously.“It’s very hard to strike a balance between reality and international adoption norms,” he said.Instead the group wants mothers to be legally allowed to give birth and give up their children anonymously.Next to the hatch in the wall, a form enables parents to state a child’s name, date of birth, and vaccinations.The mother in the video left it blank.","korean mothers international adoptions ,abandoned babies has jumped in ,korean mothers international adoptions slumped ,child nursery her daughter in ,2013 224 babies were abandoned","['South Korea', 'OECD', 'South Koreans', 'the United States', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Lee Jong - rak', 'the Jusarang Community Church', 'south korean', 'the Hague Convention', 'South Korea', 'Kim Hye - ji', 'Pastor Cho', 'Min Seo - Young', 'Korea', 'american', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Lee ’s', 'Cho Tae - seung']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65194988  0.3569673

According to traditional beliefs, during a leap month, good family events, mainly marriages, are to be avoided, while it is OK to carry out funeral-related works such as changing burial sites. South Korea is in the middle of a 13th month lasting from June 24 to July 22, but the myths and superstitions surrounding it appear to be fading -- at least among the young generation. “I did not really know it was a leap month until I went to the wedding hall company to settle my wedding day last year,” said 28-year-old Cho In-young who got married in the last week of June. “We decided to go ahead, because none of us and our parents cared.” Another bride, Yoon Ji-young, specifically chose to tie the knot during the leap month, because of a 50 percent discount that a wedding consultancy offered. “As Christians, our family does not believe in such superstitions,” she said. Wedding industry insiders said leap-month discounts and special promotions are also disappearing, because there are more couples who think like Yoon these days. “Young couples nowadays do not seem to be aware of the leap month traditions. We saw only a 5 percent decrease in reservations compared to last year, and the rate could have been influenced by the rainy season,” said an official at a wedding hall company in Apgujeong, central Seoul. To the generation used to the solar calendar, the concept of a leap month can be unfamiliar. Kim Seung-woo, a 29-year-old university student revealed that he had heard of the term, but did not know what it was exactly.Leap months occur seven times over a 19-year period in the lunar calendar because a month is counted by a cycle of the moon. A lunar year is usually 11 days shorter than its solar counterpart. To compensate the difference, an extra month is inserted around every three years.There are superstitions that no ghost or spirit exists to influence human affairs during leap months, as they do not recognize the month. This also means that there are no good spirits to watch over newlyweds and families, and no bad spirits to interrupt the way to the afterlife. Such superstitions date back only a few centuries, scholars said, adding that until the late Joseon era, the month was considered a good time to do anything. Kim Myung-ja, an emeritus professor of the Department of Folklore at Andong National University, explained that tradition changed. “As time passed, people became more cautious in leap months and they started to avoid getting married or giving birth,” she said.  The demand for shrouds jumped in the leap month, as the traditional belief says the extra lunar month is a good time to get funeral-related work done. Many now seem less concerned about whether there are good spirts to watch over them during leap months. However, when it comes to evil spirits, more people seem to care. Burial and cremation-related affairs, in particular the relocation of corpses already buried, have gone up sharply since the leap month began. Online reservations for the 58 public cremation facilities across the nation have been fully booked with over 20,000 cremations of buried corpses. Aware of the rise in demand, the ministry announced that it would extend the reservation period for cremation services from the current 15 days in advance to 30 days. It also said extra cremation furnaces would be put to use if there is a shortage during the month. “My father’s body will be removed from its current burial place in Cheonan to a woodland burial after cremation next week, so that he can peacefully rest amid nature,” said Kim, who declined to reveal her full name. “It is simple. People want to get unpleasant or worrying tasks done during the month because they say it is less harmful.”By Jo He-rim","burial after cremation next week ,50 percent discount that wedding ,leap month good family events ,settle my wedding day last ,woodland burial after cremation next","['korean', 'South Korea', 'Cho In - young', 'Yoon Ji - young', 'Christians', 'Yoon', 'Apgujeong', 'Seoul', 'Kim Seung - woo', 'Kim Myung - ja', 'the Department of Folklore at Andong National University', 'Cheonan', 'Kim', 'Jo He - rim']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58732826  0.08974354

The isolated, nuclear-armed North sent a chill through the international community Tuesday after its missile launch, a milestone in Pyongyang's decades-long drive for the capability to threaten the US mainland with a nuclear strike.US President Donald Trump had dismissed the idea of the North having a working ICBM, vowing it ""won't happen,"" but experts say the missile could reach Alaska or even further towards the continental US. The test prompted the US and the South to stage a joint missile drill aimed at countering the North's threats, after South Korean President Moon Jae-In called for a response beyond ""just words"".North Korea hit back Thursday, with its propaganda National Peace Committee for Korea criticising Moon for denouncing Pyongyang ""instead of getting rejoiced over the praiseworthy event"" staged by its northern neighbour, according to the KCNA news agency. Mocking the South as ""puppet military gangsters,"" the KCNA report added: ""It will be as easy as a piece of cake for the  to wipe out the puppet forces ... as we are now able to destroy even the US mainland across the ocean."" Left-leaning Moon, who has advocated dialogue with the North to bring it to negotiating table, condemned the launch and joined calls for tighter sanctions on Pyongyang. The latest test drew also widespread condemnation and prompted the US to push for new, tougher sanctions against Pyongyang at an UN Security Council meeting held on Wednesday. In a hard-hitting address to the UN Security Council, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said Tuesday's ICBM test had made ""the world a more dangerous place,"" and that Washington was ready to use force if need be to deal with the threat of a nuclear-armed Pyongyang.The North's leader Kim Jong-Un described the ICBM launch -- staged on the US Independence Day holiday -- as a gift to ""American bastard"" and vowed to give more ""gift packages"" to the US in the future.The impoverished North is already under onerous international sanctions imposed over its past nuclear and missile tests held in violation of UN resolutions, which ban it from using any ballistic or nuclear technologies.","with nuclear strike us president ,to destroy gangster south korea ,community tuesday after its missile ,nuclear strike us president ,nuclear strike us president donald","['Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'icbm', 'Alaska', 'US', 'US', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - In', 'North Korea', 'National Peace Committee', 'Korea', 'Moon', 'Pyongyang', 'KCNA news agency', 'KCNA', 'US', 'Moon', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'UN Security Council', 'the UN Security Council', 'US', 'Nikki Haley', 'ICBM', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - Un', 'ICBM', 'US', 'american', 'US', 'UN']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68233806  0.39145195

Nimal Siri Vandara, 38, lost his job and source of income, which was a lifeline for his family back home, after rescuing a 90-year-old woman from a fire in Gunwi-gun, North Gyeongsang Province, in February. He suffered burns and smoke inhalation injuries, which require continued medical treatment. He will also have to leave the country at the end of this year, as the incident revealed his illegal status to the immigration authorities. “Even though I got caught, I don’t regret my action. I would do the same if it happened again,” Siri Vandara said during an interview held in a Sri Lankan Buddhist temple in Daegu last week. He spoke both in Korean and Sri Lankan, which was interpreted by Sri Lankan Buddhist monk Wansa. Nimal Siri Vandara On Feb. 10, he was having lunch near an apple orchard where he worked when he heard a woman screaming for help. He ran to the place right away and found a house full of smoke. The woman said her mother-in-law was still inside.“I opened the back gate and went inside. I searched the rooms, found her and brought her outside,” Siri Vandara said between coughs, “I thought we both are going to die.” “I don’t remember much, because I lost consciousness at the end. When I woke up, I was at a hospital.”The possibility of his illegal status being exposed did not occur to him then, he said. “How can I just sit back and watch a person trapped inside the burning house? I could not look away because she reminded me of my mother back home.”Siri Vandara used to be a math teacher in Sri Lanka. To support the medical expenses for his mother, who was suffering from cancer, he came to work in South Korea in July 2013 on a work visa. After his visa expired last July, he had stayed on. As a teacher, he took home about 300,000 won  per month in Sri Lanka. In Korea, he was able to earn about 2 million won per month and remit most of it back home. Recognizing his heroic act, the Ministry of Health and Welfare granted him an award that came with prize money of about 10 million won. He became the first unregistered migrant to win the honor. However, the immigration office slapped him with a 4.8 million won fine for illegal stay. After his story came to light, the office canceled the fine and issued him a six-month visa for medical treatment, which will expire at the end of this year. Despite everything, the Sri Lankan said he is grateful to South Korea. “I didn’t expect it at all. I was very grateful. I am very happy,” he said. His biggest concern now is that he is to be kicked out of the country. As he was caught staying here illegally, he is required to return to Sri Lanka after he recovers. “The only thing I want now is that I stay here and earn money to support my children until they grow up.”By Ock Hyun-ju in Daegu","rescuing stranger from house fire ,year old woman from fire ,vandara 38 lost his job ,stranger from house fire now ,suffering from cancer he came","['Sri Lankan', 'the Korea Herald', 'Nimal Siri Vandara', 'Gunwi', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Siri Vandara', 'Sri Lankan', 'buddhist', 'Daegu', 'korean', 'Sri Lankan', 'Sri Lankan', 'buddhist', 'Wansa', 'Vandara', 'Siri Vandara', 'Vandara', 'Sri Lanka', 'South Korea', 'Sri Lanka', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Sri Lankan', 'South Korea', 'Sri Lanka', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Daegu']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57260787  0.50778002

The bones found have no visible signs of injuries. Investigators look at human remains found at a construction site in Sokcho, Gangwon Province, last week. Given the tree’s age of at least 50 years old, investigators initially thought that the remains could be soldiers who died during the 1950-53 Korean War. But an analysis by the military suggested otherwise. The remains are unlikely to be of the war dead, as they differ in age and gender, and no identification items usually buried with the corpses of military personnel were found.Based on an analysis of jaw bones and dental conditions, those buried are said to be a diverse group, including a young child, a 20-something man and an elderly woman. The police are now looking at the possibility of an old graveyard being unearthed by the construction work, based on testimonies from residents who have lived in the area for over 80 years.But questions linger, as the remains were found too close to one another to assume they were buried separately in a cemetery. There is still the possibility that the remains were relocated from a graveyard for some reason and buried altogether. Local communities suspect that it could be the victims of a tsunami that swept through Sokcho in 1968, leaving 33 dead or missing. Police said they requested the National Forensic Service to carry out a detailed assessment on the remains. By Kim Da-sol","gingko tree thursday by worker ,parking lot the bones found ,sokcho gangwon province last week ,33 dead or missing police ,16 humans found at construction","['Sokcho', 'Gangwon Province', 'Sokcho Police Station', 'Gingko', 'Sokcho', 'Gangwon Province', 'Sokcho', 'the National Forensic Service', 'Kim Da - sol']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46163291  0.52028447

In his first meeting with reporters after being nominated, Song laid out his vision with confidence. Describing the current security challenges as being paradigm-shifting, he pledged to “rebuild” the military by eradicating dubious military contracts.But the path for Song’s appointment is likely to be arduous, one strewn with allegations that critics say contradicts Song’s vision for military overhaul. The controversy is likely to dominate Song’s parliamentary hearing slated for June 28.Former Navy chief Song Young-moo Topping the list of accusations is that Song obstructed the military’s investigation into a dubious procurement contract of naval supplies when he served as the Navy’s top commander in 2007. According to the investigation report obtained by Rep. Kim Hack-yong of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, Song ordered lenient penalties for officers involved in the scandal despite the report suggesting that the contract caused a massive waste of taxes. “Song was trying to shoot down the investigation even after he was briefed about the wrongdoings,” said Kim. “Based on a series of allegations surrounding Song, I don’t think he is fit for South Korea’s defense chief.” Officials close to Song denied the lawmaker’s accusation, saying Song had repeatedly instructed further investigation into the procurement scandal. Song was not immediately available for comments. Another scandal surrounding Song is that he may have had improper ties with the businesses. The accusers cite the large payments he received in return for offering counsel for a law firm dealing with legal process over military contracts. Lawmaker Kim suggested that Song offered “special advice” for Yulchon, a law firm, which helped local shipbuilders sign business deals with overseas military contractors. According to local daily Hankook ilbo, Song received about 990 million won  from the law firm, working as an adviser between 2009 and 2011. “He was not involved with individual cases. What he did was to explain military jargons and backgrounds for the lawyers who lacked the knowledge about defense affairs,” said an aide of Song’s told reporters in a text message.Although Song‘s post-military career in private companies does not clash with laws, opposition lawmakers warn that Song’s initiative for military reform could be undermined by it. “The defense minister is tasked with eradicating acquisition wrongdoings and overhauling defense policy. I’m afraid that there might be serious conflict of interest if Song became defense minister,” Rep. Joo Ho-young of Liberty Korea Party said on Thursday. The allegation surrounding Song’s daughter is another controversial issue. Song was accused of pulling strings to help his daughter land a job at Agency for Defense Development, a state agency for defense technology, when Song served as a naval chief in 2008. After leaving the post, Song also worked as an adviser for ADD.By Yeo Jun-suk","admiral will bring sweeping reforms ,reporters after being nominated song ,song vision for military overhaul ,retired admiral will bring sweeping ,for military overhaul the controversy","['Navy', 'Song Young', 'Song', 'Song ’s', 'Song ’s', 'Navy', 'Song Young - moo', 'Song', 'Navy', 'Kim Hack - yong', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Song', 'song', 'Kim', 'Song', 'South Korea ’s', 'Song', 'Song', 'song', 'Song', 'Lawmaker Kim', 'Song', 'Yulchon', 'Hankook', 'Song', 'Song ’s', 'Song ’s', 'Song', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Song ’s', 'song', 'Agency for Defense Development', 'Song', 'Song', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43060845  0.38084471

President Moon Jae-in  greets members of the new Presidential Committee on Job Creation before the start of its inaugural meeting at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on June 21, 2017. The meeting at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae was preceded by a ceremony marking the appointment of 13 committee members from the private sector.They included Park Yong-maan, chairman of construction equipment giant Doosan Infracore and head of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as top officials from two largest labor umbrella organizations -- the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions.President Moon noted the meeting marked the first of its kind in 18 years to be attended by top representatives of the leading labor organizations and the business lobby at the same time.""I am pro-labor, but I am also pro-management and business-friendly. As you represent all various groups in our society, I wish you would become the center of our social discussions to create practical and realistic policies and reach a consensus,"" he said.The president came into office on May 10 after winning a presidential by-election caused by the ouster of former conservative leader Park Geun-hye over a massive corruption allegation.Moon noted the laborers may have been completely removed from discussions on policies that affect them under the past two conservative governments, but said his government will be different.""Along with business circle, we will respect and treat labor organizations as an important partner,"" he said.The president has promised to create 810,000 new jobs in the public sector alone during his five-year term.He noted there may be many urgent issues that need to be addressed, but said they may take time, possibly up to a year, to be addressed.""Labor, because it has been suppressed under the two former governments, may have a lot to ask.

People’s Party will boldly support Moon when needed: party chief Japan's education ministry earlier announced its education handbook for elementary and middle schools in which it calls for students to be taught that Dokdo is its territory.The move came as a follow-up measure to its revision to education guidelines in which it repeated its claims to the islets. The guidelines and the handbook serve as a standard by which students are taught and textbooks are written.The handbook is aimed at specifying how to teach students and will be used in schools in phases from 2020. It, in particular, calls for students to be taught that Dokdo is part of Japan's territory and South Korea has occupied it illegally.Dokdo, a set of rocky islets lying closer to the Korean Peninsula in the East Sea, has long been a recurring source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since the liberation of the Korean Peninsula from Japan in 1945 and has made clear that Tokyo's claims are utterly groundless.Japan has repeatedly claimed that Dokdo is its own territory, drawing strong condemnation from South Korea.This latest territorial claim is expected to worsen the already frayed diplomatic relations between the neighbors as they have been at odds over a controversial deal reached in 2015 on Japan's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women.Under the deal, both agreed to ""finally and irreversibly"" resolve the so-called comfort women issue. Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.Critics, however, call into question the sincerity of the apology, as Japan refused to recognize its legal responsibility for the forced mobilization of the women. They also criticized the deal for being hastily arranged without sufficiently seeking the opinions of the victims.President Moon Jae-in said in his telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe following his inauguration last month that many South Koreans cannot accept the deal ""emotionally,"" hinting that his government might be in pursuit of changes to it.

President Moon Jae-in has appointed six new Cabinet ministers, including Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, since his inauguration on May 10.He has also tapped 10 other nominees for new ministers, but Ahn Kyong-whan, tapped as the new justice minister, resigned last week following opposition-led attacks over his past wrongdoings that included a fraudulent marriage registration in 1975, which was revoked by a court decision in the following year.Ahn's withdrawal was what virtually triggered the launch of the presidential nomination committee.The president also needs to name two new ministers for commerce and welfare. The Cheong Wa Dae official said the two will likely be named in the near future, noting they will not be subject to a review by the nomination committee as their nomination process is already under way.""We had no choice but to verify nominees for new ministers through only an informal process as we had to verify so many in such a short period of time following the launch of the new government,"" a ranking presidential official told reporters, asking not to be identified. ""Now that things have mostly settled, we will put the nomination committee to work full time.""Still, the launch of the committee may have come a bit too late as the opposition-led parliament has already come to a near halt.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party and two other opposition parties, including the left-leaning People's Party, boycotted all parliamentary sessions Monday, demanding an explanation, if not an apology, from the president himself for his nomination of new ministers, including Ahn, with what they have called decisive defects.The president's appointment of his new foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha over the weekend further fueled the opposition's anger.The opposition parties had strongly opposed Kang's appointment, citing her past wrongdoings that included false registration of address, a crime punishable by law and also one of five corruptive activities the president has named as reasons to keep a person from any significant government job.","staff tuesday move prompted by ,six new cabinet ministers including ,staff tuesday move prompted ,of staff tuesday move prompted ,new government ranking presidential official","['Cheong', 'Dae', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Cabinet', 'Lee Nak - yon', 'Ahn Kyong - whan', 'Ahn', 'Liberty Korea Party', ""People 's Party"", 'Ahn', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Kang']",17,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.42065465  0.41595963

Wearing her inmate number, 503, on her left chest and handcuffs, the former president is escorted by two prison guards into the courthouse in southern Seoul. Inside the courtroom, Park quietly walks toward the dock and sits beside her attorney. As she does so, some people in the audience stand up in an apparent show of respect, despite security guards’ gestures not to. This much-repeated scene no longer creates a media frenzy, as the former president’s trial enters its fifth week. But many citizens still apply for the roughly 60 audience seats that are distributed to applicants by lottery. Many of them are curious to see Park, once a symbol of conservative power, in the flesh.Park Geun-hye is escorted into the Seoul Southern District Court for a hearing Monday. In court, Park’s demeanor is aloof, at times distracted, and emotionless. She remains silent and rarely reacts to whatever is being said about her, sparking public curiosity about her defense strategy and mental state. During the third hearing that took place on May 30, Park fell asleep near the end of the session that lasted almost 12 hours. She looked tired  and spiritless throughout the day.At that time, witness questioning was underway on Park’s role in the alleged money-for-favors deal with Samsung Group. The alleged bribery scheme is Park’s most damning allegation among the 18 criminal charges raised against her by the prosecution. If convicted, she could get life imprisonment.It was only at the end of the hearing that Park finally uttered a few words. Asked by the judge whether she wanted to question the witness by herself, Park replied, “No I don’t.”In another court hearing earlier this month, Park was seen repeatedly drawing on scraps of paper with a pencil -- and erasing them.Park, who sat in the dock, began to draw “unrecognizable” subjects on pieces of paper during the proceeding, as reported by local media outlets. She then rubbed the sketches out with an eraser and brushed off the shavings.This continued for around 20 minutes, observers said.Park Geun-hye is escorted into the Seoul Southern District Court for a hearing Monday. “Park’s behavior apparently indicates that she suffered from a loss of concentration in a series of hearings,” Lee Soo-jung, a criminal psychology professor at Kyonggi University, told The Korea Herald. “Another possibility is she failed to -- or chose not to -- see the gravity of the situation, with little concern about the outcome of the criminal trial. In that case, she might have ruled out any possibility of being convicted of her charges,” Lee added. Upon indictment, Park pleaded not guilty to the 18 charges, but prosecutors believe she colluded with her longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, to pressure companies, including Samsung, to donate money to foundations she established.Most recently, Park burst out laughing when her defense attorney Yoo Young-ha exchanged fierce words with Yoo Jin-ryong, a former Culture Minister under the Park administration who was put on the witness stand last week. The former cabinet minister is one of a few who exposed a blacklist of thousands of artists who were deemed unfriendly to Park and were excluded from government support programs. “She clearly has no clue what’s going on around her.” said Kim Tae-hyung, psychologist and author of “Psychology in Choosing a President.”“Apart from a loss of concentration during hearings, Park seems to be putting herself in third-party position and take no role in the court, leaving everything to her attorneys. That’s a common example seen among people who are psychologically traumatized,” Kim added.Starting from last week, the Seoul Central District Court began to increase its examination of the bribery allegations involving Samsung, SK and Lotte Group, holding four hearings per week. “Four days a week of hearings is too much of a burden for the accused, considering her physical condition,” said Park’s attorney Lee Sang-chul, describing Park as “an old, weak woman.” “She has to live a sedentary lifestyle at a detention center, where she suffers aches in her legs and back,” Lee said. The court dismissed the claim, saying a tight schedule is “inevitable” since the case involves “a great volume of witness records and a number of witnesses to question.” Park faces a total of 18 charges, with related court documents running to some 120,000 pages.Critics saw Park's complaint as a “tactic” to delay the court’s decision after the expiration of her detention period.“The defendant’s health condition is not an issue to be taken into account seriously by the justice when scheduling proceedings,” said Nam Kyoung-kook, a law professor at the University of Seoul Law School. “Unless in a serious health condition acknowledged in the form of doctor’s note, Park should not delay the proceedings,” Nam added. Park’s verdict is expected to come mid-October. Park could get life imprisonment if convicted.By Bak Se-hwan","prison guards into the courthouse ,companies including samsung to donate ,courthouse in southern seoul inside ,lotte group holding four hearings ,detention center escort van wearing","['Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Samsung Group', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Soo - jung', 'Kyonggi University', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Samsung', 'Park', 'Yoo Young', 'Yoo Jin - ryong', 'Culture', 'Park', 'Kim Tae - hyung', 'Park', 'Kim', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung', 'Lotte Group', 'Park ’s', 'Lee Sang - chul', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Nam Kyoung - kook', 'the University of Seoul Law School', 'Park', 'Nam', 'Park ’s', 'Bak Se - hwan']",9,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03006459 0.1388023  0.31537303]

But to the ire of his family and many US citizens, he was found to be in a coma and to have been in that state for some 15 months, triggering heated criticism over Pyongyang’s assumed mistreatment of the detainee.“He  has spontaneous eye opening and blinking,” said Daniel Kanter, director of neurocritical care at the University of Cincinnati Health System, according to AP. “However, he shows no signs of understanding language, responding to verbal commands or awareness of his surroundings. He has not spoken.”Pyongyang reportedly told US officials that Warmbier contracted botulism and went into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. However, the family was skeptical over this claim. AP also said that “doctors treating him in the US said they found no evidence of botulism, but did find severe brain damage consistent with losing oxygen to the brain.”In a sign of consolation, President Donald Trump made a phone call to the student’s father. Fred Warmbier said at a news conference Thursday that Trump had said he was “sorry” and criticized his predecessor Barack Obama for his failure to obtain Otto Warmbier’s release earlier. Fred Warmbier had called the conversation “gracious” and “very candid.”Otto Warmbier’s return has lent support to voices calling for a travel ban on North Korea, which has a long record of holding US nationals to use them as a bargaining chip. In Congress, a bipartisan bill was proposed in May by Republican Rep. Joe Wilson and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, which calls for Americans to be barred from touring the oppressive country and requiring them to obtain special permission for other types of visits. “Tourist travel to North Korea does nothing but provide funds to a tyrannical regime -- that will in turn be used to develop weapons to threaten the United States and our allies,” Wilson said in a statement.“We have been evaluating whether we should put some type of travel visa restriction to North Korea,” US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. “We have not come to a final conclusion, but we are considering it.”US media reports reflected public outrage and sentiment toward the North. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday argued for the ban, saying about 5,000 Western tourists take risks to go there each year and highlighting “dangers amplified by heightened tension” between Washington and Pyongyang. “Tourism is one of the most visible ways in which North Korea retains ties to the outside world despite wide-ranging sanctions,” it said. The Washington Post also condemned the North for its “horrendous mistreatment” of Warmbier and urged the US to step up sanctions on the Kim Jong-un regime. “He was arrested, tried on spurious charges and evidently subjected to horrendous mistreatment by the North Korean authorities,” an editorial said Wednesday.“This was outrageous behavior even by the standards of one of the world’s most vicious and isolated regimes. It should not go unpunished.”By Jung Min-kyung","damage his doctors said thursday ,severe brain damage his doctors ,barack obama for his failure ,news conference thursday that trump ,tuesday after being jailed","['american', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Otto warmbier Otto Warmbier', 'Ohio', 'Joseph Yun', 'North Korea', 'the US State Department', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'Daniel Kanter', 'the University of Cincinnati Health System', 'AP', 'US', 'Warmbier', 'AP', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Fred Warmbier', 'Trump', 'Barack Obama', 'Otto Warmbier ’s', 'Fred Warmbier', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Congress', 'republican', 'Joe Wilson', 'Democratic', 'Adam Schiff', 'Americans', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'Wilson', 'North Korea', 'US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'the House Foreign Affairs Committee', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the Washington Post', 'Warmbier', 'US', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Jung Min - kyung']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01159317  0.36514717

Thursday marks the anniversary of a watershed summit and joint declaration of then-President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2000.The event sowed the seed of cross-border rapprochement through humanitarian and economic cooperation such as reunions of families separated by the Korean War. In 2007, Roh Moo-hyun held a summit and issued a more comprehensive Oct. 4 peace declaration with the late strongman, inheriting the spirit of the 2000 event and his predecessor’s Sunshine policy calling for engagement with the isolated, poverty-stricken neighbor.In following through on the declaration, separate committees were set up in the two Koreas. They hosted back-to-back celebratory events in Seoul and Pyongyang between 2003 and 2008, inviting high-ranking government officials as guests and both countries’ artists as performers. The annual festivals, however, hit a snag under the two successive conservative administrations here, led by Lee Myung-bak and then Park Geun-hye. In the wake of a series of nuclear and missile tests, and the North’s 2010 attacks on a South Korean corvette and border island, inter-Korean exchanges grew increasingly scarce and then virtually ground to a halt. Following a near 10-year letup, the inauguration of President Moon Jae-in -- a close friend and top staffer to Roh -- appeared to cast a bright light over the June 15 project, humanitarian events and the protracted impasse in the relationship. On June 1, the Unification Ministry gave the green light to the South Korean committee’s request to reach out to its North Korean counterpart for this year’s joint celebration. It has also approved a multitude of civic groups’ plans to provide humanitarian aid and resume religious exchanges. But it was Pyongyang that gave the cold shoulder to the upbeat mood. The June 15 committee failed to secure a response from the North and decided to hold the event on its own in Seoul. The regime also rejected the aid offer, with an official demanding in an interview with AFP in Pyongyang that Seoul first return home 13 defectors before any humanitarian program restarts. One day ahead of the anniversary, the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea responsible for cross-border relations urged Seoul to take steps to defuse military tension before seeking a reconciliation. The committee also slammed the Moon administration’s pledge to pursue sanctions and engagement as a “foolish, disgraceful act” and “clear self-deception.”“If South Korea truly desires peace they should not recklessly take issue with our self-defensive nuclear power, which is the firmest and most realistic guarantee for peace on the peninsula, but take measures to shut out the US’ aggressive, hostile blind act,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. Experts say that in pursuing a thaw, the Moon leadership, too, should take into account not only souring public sentiment toward the unruly neighbor at home but also changes within the North especially since the death of Kim Jong-il and succession of Kim Jong-un in 2011. “North Korea is not as willing to recover the inter-Korean relationship as it did in 2000 since it’s leaning toward paving its own path with the development of nuclear weapons and missiles,” Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies told The Korea Herald. While the South Korean June 15 committee is likely to be given another chance to reinitiate the joint ceremony next year, it would be difficult to receive a positive response from the North, he predicted. “It is important to reconnect a cross-border hotline and win the approval of South Korean citizens before carrying out future joint projects,” the professor said. Dong Yong-seung, a senior analyst at Good Farmers, a non-governmental organization working to boost agriculture in the North, pointed to the economic improvements there in recent years for which the young ruler is taking credit. “North Korea has undergone a lot of changes . … Many of its citizens take pride as a member of a nuclear weapons state and are willing to trade some level of economic inconvenience for it,” Dong said at a symposium hosted by the Peace Foundation in Seoul on Tuesday. “North Korea is a de facto nuclear state, but it maintains a defensive stance against the South which is apparently intended to seek a peaceful co-existence between the two Koreas and build the foundation to maintain the current system.” Despite the current strains, Seoul officials retain cautious optimism for future relations with Pyongyang. Unification Minister nominee Cho Myoung-gyun, who was a top secretary to Roh and played a key role in the 2007 summit, on Tuesday called for a restart of the inter-Korean Kaesong industrial complex shut down last year in punishment for the North’s nuclear and missile test. He also did not out the possibility of a summit between Moon and Kim, calling it “one of the issues to pursue if necessary in working out inter-Korean relations.”Though the joint celebration failed to materialize, the Moon administration appears keen to give its blessing to the June 15 event in Seoul by dispatching Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung who is scheduled to deliver a congratulatory message. At a separate seminar on Wednesday, Chun said the nascent government will forge a fresh initiative building on the two landmark declarations. “The new administration plans to solve North Korea‘s nuclear issues and map out a new vision for peace of the peninsula and shared prosperity based on the spirit of the June 15 Joint Declaration and Oct. 4 Declaration,” Chun said at a seminar hosted by Rep. Kim Han-jung of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea. “Under this difficult situation facing the peninsula, we need to revive the spirit of inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation which the June 15 declaration symbolizes, and overcome the reality where the implementation of inter-Korean agreements were stalled and North Korea policy becomes a source of political conflicts according to government changes.”By Jung Min-kyung","tuesday north korea is de ,friendship events far fetched thursday ,foundation in seoul on tuesday ,korean war in 2007 roh ,the 2007 summit on tuesday","['inter - korean', 'North ’s', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Sunshine', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun - hye', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh', 'the Unification Ministry', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'AFP', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'the North ’s Committee', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Moon', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Lee Woo - young', 'the University of North Korean Studies', 'the Korea Herald', 'south korean', 'Dong Yong - seung', 'Good Farmers', 'North Korea', 'Dong', 'the Peace Foundation', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Cho Myoung - gyun', 'Roh', 'inter - korean Kaesong', 'North ’s', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'inter - korean', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Chun Hae - sung', 'Chun', 'North Korea‘s', 'Chun', 'Kim Han - jung', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Jung Min - kyung']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.39318976  0.53599924

The choice was seen as a reflection of Moon’s determination to overhaul the powerful law enforcement body, which has been criticized for holding too much power with its exclusive rights to indict. But the former head of the nation’s human rights watchdog has come under fire for his “sexist perception of women,” which some say could dim his chances of taking the minister’s job.Justice Minister nominee Ahn Kyong-whan speaks to reporters at a temporary office in Seoul on Wednesday. In the book titled “What is a Man,” Ahn, 69, described women as “a necessary companion to alcohol-fueled gatherings.” “There should be women at alcohol-fueled gatherings. If none, there should be at least mothers-in-law around you,” he said. Ahn also appeared to justify men’s purchasing of sex, saying “Wives, like all other Korean mothers, have no interest in taking care of their husbands in bed as they are immersed in children’s education.”“There is a saying that young women cannot be beggars unless they are mentally ill. Rather than begging for money, they can live with pride as prostitutes. There are countless men who attempt to pay for sex with women,” he said. “There is a long history of trading human bodies. A young woman’s body is a source of life. It is any man’s wish to be reborn by putting oneself in spring water.”In a column in 2004 for local daily DongA Ilbo, he also wrote, “The love story between man and woman evolves in different situations, but the essence is always the same. In other words, men are potential rapists and women are prostitutes.”The book also included what appears to be his misogynic views about women.“Korean women want everything. Some women say they want a funny guy, but they also want a luxury brand bag. It is pitiful and sad for Korean men,” he wrote.Ahn served as the chairman of the country’s state human rights watchdog from 2006 to 2009. He later stepped down, lambasting then-conservative President Lee Myung-bak’s policy on human rights. In 2003, he headed a policy advisory committee for the Justice Ministry. Since 2013, he has served as an emeritus professor of law at Seoul National University.In another column run by local paper Gwangju Ilbo in July 2014, he also confessed that he had had ethical lapses, which could further tarnish his reputation. “I was lucky enough that I was not caught, but I drank and drove on several occasions. If asked at  confirmation hearing, how should I answer?” he said in the column titled “truth and falsity of  confirmation hearing.” He said “he doesn’t know” whether he would have been appointed as head of the National Human Rights Commission in 2006 if he had to go through a formal confirmation hearing.“I have neither avoided the mandatory military service nor registered a false home address, but I may not have paid enough taxes when buying real estate. It is not right even though it was an ordinary practice,” he said. In a book published in 2000, he also made remarks about his son’s dual citizenship. He wrote to his son, “You will be forced to serve South Korea as your home country, but you have another country of yours -- the US.” Dual citizenships of high-ranking officials’ children here have been subject to much criticism as in the case of Foreign Minister nominee Kang Kung-wha who is being attacked for her daughter’s dual citizenship. There is strong public sentiment against children of high-profile figures having dual citizenships, especially sons, amid criticism that the system could be exploited to prevent them from serving the two-year mandatory military service in Korea.“I will leave the judgement to readers,” Ahn told reporters while entering his makeshift office in central Seoul on Wednesday morning. “I will give a detailed explanation during the confirmation hearing.”Opposition parties, even the minor progressive Justice Party which has so far supported Moon’s personnel choices, have strongly condemned the nominee, asking the president to withdraw his choice.By Ock Hyun-ju","down lambasting then conservative president ,misogynic views about women korean ,under fire for his sexist ,his misogynic views about women ,sad for korean men he","['Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Kyong - whan', 'Moon ’s', 'Ahn Kyong', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'DongA Ilbo', 'korean', 'Ahn', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Seoul National University', 'Gwangju Ilbo', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Kang Kung - wha', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Justice Party', 'Moon ’s', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,[1.         0.         1.         ... 0.04423387 0.65417981 0.08152337]

The Vietnamese foreign ministry voiced its displeasure with the president's comments, calling for the Seoul government on Friday to refrain from making comments that could hurt the feelings of its people.""We cherish our relations with Vietnam very much,"" foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a regular press briefing.""Since 1992 when the two established diplomatic ties, we have continued to work to advance the relations with a shared belief that we should set aside the past and look forward.... We will keep working to advance friendly ties going forward,"" he added.Cho noted that Moon's comment related to the Vietnam War was intended to remind of the need to provide ""appropriate"" support for those who sacrificed their lives at the order of the country. South Korea, which fought against Vietnamese communists during the 1960-1975 Vietnam War, is accused of killing many innocent civilians in Vietnam while carrying out operations during the war. About 5,000 South Korean soldiers died in the war.It remains a sensitive issue for the two countries despite their expanded exchanges in diverse areas for the past 25 years since they built diplomatic ties.","korea foreign ministry said tuesday ,vietnam war in his speech ,speech on june marking memorial ,korean soldiers during the vietnam ,economy here south korean president","[""South Korea 's"", 'Vietnam', ""Moon Jae - in 's"", 'Moon', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in`s', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'vietnamese', 'Nguyen Xuan Phuc', 'Hanoi', 'vietnamese', 'Seoul', 'Vietnam', 'Cho June - hyuck', 'Cho', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'vietnamese', 'Vietnam', 'south korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.50937855  0.66737032

It was his first public message since being tapped as the nation’s education chief and deputy prime minister for social affairs.Education Minister nominee Kim Sang-gon Once hailed as a “reformer of education,” the 68-year-old progressive former school superintendent of Gyeonggi Province is expected to implement reform measures aimed at ensuring fair education opportunities for all, in particular changes related to Suneung, a standardized test much like the American SAT, and prestigious schools like foreign language high schools. As a school superintendent from 2009 to 2014, Kim pushed forward educational reform policies including a free school meals policy.The policy, carried out in schools across the country, has been criticized by politicians for benefiting students from well-to-do families. They argued that resources could have been used instead to help more low-income students.At his upcoming parliamentary confirmation hearing, Kim is also expected to be questioned extensively on an allegation that he plagiarized his doctoral dissertation published in 1992, which the presidential office claimed had already been “examined closely with a high standard.” Kim was among five new ministers named Sunday by President Moon Jae-in, along with Ahn Kyong-whan for justice minister and Song Young-moo for defense minister.

Starting from this year, 1,500 new firefighters will be recruited to address a chronic shortage of manpower in the field, said Moon.  President Moon Jae-in listens as a female firefighter speaks during a visit to Yonsan Fire Station in central Seoul on Wednesday. “Firefighters play a key role to ensure the safety of people, but have been given an insufficient supply of equipment and manpower, and  poor working conditions,” Moon said to firefighters and officials at the station. Moon said his administration will also strengthen medical support to handle firefighters’ long-neglected work-related injuries and symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and establish an independent agency for the national and provincial fire service for greater autonomy.The plans include the reorganization of the government agencies and require parliamentary approval. The new administration is also seeking to change the status of firemen as state employees, most of whom are currently hired by cash-short cities and provinces.

Haunted by memories of her three starved children and old mother living in Hyesan in the country’s far north Ryanggang Province, the 44-year-old defector eagerly handed over 20 million won  to a broker -- only to find out a month later not a single penny had reached her family. “It was all of my savings,” said Park, who arrived here several years ago and agreed to speak to The Korea Herald on condition her full name not be published.“I had spent months to find this guy, but to no avail. It is just outrageous to think that other defectors like me would easily fall prey to this kind of fraud, getting their savings wiped out.”  Two North Korean defectors have managed to send money to their elder sister and relatives in the North for the past decade talk about challenges in an exclusive interview with The Korea Herald correspondent Bak Se-hwan . In line with an influx of North Koreans here, the tally of their remittances is expected to rise. As of March 2017, a total of 30,490 from North Korea have resettled in the South, according to the Ministry of Unification. No official data on their remittances is available, however, given a government ban on South Koreans wiring money to the North. The brokers sneak the funds in through acquaintances, which is also illegal in China. According to a 2016 survey from the Seoul-based Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, around 58.5 percent of 400 surveyed defectors in the South have sent money home. Twenty-six percent said they did so last year, with the average remittance being about 2.35 million won. In a poll released by local daily Chosun Ilbo in January 2016, 140 of 200 defectors said they regularly transferred money to their families in the North via China-based agents. Almost 63 percent said they send 1-2 million won a year, while a few respondents put the sum at over 10 million won. The annual average stood at about 1.64 million won. Most defectors are not high-income earners, with their average monthly wages hovering around 1.5 million won. But like Park, many defectors arrive here with little knowledge of finance and the clandestine transaction process, and so fall victim to fraud. “I didn’t have much money as it was only three months after I first landed a job as a factory worker, so my boss lent me 3 million won to fund my elder brother’s wedding in the North,” said Cho, another defector. “I was contacted by a female money broker, and we agreed on a 15 percent commission. But after three months, I learned from my family that the broker took much more without a single word about it, leaving them only with 600,000 won.”  Cho, 30, had to work several jobs to clear her debt -- at a factory by day and at a karaoke bar at night. “I was so angry at that time, but had no other option other than to suppress my anger and move on,” she said.  According to a defector-turned-money broker in Seoul who said he goes by Kim Tae-soo, the transfer process is multilayered, yet not as difficult as it may appear, and so does not justify the amounts brokers often take. Brokers here would usually wire money to middlemen in China, most of whom are smugglers or tradesmen with ties to the North. Then the middlemen call their contacts in the North to notify them of the amount of money to deliver out of the pockets of their North Korean counterparts while carrying out other trade deals of their own. The commission fee is between 20 percent and 30 percent in general, Kim said.   “The money doesn’t go directly to the North. It’s channeled through a series of operators, routed through China,” Kim said in an interview. “It is trimmed by communication fees and commissions of course, but it’s all up to us to decide how much to charge for our share.” A common technique is to offer the defectors what sounds like a low commission rate initially and extort up to 80 percent of the original amount for “unexpected circumstances while delivering,” or without any explanation at all. “These defectors are used to doing whatever they are told to do, and they will believe what they are told to believe. They have to learn everything from the start. It’s not like the friendly society they first thought it would be,” he added.   With a growing number of new arrivals falling prey to such scams, the Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs and defector support, has expanded related education and set up a 24-hour hotline manned by officials at the Hanawon resettlement center. Most defectors are mandated to undertake a three-month training period there as soon as they admitted to South Korea.  “We acknowledge that some North Korean defectors send money back home to support their families’ living costs,” a ministry official said. “But we have difficulties in estimating the scope and scale  because the practices are carried out so secretly.”For Seoul, the remittances pose a dilemma due chiefly to the transaction ban and sour public sentiment toward Pyongyang amid its nuclear weapons development and missile provocations. The money could help keep North Koreans afloat and expose them to the capitalist, better-heeled South. But it would be virtually impossible to set up a mechanism with which to monitor all financial transactions and sort out the ones that may fatten leader Kim Jong-un’s coffers or be siphoned off for military purposes. The UN Security Council has been seeking to tighten sanctions to squeeze the regime’s hard currency earnings. The US State Department assessed in a July 2015 report that South Korean defectors funneled at least $10 million into the North through the illicit Chinese networks in 2014 alone. It designated North Korea a “primary money laundering concern“ in June 2016.  “The money sent to North Korean people will gradually bring about changes to the isolated regime,” the broker Kim said. “There should be some protective measures for the defectors to ensure their money lands on the other side safe.”An Chan-il, head of the World Institute for North Korea Studies in Seoul and who crossed the border in 1979, once proposed a Korean-style “freikauf” model, the money-for-prisoner scheme used by the former West Germany. The Democratic Party of Korea, formerly chaired by President Moon Jae-in, introduced a related vision as part of its campaign pledge in the run-up to the parliamentary election in April 2016. But not since then has it brought up the issue for public debate in the face of Pyongyang’s unabated provocations and a protracted freeze in cross-border relations. Despite political difficulties, Seoul needs to consider institutional support, An said, stressing the remittances may serve as impetus to shift the mindset of people and eventually the reclusive society. For ordinary citizens of the North, $1,000 is sufficient to cover their living expenses for an entire year, he noted. “The defectors currently have to take all the responsibility for any of their losses that may occur in helping their families in the North. The government should craft measures to encourage the practice and hedge risks such as through an insurance scheme,” An said. “The remittance sparks admiration among their left-behind families toward the South and helps plant the market economy there. Together with civilian exchanges, it could play a key role in ushering in an era of reconciliation.” Not all defectors struggle to find trustful middlemen.Unlike many others, a 42-year-old defector who gave Kim Hye-sook as her name, has managed to send money to her elder sister and relatives who remain in the North for the past decade. She was lucky enough to find someone in the transfer business who was a friend of a fellow defector. Although the commission fees are relatively high -- around 30 percent of the amount entrusted -- Kim’s money has always landed safely in the hands of her family. “Looking at kids here, I cannot help but think of my nephews . I wish they could live a decent life as they do here. I myself live on a tight budget with my husband, as I’m sick and can’t work. Nevertheless, I can’t stop sending money back home because I know exactly how they live in North Korea -- it breaks my heart now just thinking of it,” Kim said during an interview at her home in Gyeonggi Province. “Sometimes, several faces of my friends come across my mind. I always wonder if the two Koreas will ever be reunited so that I can see them again.”But would she believe the money transfers for the 10 years and counting help toward realizing a reunification? “Definitely,” she said, with a faint smile.

153,153,[News Focus] Moon has more targets in military, 　Former Cheong Wa Dae chief security officer Kim Kwan-jin and incumbent Defense Minister Han Min-koo -- a once powerful pair in South Korea's military hierarcy -- are under investigation for not relaying highly sensitive information to the new administration. But the issue is only the beginning of trouble for the country’s military brass. 　President Moon looks set to push ahead with his ideas to reform the m...,"Former Cheong Wa Dae chief security officer Kim Kwan-jin and incumbent Defense Minister Han Min-koo -- a once powerful pair in South Korea's military hierarcy -- are under investigation for not relaying highly sensitive information to the new administration. But the issue is only the beginning of trouble for the country’s military brass. President Moon looks set to push ahead with his ideas to reform the military and eradicate corruption -- in particular the dubious connections between the military procurement agency and arms vendors.  “We have to use  as an opportunity to root out irregularities in military acquisition deals that have brought enormous disappointment to the people,” said Rep. Kim Young-ho of Moon’s governing Democratic Party who is a member of the parliamentary defense committee. Former security chief Kim Kwan-jin and President Moon Jae-in. YonhapTopping the list of “irregularities” would be the previous Park Geun-hye administration’s controversial decision to purchase 40 F-35 stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, as part of the country’s next-generation fighters procurement project. Despite the fact that Boeing’s F-15 Silent Eagle had been initially selected as a sole candidate for the project, then Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin, who held the final say over the procedure as a chairman of defense acquisition council, ordered a review of the biding process and selected F-35 in the end.Since April, the nation’s Board of Audit and Inspection has been looking into allegations that Lockheed Martin failed to fulfill its agreement, part of the 7.3 trillion won F-35 deal, to transfer technology to South Korea so that it can build its indigenous aircrafts.Another issue could be the collusion scandal surrounding Korea Aerospace Industries, South Korea’s sole aircraft manufacturer, which produces indigenous air fighters, including supersonic aircraft T-50.In 2015, KAI was accused for creating a slush fund worth of 5.2 billion won  and bribing military and political figures with gift vouchers. About one-third of the fund was allegedly used for lobbying efforts. KAI has denied the allegation.Since taking office, President Moon has made eradicating corruption in military on his top priority, describing it as a “deep-rooted evil” that has plagued the country’s national security and readiness posture. “We will never tolerate irregularities over defense acquisitions,” Lee Soo-hun, a member of Moon’s de facto transition team, said on May 25 after receiving a report from the Defense Acquisition and Procurement Agency.“The issue is so import that we decided to have a  briefing session…Over the past years, the military has found itself in the hot seat from a series of procurement scandals. Now is the time to find ways to fix past wrongdoings and ensure military discipline.”Defense Minister Han Min-koo  and Kim Kwang-jin , former President Park Geun-hye’s chief security adviser, is seen with President Moon Jae-in . YonhapThe Moon administration is not the first government that sought to overhaul the scandal-ridden military procurement process, mostly dominated by a revolving door of the defense ministry, acquisition agency and military contractors. In 2014, former President Park ordered a massive probe into dubious military contracts following public outrage over Navy salvage ship ”Tongyeong,“ which failed to participate in the rescue mission of the sunken Sewol ferry due to a malfunction.But the malfunction turned out to be a result of the collusion between the Defense Acquisition and Procurement Agency and former Navy captain, who received 400 million won in kickbacks to introduce a local supplier to DAPA official in charge of acquiring the ship.  The investigation team revealed that collusive practices were pervasive in various procurement contracts, ranging from the purchase of basic gadgets like body armor and rifles to high-tech ones such as submarines and helicopters.  Most of the corruption in procurement took place when each military branch raised its requirement to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which determine whether to approve the request and have DAPA carry out procurement, said defense officials. ”Every service chief has been so obsessed with their legacy. They tend to think of how many contracts were signed during their tenure as a measure to gauge their performance,“ an Air Force officer who worked for DAPA until last year said under the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. The majority of unlawful deals are made when the military signs a contract with domestic contractors, who supply the military with maintenance and upgrade components, not the foreign contractors such as the US government, who provide the whole weapon system under the restricted rule.According to the Park administration‘s 2014 investigation on the collusion in military procurement, the Navy topped the list for engaging in wrongdoings, with a total amount of illegal projects amounting to 840 billion won . The reason is, acquisition officials and experts said, that the Navy’s procurement was mostly about purchasing components from domestic suppliers for maintaining and outfitting the warships, which suffered from frequent malfunctions during the operation. President Moon vowed to impose harsh punishment on those involved with procurement irregularities. On the campaign trail, Moon said that corrupted officials will face punishment equivalent to a treason charge and contractors would be permanently barred from bidding processes if they are found guilty of wrongdoings.Lockheed Martin`s F-35 stealth fighter. Yonhap”If anyone were found to have engaged in acquisition collusion, they would face severe punishment equivalent to the punishment on treason,“ Moon said in April when he was a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party of Korea, which last year sought to enact a bill including a similar idea to Moon’s.  The president also vowed to enhance civilian oversight over the procurement process by granting more authority to economic branches and outside entities and encouraging more civilian participation in the government-led, procurement decision-making body. DAPA would be transformed into a body with more transparency and expertise. Created in 2006, the agency has been under scrutiny for a lack of military expertise, civilian oversight and collusion from revolving doors between its officials and contractors with a DAPA background. But too much control would lead to excessive regulation on the defense industry, one of the most lucrative export businesses for South Korea, analysts noted, warning against the possibility that the overhaul movement would be reduced to political bickering.For example, former President Park’s extensive investigation was criticized as a stunt to dive the people away from the Sewol tragedy as most of prosecuted high-profile generals were found innocent including former Navy chief Hwang Ki-chul, who is now on the list for the next defense minister or DAPA chief. “Procurement scandal is the result of a break-up in the cartel created decades ago between the government and defense industry,” said Yang Uk, senior research fellow at the Korea Security and Defense Forum. “To some extent, it was somewhat inevitable, taking place because of the change of the economy.” “Therefore, the issue should be seen from a broader perspective. We have to view it as a part of the effort to overhaul the military policy as a whole. Otherwise, investigation into the scandal could be subject to a political witch hunt.”By Yeo Jun-suk","former president park extensive investigation ,military contracts following public outrage ,collusion scandal surrounding korea aerospace ,scandal ridden military procurement process ,overhaul the scandal ridden military","['Cheong', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', ""South Korea 's"", 'Moon', 'Kim Young - ho', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lockheed Martin', 'Boeing', 'Defense', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Board of Audit and Inspection', 'Lockheed Martin', 'South Korea', 'Korea Aerospace Industries', 'South Korea ’s', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'Moon', 'Lee Soo - hun', 'Moon ’s de', 'the Defense Acquisition and Procurement Agency', 'Han Min - koo', 'Kim Kwang - jin', 'Park Geun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'YonhapThe Moon', 'Navy', 'the Defense Acquisition and Procurement Agency', 'Navy', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Air Force', 'DAPA', 'US', 'Park', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Lockheed', 'Yonhap”If', 'Moon', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'Moon ’s', 'South Korea', 'Navy', 'Hwang Ki - chul', 'dapa', 'Yang Uk', 'the Korea Security', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.31621897  0.19297445

The hearings for the two minister-nominees will be held Wednesday, while the hearing for the chief justice-nominee will last two days from Wednesday, according to National Assembly officials.The new Cabinet members -- Kim and Kang -- do not require parliament's approval for their appointment. The chief justice nominee does.No need to win parliament's approval, however, does not mean their hearings will just take their course, as strong opposition from political parties during a hearing may still lead to the withdrawal of their nomination.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party and many others are already urging President Moon Jae-in to do just that, at least for some of his nominees.Kang, for instance, has already been declared unfit for the top office at the foreign ministry for what the opposition parties call a wide range of irregularities that include false registration of address, suspected to have been done for real estate speculation.The chief justice-nominee too stands opposed by the opposition parties, including the left-leaning People's Party, which earlier helped pave the way for the appointment of Moon's new prime minister, Lee Nak-yon.Kim, the chief justice-nominee, is accused of handing down rulings favorable to the government's military crackdown on the 1980 democratic movement in Gwangju, a city located some 300 kilometers southwest of Seoul, that left hundreds of people killed.The three confirmation hearings come as a second round of battle between the ruling and opposition parties following their first clash in hearings for the prime minister and new heads of the Fair Trade Commission and the National Intelligence Service, the spy agency.Prime Minister Lee and new NIS chief Suh Hoon were appointed last week.The rival parties have so far failed to publish a joint report on the outcome of the hearing for the new FTC chief Kim Sang-jo.The main opposition party is threatening to boycott all future parliamentary sessions should the ruling party and other minor opposition parties endorse the new FTC chief-nominee without its blessing.A senior official from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said the presidential official will first wait and see the outcome of discussions over Kim's appointment, but insisted it should be quickly endorsed.""I believe FTC chief-nominee Kim has thoroughly explained his allegations to an extent that most people can now understand,"" the Cheong Wa Dae official said, asking not to be identified.The official noted Kim's appointment did not require parliamentary approval, but said, ""We will wait until the parliament completes its due process out of respect for the National Assembly.""The president earlier said he will eventually have to replace all 19 cabinet members, including the prime minister, as the incumbent ministers were appointed under the former conservative government.Moon has so far named six new ministers, including the finance and foreign minister nominees set to undergo parliamentary hearings this week. The four others are lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party. Schedules for their confirmation hearings have yet to be set.The president needs to replace 12 other ministers and name dozens of other top government officials before what can be considered a true Moon Jae-in administration can set sail.Moon came into office on March 10, only one day after the country held a rare presidential by-election caused by the ouster of former leader Park Geun-hye.","sunday the three confirmation hearings ,killed the three confirmation hearings ,nominees will be held wednesday ,undergo parliamentary hearings this week ,held wednesday while the hearing","['Finance', 'Kim Dong - yeon', 'Kang Kyong - hwa', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Kim Yi - su', 'National Assembly', 'Cabinet', 'Kim', 'Kang', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kang', ""People 's Party"", 'Moon', 'Lee Nak - yon', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Lee', 'NIS', 'Suh Hoon', 'FTC', 'Kim Sang - jo', 'FTC', 'Kim', 'FTC', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Park Geun - hye']",17,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.2262595   0.21090217

Material evidence, such as semen samples from victims, hair and cigarette butts, were collected, but all failed to pinpoint the identity of the killer. It is now legally impossible to bring the uncaught killer to justice since the statute of limitations has already passed on the case. According to Kwon, a case turns cold either because it was investigated during a time when the nation lacked profiling skills or the investigation process is prolonged to prevent wrongful conviction.  Police authorities investigating the crime scene of the Hwaseong serial killings in Gyeonggi Province.“Cases like the Hwaseong serial killings went cold because of dated forensic technology,” said Kwon. The late 1980s and early 1990s were when a sharp shift in crime motivations occurred, as fast changes in society and the economy left behind people at the margins of society, but the authorities failed to adapt to the times, he noted. More than a decade after the Hwaseong case, renowned director Bong Joon-ho made a film loosely based on the sequence of events. “Memories of Murder”  attracted 5.3 million moviegoers nationwide and added more notoriety to the controversial case.Recent hit South Korean dramas, such as tvN’s “Signal” and OCN’s “Tunnel,” have also brought back nauseating memories from the time when the nation was shocked with horrendous questions that remain unanswered to this day. Both have time traveling as their main plot device, which seems to reflect the desire of many to solve cases that remain frozen in time. Recently, cold case teams within police departments have been focusing on reopening files that have been buried in dust. Unsolved cases from the early 2000s were brought back with the hope of discovering new evidence through advanced technology.Another mysterious rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl that happened in South Jeolla Province in 2001, called the “Dedeul River case,” is an example of a case that was reopened with successful results. Police focused on reanalyzing DNA data extracted from retained semen samples along with new evidence found in the archives. A 40-year-old man surnamed Kim, who was already serving in prison on charges of robbery and murder, was resentenced to life in prison for his past wrongdoing. Kwon said that it is crucial to keep an open mind when reinvestigating a case and recommended minimized exposure to outdated records which can distract one from producing fresh theories. “The original files could hold errors which can sidetrack investigators from seeing the truth.”He added that modern-day cold cases sometimes derive from complacent attitudes such as the police not taking disappearance reports seriously. Kwon also emphasized the importance of patience and heading in the right direction when pursuing a reopened cold case. “Solving a cold case is not only about the results, but the process itself,” said Kwon. “When a case is finally solved after a period of stagnation, then there is nothing better than that.”By Jung Min-kyung","the hwaseong serial killings over ,south korea first criminal profiler ,devastating cold case south korea ,hwaseong serial killings over million ,hwaseong serial killings went cold","['south korean', 'Hwaseong', 'South Korea', 'Kwon Il - yong', 'South Korea ’s', 'Hwaseong , Gyeonggi Province', 'Hwaseong', 'Kwon', 'Hwaseong', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Hwaseong', 'Kwon', 'Hwaseong', 'Bong Joon - ho', 'south korean', 'Signal', 'OCN ’s', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Kim', 'Kwon', 'Kwon', 'Kwon', 'Jung Min - kyung']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53563666  0.34014064

Shame on the Korean military,” she said. The convict, an Army captain whose name was withheld, was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for a year, for having consensual sex with a same-sex soldier in a private place. He was charged with a violation of the Military Criminal Act, which is punishable by up to two years in prison. The act outlaws sodomy or other “disgraceful acts” in the armed forces regardless of whether there was mutual consent. “I’m beyond furious. How is this a fair ruling? They are forcing men to serve in the military, but they cannot be themselves -- gay?” said Jacqueline Carrillo, who identifies as bisexual.In South Korea, serving about two years in the military is mandatory for most able-bodied men to deter aggression from North Korea. “What’s going to happen to them in jail? Will they be persecuted for being gay, too?” she asked. The military, as well as conservative and Protestant groups, argue that homosexual acts in the barracks would undermine its readiness and discipline to fight North Korea’s 1.2 million-strong army. Timothy Gitzen, an activist for Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights for Korea and a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at the University of Minnesota, said that it was no different from “segregation.”“Do not be mistaken. This is South Korea -- the place where “the power of the people” can unseat corrupt presidents,” he said. “But it’s state-sanctioned violence against its own people.”“It is the same argument people would use in the US to talk about segregation in the military between people of color and white soldiers,” Gitzen said. “Soldiers only care about staying alive and finishing their service. The only people who care about it are military officials in power who want to impose their religious world view on the military and the state.”In protest against the ruling, a group of 10 liberal lawmakers submitted a bill to scrap the controversial gay ban clause in the military criminal act. “Punishing those having consensual sex outside the barracks is a violation of rights to self-determination and privacy,” said Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the minor Justice Party in a press briefing Thursday. “Sexual orientation is not subject to permission.”“There are still clauses severely punishing forcible sexual contacts such as rape, so it is groundless fear that the lifting of the military gay ban will help spread sexual crimes.”After the verdict was delivered Wednesday, human rights groups have strongly condemned the verdict. “It is a shameful side of South Korea, which has been a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, that the government labeled an individual as a criminal just because he is gay,” said the Center for Military Human Rights Korea. Amnesty International called for an end to the “bigoted hunt to root out gay personnel.”“This unjust conviction should be immediately overturned. No one should be persecuted based on their sexual orientation, activity or gender identity alone. What counts is their service not their sexuality,” said Roseann Rife, East Asia Research Director at Amnesty International. In April, the military human rights group claimed that Army chief of staff Gen. Jang Jun-gyu ordered a hunt to identify gay military soldiers. The military put up to 50 soldiers on the list and set up fake profiles on dating apps to lure them into outing themselves, it said. The Korean military denied the allegations, saying it only investigated those involved in a video of two servicemen having sex posted on social media.Meanwhile, a Taiwanese court on Wednesday ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, paving the way for it to become the first Asian country to legalize same-sex unions.By Ock Hyun-ju","gay soldier for having sex ,out gay personnel this unjust ,conviction wednesday of gay soldier ,gay personnel this unjust conviction ,wednesday of gay soldier","['South Korea', 'Amanda Melgarejo Bastos', 'the United States', 'korean', 'Army', 'Jacqueline Carrillo', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'protestant', 'North Korea ’s', 'Timothy Gitzen', 'Solidarity', 'Korea', 'the University of Minnesota', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Gitzen', 'Kim Jong - dae', 'Justice Party', 'South Korea', 'the United Nations Human Rights Council', 'the Center for Military Human Rights Korea', 'Amnesty International', 'Roseann Rife', 'Amnesty International', 'Army', 'Jang Jun - gyu', 'korean', 'taiwanese', 'asian', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07878175 -0.08700294

Symptoms of the illness, caused by group A streptococcal infection, includes fever, sore throat, a flushed face and swelling of the tongue. Scarlet fever usually occurs in children, and spreads through coughing and sneezing, and physical contact with contaminated surfaces or infected persons. According to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, 96 percent of patients reported last year were children under the age of 10. It is easily treated by antibiotics, but late diagnosis and inadequate treatment can lead to more serious conditions including pneumonia and lymphadenitis, experts warn.“People diagnosed with the fever and who are on an antibiotics treatment should stay away from others for at least 24 hours to avoid passing on the infection,” Lee Ji-yong, head of the infectious diseases division at a local H Plus Yangji Hospital. Lee added that the spread of the disease can be prevented by maintaining personal hygiene such as washing hands, and covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing.By Bak Se-hwan","tongue scarlet fever usually occurs ,kcdc 11 911 suspected cases ,group streptococcal infection includes fever ,fever are on sharp rise ,scarlet fever usually occurs in","['the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'KCDC', 'KCDC', 'the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service', 'Lee Ji - yong', 'h plus Yangji Hospital', 'Lee', 'Bak Se - hwan']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08845422  0.41898286

It couldn’t have been more different this year. Liberal President Moon Jae-in, taking office after two conservative presidents, turned the otherwise dull, perfunctory event into an emotional revisit of the nation’s turbulent path to democracy, paved with the blood of Gwangju citizens.President Moon Jae-in hugs Kim So-hyung, whose father was killed during the May 18th Gwangju Uprising, during a ceremony marking the 37th anniversary of the democratic movement in the southern city of Gwangju on Thursday. “I dare tell you here and now that the new Moon Jae-in government stands in line with the legacy of the Gwangju Democratization Movement,” said Moon in his address at the national cemetery, vowing to protect and further advance the country’s hard-earned democracy. The 37th-year anniversary was honored with the biggest number of participants, some 10,000, including President Moon himself, since the day was designated as a national anniversary in 1997. For the first time in nine years, the crowd sang “March for the Beloved,” a song symbolic of the spirit of the 1980 civilian uprising. Many shed tears and expressed satisfaction at the way the day was remembered and patriots honored. The May 18 Democratic Uprising was a pro-democracy movement in 1980, where citizens protested against the military dictatorship of Gen. Chun Doo-hwan. He took power through a military coup and expanded the martial law throughout the country, shutting down universities and banning political speeches. As more than 200,000 Gwangju citizens took to the streets, hundreds were killed and wounded during the nine-day protest as Chun ordered the most violent crackdown in the nation’s modern history.At the time, it was defined as a riot with North Korea masterminding the developments. Although the massacre was later officially recognized by the government as a grassroots rebellion against the dictatorship, Gwangju’s strong association with the liberal political faction amid the acrimonious rivalry between the left and the right has made it difficult for many conservatives to truly accept it. The previous conservative presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye only paid tribute in the annual event in their first year in office. After that, prime ministers and other high-ranking officials took on the role. During their term, “March for the Beloved” couldn’t be sung by the participants. It was only allowed to be played by a choir. President Moon ordered last Friday that the song be sung as part of the ceremony. President Moon said he would conduct a thorough investigation into the killings and find out who is responsible for the bloody attack, indirectly pointing at the then-commander in chief, Chun himself. “The new government will exert efforts in finding out the truth about that day, including who ordered the first shot  and hold  to account.”Moon also reiterated his earlier promise to include the May 18 spirit in the nation’s Constitution, so people can learn about and remember the country’s history of democratization.The new leader’s support uplifted the sentiments of the survivors and the bereaved families. “What Moon is doing is for the people of the nation. I am glad he has acted to acknowledge the historical event,” Yang Don-sil, 87, told The Korea Herald. She lost her sixth son, Kim Yong-pyo in the bloody crackdown.Lee Chang-hee was arrested, tortured and jailed only two months after he enrolled at the Chonnam National University in 1980. “I feel guilty to be alive in front of all the victims here,” the 55-year-old said, sitting in a wheelchair in the front of the stage. He said that he can now finally breathe, as he could not for the past 10 years with the conservative presidents in office. Another survivor of the brutal incident recalled his experience as a trauma and refused to talk about it. Still, he felt strongly about the song, “March for the Beloved.” For liberal politicians, the ceremony epitomized the change of the era, or the arrival of their era. Many turned emotional. “I was touched how the whole new Republic of Korea revealed itself in a symbolic way through the May 18 memorial ceremony,” said the newly elected floor leader Woo Won-shik of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, hailing the renewed tone of the long-neglected ceremony.South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung, who had competed with Moon during the Democratic Party primary, said that he was “so deeply touched that tears came out.”“Regardless of progressive or conservative, this is what a nation is supposed to be like,” the governor said.Liberal Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon spoke of hope and a new vision for the future.“I believe that the past nine years of darkness, anger, and sorrow have ended, giving way to a new world of hope,” Park said. “We have come to live in a world in which the May 18  spirit has been revived.”Rep. Chung Woo-taik, floor leader and interim chief of the conservative opposition Liberty Korea Party, stood out during the ceremony by not singing along with the commemorative song. “I understand that President Moon ordered for unison, but has never requested cooperation from the political circles over the issue,” he told reporters.By Jo He-rim Staff reporter Bae Hyun-jung contributed to this article. --Ed.","office after two conservative presidents ,two conservative presidents turned ,choir president moon ordered last ,after two conservative presidents turned ,after two conservative presidents","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim So - hyung', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Gwangju Democratization Movement', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'democratic', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Chun', 'North Korea', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Chun', 'Moon', 'Yang Don - sil', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Yong - pyo', 'Lee Chang - hee', 'the Chonnam National University', 'Korea', 'Woo Won - shik', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'South Chungcheong', 'an Hee - jung', 'Moon', 'the Democratic Party', 'Park Won - soon', 'Park', 'Chung Woo - taik', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Moon', 'Jo He - rim Staff', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",4,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.30725047  0.5454725

On Wednesday, the president ordered the Justice Ministry and the Supreme Prosecutors' Office to inspect Ahn Tae-geun, a deputy minister for criminal affairs, and Lee Young-ryeol, chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, who led the headquarters of special investigation into the corruption scandal. This combined photo shows Lee Young-ryeol, chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office  and Ahn Tae-geun, ranking official at the Ministry of Justice. The two offered to resign on May 18, 2017, one day after President Moon Jae-in ordered an inspection into allegations they inappropriately exchanged money. His order is seen as a possible trigger to reopen the investigation into Park's former aide Woo Byung-woo, and to carry out a drastic reform of the prosecution office. Lee's team is suspected of failing to get to the bottom of Woo's charges, resulting in a court's refusal to approve his arrest last month. Woo once served as a senior prosecutor. During a dinner shortly after Lee's team closed the investigation late last month, they offered envelopes of cash to each other's underlings. Each of the envelopes contained between 700,000 won and 1 million won . Two justice ministry officials who received money from Lee returned it the very next day.""I am sorry for causing concern to the public. I will resign from the post and sincerely go through the inspection,"" Lee said in a statement.""I feel sorry about the latest incident. I would like to offer my resignation as it seems inappropriate to serve in the public office under the current circumstances,"" Ahn said in a separate statement.Ahn has also been said to have held hundreds of telephone conversations with Woo while the latter was still working at the presidential office but was subject to investigation by an independent counsel.Still, it is unlikely for their resignations to be accepted until the inspection is over. This photo taken on May 17, 2017, shows the national flag and the prosecution's flag flapping in the wind at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in the capital. Woo was questioned over a range of allegations, but the prosecution's two attempts to arrest him were dismissed by a court.Woo currently faces a trial over allegations that include negligence of duty for failing to prevent Park's longtime friend Choi Soon-sil from interfering in government affairs and extorting tens of billions of won from local businesses.He is one of very few suspects in the case to face trial without physical detention, while the former president herself remains in custody.Cheong Wa Dae said the prosecution has also set up a 12-person team to investigate allegations surrounding one of its own, Lee said.","officials offered to resign thursday ,aides on wednesday the president ,resign thursday one day after ,offered to resign thursday ,to resign thursday one day","['Justice Ministry', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun', 'the Justice Ministry', ""the Supreme Prosecutors ' office"", 'Ahn Tae - geun', 'Lee Young - ryeol', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Lee Young - ryeol', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Ahn Tae - geun', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Lee', 'Woo', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Lee']",2,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.41543779  0.38115364

At dusk Wednesday, the first anniversary of the killing, hundreds of people, mostly women in their 20s and 30s, silently marched across Gangnam in tribute to the 23-year-old victim who was stabbed to death by a man in a unisex public bathroom.Mourners pay silent tribute to the 23-year-old victim killed at a uni-sex public bathroom near Gangman Station last year during a memorial event held in Gangnam, southern Seoul, Wednesday. “The murder forever changed my life. It was a chance for me to wake up to the seriousness of misogyny and discrimination in Korean society,” Suh Jung-hyun, a 19-year-old university student told The Korea Herald. “Before the murder, I was not happy about having to be careful at night just because I was a girl. But I did nothing because I thought I couldn’t help it,” she said while marching with a friend. “I now gained courage to take action to fight the injustice in solidarity with others.”The murderer was a 34-year-old man, surnamed Kim. He waited for about 50 minutes in the restroom, while six men entered and left, before he killed the first woman who entered the bathroom, according to CCTV footage. Kim said he had committed the crime because he had been “ignored and belittled” by women many times in the past.Mourners march across Gangnam, southern Seoul, Wednesday, marking the first-year anniversary of the Gangnam Station murder. After the incident came to light, exit 10 of Gangnam Station transformed into a memorial site with people leaving flowers and written notes to mourn the death of the young woman and express their anger toward violence targeting women. A year after the killing, justice has been done. The murderer is locked up in prison, where he is to stay for 30 years. Yet, many mourners who gathered felt their fight against misogyny and hate crimes had a long way to go.“I still fear violence against women. It will not change anytime soon,” said 28-year-old Bae Un. “Safety cannot be achieved through regulation. Safety for women can only be achieved through the social perception that men and women are equal.” Male participants sympathized with the women, too. “I will never fully know what it is like living in fear of being killed because of my gender. That’s why I will make more of an effort,” said Kim Jae-ho, a 23-year-old student. “This is not only a woman’s problem. It is about making a society where human rights are respected.” Mostly dressed in black, the participants were holding flowers and handwritten messages on sticky notes, which they later left outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station. Following the march, people shared their stories of rape, violence and discrimination.Human rights acvitists and feminists hold banners urging for an end to misogyny and crimes targeting women at a press conference at Gwanghwamun in central Seoul, Wednesday, marking the first-year anniversary of the Gangnam Station murder. Earlier in the day, women’s rights activists held a press conference at Gwanghwamun, central Seoul and, as part of a performance, silently held up posters reading messages such as “Since the day, we are changing” and “For women, everywhere is Gangnam station.”“Women have changed. The way we perceive the male-dominated society and resist discrimination has changed,” women’s rights activist Kim Hui-yeong said. “It was a chance for women to stand up for their own safety and equality.”Many pro-women groups were created based on social media by young women identifying themselves as feminists. They were at the forefront of pressuring the government to scrap its plan for a tougher ban on abortion, among other actions. “But society has rarely changed,” Kim said, criticizing the government’s short-sighted measures to prevent hate crimes against women.Since the murder, municipalities stepped up efforts to install more CCTV cameras and alarm bells and set up separate public bathrooms for men and women to prevent a recurrence of such crimes. “That’s not the point. We are suffering from hatred, discrimination and violence in our daily lives at home, at school and at work,” she said. “CCTVs cannot prevent misogynic crimes. The key is to raise awareness, especially among policymakers. There should be awareness that women are equal to men and they don‘t need to be subjected to special protection.”A passerby, who left a message of support in respect to the victim, hoped for an easing of conflict between men and women. “For the past year, hatred and conflict between men and women has intensified. It is true that I am still worried about my girlfriend being outside at night and there is still discrimination against women, like in the job seeking process,” said Nam Kun-hee, 21, a university student.At the height of the outpouring of grief and anger, tension spiked between extremist groups of men and women, particularly on the internet. As police concluded the murder was a random crime by a mentally disturbed man, not a hate crime, there was criticism of police attempts to cover up the misogyny prevalent in society. Some radical men shot back, accusing women of treating them as potential criminals. “I just hope that both men and women can coexist in harmony without being discriminated against in Korean society,” Nam said.By Ock Hyun-ju","women year after the killing ,seoul wednesday the murder forever ,hated women at dusk wednesday ,wednesday the murder forever changed ,women since the murder municipalities","['Gangnam Station', 'Gangnam', 'Gangman Station', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Suh Jung - hyun', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'CCTV', 'Kim', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam Station', 'Bae Un', 'Kim Jae - ho', 'Gangnam Station', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam', 'Kim Hui - yeong', 'Kim', 'CCTV', 'Nam Kun - hee', 'korean', 'Nam', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61108297  0.41110134

At the core of restoring public trust are principles, self-control and integrity,” said Prosecutor-General Kim during his retirement ceremony at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office in Seoul.Outgoing chief prosecutor Kim Soo-nam Appointed by former President Park Geun-hye, he had seven months left in his two-year term. Kim offered to step down Thursday, hours after new President Moon Jae-in appointed Cho Kuk, an advocate of drastic reforms of the prosecution, as his legal affairs secretary. Moon accepted the resignation the following day.In his farewell remarks, the outgoing chief also expressed hopes for a “desirable” direction for the prosecution overhaul. “The reforms of the prosecution should be in line with the direction that can help the public,” he said. “It should be reviewed whether reforms of the prosecution guarantee neutrality, fairness and efficiency of investigations.”Public distrust of the prosecution hit a tipping point in the wake of the corruption scandal involving former President Park and her inner circle, including her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil, a prosecutor-turned-presidential aide and ex-ministers. The prosecution drew criticism for being lukewarm and lenient in investigating cases related to high-ranking officials under the Park administration, especially a case involving Cho’s predecessor Woo Byung-woo. Woo, a former prosecutor, is suspected of using his ties to the prosecution to sway its investigations in favor of the government. Kim’s resignation is expected to boost Moon’s pledge to revamp the state prosecution, which he sees as wielding too much power with exclusive rights to investigate, arrest and indict.Cho Kuk, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Moon ordered the new Civil Affairs Secretary Cho to revisit the corruption allegations involving the ousted president. For a start, Cho said in a media interview that he would internally look into the Jeong Yoon-hoe scandal. Police said Monday that they were reviewing whether to open an investigation into deceased police officer Choi Kyung-rak, who committed suicide while undergoing a prosecutorial probe in 2014. He was suspected of handing over to a local daily the confidential document accusing Jeong, husband of Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil, of meddling in state affairs. Choi’s brother filed a petition with the police, asking for a reinvestigation into Choi’s death. Choi’s suicide note hinted he was under pressure to make false testimony not to go against the government.“I have a right and duty to clarify why the prosecution covered up the Jeong Yun-hoe case and why it distorted it under the previous prosecution,” presidential aide Cho said in an interview with local media. In 2014, the daily reported on the document revealing Jeong peddled influence over state affairs behind the scenes despite holding no elected office. Jeong assisted Park when she entered politics in 1998 and was her chief secretary in 2002 when Park founded her own political party. The prosecution had concluded that the report was based on false accusations, only indicting those who released the document -- ex-presidential secretary Cho Eung-cheon and ex-senior police officer Park kwan-cheon -- for leaking government secrets. The prosecution was criticized for only focusing on how the confidential document was leaked out of the presidential office rather than looking into the content allegedly indicating Jeong and his wife Choi’s meddling in state affairs. Cho, a lawmaker of the Democratic Party of Korea, was found not guilty. Park received an eight-month term in prison, suspended for two years, for releasing one of the 17 government documents. The prosecution dismissed the claims accusing it of covering up the case. “In the two-page document, there were no parts indicating Choi’s specific meddling in state affairs or irregularities,” the prosecution said. “We thoroughly investigated the case but there was no evidence to confirm the way the document was leaked or Jeong’s interference with state affairs.”By Ock Hyun-ju","kim during his retirement ceremony ,thursday hours after new president ,monday as major overhaul looms ,in seoul outgoing chief prosecutor ,after new president moon jae","['Kim Soo - nam', 'Prosecutor - General', 'Kim', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Seoul', 'Kim Soo - nam', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Cho Kuk', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Cho', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Kim', 'Moon ’s', 'Cho Kuk', 'Moon', 'Civil Affairs', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Choi Kyung - rak', 'Jeong', 'Park ’s', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi ’s', 'Jeong Yun - hoe', 'Cho', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Park', 'Cho Eung - cheon', 'Jeong', 'Choi ’s', 'Cho', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'Choi', 'Jeong', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",12,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.36270976  0.62104064

For this new role, Moon chose Sogang University economist Cho Yoon-jae, and the chief delegates include a lawmaker and a former ambassador to Germany. Cho served former President Roh Moo-hyun as an economic adviser in 2003 and as Seoul’s ambassador to the UK between 2005 and 2008. The delegation also includes Bae Gi-chan, the chief director of United Korea Cooperative, a nongovernmental organization working for the reunification of the two Koreas.This combined file photo shows Hong Seok-hyun , a former chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media Network; former Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan ; and Democratic Party Reps. Moon Hee-sang and Rep. Song Young-gil . For the critical role of special envoy to the US, Moon chose former Chairman of JoongAng Media Network Hong Seok-hyun. In the run-up to the May 9 presidential election, Hong was rumored to have presidential ambitions. However, after he chose to support Moon, rumors circulated that Moon was considering him for the post of prime minister. Hong, who served as Seoul’s ambassador to the US in 2005, will be accompanied by a former diplomat, a national security expert and a ruling party lawmaker. Hong’s delegation is the only one to include a businessman -- Ryu Jin of defense contractor Poongsan.“The president spoke to the leaders of major countries, and explained the government’s vision and policy direction on a number of crucial issues including North Korea’s nuclear program,” chief presidential press secretary Yoon Young-chan said. “ are individuals best equipped to convey the president’s visions in diplomatic affairs and have a clear understanding of them.” The envoys’ connections to their destinations appear to have played a big part in the selection of the special envoys to China, Japan and Russia. Special envoy to China, Rep. Lee Hae-chan of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, served the same role for Roh while he was president-elect. He is said to have maintained close ties with Chinese leaders. Lee’s selection was quickly met with positive assessment from the Chinese media. In a Chinese-language report, China’s state-run Global Times assessed Lee’s selection as a move to improved strained relations between Seoul and Beijing. Citing Lee’s experience of representing Roh in Beijing and his ties to Chinese officials, the report said that the seven-term lawmaker was a pro-China figure. In a separate but related development, the ruling party’s Rep. Park Byeong-seug is said to have met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday. Park is leading Seoul’s delegation to an international economic forum in Beijing. At the meeting, Xi expressed hopes to improve relations, Park told reporters.As for the special envoy to Japan, Rep. Moon Hee-sang is a veteran politician, who served as the chairman of the Korea-Japan lawmakers’ association between 2004 and 2008. For special envoy to Russia, Moon chose the ruling party’s Rep. Song Young-gil. In 2013, Song was awarded a medal from the Russian government for his efforts in increasing exchanges between the two countries while he was mayor of Incheon. Song also currently serves as a deputy chairman of the Korea-Russia lawmakers’ association.By Choi He-suk","major powers monday adding germany ,powers monday adding germany and ,powers monday adding germany ,monday adding germany and the ,moon chose sogang university economist","['Moon Jae - in', 'Germany', 'the European Union', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'EU', 'Germany', 'Moon', 'Sogang University', 'Cho Yoon - jae', 'Germany', 'Cho', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Seoul', 'UK', 'Bae Gi - chan', 'United Korea Cooperative', 'Koreas', 'Hong Seok - hyun', 'the JoongAng Media Network', 'Lee Hae - chan', 'Democratic Party Reps', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'Song Young', 'US', 'Moon', 'JoongAng Media Network', 'Hong', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Hong', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Ryu Jin', 'Poongsan', 'North Korea ’s', 'Yoon Young - chan', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'China', 'Lee Hae - chan', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Roh', 'chinese', 'Lee', 'chinese', 'China', 'Global Times', 'Lee ’s', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'cite Lee ’s', 'Roh', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Park Byeong - seug', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Xi', 'Park', 'Japan', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'Korea', 'Russia', 'Moon', 'Song Young', 'Song', 'russian', 'Incheon', 'Song', 'Korea', 'Russia', 'Choi He - suk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.42407531  0.97914112

The government should also make companies return resumes or applications to the job applicants.“This can help reduce the pressure on younger people seeking employment and also save time.”Choi Hwee-young, 27, performance planning industry worker“Many believe that those who work in art, sports and the performance industry make little money and live a life that is removed from reality. “I hope our new leader can break the stereotype of those who work hard chasing their dreams -- help them to receive more respect and support.“I do not wish to see another incident like the drawing up of a blacklist of cultural figures deemed critical of the government who were then denied state support.”Kim Se-yule, 38, manager at Redcap Tour“Dear President, I and my spouse don’t want our daughter -- Kim Ju-ah in her first year at an elementary school -- to spend too much time memorizing English words and wrestling with math questions when she goes to middle and high school.“We believe few Koreans would deny that cramming for exams at school has hampered the development of creativity of students over the past few decades.“So we hope you will be a leader who overhauls the educational system for the children’s better future and for improved national competitiveness. Congratulations on your inauguration!”Eun Jong-hun, 28, assistant film director Freedom of expression, guarantee of diversity, the principle of “support without interference,” and a system where artists and creators can take control of culture-related policies -- these are the things I ask of the new administration with regard to the film industry.In terms of society in general, I hope citizens will be able to receive care and the guarantee of basic happiness for no other reason than the fact that they are citizens; and that people will not be discriminated against due to gender, profession or income.Dong Jong-in, 61, joint head of Korea Association of Energy, Climate Change and Environment“Each candidate’s party had put out pledges regarding fine dust issues, and it’s a sign that they are being taken seriously. But the pledges lack details on finding the root cause of rising fine dust levels and how much it will cost to implement anti-pollution plans.  “The new administration should start by creating a database that helps identify various sources of air pollution. “It is important for the government to hold an open discussion with local environmental groups to gather expert opinions, come up with proper diagnosis and treatment plans and put them into actual policies that are effective and sustainable.”Lee Seung-ha, 36, working mom with a 4-year-old child“Dear President, I am a working mother living in the city and as much as I appreciate the government’s child care allowance, what I truly need is a reliable place that will take care of my daughter in times of need.“Also, I strongly ask that the new government take the worsening fine dust situation seriously, as it will cause irrevocable damage to the health and development of our children.“I sincerely hope that in years to come, I will be able to tell my daughter that our government exists to serve the people and to punish those who have committed wrongdoings -- a simple principle which our society has failed to uphold for too long.”Kang Sung-woo, 32, Gwangjang Market street vendorAll I want is for the newly elected president to just allow us to run our business and for the president to do his job well. When presidents did not do their job properly, I saw my business in trouble and my livelihood at stake. As a vendor, I have watched the number of Chinese customers decrease to nearly zero. But, I don’t have a say here, because I know that national security is a graver matter than a cup of juice.I am rather concerned about my girlfriend who has not been able to find a stable job. I don’t expect a president to cast a magic spell. But I hope the new president will be able to tackle unemployment and make things better for young people.Rhyu Jung-bum, 35, Mesh Korea CEO “As a founder of a Korean startup, I would ask our new president to relax excessive regulations that limit business opportunities. It is necessary and important to have regulations in order to prevent foreseeable social problems. But often, we see that some regulations are too excessive, preventing startups from proceeding with their businesses smoothly. They are, rather, hurdles to us. “The startup environment has seen significant improvements in terms of financial support for new firms. I hope the new government continues supporting startups by keeping policies that are consistent with those of the previous administration.”Ahn Chan-il, director of the World North Korea Research Center, North Korean defector living in South Korea since 1979“After a decade of engagement policy and another of a pressure campaign, South Korea is at a crossroads on its approach toward the North and unification. I hope the new government will find a third way, blending the Sunshine Policy and pressure, which could close the gap between the two Koreas, build trust and lay the groundwork for unification. “The path to unification would open if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un abandons nuclear weapons and comes forward with a message of peace. But he is unlikely to do so unless the US signs a peace treaty and withdraws its troops from the peninsula. “Seoul should explore various ways to foster the mood for rapprochement. As an option, I suggest the launch of new denuclearization talks that could entail a restart of the Kaesong industrial park and tours to Kumgangsan, but without providing bulk cash. I hope the new government will be remembered by history as one that paved the way for unification.”Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch“South Korea’s new president should recognize that all Koreans, regardless of whether they are living north or south of the 38th parallel, deserve to have their human rights protected, their freedom assured and their dignity respected. The new leader should recognize that it’s time to end the polarization and politicization of human rights dialogue in South Korea between left and right, with each side asserting they are right and the other side is wrong. “Yes, the UN Commission of Inquiry established beyond a doubt that the Pyongyang government has committed crimes against humanity against the people of North Korea, and we all need to work to ensure those responsible are held accountable for their crimes. But that certainly doesn’t mean that South Korea can ignore its own human rights problems that must be urgently addressed, like abuses of labor rights, discrimination against women at home and in the workplace, violence and abuse against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful public assembly, and abusive treatment of migrant workers from other countries. “Human Rights Watch expects that the new president will work equally hard on human rights issues in both the north and the south, recognizing that the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states unequivocally that ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.’ The time is opportune for South Korea to turn a new page, and become a global leader in the 21st century on human rights, whether at home or in North Korea, during bilateral foreign policy negotiations with other governments or at the UN in New York and Geneva.”Oh Yun-mi, 33, a soon-to-be working mom who expects twin boys in August To fundamentally resolve the low birthrate issue, what we need is an environment in which stable child care is possible, not just one-off incentives for show. The new government will hopefully be capable of introducing a policy that does not require double-income parents to choose between their children and their careers.Hong Min-ji, 35, a lecturer at the Chinaro Chinese language institution, from Seoul I hope the new government will implement a principled policy that promotes a balanced relationship between Korea and China. I am keen to see the issues regarding the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system resolved in an amicable and peaceful manner so that those who are engaged in China-related work can be at ease again. As all Koreans wish, the new government should also heed the voices of the people, taking it as its innate duty. Jin Minghua, 30, a lecturer at the Chinaro Chinese language institution, from Harbin, Heilongjiang province, China I hope the relationship between China and Korea will remain as cordial and peaceful as now, and the countries will prosper in tandem. Also I hope the new Korean government will improve labor rights and incentives for expats, while creating better jobs and working environments.Ryu Wang-sik, 59, retireeRyu Wang-sik worked for one of the country’s largest family-run conglomerates for 32 years.  “The new president should set out to reform the chaebol to rule out unjust misconduct and corporate crimes. They are privatizing companies even though they hold a very small stake. Their influence likens them to emperors. Decades of corruption must be stamped out. The nation’s companies, as well as the economy, remain vulnerable to ‘ownership crises' as long as corruption continues to exist,” Ryu said.Ryu said the new president should tackle economic issues such as disparities between the rich and the poor, welfare and developing the nation’s overall competitiveness amid the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Chang Sung-ho, 28, investment banker at a Tokyo-based financial firmAs a Korean living in Japan, the most uncomfortable situations occur with regards to bilateral agreements about the past atrocities committed by Japan. I hope that the new president will address the issue more clearly and approve or disapprove of the agreements or comments that were made by past administrations. If an agreement was reached in the past that is deemed unfair by the public, please come to a new agreement and ask for an additional apology, or state that the agreement was unfair but that it was the best that could be achieved. Manage the issue domestically, rather than allow public emotions to run amok without an official government stance.Lee Hyeon-song, 32, lawyer living in London I think there is widespread skepticism among young people toward South Korean society. We need to build a social climate where the effort you put in is compensated properly. Under such conditions, people can be creative and diverse in designing their own lives. One of the most impressive things I noticed while living in London is its culture in which people respect each other’s diversity. Despite Brexit, I think London is still a city where people of different colors and cultures can live harmonious lives. I hope the new government will be more proactive in reducing social bias and discrimination.Park Se-jin, 29, Seoul-based artist “I want South Korean society to be fair and just and, above all, open to all those who pursue their dreams. “I live with money earned by holding part-time jobs at bars and convenience stores. I manage to buy the material for my painting, but then I cannot rent a venue to show and sell my works. It is a vicious circle. “Living as an artist and chasing my dream seems impossible without financial support from one’s parents. “I hope the new government expands welfare for artists, especially fledgling ones. “It would be good if the government could create a website, let artists register their works and give them little subsidies to financially support them. I think such a website could also be a way to promote Korean artists internationally.”Udaya Rai, president of the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union“Compared to 15 years ago, migrant workers’ lives are not at all better off. The Korean government thinks it should help us because we are from poor countries. “We have not been allowed to take paid days off or change workplaces as we wish under the current Employment Permit System. We have been pressured to work longer hours than Korean peers, but earned less. “Under the new government, I hope migrant workers’ basic labor rights can be guaranteed and we are embraced as members of society, as South Korea cannot function without us supporting the very bottom of its economy.”So Sung-wook, 26, Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea activist “I hope South Korea becomes a society where someone like me, who is gay, can lead a safe and happy life. I want to reveal who I am and my sexual orientation without my existence being denied. “I was outraged and sad when presidential candidates, except for one, said they opposed our existence. It is the new president’s job to fight discrimination against sexual minorities rather than wait for things to change. “We hope the new government stops punishing soldiers just because they are gay. We want the new administration to pass an anti-discrimination law to make us safer. We want the nation’s education materials to mention our existence so that the young can think of who they are and their rights.”Amanda Melgarejo Bastos, American, English teacher I hope the air quality in Korea improves and that the foreign community can have more confidence in Korean law enforcement.I developed tonsillitis almost immediately after arriving in Korea and it has never gone away. I want to know where all the pollution is coming from because even if half of it is from the deserts in China, the other half coming from Korea needs to be investigated and cleared away.Also, I hope the police take foreigners more seriously. In general, the police seem to favor only the Korean side of the story instead of equally hearing and understanding both sides.Lee Jin-ock, Korea Womens’ Political Solidarity director“Korean society has shifted responsibility for giving birth, raising children and maintaining careers to women, so women’s lives as mothers and workers have become more vulnerable.“Policies themselves cannot solve the gender inequality problem. It is good to expand parental leave. But only regular workers are entitled to such paid parental leave. If not embraced by companies, women will continue to suffer from the burden of child-rearing alone.  “I hope that the new government improves the structural inequality in society and the way it governs the country.  The government should serve as a mediator to include more voices of women, minorities and civil society in implementing its policies.”Choi Jung-wha, president of Corea Image Communications Institute and professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies“Korea would benefit greatly from a president who prioritizes cultural communications with communities around the world. I want our new leader to raise our national prestige up a notch, so that citizens of the world feel compelled to do many interesting things with Korea.“Our country also needs a leader who can demonstrate to our young people that everything is within our grasp given our creative exertion -- that the world is our oyster. Emmanuel Macron, the freshly elected soon-to-be president of France, when he came to Korea in late 2014 as an economic minister exemplified that spirit in a 40-minute off-the-cuff speech.“Macron‘s message was that by promoting flexible work on Sundays, citizens can be both progressive and pragmatic at the same time. The strength of France, a global cultural powerhouse, comes from open communication between citizens and with the world at large.”Park Sung-min, 31, Occupational and Environmental Health doctor at Inha University Hospital “As a whole, I want policies to head in a direction where it diminishes social discrimination. There are existing bills that ban discrimination against disabilities, but I’m not sure it’s well-abided,” said Park who was permanently paralyzed from the waist down from a skiing accident in college.“There are companies that would rather pay fines than actually hire disabled employees. Even if they succeed in getting the job, most disabled persons soon resign due to lack of support and infrastructure.” Park emphasized that reduced mobility and accessibility were the main reasons behind the low social participation of the disabled. He believes once the rights are secured, the participation rate will increase gradually.Lim Won-sun, 54, head of Korean Academy of Multicultural Family“The new administration should establish a new immigration services body that can comprehensively deal with issues related to multicultural families. Currently there are ministries and organizations proceeding with similar projects, which is very inefficient. In addition, the government bodies should be watched closely on their management because the services and monetary budgets offered are often not fully delivered. “I wish the government would acknowledge that, while multicultural families need attention, they are also members of society, existing as another form in the diversifying family culture in Korea. “Health support centers and multicultural family centers exist separately, but it would be better to have a family support center that can include multicultural families, instead of discriminating against them as if they were foreigners.”Lee Min-young, 18, Silim High School“I believe the key for good leadership is the ability to listen to the people. The former president lacked that skill and failed to care for the livelihoods of the citizens. I hope the new president is more considerate. “I get my voting right next year after I turn 19. I wish the new leader would lower the voting age. Eighteen-year-olds are old enough to think about policies and decide on the leader who will affect their lives for the next five years. “My parents work and they could not take time off on holidays. It would be nice to increase the number of national holidays, but what is more important is that the employees be able to fully take off the existing holidays.”Nu Chen , 31, musician “I hope the new government can make more room for musicians who don’t come from major entertainment agencies, like me. I think the current music industry is too focused on K-pop. I know that the Korean entertainment industry has grown so much with K-pop content, but they are also leaving less room for other artists to develop. The Korean music industry would be more diversified if the future government could support musicians from various backgrounds to freely pursue their music careers.“I also hope the new government will fix problems regarding illegal downloading and streaming that are rampant today. We are having a real hard time with such problems and they are very sensitive issues to musicians.”","36 newlywed living in incheon ,koreans wish the new government ,much needed assistance for newlyweds ,the new government hope migrant ,newlywed living in incheon","['Yang Sung - hoon', 'Hwee - young', 'Kim Ju - ah', 'english', 'Koreans', 'Jong - hun', 'Dong Jong - in', 'Korea Association of Energy , Climate Change', 'Seung - ha', 'Gwangjang Market', 'chinese', 'Rhyu Jung - bum', 'Mesh Korea', 'korean', 'Chan - il', 'the World North Korea Research Center', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Kumgangsan', 'Robertson', 'Human Rights', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the UN Commission of Inquiry', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'New York', 'Geneva', 'Yun - mi', 'Hong Min - ji', 'Chinaro', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'China', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'China', 'Koreans', 'Jin Minghua', 'Chinaro', 'chinese', 'Harbin', 'Heilongjiang', 'China', 'China', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Ryu Wang - sik', 'Ryu', 'Ryu', 'Chang Sung - ho', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Lee Hyeon - song', 'London', 'south korean', 'London', 'Brexit', 'London', 'Park Se - jin', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'korean', 'the Seoul - Gyeonggi - Incheon Migrants ’ Trade', 'korean', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Solidarity', 'South Korea', 'Melgarejo Bastos', 'american', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Lee Jin - ock', 'Korea Womens ’ Political Solidarity', 'director“Korean', 'Jung - wha', 'Corea Image Communications Institute', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies“Korea', 'Korea', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'France', 'Korea', 'France', 'Sung - min', 'Occupational and Environmental Health', 'Inha University Hospital', 'Lim Won - sun', 'Korean Academy of Multicultural', 'Korea', 'Silim', 'Chen', 'korean', 'korean']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5787161   0.56684816

At 6 a.m., voters started to trickle into nearly 14,000 stations across the country, braving fine dust and rain in some regions. In Gangwon Province, victims of this week’s massive forest fire resorted to booths nearby their makeshift shelters.  Voters form a long queue at a polling station in Seongbuk, northern Seoul, to cast their ballots for South Korea's presidential election on May 9, 2017. The election posted one of the highest-ever turnouts in the history of the country’s still nascent 30-year-old democracy, at 77.2 percent. And the rate speaks for itself -- voters’ zeal for change was felt on the ground. “I hope that the new president bridges the political divisions and fixes domestic and diplomatic woes. Most importantly, he has to create more jobs for young people,” said Lee Oh-sun, 72, who voted at in Songpa-gu, eastern Seoul. Park Hae-soo, 67, said the acute fine dust levels could not thwart her resolve to cast her ballot because the next five years are particularly critical given North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats.  Citizens urge lawmakers to vote for an impeachment bill against embattled President Park Geun-hye during rally in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Dec. 9, 2016. For her, Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party was deemed the best man to be a commander in chief who can ensure robust defense and no more financial aid to North Korea’s Kim Jong-un regime, with the inter-Korean Kaesong industrial park remaining shuttered.  “I voted for Hong Joon-pyo because liberal candidates would not solve the threats from North Korea‘s nuclear program,” she told The Korea Herald. “Reviving the Kaesong industrial park is not an answer especially at a time when tensions are really high as today.” Chung Yoo-young, 38, cast his ballot at a booth in Sanggye-dong in the north of the capital, where her pick, Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People’s Party, also turned up to vote.   Voters wait in line at a district polling booth in Sanggye-dong , northern Seoul, before its official opening time at 6 a.m. Despite his waning performance in recent poll results, she stood by her belief he was capable of reinvigorating the economy and bringing in jobs. “I want a candidate who is competent enough to revive the current economy. I’m not sure if Ahn will become the next president, but I like him because he seems to be focused on the economy,” Chung said. “I just want the country to be a better place.”For many South Koreans, the election instilled a sense of ownership and responsibility, as it was the culmination of six months of a peaceful grassroots movement that unseated former President Park Geun-hye. After a sweeping presidential influence-peddling scandal broke out, infuriated and disillusioned citizens took to the streets. Saturday after Saturday, as many as 2.32 million gathered across the country, pushing up the accumulated tally to 17 million.  Supporters of Presidential candidate Moon Jae-in hold out their smartphones and a magazine for Moon to sign, outside the polling station in Hongeun Middle School in Seoul on Tuesday. On Dec. 9, the National Assembly impeached Park. On March 10, the Constitutional Court confirmed the decision to oust the president.“I voted to make the country a better place for my children. I am sure my vote counts,” said Sim Eun-hee, 45, who cast her ballot in Yongsan, central Seoul, with her physically challenged husband and two children. “This is the election made possible by the public. Upholding the public sentiment, I hope society becomes fairer for all, especially for the disabled, under the new government.” The scandal and ensuing national chaos may have had a silver lining: it intrigued many youngsters previously indifferent to politics and inspired their participation, as it did for Lee Jun-myun. “I wasn’t really interested in politics until this year because of Park’s impeachment,” said the 22-year-old university student from Nowon, northern Seoul. “I can’t tell you who I voted for, but I want a president who is qualified to run this country and solve the current unemployment issue. I’m worried because I feel like I’m trapped in this unlucky generation where most of us struggle with our dreams.”Fandom and anger also served as another driver for turnout.Song Nan-young, a 34-year-old company worker, came to a polling station in Seodaemun, central Seoul, to see front-runner Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea -- on course to victory as of 10 p.m. -- after casting her own vote at 6 a.m. in her hometown of Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province. “I came here taking an hour and a half ride from my home to see him in person,” she said, showing off Moon’s autograph on her mobile phone. “I am sad that I would not be able to see him so often anymore when he goes to the presidential office tomorrow, but I am sure he will do a good job as president.”In contrast, Kim Ki-hwa, 20, said he had to take the one and only chance of being eligible to vote for the first time, expressing hopes for a better job environment especially for students of humanities majors like himself. But perhaps a bigger catalyst was Hong’s self-professed involvement in a past sex crime involving a sexual stimulant used to breed farm pigs.“Whoever is elected, I hope it won’t be Hong,” Kim said. “It’s my first time to cast a ballot, and my goal is to stop him from becoming our next president. It would be a disgrace for all to have someone as our leader who had conspired in a sex crime using a pig stimulant.” This year, ballot selfies have become a social media sensation, starting from Thursday and Friday’s early voting period. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have been flooded with photos of voters -- especially young voters -- taken outside polling booths with their hands marked with a ballot stamp. This is thanks in part to the National Election Commission’s lifting of a related ban to help boost turnout. “I took a photo of us holding hands with the stamps showing because I wanted to remember the moment. We made this election possible,” said Kong Young-hee, a 29-year-old office worker who turned up at a booth in Seongdong-gu, central Seoul, alongside the wife he married last year.

But the volunteering helped him more than he helped the handicapped, and enriched his life like no other, the president of the Israel Foundation for Handicapped Children said during an interview with Yonhap News Agency on Monday.Visiting Korea for the first time to attend the opening of the art exhibition, ""Honorary Ambassadors from Israel,"" organized by ILAN and the Embassy of Israel in Seoul, he shared how leading the organization, the country's oldest and biggest charity group to help the physically challenged, helped him change his view on life in general. Ehud Ratzabi, president of the Israel Foundation for Handicapped Children, walks with a child who is in a wheelchair. ""We have some 2,400 volunteers working on a daily basis. When I work with these people, I see a better world and better people,"" said Ratzabi, who has also been volunteering in the group since 2007. ""In a capitalist country like Korea, for example, people are working, thinking how to succeed. Success here is more money, a better car or a bigger TV. This is what you strive for. You never stop. Then you meet people here and you stop. You ask yourself, 'Wait a second. I eat only one lunch a day, not two lunches. Let's see what I can do for others,'"" the former accountant and member of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, said of how his thoughts started to change from the moment he got involved in charity work for physically challenged children and adults.Founded in 1952, the group now has 39 branches and more than 30 facilities around Israel, which include day centers, hostels, a factory that employs the disabled and sports centers. It serves the needs of about 20,000 handicapped people, with a mission to guarantee them the best quality of life possible.The art exhibition that shows paintings by physically challenged Israeli children first started at the Israeli Foreign Ministry as a one-off event, but was later turned into an overseas show to ""allow ILAN's children to become ambassadors of the State of Israel and of art."" These photos show paintings by handicapped Israeli children on display at the exhibition ""Honorary Ambassadors from Israel,"" organized by ILAN and the Embassy of Israel in Seoul. The exhibition runs from May 9-21 at the I-eum Center in central Seoul. ""Art has no boundaries and serves as a bridge for communication between people across the globe, regardless of race, religion, gender or type of disability,"" Ratzabi said, adding that ""Painting is one of the strongest means of expression available to disabled artists, and reflects their efforts to overcome the limitations of the body and to unleash their imagination and soul.""The exhibition, which opens Tuesday at the I-eum Center in central Seoul run by the Korea Disability Arts and Culture Center under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, is aimed at raising ""awareness of the needs of the disabled and their integration into society.""Before it came to Korea, the exhibit took place at the home of the British ambassador to Israel. After the Seoul show, it will travel to Ecuador. Through this exhibition, the 63-year-old hopes to seek cooperation with Korean organizations that pursue similar causes. ""There are no boundaries in disabilities. There is no question about religion or gender. Everybody can be disabled. I hope to find a way to cooperate between Israel and Korea and find a way to share our experiences. We can do that with compassion and heart.""","biggest charity group to help ,monday visiting korea for the ,oldest and biggest charity group ,oldest and biggest charity ,agency on monday visiting korea","['israeli', 'Ehud Ratzabi', 'the Israel Foundation for Handicapped Children', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Korea', 'Israel', 'ILAN', 'the Embassy of Israel', 'Seoul', 'Ehud Ratzabi', 'the Israel Foundation for Handicapped Children', 'Ratzabi', 'Korea', 'israeli', 'Knesset', 'Israel', 'israeli', 'the israeli Foreign Ministry', 'ILAN', 'the State of Israel', 'israeli', 'Israel', 'ILAN', 'the Embassy of Israel', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Ratzabi', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Disability Arts and', 'Culture Center', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism', 'Korea', 'british', 'Israel', 'Seoul', 'Ecuador', 'korean', 'Israel', 'Korea']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31053403  0.12072485

Fourteen hours, from 6 a.m., will be given to those who did not cast ballots during the two-day early voting period on Thursday and Friday. Over 26 percent of the electorate, or about 11.07 million, did so. Overall voter turnout is expected to exceed 80 percent, the highest level in recent decades.National Election Commission officials check ballot counters at a vote counting station in Seoul’s Yeongdeungpo district Monday, a day before the presidential election Tuesday. Exit polls, which were banned during advance voting, will be announced shortly after the polls close at 8 p.m. According to the National Election Commission, the counting of ballots is likely to start at around 8:30 p.m. The winner could be known as early as around 10:30 p.m.If the race turns out to be closer than expected, the victor will likely emerge after 1 a.m. on Wednesday. The determining time could be delayed even further if the gap between top vote-getters is less than 1 percentage point.Liberal candidate Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea is the favorite to win, maintaining his lead in polls throughout the 60-day election race and giving his pursuers the slip at a large margin. Moon’s support rating hovered at 40-42 percent as of May 3, while those of centrist Ahn Cheol-soo and conservative Hong Joon-pyo stood at 20-22 percent and 17-20 percent, respectively.“This election is different from past cases in which liberal and conservative voters usually halved themselves between two leading candidates,” said Kim Man-heum, chief of the Korea Academy of Politics and Leadership.He said it is still hard to predict the outcome as it remains unclear which way voters in Chungcheong, Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces will go. Moa Online researcher Yoon Tae-gon picked Jeolla provinces as a core battlefield for Moon and Ahn. “Voters in the region support Moon and Ahn. So one ballot to a candidate means two losses for the other.”While Moon is leading nationwide, excluding Daegu-North Gyeongsang Province, some observers have suggested swing voters could ultimately determine the result.Police said they would dispatch 84,000 to polling stations and ballot counting locations to prevent potential incidents.The winner will be sworn in as president of South Korea on Wednesday.

Only one person, a 62-year-old surnamed Lee, waved both the Korean and the US flags, saying he hoped Park would end up in a better house than her old one.Others were less sympathetic.“It was just so noisy around these parts after the impeachment, with the police and Park supporters,” said a 51-year-old named Choi, a 10-year resident of the area. “And because some of the supporters were violent, it was just frightening to walk through the neighborhood.

This is about to change. Starting Jan. 1 next year, all public bathrooms will be devoid of trash cans, under a revised law that passed the Cabinet on Tuesday.“We believe it’s more reasonable to distribute rapid dissolving toilet papers for public restrooms instead of trash cans which can cause hygiene issues,” said the Ministry of Interior, which proposed and drafted the revision bill on the management of public restrooms. Under the amended law, garbage cans inside all bathroom stalls for both sexes are to be removed due to issues such as poor sanitation and bad odor. Boxes will be installed for women to dispose used feminine hygiene products. “The revisions were proposed to accommodate users’ needs and convenience when using the restrooms,” added the ministry. The news drew a sigh of relief from subway commuters who frequent public bathrooms. A 22-year-old university student surnamed Lee, who regularly stops by a restroom at Jemulpo Station in Incheon every morning said, “I’m glad I don’t have to see a pile of overflowing trash just laid out for everyone to see.” The revised law also addresses other inconveniences. For instance, janitors or cleaning staff will be required to place signs in front of the entrance of bathrooms when cleaning facilities for the opposite sex. Dividers measuring 40 centimeters wide and 60 centimeters long will also be installed between urinals in men’s bathrooms.By Jung Min-kyung","dissolving toilet papers for public ,rapid dissolving toilet papers for ,rapid dissolving toilet papers ,distribute rapid dissolving toilet papers ,papers for public restrooms instead","['korean', 'Cabinet', 'the Ministry of Interior', 'Lee', 'Jemulpo Station', 'Jung Min - kyung']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50282902  0.21976453

Nearly 26 percent of them had engaged prostitutes in the past year and did so 8.46 times per year on average.The majority of men who had paid for sex, or 53.8 percent, first did so when they were aged between 20 and 24, followed by those aged 25-29 , 30-34  and those under 20  One in 4 men who have bought sex said that they did so out of curiosity.Social atmosphere also appears to be a major factor. Just over 19 percent purchased sex ahead of such “special events” as enlisting in the mandatory military service, followed by 18.3 percent after an alcohol-fueled gathering and 10.4 percent under pressure from peers. The number of establishments involved in prostitution across the nation increased from 1,858 to 1,869, compared to the last survey in 2013. But the number of sex workers declined from 5,103 in 2013 to 4,402 last year, the report showed. According to a survey of 174 sex workers, 75.6 percent of them were in their 30s. Nearly 48 percent of prostitutes first turned to prostitution in their 20s, while nearly 22 percent began as teenagers. The majority of the prostitutes said they worked for eight to 12 hours on average, their health conditions were poor and they were in debt. They took 4.7 days off a month and on average were paid 78,120 won  per transaction, down from 79,650 won in 2013. Another poll in the report showed that 61.8 percent of the surveyed 173 teenagers from troubled homes had provided sexual services to adults in return for money. Of them, 78.4 percent arranged the meetup using mobile chat applications or websites.Among the 108 websites arranging sexual exchanges, only 15.7 percent had adult verification measures to confirm those offering sexual services were not underage. Among 317 such mobile applications, 87.7 percent of them were available for anyone, regardless of an age. The reason they had turned to prostitution was because they had nowhere to go or sleep , friends asked them to  or they were under pressure from others . Nearly 88 percent received money in return for the sex. The Gender Ministry conducts the study every three years to find out Koreans’ awareness of and experience with prostitution, teenagers’ involvement in the sex industry and sex workers’ conditions. “We will toughen crackdowns on the sex trade in partnership with police by stepping up monitoring on messaging applications tricking children and young people into the sex trade and giving prize money to those who report such applications,” Gender Equality and Family Minister Kang Eun-hee said.By Ock Hyun-ju","nearly 48 percent of prostitutes ,half of korean men have ,174 sex workers 75 percent ,48 percent of prostitutes first ,sex workers 75 percent of","['korean', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Gender Equality', 'Kang Eun - hee', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32971534  0.42829821

""I want to give the people a life with a comma,"" he wrote. The Korean word for comma literally means ""rest symbol."" He added, ""We all have the right to rest. We truly work a lot.""According to Moon, a recent survey conducted ahead of a vacation season showed that more than 5,000 out of some 57,000 respondents were unable to have a summer break. Meanwhile, a labor ministry study found that the average number of vacation days was 14.2 but the average number used was 8.6, or 60.4 percent.""People couldn't rest because they neither had the time nor money,"" Moon claimed.After three public holidays next week, the nation will also rest on May 9, which has been designated a temporary public holiday for the presidential election.""With the election ahead, I'm worried about voter turnout, but I also think about whether the people will be able to get proper rest,"" Moon said. ""The next government will restore the right to rest for our hardworking people.""If elected, Moon promised to introduce more substitute holidays for when a public holiday falls on a weekend. He also pledged to provide government subsidies to encourage workers to take vacations, saying such measures could help boost local economies.Other plans include discounts on accommodation and transportation for pregnant women and parents with young children, tourism programs tailored for senior citizens, and more and improved vacation spots such as camping sites and recreational forests.""Rest leads to new production,"" Moon said.

Is it safe to ride a bicycle on downtown main streets? What if it rains unexpectedly? Can I ride in my business attire? An office worker rides a rental bike in Yeongdeungpo-gu on his way to work in the morning Despite such challenges, an increasing number of people have been turning an eye to the eco-friendly self-pedaled vehicle as a way to combine physical exercise and daily life.Lee Jin-young, a 35-year-old office worker who commutes daily from Seoul’s Yeongdeungpo-gu to downtown Jongno-gu, decided to avail himself of the city’s bike-sharing system.“The first thing I do after getting ready for work is to check on the Seoul Bikes app to confirm that there are bicycles available in the bike-sharing station nearby,” he said.Seoul Bikes, or Ttareunggi in Korean, is a bike-sharing service run by the Seoul Metropolitan Government since 2015, involving some 5,600 bicycles in 450 stations all throughout the city.The greatest merit of using the city-run system is that one may pick up a bike at one center and return it at another. The fact that most stations are located within the vicinity of subway stations or bus stops offers further convenience for users.But the given service is currently limited to 11 districts within Seoul, most of them centered on the downtown area, which is why the city government last month vowed to expand the range to 25 districts and increase the number of stations to 1,300 by the end of the year.“Actually, these stations are usually sufficiently stocked, especially in the early morning commuting hours, so the checkup isn’t all that necessary,” Lee said, unlocking one of the bikes.“But to me, turning on the Seoul Bikes app has become just another daily routine, much like opening one of the public transport apps to see when the next bus is coming.”Lee is a member of online community Jachulsa -- an abbreviation for “people who commute by bicycle” -- where he shares information on bicycle models, safety gear and bikeways across the nation.His favorite course is riding along the Han River for as long as possible -- in his case, up to the Hangang Bridge connecting Noryangjin and Yongsan -- before rolling into the crowded downtown streets.The round-trip bike journing, taking almost two hours every day, may at first seem a burden, but in in fact is a more practical option considering the time and trouble taken to go to the gym on a daily basis, according to the enthusiast.Some prefer to ride their own bike, either due to lack of a nearby bike station or preference for certain specifications.“I’ve always been fond of bikes and used to ride one to work while working in the province as a military judicial officer, but downtown Seoul is not exactly an ideal place for bikes,” said Lee Il, a lawyer working near Anguk Station, central Seoul.As a full-time worker and father of two children, Lee earlier decided that the most realistic way to stay fit was to use his commuting hours for biking, but his plan was soon thwarted by the traffic environment around Gwanghwamun and City Hall.“I couldn’t help feeling threatened by the large, quick-tempered buses on the road, but I wasn’t about to give up completely on my bike riding plan,” he said.Lee indeed has reason to be concerned -- the number of Seoul’s traffic accidents involving bicycles totaled 4,062 in 2015, up 70 percent from 2011. Of those, 22 resulted in the biker’s death, mostly due to crashes involving automobiles.“This is why I recently ordered an electronic bicycle, hoping to enjoy my ride in full leisure when I can and move ahead fast when faced by a pressing traffic situation,” he added.“With the fast growth of the electronic vehicle market, along with the public’s persisting interest in health issues, electronic bikes will soon rise as a practical and stylish means of commuting transport.“Lee said that another advantage of an electric bike is that the user may choose the automatic drive mode in the morning so as to avoid sweating on the way to work and later switch over to manual mode in the evening for exercise.By Bae Hyun-jung","his commuting hours for biking ,seoul traffic accidents involving bicycles ,heavy monthly allowance on taxi ,office worker rides rental bike ,daily through the traffic jammed","['Lee Jin - young', 'Seoul ’s Yeongdeungpo - gu', 'Jongno - gu', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Bikes', 'Ttareunggi', 'Korean', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Jachulsa', 'Hangang Bridge', 'Noryangjin', 'Yongsan', 'Seoul', 'Lee Il', 'Anguk Station', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18333955  0.33195239

It is not mandatory to donate in order to take part in the event. The first prize winner could receive up to 5 million won  depending on the volume of donations.

Her mother would pack her luggage, saying her parents were waiting for her to come home. The symptoms gradually worsened, until Yang had to feed her mother and change her diaper every hour.“I thought she was just becoming old,” Yang told The Korea Herald.Like Yang, about one quarter of dementia patients miss the opportunity to receive timely treatment and care because they are unaware of the early symptoms, recent data shows.According to the study released Wednesday by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, approximately 685,000 senior citizens aged 65 or older in South Korea were suffering from dementia last year. Of these, 25 percent, or 168,000, failed to recognize the signs of their condition until they reached full-fledged dementia. The National Institute of Dementia projects that about 2.7 million people aged 65 or older will be diagnosed with dementia by 2050. The figure would be about 15 percent of the age group. Senile dementia is caused by various factors, but the most common is Alzheimer’s disease.But, awareness for early screening for dementia is very low here.A separate survey by the Korean Senior Citizens’ Association found that 65 percent of seniors were unaware the National Health Insurance covered dementia tests. Of the surveyed 1,000 seniors, 54 percent said that they did not know that they could be tested for senile dementia at some 255 public health centers across the nation.While awareness remains low among seniors, experts say early detection is the best way to prevent dementia.“There is no major progress  A lot of families get discouraged as it does more than cause a single person to suffer,” said Kim Yoo-jung, an official from the National Institute of Dementia.“That is why it is important to detect the symptoms early, but many mistake early signs of dementia as part of the aging process,” she added.Kim said there is an urgent need for the government to help families who suffer the burden of caring with insufficient state support. With the number of dementia patients rising, the government released in 2015 a set of comprehensive plans to reduce the financial burden for caregivers.“Dementia is different from many other diseases in that it requires long-term care and affects the patient‘s entire family,” said Lee Jae-yong, an official in charge of elderly policies at the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Earlier this month, the Health Ministry announced a plan to run the country’s first villages reserved for people suffering from dementia and their families. Three designated villages will open in May, in an aim to create a community where dementia sufferers and their families can live safely without leaving society and becoming isolated, the ministry said.By Kim Da-sol","mother became confused and delusional ,quarter of dementia patients miss ,change her diaper every hour ,dementia patients miss the opportunity ,suffering from dementia last year","['Yang Min - ju', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'the Korea Herald', 'Yang', 'the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service', 'South Korea', 'the National Institute of Dementia', 'Korean', 'Citizens ’ Association', 'the National Health Insurance', 'Kim Yoo - jung', 'the National Institute of Dementia', 'Kim', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Health Ministry', 'Kim Da - sol']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.13335061  0.29256657

Moon noted many firms assign employees they wish to get rid of to meaningless or impossible jobs, forcing them to volunteer for retirement.The presidential nominee said he will work to prohibit such assignments in the first place, and also require the management to acquire the approval of union leaders when laying off a certain number of workers or more under a voluntary retirement program.Moon said he will also allow those aged 50 years or older to demand their employers cut their working hours, so they can prepare for life after retirement.Those who experience a reduction in income following a change of his or her job will be provided up to 50 percent of the difference between wages from their old and new jobs for up to three years, he said, while speaking in a press conference at his party headquarters in Seoul.""The most important issue for the new middle-aged class is to keep their jobs. Protecting their jobs is to protect their families,"" Moon said at the press conference.He also promised additional benefits to self-employed entrepreneurs, noting that 55 percent of all self-employed people are currently in their 50s and 60s, and also suggesting many may have started running their own businesses after retiring from salaried jobs.The presidential candidate said he will, if elected, provide up to 4 trillion won  in various financial benefits to people through special vouchers that can only be spent at small, non-franchise shops.He also promised to lower college tuition by half.""Many of our family heads spend sleepless nights, concerned about ways to pay for their children's tuition and the cost of weddings. We may not be able to solve all their problems, but the country must work to relieve at least some of the burden,"" he said.Moon said he will inject an additional 500 billion won a year to halve college tuition from the current level.","volunteer for retirement the presidential ,presidential front runner moon jae ,press conference at his party ,jobs the presidential candidate ,wednesday promised to help enhance","['Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Moon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.86580598  0.60018319

Moon Jae-in , the presidential candidate of the liberal Democratic Party, rallies support in the upcoming presidential election while staging a campaign event in downtown Seoul on April 17, 2017. Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party remained in a distant third with an approval rating of less than 10 percent.And with less than three weeks left until the election, the two leading candidates seem only intent on taking a chunk of the other's share of votes.Unfortunately, however, they are each other's worst enemy as they once shared the same boat.Ahn, an IT millionaire-turned-politician, even dropped out of a party primary for the 2007 presidential election, giving his blessing to Moon, who went on to face and lose to the then conservative opponent Park Geun-hye.Ahn, now the presidential candidate of the center-left People's Party, defected from Moon's liberal Democratic Party only last year, meaning he may know everything there is to know about his liberal contender in the upcoming election.""Not all regime changes are the same. We must aim for a better regime change,"" Ahn said while electioneering in Seoul on Monday, accusing Moon of long flexing factional power within his own party.""We must not entrust the country again to a factional power.  is serving only his own interests by dividing the people,"" he added.Moon, on the other hand, has flatly accused his former ally of taking sides with conservative forces responsible for the massive corruption scandal that led to the March 10 ouster of former President Park Geun-hye.The presidential front-runner has repeatedly insisted Ahn's victory in the presidential election will only mean a revival of the former administration, citing Ahn's recent offer to consider giving a special pardon to the ousted former president, who was formally indicted this week while in jail.""The upcoming presidential election is really a match between candlelight vigils and the corrupt old power,"" Moon has said.The former opposition leader also argues Ahn has no choice but to ally with such corrupt conservative forces to win the election and also to run the government after being elected, noting his opponent's People's Party controls less than 40 seats in the 299-seat National Assembly.""How could a small, makeshift party with less than 40 lawmakers ever be able to run the government in a crisis such as now,"" Moon said Monday, the first of a 22-day official electioneering period before the May 9 election.The Democratic Party currently has 119 seats, the largest number controlled by a single political party.Still, Ahn has insisted the party's 119 seats will prove useless due to Moon's interest in his own small faction.The two are also increasingly engaging each other in an apparent character debate.Ahn's People's Party, along with the former ruling Liberty Korea Party, was the first to open fire, persistently raising allegations over the employment of Moon's son at the state-run Employment Information Service in late 2006, while Moon was serving as a senior presidential secretary.Moon and his party gave Ahn a taste of the latter's own medicine, raising questions about the 2011 employment of Ahn's wife as a professor at Seoul National University.So far, the two have met in at least two rounds of TV debates.No serious duel has taken place so far as the TV debates also involved three other contenders -- Hong of the Liberty Korea Party, Rep. Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party and Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the splinter conservative Baren Party.At least four more TV debates, including three sponsored by the National Election Commission, are scheduled before the election.","electioneering in seoul on monday ,jail the upcoming presidential election ,to exchange vicious attacks tuesday ,upcoming presidential election is really ,upcoming presidential election while staging","['Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party', 'Seoul', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hye', ""People 's Party"", 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Park Geun', 'Ahn', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Ahn', ""People 's Party"", 'National Assembly', 'Moon', 'the Democratic Party', 'Ahn', 'Moon', ""People 's Party"", 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Moon', 'Employment Information Service', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Seoul National University', 'the Liberty Korea Party', 'Sim Sang - jeung', 'Justice Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Baren Party', 'the National Election Commission']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.77458692  0.24662489

""I will actively expand the increase to an annual average of 7 percent,"" he said at a press conference on his economic policies.Moon did not specify how much such an increase will amount to in additional spending, but said an additional 50 trillion won  will come from a natural rise in tax revenues over a five-year period.The additional money, along with a greater part of the existing budget, will go to the people instead of businesses, as they often did in under past administrations, he said.""Up until now, economic policies have centered on providing everything the country had to companies. We hoped such investment in companies would trickle down as benefits to workers and people,"" Moon said.""But limits of such policies have been identified. I will change the order. I will change the economic structure to one centered on the people, in which the government will invest in people, who will then improve the competitiveness of companies and the country,"" he added.Such efforts will include fresh and increased investment in 10 major areas that include the fourth industrial revolution and the social services sector.The investment will help create more than 500,000 new jobs per year over the next five years, he insisted.While meeting with members of the American Chamber of Commerce and the European Chamber of Commerce in Korea later, the presidential front-runner said he will create 810,000 new jobs in the public sector alone.""People-oriented growth starts with creating quality jobs. I will help boost the people's income by creating quality jobs.

Ahn Cheol-soo, presidential candidate of the People's Party, on Tuesday vowed to promote the independent management of private kindergartens, calling for restraints upon large public ones.His remark instantly ignited a backlash from parents here as it contradicted his past gesture to expand state-led childcare, as well as the public notion that a lack of state and social support in child-raising is a core reason behind the country's low birthrates. Ahn Cheol-soo speaks during a gathering of kindergarten teachers at Olympic Park in eastern Seoul on April 11, 2017. “I will curb additional establishments of large kindergartens which are annexed ,” said Ahn Tuesday in a conference for children educators.“As for private kindergartens, I shall guarantee their independence and acknowledge their respective operation policies according to facilities.”But such a move to regulate public kindergartens came under fire, not only for the current lack of state-backed daycare institutions but also for his apparent change of stance.Back in 2014, when Ahn was co-chief of the then-main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy along with his current election rival Moon Jae-in, Ahn had steered the party’s campaign for the June local elections. Of the top 10 key pledges was a plan to expand the number of public kindergartens and to promote government-led childcare.Also, his suggestion of boosting independence for private kindergartens was largely seen as a contradiction to the metropolitan government’s policies. Pressed by calls for more public kindergartens, Seoul City has been struggling to add state funds or a public monitoring system even in private institutions, a compromising move to balance autonomy and public interests.“Those working in private schools and kindergartens are crucial factors in  public education policies,” the presidential aspirant said.“But no sufficient support has yet been provided to revise the related laws and systems.”Amid the burgeoning disputes on the issue, Ahn explained himself later on, claiming that he did not mean to suppress the establishment of public kindergartens.“What I meant was that I will control the number of large annexed kindergartens, not that I will cut down that of public kindergartens,” he wrote on his Facebook account.By Bae Hyun-jung","people party on tuesday vowed ,private kindergartens calling for restraints ,calls for more public kindergartens ,boosting independence for private kindergartens ,instantly ignited backlash from parents","['Ahn Cheol', ""the People 's Party"", 'Seoul', 'Ahn Tuesday', 'Ahn', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn', 'Seoul City', 'Ahn', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",17,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.19185786  0.52429962

Despite his support, it took more than a decade to finally be able to call South Korea her home.From the language barrier and spicy food to the country’s patriarchal values, the 47-year-old, who did not want to use her real name, faced challenges every step of the way to adjust to life here, some 2,600 kilometers away from her family and friends in the Philippines.“As I started to live with my husband’s family, I found it difficult to prepare food on traditional holidays and for Confucian ancestral rites. Unlike men in my home country, Korean men didn’t give a helping hand in cooking or washing dishes,” Maria said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I could not even cope with Korean food, so I lived on eggs.”“The most difficult thing is, of course, loneliness. I could not speak the language. I had no friends. There were not many Filipina wives back in 2000,” said Maria, who lives with her husband and two children in northern Seoul. Her personal experience led her to apply for a job at Danuri Helpline -- a hotline mostly for foreign wives married to Korean men -- in 2006. She is one of the 99 counsellors at the hotline operated by the Korean Institute for Healthy Family. The hotline provides translation and counselling services, and information on things ranging from Korean language programs and job opportunities to visas and government support. It also provides emergency aid and shelters for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The counsellors at the state-run agency are foreign-born wives who have lived in South Korea for more than three years. They take calls from women from their countries of origin and offer services in 13 languages including Chinese, Vietnamese and English.According to data from the Interior Ministry, the number of foreign-born spouses stood at 238,161 in 2015. The biggest group were ethnic Koreans with Chinese nationality, followed by Chinese, Vietnam, Filipinos, Japanese and Cambodians, the data showed. Maria, who has offered services in Tagalog and English for 12 years now, said that she takes all kinds of calls. Some ask for simple translations between Korean and their languages. Others seek information on what to do in response to the outbreak of a contagious disease, earthquake and North Korea’s launch of missiles into East Sea. There are also foreign wives seeking tips on where to find their favorite fruit from home, how to find lost belongings, how to apply for refugee status and how to begin a divorce process. “Recently, I began to get more calls from Americans who had been sexually assaulted,” said Maria. “Until 2014, I got more calls from Filipinos coerced into selling sex at the US military bases. And those looking for their Korean husbands who abandoned them in the Philippines.”In 2016 alone, Danuri Helpline gave counselling to 124,401 people through phone, face-to-face interviews or visits. The majority of their inquiries last year were about family conflicts , followed by information on daily life in Korea  and domestic and sexual abuse . A 32-year-old Cambodian woman, who only wanted to be identified by her surname Lee, was one of those who turned to Danuri Helpline for help in seeking a divorce. She only found out about her husband’s mental disability after arriving in Korea. The center matched her with a lawyer.“I first got help from the center for interpretation to solve family conflicts in 2013. I could not communicate well with my husband and his family here,” said Lee, who got a divorce in February. “They hurled swear words at me. They forced me to work.”Lee, who has to raise three children without a job or income, is now in the process of claiming childrearing expenses from her husband through a government agency. “It is rewarding to help people like me to adjust to life here and not to go through the same hardships I experienced,” Maria said. For migrant spouses, however, life still has challenges even after they get used to Korean culture and the long-distance relationship with their family back home, she said. “Things have improved for migrants here, but there is still tendency of Koreans to look down on people from Southeast Asia. They appear to think we are poor and came here for money,” she said. “I just hope that I can contribute to making Korea more embracing and understanding of foreigners -- the country my children will live in.”Counselors from Russia, China, Vietnam, Mongolia and the Philippines pose for a photo at the headquarters of Danuri Helpline, run by the Korean Institute for Healthy Family, in western Seoul. Migrant women who need help can call the Danuri Hotline at 1577-1366. It is available round-the-clock, 365 days a year. The services are available in 13 languages: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Russian, Thai, Mongolian, Lao, Uzbek, Nepali, Khmer and English. They can also visit the Danuri Helpline’s offices for help. Its headquarters is in Seoul and branches in six cities -- Suwon, Daejeon, Gwangju, Busan, Gumi and Jeonju -- which are only open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the week.

The intensifying battle for the top elected office has somewhat blurred the line between vetting and downright mudslinging, giving rise to a legal tit-for-tat.On Friday, Moon's camp pressed charges against a lawmaker of the conservative Liberty Korea Party for spreading what it said were false rumors that the candidate's son received special favors to land a job at the state-run Korea Employment Information Service in 2006. Moon, who was then the senior presidential secretary for political affairs, has repeatedly denied the charges by citing a labor ministry investigation that found no wrongdoing in the hiring process.The lawmaker Shim Jae-chul vowed to respond in kind through legal action.The allegations took on a new dimension this week when another lawmaker, this time of the splinter conservative Bareun Party, claimed there was a separate ""final report"" on the labor ministry's investigation. Ha Tae-keung earlier argued that although the investigation failed to verify the alleged special treatment, the labor ministry took issue with the way the job opening was announced and imposed disciplinary measures on officials of the employment service center who were involved. ""We urge Rep. Ha to now throw away his recorder that keeps blasting fake news,"" Moon's public relations chief Park Kwang-on said during a press briefing Monday. ""We plan to take legal steps against Rep. Ha shortly.""The ongoing wrangling over the alleged special treatment apparently dealt a blow to Moon's approval ratings. In a Korea Research Center survey published Sunday, Ahn overtook Moon for the first time in a hypothetical five-way race, with 36.8 percent against Moon's 32.7 percent.The center-left lawmaker has been dealing with his own set of negative allegations.The latest headache centers on charges his wife gave birth to their daughter in the United States to enable her to win US citizenship, that she holds dual citizenship there and here, and that she studied abroad in lavish conditions.Ahn's campaign rejected the allegations, saying his daughter only holds South Korean citizenship, and filed a formal complaint with the prosecution Monday.""Spreading false rumors on the Internet about Seol-hee constitutes a clear violation of communications and election laws,"" Kim Kyung-jin, chief spokesman of Ahn's party, said in a statement. ""We have pressed charges against  involved.""Experts attributed the growth of negative campaigning to its disproportionate influence on voter sentiment.""It's an inevitable aspect of elections,"" said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul's Myongji University. ""This is just a preview as each party will start coming out with their revelations next week.""Yoo Yong-hwa of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies agreed that the public tends to react sensitively to such negative allegations.""Unlike in the past, it's hard not to engage in negative campaigning because with advances in the Internet, once  spread online, everyone believes them,"" he said. ""It'll just become more intense.

The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said Thursday that a wild pollack, locally called “myeongtae,” was caught in eastern waters near Uljin, North Gyeongsang Province. The fish, procured through a net installed 100 meters underwater, was 56 centimeters long, a tad smaller in size than its typical 61 centimeters. It was transported live to a research facility under the National Institute of Fisheries Science for further inspection.Wild pollack caught in waters off Uljin, North Gyeongsang Province The government has been running a recovery project worth 24.8 billion won  since 2014 to invigorate the South Korean pollack population. A crucial part of the project was releasing 1,000 fry, or juvenile fish, into the wild in the waters adjacent to the coastal city of Sokcho, Gangwon Province, last June. The fry had labels attached to their dorsal fins to distinguish them from wild shoal. There were no signs of any labels on the fish caught Thursday. Experts blame global warming along with ruthless overfishing for the decline of the pollack population in South Korea, which according to data released by the Japanese Government General of Korea, took up 14.9 percent of Korea’s entire seafood market in 1942. Currently, approximately 90 percent of pollack consumed in Korea is imported from either Russia or Japan.A poster designed to promote the search for Pollacks in South Korean waters. Pollack is considered the James Bond of Korean seafood due to a wide spectrum of identities and names that follow both underwater and on the dinner tables. There are at least 28 different variations that derive from the Korean term “myeongtae,” based on the processing method, location and size of the fish. Pollack caught fresh after spawning season are called “kkeoktae,” those caught in waters near Gangwon Province are dubbed “gangtae” and fry between the size of 20 and 25 centimeters are “nogari.”Regarding its state of preservation, pollack dried under special conditions are labeled “hwangtae,” while freeze-dried ones are “dongtae” and the fully dried are “bookuh,” which is often used as a base ingredient for “hangover soup.”The list goes on, as Koreans’ affection and longing for the fish -- and various dishes made from it -- has even bestowed it a fairly new moniker: “geumtae,” meaning “golden pollack” for its scarcity. Folk rock star Kang San-ae took it to the next level and named a song after the fish in the early ‘90s. The number is a witty serenade with lyrics that praise the beauty of its versatility, taste and charming nicknames. “You become my blood and flesh, too soft and delicious ... there is nothing to waste,” Kang sings. Last September, a research facility under the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries that focuses on the habitat of the East Sea successfully developed a technique that could farm breed the fish. The chief manager of the project, 52-year-old Dr. Byun Soon-gyu, has been called by his colleagues “Myungtae Daddy” for his contributions and dedication to the project. In an interview with a local media outlet, Byun explained the project faced several difficulties due to the scarcity and sensitive nature of wild pollack. “The research started in the mid-2000s, but there was no progress due to its scarcity. Besides, problems continued even after we procured the subjects -- the fish would die from stress and wounds despite our efforts to provide the best environment.”The project gained traction in 2015 following the procurement of a healthy female specimen that was able to provide 530,000 fertilized eggs. Now, the facility is a home to 500 fully matured pollack and 50,000 fry.“We are expecting that households in Korea will finally be able to enjoy foods cooked from local pollack by 2020,” said the institute.By Jung Min-kyung","the fish caught thursday experts ,fish caught thursday experts blame ,fish caught thursday experts ,the fish caught thursday ,province last june the fry","['South Korea ’s', 'the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries', 'Uljin', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the National Institute of Fisheries Science', 'Uljin', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'south korean', 'Sokcho', 'Gangwon Province', 'South Korea', 'the japanese Government General', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Pollack', 'James Bond', 'korean', 'korean', 'Gangwon Province', 'Koreans', 'Kang San -', 'Kang', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Byun soon - gyu', 'Byun', 'Korea', 'Jung Min - kyung']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53577989  0.36023006

For the progressive left’s flag-bearer Rep. Sim Sang-jeung, however, the upcoming May 9 election is about more than just victory or a turnover of power. Despite a relatively low chance of winning, Sim is committed to freshening the political climate by emboldening reform-minded voters and harnessing society’s zeal for responsible, more trustworthy politics. “I will not drop out from the race nor join hands with other opposition runners for a unified single candidacy. I will finish the race no matter what,” Sim of the Justice Party told The Korea Herald at her office in the National Assembly in Seoul. Sim, 58, said her third attempt for the presidency is different in many aspects. The party has managed to shake off the label as “North Korea sympathizers,” while upgrading its security and socioeconomic policies in a more practical manner so as to represent the average citizens interests. Rep. Sim Sang-jeungShe was defeated in the party’s 2008 primary and dropped out of the 2012 election to endorse the then main opposition party’s candidate, Moon Jae-in, who lost to now-impeached former President Park Geun-hye by a slim margin.“The progressive politics we pursue is to compete for responsibility, not radicalism or boldness. I’m running because I think it is about time for our party to govern,” Sim said. “Therefore, it’s virtually my first presidential bid.” This year’s early election, slated for May 9, is taking shape through a more unconventional chain of events, triggered by the ouster of former President Park over a massive bribery scandal involving her longtime friend, presidential aides and business conglomerates.    The Justice Party, despite being the first to push for Park’s impeachment as its official platform, is struggling to boost its popularity amid the post-impeachment whirlwind that shone a spotlight on the liberal frontrunner Moon of the Democratic Party of Korea.  To stay relevant in the race, the former labor activist said her campaign will focus on bringing back what she described as “shy progressives,” who actually have progressive inclinations but have voted for mainstream parties out of fear that their ballots are discounted. “It had been difficult for us to convince ‘shy progressives’ to return to our base. Although they believed in our value in theory, they chose not to join us in reality. But I think it is time for them to return and once they return, they would never go back again.”“Currently, the voters feel very strongly about the need for change, and they are drawn to parties and candidates who can achieve it in a short period. I think there is doubt how far the Democratic Party could go. So our mandate is to prove to the people that we can deliver.”Rep. Sim Sang-jeungSim’s Justice Party is the only political entity to publicly advocate for the right of minority groups such as homosexuals, labor unions, women, and even animals. She has put forward various legislations aiming to protect the minority. Among the most popular one is “anti-discrimination law,” which aims to ban any form of discrimination against the people based on race, gender, age and sexual orientation and among others. But the bill failed to clear legislative hurdles as some lawmakers opposed it, saying it would encourage homosexuals. Despite legislative failure, Sim vowed to push the agenda. Her campaign incorporated the enactment of an “anti-discrimination law” into their election pledge and pledged to enact a bill that allows gay couples to register as legitimate couples. “The anti-discrimination law is the basic law for a country who values democracy and human rights. I don’t think it is right for me to give up on the bill simply because I could lose votes. It’s an issue that goes beyond political calculation. It’s about responsibility of a country.”While acknowledging that her party was branded as pro-North in the past, which she argues is an antiquated stereotype established by ultra-conservative groups, Sim made it clear that her party has moved beyond it.“When it comes to North Korea issues, I think we have turned a new leaf,” she said, stressing her landslide victory in the 2016 general election in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, which nears the border with North Korea. “I think there was an internal reason for us failing to become a mainstream party. There was a robust party overhaul to allow the party to take the rational and principled platform. There are some who place such a label on us, but I think we have moved beyond that.”Yet Sim pointed out that many former South Korean leaders, whether they are liberals and conservatives, leaned toward the US too much without a shrewd strategy to find a balance between regional powers. Despite its security reliance, Seoul needs to speak out against the US over controversial issues, such as the decision to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system battery here, she said. “I was often told that you should never say something negative about the US if you want to become a successful politician in the US. But I don’t agree with that. You shouldn’t become a president if you can’t say ‘No’ to the US,” she said. Rep. Sim Sang-jeungHaving devoted 25 years of her life to the labor movement, she was on the wanted list for the longest time among female politicians. From 1984 and 1993, she was on the run for leading the campaign to form labor unions, which was illegal in the 80s when authoritarian leaders ruled South Korea. Such a track record prompted her supports and pundits to refer to Sim under different names. Those who focus on her activist side prefer to call “Sim d’arc,” named after Jeanne d‘Arc. Others describe her as “Sim-vely,” a combination of her last name and a syllable of the word “lovely” to highlight her personal charm. Sim now wants to add a new nickname to the list: Angela Markel of South Korea. Just as the German Chancellor reached across the aisle to build a coalition government, the only female presidential candidate vowed to create a political landscape where dissenting voices are respected. “The failure of former President Park Geun-hye should not translate into the failure of female politicians... I am now focusing on Chancellor Markel, who can negotiate a deal without compromising her political conviction. I think that is the kind of leadership required of South Korea,” Sim said.

Is the international community doing anything about it? ... Kim Jong-un wants to set a precedent that the international community does not,"" Bruce Bennett, a senior researcher at US think tank Rand Corporation, said in a lecture in Seoul.Bruce Bennett, a senior researcher at US Last month, Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of the North Korean leader was murdered in Kuala Lumpur International Airport after two women rubbed the lethal chemical on his face. The Malaysian police later concluded several North Korean men, including a Malaysian-based diplomat, were behind the killing.Over one month following the killing, however, the international community has yet to take concerted action to punish the regime for the use of the chemical classified as a weapon of mass destruction. Bennett said North Korea does not consider the use of chemical weapons as WMD. ""They believe it's a conventional weapon. That's a big thing to recognize.""For that reason, he said, ""We need to be trying to establish it in the international community. We should be clearly pushing an action on the use of VX.""""We need to be setting a precedent that this is unacceptable in the international community,"" Bennett stressed in the lecture focused on North Korean security challenges. Drawing on a growing South Korea-China diplomatic feud over Seoul's deployment of an advanced anti-missile system known as THAAD, the senior researcher said that the Asian power is trying to tame the bilateral relationship.""China's objective with THAAD is not just prevent THAAD deployment. I think it has longer-term influence kind of approach that they are trying to develop a precedent that if we tell Korea to do something, Korea realizes it's going to be too costly if it doesn't do that."" ""China's whole point of putting pressure on THAAD is to demonstrate to everyone around the world that there will be a price to pay if they choose to cause problems for China,"" he said. Over the past months since South Korea and the US officially decided to bring in the missile interceptor to deter North Korea's nuclear and missile threats in mid-2016, China has taken a series of crushing economic retaliations against Seoul, demanding the withdrawal of the deployment which Beijing says seriously compromises its security interests.Bennett also said North Korea is believed to be in possession of as many as 50 nuclear weapons as of now, indicating that North Korea's increased nuclear threats demand a different policy approach from South Korea and the US. Former US President Barack Obama had been against the use of nuclear weapons in any case, but, Bennett said, ""I don't think the  Trump administration has the same kind of approach"" although exactly what Trump's North Korea policy would be is still unknown.","north korean leader was murdered ,korean leader was murdered ,crushing economic retaliations against seoul ,korean leader was murdered in ,to deter north korea nuclear","[""North Korea 's"", 'VX', 'US', 'Malaysia', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Bruce Bennett', 'US', 'Rand Corporation', 'Seoul', 'Bruce Bennett', 'US', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'malaysian', 'north korean', 'Malaysian', 'Bennett', 'North Korea', 'VX.""""We', 'Bennett', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'asian', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'US', ""North Korea 's"", 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Bennett', 'North Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Barack Obama', 'Bennett', 'trump', 'Trump', 'North Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78806353  0.30132863

Only one-third of respondents said they supported such a scheme.A majority of respondents on internet portals said the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, if achieved, should not alter the five-year tenure of the next president, who will be selected on May 9.Though the SBS poll was conducted on March 11-12, before the three parties unveiled their plan, it seems the three parties will have difficulty persuading the people even after they propose an amendment bill.The three are the Liberty Korea Party, People’s Party and Bareun Party.Supporters, including the three parties, say the terms of the president and lawmakers should coincide to maximize administrative efficiency.They claim the year 2020 would be a good time to elect the president and the National Assembly simultaneously, both of whose terms would expire in 2024.Liberty Korea Party floor leader Chung Woo-taik criticized the Democratic Party’s powerful presidential contender Moon Jae-in, who is one of few opponents of a constitutional revision at the current stage.Chung on Thursday refuted Moon’s earlier remarks that “the three parties’ move is to defy the people’s sovereignty.”He cited a constitutional clause, that stipulates that “the people entrust the National Assembly with the authority to amend the Constitution.”Other presidential hopefuls are likely to continue to target Moon, who has maintained the No. 1 position in terms of support, by highlighting the side effects of “imperial presidents,” a term many critics have used, under the single-term, five year presidency.While there remains less than 55 days before the presidential election, the Assembly should undergo four procedures for an amendment.The four steps are proposal by a majority of lawmakers, deliberation, Assembly passage by a two-thirds majority, and a majority approval in a referendum.There is no time limit for the second step.By Kim Yon-se","next president term to three ,shorten the next president term ,next president tenure from 2022 ,days before the presidential election ,four year presidency via referendum","['the Democratic Party of Korea', 'SBS', 'Koreans', 'SBS', 'the Liberty Korea Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Bareun Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Korea Party', 'Chung Woo', 'the Democratic Party ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'Moon', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Kim Yon - se']",17,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.76033723  0.50590843

CARE, a Seoul-based animal rights group, blasted Park for not being responsible. “It is no different from abandonment that the once chief of state gives up nine Jindo dogs she herself adopted and breed,” the group said on its website Monday.The family of dogs consists of a male-female pair, which Park had received as a gift from her neighbors when she left her home in Samseong-dong for the presidential residence in 2013, and seven puppies born in January. In August 2015, the pair, named “Saerom ” and “Heemang ,” gave birth to five puppies, which were re-homed.  Former President Park Geun-hye plays with her Jindo dogs. In photos, including one posted on the Blue House’s Facebook page, the former president was seen playing with the dogs. Park moved into her Samseong-dong house on Sunday night, two days after the Constitutional Court ruled to remove her from office over her role in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal involving her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. An association of Busan-based animal welfare organizations filed a complaint against Park for abandoning her dogs. Amid growing controversy, the presidential office said it will put up the nine Jindo dogs for adoption. “We are mulling over how to put up a notice to receive applications to preserve their blood purity,” an official from the Blue House was quoted as saying.By Ock Hyun-ju","park for abandoning her dogs ,jindo dogs she herself adopted ,her dogs amid growing controversy ,nine jindo dogs for adoption ,presidential residence sunday care seoul","['Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Jindo', 'Park', 'Samseong - dong', 'Heemang', 'Park Geun', 'jindo', 'the Blue House ’s', 'Park', 'Samseong - dong', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Busan', 'Park', 'Jindo', 'the Blue House', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05484792  0.32197493

Spicer said the two sides are working to set up a meeting, but no dates and other details have been determined yet.""Planning is ongoing for a visit between President Trump and President Xi at a date to be determined. We're not ready to confirm that. We will have more details,"" Spicer said. ""It's the purpose of this meeting -- of that kind of meeting -- to help defuse tensions over North Korea and the recent deployment of a THAAD military battery to South Korea.""Any meeting between the US and Chin would necessarily cover a broad range of topics of mutual concern, he said, adding that further details will be fixed as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is set to travel to the region later this week.Earlier, the online news outlet Axios reported that Trump plans to host Xi at the Mar-a-Lago resort on April 6-7.If the plans are confirmed, Xi will be the second foreign leader to be invited to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Last month, Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Palm Beach resort after a White House summit, and they played golf together.No golf is planned during Xi's stay, Axios said.The main topics of discussions are expected to include North Korea.Trump has made it a key priority of his administration to get China to exercise more leverage as the main energy and food provider for North Korea to rein in the provocative regime. Trump has long said that North Korea is China's problem to fix. In a media interview last month, Trump said that China can solve the problem ""very easily if they want to."" He welcomed Beijing's recent decision to suspend coal imports from North Korea, but said China should put more pressure on Pyongyang.Trump had even raised questions about why the US should adhere to the ""one-China"" policy of diplomatically recognizing only Beijing, not Taiwan, when China is not helping the US with the North Korea problem, though he later promised to respect the policy.Trump and Xi could also clash over the deployment in South Korea of the US THAAD missile defense system.China has railed against the deployment, claiming that the system, especially its powerful radar, could be used to spy on the country and undermine its nuclear deterrent, despite repeated assurances from Washington that the battery is designed only to defend against North Korean threats.","media interview last month trump ,president donald trump holds summit ,interview last month trump ,his florida resort next month ,trump plans to host xi","['North Korea', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'the White House', 'White House', 'Sean Spicer', 'trump', 'Xi', 'Florida', 'Trump', 'Xi', 'Spicer', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Chin', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Axios', 'trump', 'Xi', 'Xi', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Palm Beach', 'White House', 'Xi', 'axio', 'North Korea', 'trump', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Trump', 'China', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Beijing', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Xi', 'South Korea', 'US', 'China', 'Washington', 'north korean']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.91486317  0.4915857

We also shared ideas on the revision,"" In told Yonhap News Agency after the gathering.In, however, said he did not suggest that Kim join the Liberty Korea Party during the gathering.Kim quit the Democratic Party earlier this week in a move that pundits say may ignite a realignment of centrist politicians in the lead up to the presidential election.Observers said they might have exchanged views on a constitutional revision, a divisive issue that could serve to forge a political coalition ahead of the key election. In and Kim have both called for a pre-election revision to the decades-old basic law.Discussions on revising the Constitution recently surfaced as critics claim the existing law, which grants excessive power to the president, contributed to the latest corruption scandal that terminated Park's political career.Since leaving the main opposition, Kim has been meeting with various officials from other parties, including Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the Bareun Party who is cited as a potential presidential candidate. Such meetings are seen as Kim's efforts to gather forces that can compete with Moon Jae-in, the frontrunner presidential hopeful from the Democratic Party.

Washington looks forward to a “productive relationship with whomever the people of South Korea elect to be their next president,” he said, adding the US will remain a “steadfast ally, friend, and partner” to Seoul in the face of North Korea‘s threats.Mark Toner Beijing, which has been taking economic retaliatory measures against South Korea over the plan to station the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here, blamed Park for making the decision that “affected” bilateral ties. “ did many things for the South Korea-China relationship but affected its development by making the decision to deploy THAAD,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a news briefing. He declined to comment on Park’s impeachment because it is a “domestic affair,” but displayed hopes that South Korea would “regain political stability as soon as possible.”Despite persistent historical tension between the country and South Korea, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida also echoed the US’ view, offering an upbeat outlook for future collaboration with Seoul. “Japan needs to promote cooperation with the new  government in various areas,” Kishida was quoted by Kyodo News as saying to reporters. The Constitutional Court’s decision made headlines at home and abroad, with foreign media churning out breaking news reports and predictions about South Korea’s political climate. The New York Times said that with her presidential immunity gone, Park will now face prosecutors probing into her bribery, extortion and power abuse charges, while the opposition has high chances of taking power in the next election and overhauling Seoul’s approach to North Korea and China. “Her downfall is expected to shift South Korean politics to the opposition, whose leaders want more engagement with North Korea and are wary of a major confrontation in the region,” the paper said. US-based broadcaster CNN also delivered the news swiftly, with its website covered with such headlines as “Judgment Day” and “Park Out.” The UK’s BBC said the marathon protests that ignited the impeachment campaign have sent a “strong signal” that the cozy relationship between politicians and family-run conglomerates needs to change.Japan’s TV networks such as NHK and TV Asahi, as well as Chinese state media, also conveyed the court verdict in real time. China’s official CCTV even halted its live broadcast of the National People’s Congress, one of the country’s largest annual events, to inform the public about Park’s ouster. Reporting on the decision, Xinhua and the Global Times cited criticism by opposition figures toward Park such as Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung, as well as a “tearful mother and her daughter” -- anti-Park protesters who held placards that read “No THAAD.”By Shin Hyon-hee","court ruling friday boosting hopes ,next election and overhauling seoul ,the court ruling friday boosting ,court ruling friday boosting ,korea would regain political stability","['Park Geun - hye', 'Washington', 'Japan', 'China', 'korean', 'US State Department', 'Mark Toner', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'North Korea‘s', 'Mark Toner', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'US', 'South Korea', 'China', 'chinese Foreign Ministry', 'Geng Shuang', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Kyodo News', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'the New York Times', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'China', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'US', 'CNN', 'UK', 'BBC', 'Japan ’s tv', 'NHK', 'Asahi', 'chinese', 'China', 'CCTV', 'the National People ’s Congress', 'Park', 'Xinhua', 'Global Times', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'anti - park']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75425017  0.31576917

While a majority of the public heaved a sigh of relief and expressed joy at the Constitutional Court’s decision to finalize the impeachment of the disgraced leader, a smaller group of staunch Park supporters vehemently protested. Two died of injuries while protesting. Park supporters shed tears Even before dawn, the tension was palpable near the top court in central Seoul, with the streets filled with protestors rallying for and against Park. From 7:50 a.m., Park’s loyal supporters started to chant “reject the impeachment” and began singing Korean folk songs. “I arrived here around dawn, as I was so worried that the eight justices may make a wrong decision, influenced by biased media and prosecutors,” a 63-year-old Park supporter, Shim Min-sik, told The Korea Herald. Across the street, an estimated 1,000 anti-Park protesters held placards that read “We trust in you, the Constitutional Court,” “Impeach the President” and “Send Park to prison.” When the verdict hearing commenced at 11 a.m., people on both sides of the street fixed their eyes on smartphone screens and listened closely, as the court’s acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi read the verdict for about 20 minutes. As it became clear that the court’s decision was against Park, a loud clamor “We won!” and clapping rippled through the crowd on the anti-Park side. Some shed tears of joy, shouting, “Democracy has won!”Anti-Park protesters rejoice “We are one step closer to making Korea a true democracy. The Constitutional Court’s ruling was the same as what most people had expected,” said 53-year-old Kwon Hyuk-chul, who was clapping enthusiastically. Just 100 meters away, across the street, others let out deep sighs, with a few elderly men tilting their heads and asking one another, “Did the court really say Park is expelled?”The pro-Park protestors burst into a rendition of the national anthem in tears, chanting “We are one until the end.” “I can’t believe they really impeached someone who did nothing wrong. This is complete nonsense,” a pro-Park supporter told The Korea Herald.Later at around 1 p.m., a 72-year-old man surnamed Kim was found bleeding from his head on the ground during a violent street rally in central Seoul in protest against the Constitutional Court’s decision. He was rushed to a hospital but was pronounced dead there at around 1:50 p.m., according to the police.The other man, also surnamed Kim, 60, was found unconscious at a subway station near the court at around 12:15 p.m., police said.At least 10 more have been taken to hospitals for injuries as of Friday at 5 p.m., with two of them unconscious, the police said. Pro-Park groups said that they will continue their protest, with a nonstop sit-in near the court. They also vowed to begin a signature-collecting campaign calling for Park’s reinstatement. A man is injured The nation was on high alert Friday due to the historic ruling, which decided the fate of Park’s presidency amid a sharp divide among the public over what to do with her. After the verdict was announced, acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn ordered heightened military and police vigilance to maintain public safety. Police buses line up next to the Constitutional Court Some 21,000 police officers were dispatched near the court. A dozen police buses were lined up to block access to the Constitutional Court, the Blue House and other major locations of possible clashes. The police used tear gas, at one point after the verdict, to disperse angry demonstrators.The anti-Park protesters, who have been holding candlelight vigils almost every Saturday evening since the scandal erupted in late October, gathered in Gwanghwamun Square at 7 p.m. to celebrate their victory. They said they will hold the last candlelight vigil on Saturday at 4 p.m., ending the monthslong campaign to expel Park on a high note. Chae Young-hyun, one of the lucky 24 who was invited to the courtroom in an online random selection, said he felt gratitude at being able to witness the historic scene.“I did not expect to be one of the lucky 24. I’m satisfied with the court’s decision,” said the 59-year-old teacher from South Gyeongsang Province.“Those who commit a crime must follow the verdict and get punishment. I hope today’s verdict will set a cornerstone for Korea to develop as a constitutional nation,” Chae told The Korea Herald. Children protest against former-President Park Geun-hye The Constitutional Court said Thursday that a total of 19,096 citizens applied to enter the courtroom as part of the audience to hear the final verdict on Park’s impeachment trial. A total of 24 citizens were selected randomly online.By Kim Da-sol , Bak Se-hwan Staff reporters Ock Hyun-ju, Son Ji-hyoung, Shim Woo-hyun, Jung Min-kyung contributed to this article.","protesting park supporters shed tears ,pro park protestors burst into ,won anti park protesters rejoice ,children protest against former president ,000 anti park protesters","['South Koreans', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Park', 'park', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'korean', 'Shim Min - sik', 'the Korea Herald', 'anti - park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lee Jung - mi', 'Park', 'Korea', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Kwon Hyuk', 'Park', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Kim', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Blue House', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Da - sol', 'Bak Se - hwan', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Son Ji - hyoung', 'Shim Woo - hyun', 'Jung Min - kyung']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33641869  0.26226893

Park Geun-hye has hardly attempted to reach across the aisle and explain herself to opponents and investigators.Instead, she chose to cling strongly to her loyalists -- a strategy which not only sent her approval rating to a record-low but also intensified the chronic divide among political clusters here.For such reasons, her defense often leaned toward an emotional approach, describing herself as a victim of Choi’s fraudulent practices and accusing opponents of having “underlying political intentions” against the embattled state leader.On Thursday, a day ahead of the Constitutional Court’s final judgment on Park’s impeachment, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae prolonged its silence, refraining from commenting on the possible ouster of the suspended president. Police guard the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Thursday, ahead of the final ruling Friday in President Park Geun-hye’s impeachment trial. “ is keeping watch on the upcoming result in a cool and composed manner,” said an official of the Blue House, adding that there would be no official message from Park.While a majority of the nation is hoping for the scandal-ridden president’s expulsion from power, the presidential office continued to allude at hope for the dismissal of the impeachment case, so that Park may resume state affairs.“Never during her term in office has the president violated the Constitution or any laws, which makes the impeachment trail groundless,” the official said.“We expect the Constitutional Court to make a reasonable judgment.”In contrast to what Park may think, however, a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter showed that 76.9 percent of the respondents approved of Park’s impeachment as of Wednesday, with 20.3 percent opposing it.Park’s response on what could possibly be her second last day in presidency was a reflection of her defensive moves over the past months -- sidestepping disadvantageous issues and holding out against accusations for as long as possible.The starting point was her first response on Oct. 25 last year, the day after broadcaster JTBC suggested suspicions that Park’s longtime friend Choi had meddled in presidential speeches and other key state affairs.Denial was Park’s immediate choice of action.“Choi is a personal acquaintance who helped me out in my difficult times in the past, and I have sometimes asked for her help in some of the promotional materials and speeches,” she said in a surprise apology.Claiming that Choi’s language was useful in “angling toward the public,” Park asserted that such “personal help” only lasted during the first few months of her presidency, until her secretariat was fully established.Her arguments were soon refuted by a set of evidence showing that Choi continued to have influence on state affairs for her own benefits even after those initial months, which immediately sent her approval rating to a record-low of 4 percent by early December, just before the National Assembly passed her impeachment bill.Despite the tangible blow on her reputation, Park once again relied on making emotional appeals, instead of facing the controversy head on.“Ever since I entered Cheong Wa Dae, I have cut off ties with my own family members, in fear of unsavory scandals, leaving myself in solitude,” she said in her second address to the nation on Nov. 4 last year. “It is true that I have let down my guard  as she stood beside me throughout my hardest times.”Her comments alluding to her past -- filled with tragic experiences such as the assassination of both her parents and estrangement with her younger siblings -- seemed to work on Park loyalists, while further appalling her opponents.“To think that this is what I became president for, I feel ashamed and distressed,” was parodied all around, in satire of the president’s self-pitying tone.Speaking for those feeling compassion for the president was Seo Seok-gu, a senior member of Park’s legal representative team, who frequently made news headlines with his controversial remarks.“Socrates was handed down a death sentence in jury trial and Jesus had to bear the cross. … Democracy, the rule of majority could come at risk when the majority is incited by the media,” he said during a hearing session in January.Park’s legal team also raised questions against independent counsel Park Young-soo’s team, which had led the investigation since December until closing down last week.“The special prosecutor’s team lacked political neutrality and equity from the very start,” said Yoo Yeong-ha.He had no reply to the irony that it was President Park who had appointed the independent counsel Park to his post in December, amid disputes that state prosecutors lack procedural equity.The lawyers’ words incurred ridicule for the most part, but did have the intended effect of adding fuel to the fury of Park loyalists.Since Park’s outspoken lawyers started to make their defenses at the court, the frequency as well as the intensity of the so-called “patriot” rallies have increased. The claim of the participants, mostly aged 60 and above, was that they could no longer bear the “socialist conspiracy to throw out the government.”These fervent pro-Park members were even described by outside observers such as the New York Times as being captivated by a “personality cult.”The president’s own political home has been ill at ease with such blind loyalty toward the president. The consequence was the divide of the former ruling Saenuri Party into the relatively reformative splinter Bareun Party and the conventional Saenuri, which later changed its name to the current Liberty Korea Party.Before the split, the non-Park members of the conservative camp, along with some of the pro-Park group, had suggested that the president step down voluntarily and avoid the disgrace of being impeached. Their reason was that Park had already lost her dignity while struggling to avoid the investigators’ questioning and refuting the allegations raised against her.The speculation of “disciplinary resignation” once again gained some ground last week while the court was gearing up for its final ruling.The Blue House and Park’s lawyers, however, ruled out the possibility and pledged to face the court’s judgment. This, in turn, triggered rumors that the president was confident of the court’s dismissal of her impeachment case, despite all the odds.By Bae Hyun-jung","the scandal ridden president expulsion ,had meddled in presidential speeches ,on park impeachment the presidential ,scandal ridden president expulsion from ,scandal ridden president expulsion","['Park Geun', 'Choi ’s', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Dae', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'the Blue House', 'Park', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Seo Seok - gu', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Park Young', 'Yoo Yeong - ha', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park ’s', '”these', 'the New York Times', 'Saenuri Party', 'Bareun Party', 'Saenuri', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'the Blue House', 'Park', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64256066  0.53367931

Some 50 Park sympathizers, holding baseball bats and the national flags of Korea and the US, pledged retaliation against the “forced investigation” led by independent counsel Park, while setting pictures of the 65-year-old on fire. The rallies started on Feb. 24 and lasted through the end of the month.Independent counsel Park requested police put his house under strengthened guard and ban the leaders of a President Park advocacy group from approaching the area.

The conservative camp described the occasion as a call for unity among the citizens of a nation that has been divided over the president’s impeachment. On the other hand, the opposition appealed to those in the public who have been calling for the past months to oust the state leader and establish a new power.The conservative bloc, which includes the ruling Liberty Korea Party, formerly the Saenuri Party, and its splinter Bareun Party, focused on unifying public opinion. “South Korea is currently impotent in the face of a national crisis,” the conservative ruling party’s spokesperson Rep. Kim Sung-won said in a statement. “The nation is divided into those for and those against the impeachment, with each showing strong hostility against the other.” Lawmakers from both conservative and liberal parties wave Korean flag in a ceremony celebrating the nation's Independence Movement Day at Sejong Center in Gwanghwamun, in central Seoul on Wednesday.The conservative Bareun Party also vowed to integrate national sentiment.“We should be ashamed of the ongoing division as we remember our patriotic martyrs ,” the party’s spokesperson Lee Ki-jae said.On the other hand, the liberal opposition parties reiterated their stance to push for the ouster of Park and to restructure the nation. They also strongly criticized opponents of the impeachment who use the Taegeukgi, or Korean flag, as their symbol. “The protesters against the impeachment are even using the Taegeukgi to carry out biased performances in front of the Constitutional Court. It violates the nobility of the national flag,” spokesperson Park Kyung-mi of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea said.The party said they will continue to support the impeachment of Park and the citizens who hold candles in street protests. A leading presidential candidate of the party, Moon Jae-in, is also expected to participate in Wednesday’s rally for the impeachment in Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul. “It has been almost a hundred years and citizens are still calling for a democratic republic through candlelight vigils on the streets,” said Moon. “I will make efforts to clean up the old evils in society and reform the nation through a regime change.”By Jo He-rim","street protests leading presidential candidate ,wednesday rally for the impeachment ,protests leading presidential candidate ,protests leading presidential candidate of ,street protests leading presidential","['Liberty Korea Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Bareun Party', 'South Korea', 'Kim Sung - won', 'korean', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Bareun Party', 'Lee Ki - jae', 'Park', 'korean', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park Kyung - mi', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Park', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Jo He - rim']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.59934318  0.25589195

In a written statement, the Ministry of Defense said the military had concluded the land-swap deal with Lotte Group, who handed over its golf course in the southeastern rural country of Seongju to host the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system and received a state-owned military site near Seoul in return.A blueprint of the THAAD battery Following the announcement, the ministry vowed to move up the deployment of THAAD and complete the process as soon as possible, although it did not offer a specific timeline. In November, Vincent Brooks, commander of the US Forces Korea, said the missile defense system would be deployed as early as July. “Now that we have finalized the land-swap deal, we will make various efforts to deploy the THAAD battery as soon as possible,” said the ministry’s spokesman Moon Sang-kyun. “Given that we are a month behind schedule, we will do our best to move up the timeline.”The military and Lotte Group were initially expected to sign the deal in January, but delayed the move due to the conglomerate’s concerns over its business in China. China objects to THAAD due to worries its X-band radar could be used to spy in its territory. Lotte’s board approved the deal a day earlier. On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang warned Seoul and Washington that they would face “consequences” should the deployment proceed. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up retaliatory measures against South Korean companies operating in China. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry criticized the Chinese move as “detrimental” to its economic ties with Beijing, Seoul’s biggest trading partner, on Tuesday. The ministry said it would conduct a legal review to see if the measure violates its bilateral trade agreement with China or the World Trade Organization Agreement. “In light of common understanding that we need to promote relations between Korea and China, such measure is not helpful to the bilateral relations,” said Cho June-hyuck, spokesman at the Foreign Ministry. “We will maintain our principle to take sovereign, self-defense measures.”Now that the land-swap deal is over, the Defense Ministry said, the military will kick off bilateral consultations this week to hand over the newly acquired site to the USFK, which is governed by the ROK-US Status of Forces Agreement. The bilateral process involve mapping out a battery site, setting up military facilities and carrying out inspections of the battery’s environmental impacts, which will be finished in May or June, according to the military. “There will be flexibility in the pending procedures, such as the environmental inspection. They will proceed in a simultaneous manner, so it is hard to tell exactly when each procedure will be finished,” said Moon. Meanwhile, a group of residents in Seongju who oppose the THAAD deployment pledged to protest the measure, saying they will take “legal and physical” means to scuttle the plan. As of Tuesday afternoon, there had been no reports of violence. The military has constructed barbed-wire fences around the planned THAAD battery site and dispatched security to block the protestors’ access to the site. It used choppers to deliver construction materials. Designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight after detecting the missiles with a land-based radar system, a THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, a fire control and communications unit and an AN/TPY-2 radar.

At a parliamentary briefing, the National Intelligence Service said it has concluded that four officials from the North’s State Security Ministry and two from the Foreign Ministry were involved in the Feb. 13 assassination in Malaysia, shifting from its initial view that the Reconnaissance General Bureau was the chief architect of the act. The suspects had apparently split into two groups each in charge of the poisoning and backup, and separately induced the arrested two women -- a Vietnamese and Indonesian -- before uniting in Malaysia for the murder, lawmakers said. Other participants include an employee each from Koryo Air and a state-run trading firm. “It was a case of terror directly led by the state security and foreign ministries, a state-led terror,” Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the Liberty Korea Party who chairs the parliamentary intelligence committee told reporters after the closed-door session. Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the Democratic Party of Korea said, “In light of the composition of personnel, the NIS judged that it was a systematically conducted terror by Kim Jong-un.” The agency’s assessment shored up Malaysian authorities’ interim probe results that found several North Koreans were implicated in the case, including Hyon Kwang-song, a second secretary at its embassy there, and a Koryo Air worker. They said four had fled the country shortly after the killing. The NIS said Hyon works for the State Security Ministry. But the NIS later explained it was still working to determine the prime mover behind the incident, though it did find that many State Security Ministry agents were engaged in the murder. The agency also said Kim Won-hong, the state security minister who the Unification Ministry here said early this month has been sacked, is now under arrest after incurring the young leader’s rage for having given false reports. Kim Won-hong had been deemed one of the most powerful persons in the regime, running a secret police and surveillance network across the reclusive nation. But in mid-January, he came under scrutiny from the ruling Workers’ Party’s organization and guidance department over perceived abuse of power and corruption, which led to his dismissal and demotion to a one-star general from four, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry. His sacking triggered heated speculation over a persistent power struggle between the North’s state organs.“At least five vice-ministerial officials of the ministry have also been shot to death by machine gun, and given the ongoing inspection, there are possibilities for further executions of working-level officials,” Kim Byung-kee added.

The 18-year-old -- who studied in the US before entering one of Seoul’s top foreign language high schools -- strongly objected to the practice, but was told by a school counselor that “everyone does it here.”“Teachers review what we wrote about ourselves in the format of reference letters and send them to colleges. In many cases, without changing a word,” the disgruntled student told The Korea Herald. Kim, like many fellow students at his school, is preparing for universities in the US. In South Korea, entrance into a prestigious university is often the ultimate goal of education for students, their parents and teachers. But the admissions process is fraught with irregularities that some say undermine fair competition. Admission requirements vary greatly among universities here, but the three common pillars are school records, letters of recommendation and suneung, the Korean equivalent of the US’ Scholastic Assessment Test.Although suneung has its own issues, none question its objectivity in assessing a student’s academic performance. However, school records and teacher letters are a major source of unfairness and often invite falsification, critics say. Letters of recommendation, in particular, are designed to highlight the special talents and intellect of students throughout their years in high school, which could help them stand out from others. In reality, they have more to do with falsely created character traits and made-up stories designed to enhance a student’s chances at entering a desired university. A 2014 survey found that roughly 74 percent of the high school students polled and 75 percent of the parents polled doubted the objectivity of teachers’ recommendation letters, believing they are partly based on false stories. The Ministry of Education specifies in its guidelines that teachers, or counselors, are required to write reference letters for graduating students, but it lacks concrete rules on enforcement, leaving the discretion to schools. Park Min-kyu, who went to a public high school in Seoul and applied for local universities, said that at his school it was common for teachers to not pen the letters themselves. “It is our future after all, so we don’t really object to the idea ,” he said. “Some of my classmates paid private counselors at hagwon  to have them ghostwrite the letters for them so that they could concentrate on their transcripts,” he added. On the other hand, teachers complain of the workload and the pressure of writing reference letters that would allow their students to appear more appealing to university admission officials. “A class has about 40 students and the students apply for multiple universities,” a high school teacher said. “And very often, we feel we don’t know enough about the students.” Lim Sung-ho, the head of Jongro Academy, one of the biggest hagwon chains here, said the recommendation letters place an extra burden on students who spend most of their time cramming for school exams and the suneung. “After decades of a suneung-centered admissions system, the Education Ministry and colleges suddenly emphasize the importance of extracurricular activities and reference letters in the assessment process,” he said. “Such a system may be well-rooted in countries like the United States, but we are simply not ready to embrace the change all at once.” To tackle the issue, another private institute expert argues that the government and schools should strengthen measures to monitor the objectivity of recommendation letters. “It’s widely understood that it is part of the job of teachers to give their students every advantage in the admissions process, especially when it comes to allowing ghostwriting of the recommendation letter,” said Lee Man-ki, a director at Uway Joongang Education, a Seoul-based private evaluation and test provider. In his opinion, the trend itself to review an applicant’s credentials more comprehensively through a teacher’s letter and school records is not wrong, but requires more thorough monitoring. Failing to do so would give an unfair disadvantage to applicants from families who do not have the financial resources and time to invest in reference letters, Lee warned.

212,212,[Feature] Smokers say graphic warnings on cigarette packs useless,"Sung Jong-tae, 35, a heavy smoker for the past 15 years, has tried almost everything there is to quit smoking, but his efforts have been in vain.“I am well aware, more than anybody else, of the detrimental effects of smoking, having a 3-year-old daughter at home. But still, nothing can physically help me stop smoking,” Sung told The Korea Herald.Even the recently introduced disturbing graphic warnings on cigarette ...","Sung Jong-tae, 35, a heavy smoker for the past 15 years, has tried almost everything there is to quit smoking, but his efforts have been in vain.“I am well aware, more than anybody else, of the detrimental effects of smoking, having a 3-year-old daughter at home. But still, nothing can physically help me stop smoking,” Sung told The Korea Herald.Even the recently introduced disturbing graphic warnings on cigarette packs have not helped him kick the habit.“These graphics, though quite terrifying as they are, can easily be covered with my fingers,” Sung said.“Also, I don’t really think about them when placing a cigarette in my mouth.” Cigarette packs are lined up on a shelf in a convenience store in Seoul. About half of them do not carry graphic warnings yet due to production and distribution procedures. Two months have passed since the government introduced mandatory graphic warnings as part of efforts to curb smoking, but many are questioning its effectiveness.The ministry designated in December that all cigarette packs sold here, including those sold at duty-free shops, must carry one of 10 designated full-color photos showing graphic images and warnings on the harmful effects of smoking.Some of the photos depict the body parts of smokers suffering from fatal diseases such as lung cancer, oral cancer, heart attacks and strokes. This was the first time since 1986 that the government started using visual images on cigarette packs as part of its anti-smoking campaign. Korean cigarette packs had previously only carried text warnings.But despite the government’s expectations that the altered cigarette packs would pull down the smoking rate by 4.7 percent on-year, cigarette sales early this year have already surpassed the corresponding period for last year. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the amount of cigarette packs sold hit 280 million packs in January alone, up 4.9 percent from the 267 million packs sold in the same period in 2016. Industry insiders say cigarette sales may record an upward trend in the second quarter of this year.“Following New Year’s resolutions, most smokers tend to decide to give up smoking, which lead to relatively low sales from January to March,” said an official from the country’s leading tobacco maker KT&G.;“It is the sales volume in April-June that one should really look into, in order to find the actual effect of the graphic warnings on the cigarette packs,” he added.However, smokers say the graphic warnings will not be able to help them quit.Lee Jung-nam, who runs a convenience store in the crowded district of Gwanghwamun, finds that the disturbing photos have little impact. “There seems to be little difference among smokers -- and even myself as a seller and a smoker -- when purchasing the cigarette packs with the altered design.  are not really noticeable, and many smokers already have a box case to put cigarettes inside and throw away the package right away,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “I heard that some convenience shop owners are putting papers and covers in front of shelves to hide the graphic warnings on cigarette packs,” he added.According to Lee, the disturbing photos on the packs simply results in more smokers using cigarette cases. On blogs and online communities, smokers have uploaded their brand new cigarette cases, from plastic cases to pricey leather case, actively sharing information on where to get them.According to Ebay Korea, sales of cigarette cases at e-commerce marketplace Auction rose sevenfold in January alone, compared to the same month last year. Currently, the action of hiding graphic warnings on cigarette packs on purpose cannot be punished by law. Earlier this month, 11 lawmakers including Rep. Kim Seung-hee of the ruling Liberty Korea Party proposed a revision to the National Health Promotion Act, so shops who intentionally hide graphic warnings on cigarette packs would be punished by law and fined. The ministry is also moving to revise the current regulation on the graphic warnings.“I think it is little hasty to be looking at the results of the graphic warnings attached on the cigarette packs, since products with the altered design have not even been fully distributed to stores across the country ,” said a ministry official from the national health promotion division.“Unlike sharp hikes in tobacco prices, the graphic warnings are meant to change people’s way of thinking and mindsets, which may take a longer period of time to result in an actual fall in the smoking rate.“But if necessary, the ministry will discuss the size of the graphic warnings and expand them to become more noticeable by revising the current law,” he added. For now, the graphic health warnings must be placed on the upper part of both sides of cigarette packets. The photos are required to cover more than 30 percent of both sides of each packet, the ministry said.Under the law, the graphics will be replaced every 24 months and a notice about the next 10 photos will be announced six months ahead of the replacement.

They do not hesitate to make inquiries about new make-up products or surgical procedures. For them, “I’m too old for this” is no longer an excuse.“The fact that these seniors are highly conscious of their looks and fashion shows that they are acting as independent consumers, no longer as passive parents dependent on their families,” said Kim Sook-eung, head professor for business administration for the Elderly Program at Sookmyung Women’s University’s Graduate School of Distance Learning.“They care about how others think of them or evaluate their looks and actions, so their spending is not just about money but a way to form a relationship with society,” Kim said.In terms of senior citizens, meaning those aged 65 or more, South Korea is without doubt an “aged society,” concerned over its increasing elderly population and rock-bottom birthrate.Data by the Ministry of the Interior showed that seniors accounted for 13.5 percent of the nation’s population as of the end of last year.Statistics Korea speculated that the figure would soon exceed 14 percent, the threshold for an “aged society,” the phase after an “aging society.”The demographic projection also predicts that from 2025, elderly people will make up more than 20 percent of the population, making Korea a “superaged society.”Despite these concerns, however, some point out that the very definition of “aged” should be renewed so as to embrace the prolonged life expectancy and the consequent way of life.This is also where the concept of “active seniors” emerge, constituting an interlayer between the middle-aged and the conventional silver generation.The term, established by American psychologist Bernice Neugarten, refers to the “young old” in their 60s, who are active and socially involved, instead of taking a backseat.“These active seniors are differentiated from the conventional silver generation in that they wish to hold control over their own lives, instead of relying on help,” said Kim Kyung-chul, head of the Active Senior Institute at Korea University Institute for Continuing Education. By Bae Hyun-jung","these confident beauty craving seniors ,confident beauty craving seniors ,beauty craving seniors ,confident beauty craving seniors is ,beauty craving seniors is","['Kim Sook - eung', 'the Elderly Program at', 'Sookmyung Women ’s University ’s Graduate School of Distance Learning', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'Statistics Korea', 'Korea', 'american', 'Bernice Neugarten', 'Kim Kyung - chul', 'the Active Senior Institute', 'Korea University Institute for Continuing Education']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.06496155  0.64351559

Should it decide to reinstate her, the election will be held in December as originally scheduled.This image, provided by Yonhap News TV, shows President Park Geun-hye and the main room of the Constitutional Court in Seoul. This weekend's anniversary is likely to mark a sharp contrast from the 2014 edition where a confident Park unveiled an ambitious three-year economic innovation plan and her intentions to build better ties with Pyongyang -- her legacy projects hamstrung by the political scandal.Further darkening the mood at the presidential office are political parties' raucous preparations for an early presidential poll, coupled with burgeoning rumors that Park may voluntarily resign before the court's ruling to avoid being ousted through a legal process.""Political circles appear to be spreading rumors about her possible resignation and making them a fait accompli,"" an aide to Park told Yonhap News Agency over the phone, declining to be named.""Though  in a difficult situation,  will do her best until the end.""This weekend, Park may have little time to reflect on the meaning of her past four years in office as she faces a tricky decision over whether to appear at the court to make her case in person.The court has told Park's attorneys to notify it by Sunday of whether Park will testify. It has set Monday as the date for closing arguments, which will be followed by the justices' closed-door deliberations, a process expected to take some two weeks.Some of her aides believe her oral argument to deny a string of corruption charges -- cited in the impeachment resolution -- could influence the court's judgment in her favor and help placate negative public sentiment.However, some others still argued that the president must stay away from the messy process of appearing in court and touching on the allegations of wrongdoings, which she has called a ""colossal mountain of preposterous lies.""Park has been suspected of allowing her friend Choi Soon-sil to meddle in important state affairs and extort money and favors from local conglomerates such as Samsung Group. Both have flatly denied the allegations.Park initially wanted to rebut her charges at an interview with special prosecutors looking into the scandal on Dec. 9. But the plan was scuttled after her aides accused the investigators of leaking the schedule.Observers say the probe team might not be able to question her with its initial investigation term set to end next Tuesday. The probe mandate can be extended by a month with consent from Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, but it is unclear whether Hwang will agree to the extension.""As her attendance at the court will be virtually her last card, President Park will make a prudent decision in consideration of various variables,"" Park's aide said.","fourth anniversary of her inauguration ,her last card president park ,in seoul this weekend anniversary ,anniversary falls on saturday ,first ever presidential by election","['Park Geun', ""South Korea 's"", ""the Constitutional Court 's"", 'Park', 'Yonhap News tv', 'Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Park', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Samsung Group', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'Park']",9,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.6319198  0.3443886  0.5636484]

Two front-runners vying for South Korea’s presidency are locking horns in a rare philosophical debate over the question. The spat began with a controversial remark by South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung from the liberal opposition Democratic Party of Korea about the failures of the two conservative presidents. “I think they  tried to govern well for the citizens and those from the lower part of the social ladder. But it just did not work out the way they desired,” An said Sunday, in a meeting with university students in the southern city of Busan. From left: An Hee-jung, Moon Jae-inHe went on to say that President Park, who was impeached by the parliament, may have had good intentions when she helped her friend Choi Soon-sil to raise donations for Choi’s two foundations. “ the K-Foundation and Mir Foundation may have started from good will to help prepare for the successful hosting of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics,” the liberal governor said. Both the nation’s prosecution and an independent counsel appointed to investigate the president’s scandal defined the act as an extortion of money. Park was impeached by the National Assembly in December over the abovementioned accusations and others, including one that she allowed her friend Choi to meddle in state affairs. As controversy arose over An’s remarks, the presidential hopeful sought to defend himself, saying, “My purpose was that, those with good intentions might also get into trouble if they do not follow the law and principles.” In a rare criticism of his rival, Moon Jae-in, a former chief of the Democratic Party, took issue with An’s perception of justice, saying he missed an important element of justice -- anger. “‘Rage’ is an initiating point for justice and the strong feeling against injustice is what leads to the will to uphold justice,” Moon said Monday. An responded the next day that “rage” is a dangerous feeling for a leader to have. Even the phrase, “leader’s rage” may bring bloodshed, he warned. Moon fought back Tuesday, saying the rage he meant is not directed at individuals.“The rage we feel now is not about people, but about injustice. The great will for change and reform in South Korean society is only triggered from such heated minds,” he said. An ultimately apologized and ended the debate.“What I wanted to say was that, accepting the opponent’s opinion and good will is the way to lead a productive dialogue to solve problems. I admit I went too far by giving a wrong example of a corrupted president and apologize to citizens,” he told reporters. Moon commented that An’s apology well reflects the public sentiment and that An’s remarks were misunderstood.“Because he stressed the importance of unity and integration, he may have slipped in his explaination. But I think we agree that rage does not exist for its own sake nor should it be directed at another person. It should be a source of motivation to the development of South Korea,” Moon said. The rare spat between the two liberal candidates, who have so far displayed fondness for each other even in the competition, captures where the two differ in their political philosophy and campaign strategy, observers say. An, stressing the importance of unity and accepting the opposite, has been making moves to garner support from middle-ground voters. Moon puts top priority on the reform of Korean society and a clear breakaway from the past 10 years of conservative administrations.

The figures represented growth of 9.1 percentage points for men and 4.2 percentage points for women from 10 years ago, indicating an increasing number of people shun breakfast and move further away from the government's goal of lowering the proportion of breakfast skippers in the entire adult population below 18.3 percent.People in their 20s topped the list of breakfast skipping rates with 51.1 percent for men and 46.9 percent for women.According to the survey, the breakfast skipping rate for people between the ages of 30 to 49 came to 32.4 percent and 25.6 percent for men and women, respectively, with 11.3 percent and 14.5 percent each for the 50 to 65-year-old age group.

It was only later that the victim turned out to be the alienated brother of the communist state chief.The CCTV records showed one of the two female figures who approached Kim -- a relatively young, tourist-looking woman wearing a white-colored long-sleeve T-shirt and a mini skirt.But her agile figure and sharp moves led to rampant speculations that she, as well as her partner, was a well-trained special agent dedicated to secret missions, including high-profile assassinations.It has been common for the North Korean regime to train women -- usually distinguished by their attractive looks and sociable behavior -- as special agents.Their prime role is to put the target off guard and speedily eliminate the “enemy,” often using stealthy means such as poisoned needles or close-range shooting.It was also on such backgrounds that a number of female espionage agents were caught over the past decades while in action in South Korea.This time, the two agents were determined not to miss out on their target, who has long been a subject of annoyance for their state leader.Both of them reportedly turned on Kim while he was facing the check-in kiosk for his flight for Macau, one grasping him from the back and the other spraying toxic substance onto his face.While the two aggressors fled and disappeared from view by taxi, Kim complained of severe pain, upon which he was moved to the airport’s first-aid center and then to a general hospital downtown. He died on the way.By Bae Hyn-jung","assassination of north korean leaders ,female espionage agents were caught ,spy movie featuring fugitive high ,wednesday citing selangor police chief ,missions including high profile assassinations","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'malaysian', 'Selangor', 'Abdul Samah Mat', 'the Kuala Lumpur International Airport', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'CCTV', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'Macau', 'Kim', 'Bae Hyn - jung']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13390478  0.17767985

I am glad to say that in the end we were successful in helping recover all of his money.”The company is one of a new breed of concierge services, offering help via a mobile messenger on a pay-per-service basis, a divergence from traditional concierge programs with pricey subscription fees.Another provider, Ask Ajumma, has been operating for about a year and a half and has handled over 50,000 requests in that time, according to founder Maria Lee. “A lot of times, simple tasks can become extremely complicated based on local business practices and difficult payment systems,” she said. “Our goal is to encourage global citizenry and make it easy to travel and live abroad. We help tear down the challenges of language and culture by helping to facilitate getting things done.” She soon had competition.Daniel Choi, founder of Butlers Korea, said he had been helping foreign residents with various things for a long time, including as a police interpreter from 2003. He finally decided to take the plunge and register a business in March last year.We Can Help in Korea was launched the same month by Kang and Suki French, also seeing an opportunity based on the help they had offered foreign acquaintances in Korea.“I have many foreign friends here in Korea and observed that they faced challenges performing even the simplest tasks due to the language barrier or a lack of everyday knowledge necessary for living in Korea,” said Kang, who added that foreign residents often didn’t know about many of the services that are available here.“When they use them effectively, we believe that their lives in Korea will be much easier and enjoyable.”The three companies all offer similar services, including helping with delivery, relocation and travel and arranging personal services such as house cleaning. They also provide general information, such as on hospitals and places to go.As well as expats, their customers include visitors such as tourists and businesspeople. Kang said her company had planned a vacation for a family who had not been to Korea before. “For tourists and business visitors, they often ask for concert tickets to hot shows, accommodations, transportation and items they forgot to bring on their travels,” Lee explained.Expats, on the other hand, have a more varied set of requests, including arranging services such as housekeeping, translation and pet sitting, as well as one-off tasks like renting dinnerware for large parties, private yachts and hiring magicians.  “We love helping people plan their vacations, romantic engagements and special occasions,” said Lee Delivery is also a common request for the services -- Ask Ajumma has even arranged transport for live snakes and tarantulas, and Butlers Korea has its own delivery driver. “Especially for furniture moving, like secondhand things and small furniture, because the local furniture shops are not really kind and there are communication problems, too,” said Choi, who added that online expat flea market prices were often cheaper than those in conventional shops.Butlers Korea also helps with finding somewhere to move and dealing with the new landlord, though this service is mostly kept to Gwangju, where the company is based.The services all say they will consider any request -- within the law, that is. In many cases it is a learning experience, in which they find the solutions as the problems present themselves. Case in point: holiday package holdups.“At Christmas and New Year’s, customers parents or siblings who are out of Korea send some items to Korea, but some of the packages got stuck in customs, and they sent our customers some documents that they have to submit in terms of clarifying what items and what the value is,” said Choi, who explained he helped resolve the issue so they could get their packages.Now in tax season, Choi said Butlers Korea also has an accountant available to help with returns.  Ask Ajumma and We Can Help in Korea both offer VIP subscription services, but all three companies provide one-off services, with charges arranged in advance based on a commission and the amount of work involved in fulfilling the request.But though the services are one-off, the key has been in repeat customers, they said.“Regarding pricing we try to make it reasonable and most of our support is based on per transaction,” said Lee “We never charge a customer until they are 100 percent happy with what we‘ve found.”By Paul Kerry","business practices and difficult payment ,shops butlers korea also helps ,her company had planned vacation ,to korea before for tourists ,korea also has an accountant","['US', 'USA', 'Angie Kang', 'Korea', 'korean', 'ask Ajumma', 'Maria Lee', 'Daniel Choi', 'Butlers Korea', 'Korea', 'Kang', 'Suki French', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Kang', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Lee \xa0 Delivery', 'Butlers Korea', 'Choi', 'Butlers Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Butlers Korea', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Paul Kerry']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86837912  0.3689335

His appointment came just three days after the addition of another former prosecutor to the team. Parliament has 16 lawyers on its impeachment panel to serve as the prosecution. Park was impeached by parliament in December over an influence-peddling scandal centered on her friend Choi Soon-sil. The president has persistently said the charges leveled against her are false and that she will prove her innocence in court.The court must decide by early June whether to unseat or reinstate the president. But before retiring earlier this week, Court Chief Justice Park Han-chul urged a decision by March 13 to prevent a ""distorted"" ruling following the retirement of another justice on the nine-member bench.The president's lawyers strongly resisted the setting of a deadline which they countered would prevent all evidence from being examined in detail, and hinted at a collective boycott of the trial. Park's attorneys have taken flak for trying to stall the proceedings by asking the court to summon a growing number of witnesses to testify.If Park is removed from office, South Korea is required to hold a presidential election within 60 days, with the next president taking power after being elected. If she is reinstated, the election will be held in December as originally planned, with the new president being sworn into office in late February.","to her legal team friday ,her legal team friday ,16 lawyers on its impeachment ,her legal team friday in ,impeached president park geun hye","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Wie Jae - min', 'Parliament', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Court', 'Han', 'Park', 'Park', 'South Korea']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04244955  0.24830277

Still, it is unclear whether the investigators will be able to enter the compound, as the presidential office has been reiterating its stance to deny them access, citing security concerns. State prosecutors, who handed over the case to the independent counsel last year, attempted to raid the office twice but were halted by the presidential office. The office, instead, voluntarily turned over some documents requested by the prosecutors.Under the country's law, military facilities and other areas that handle confidential information cannot be searched without approval from the person in charge of the location. Yet, the law also prohibits the person from refusing to grant such consent unless it infringes upon key national interests.The two sides are in talks over when and how to carry out the questioning of Park, who is now awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on her impeachment motion.

Its claim is that officials are not entitled to force themselves into zones such as the presidential residence, the dispensary building and security offices.The special prosecutors, however, are citing the presidential office‘s duty to preserve documents, suggesting that such records should also be available for investigation.The investigation team led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo earlier vowed to have President Park Geun-hye summoned for face-to-face questioning by mid-February and to raid the Blue House before then.Considering the suspended president’s 65th birthday, which is on Thursday, the best scenario for investigators is to carry out the search on Friday, or Saturday at the latest, according to officials on Wednesday.“We don‘t expect much celebration this year,” said a Blue House official Wednesday.“Presidential staff members may individually visit the president’s residence after working hours, but that is about it.”“Cheong Wa Dae itself is an archive of presidential records and thus has the duty to preserve key documents,” the independent counsel team’s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul said Tuesday. Independent counsel team`s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul According to the law on presidential record management, one may not destroy, damage, conceal or leak presidential records. Outdated records, too, may be discarded only upon the approval of the committee in charge.But exceptions are made for records which may cause confusion in national security or excessively infringe on an individual’s personal life, in which case the High Court may decide on whether or not to issue a search warrant.Last year, the lower court issued the warrant requested by the prosecution’s special team but its execution was thwarted by the presidential security team.“We will stick to the rule when it comes to the seizure and search,” said an official of the Blue House on Wednesday.“Key confidential areas are in need of special security and may not be accessed by the independent counsel team.”Cheong Wa Dae’s stern resistance to a search has been raising concerns that the presidential staff may be trying to gain time to conceal key evidence, but the investigation team dismissed such a possibility.“The destruction of evidence, which is close to impossible, is bound to leave traces and this is one of the reasons that we should carry out the search,” Lee told reporters.By Bae Hyun-jung","special prosecutors preparing for seizure ,leak presidential records outdated records ,thwarted by the presidential security ,prosecutors preparing for seizure ,conceal or leak presidential records","['the Blue House', 'Independent Counsel Park Young', 'Park Geun', 'the Blue House', 'Blue House', 'Dae', 'Lee Kyu - chul', 'Lee Kyu - chul', 'the High Court', 'the Blue House', 'Dae ’s', 'Lee', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67630339 -0.52432632

The current society is ill from the Constitution that was last amended in 1987,” he said. “Saenuri’s joint in the reform drive would be well appreciated.”Ban had proposed a day earlier to form a consultative body to fuel constitutional reform before this year’s earlier-than-expected presidential election.As the law revision is deemed a crucial political agenda in the presidential election, this was taken as another gesture that he would make the anticipated bid.Prominent liberal candidate Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea agrees that the revision is necessary, but claimed that it should take place after the imminent election.Altering the nation’s basic law, which has remained unchanged since 1987, has long been a subject of discussion. A key issue is to change the current presidential system of five-year single-term presidency to a double-term, four-year one.The Bareun Party, a Saenuri splinter which has been seeking to recruit Ban as a presidential frontrunner, decided to move ahead with its election plans without Ban.“There will be no change in primary rules or election roadmaps, whether or not Ban decides to join our party,” said party chairman Rep. Choung Byoung-gug, after his meeting with Ban.“Should  look to the same value as we do, he is free to join us.”Ban’s sudden renunciation seems to be reflecting the recent fall in his approval ratings, as well as his vague position in between political parties.According to a poll conducted by Research & Research earlier this week, Ban's figures stood at 13.1 percent, lagging far behind that of Moon, who had 32.8 percent of the respondents’ support.By Bae Hyun-jung  and Jo He-rim","wednesday renounced his much anticipated ,renounced his much anticipated bid ,this year presidential election move ,moon on wednesday renounced his ,after the imminent election altering","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'the National Assembly', 'UN', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Ban', 'Saenuri', 'Bareun Party', 'Saenuri', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Democratic Party', 'Korea', 'the Bareun Party', 'Saenuri', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Choung Byoung - gug', 'Ban', 'Research & Research', 'Ban', 'Moon', 'Bae Hyun - jung', 'Jo He - rim']",17,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.73376024  0.57525837

It also acknowledged that the Saemaeul Movement was a ""state-led"" reform project initiated by the late Park to overcome poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War.One of the disputes centered on the description of the date Aug. 15, 1948. While the government designated it as the foundation day of the Republic of Korea, liberals argued it should be known as the foundation day of the government of the Republic of Korea as the country was already in existence in the form of a government-in-exile.The new textbook kept the description used by the government.However, in announcing the guidelines for state-authorized textbooks -- a separate set of textbooks that are currently in the making -- the ministry said it will allow the use of both expressions.""In the opinion-gathering process, we received the most input on the date of the foundation of the Republic of Korea,"" Vice Education Minister Lee Young said during the press conference. ""We revised the guidelines to reflect this.""The state-authored textbooks are to formally go into use next year following a trial period at school that volunteered to adopt them. The state-authorized textbooks will also be issued next year, after which schools will be given the freedom to choose the version they prefer.Critics accused the government of suddenly changing its stance on the date controversy to appease liberals and keeping more or less the same amount of coverage of Park Chung-hee in the state-authored books.""The education ministry should not create confusion in education and at schools,"" said Lee Jae-joung, education superintendent of Gyeonggi Province. ""State-authored history textbooks should be scrapped immediately according to the people's wish.""The ""Park Geun-hye textbook"" is unconstitutional, undemocratic and anti-educational, and the National Assembly should swiftly pass a bill aimed at banning the books, he argued.The bill passed through the parliamentary education, culture and sports committee earlier this month amid a boycott by the ruling party. Opposition parties have vowed to pass it through a plenary session before the start of the academic year in March.""I don't understand the reason for pushing ahead with a policy that will be scrapped in two months,"" Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, said during a party meeting, referring to the possibility the president will be removed from office. Park was impeached by parliament last month over an influence-peddling scandal and currently awaits a decision by the Constitutional Court on whether to oust or reinstate her.  ""I plead with the education minister to please stop,"" Woo said.

Things are looking good so far.” US Defense Secretary James Mattis The two defense chiefs, observers said, will devote most of their talks to the escalating missile and nuclear threats from North Korea. Its leader Kim Jong-un said the regime is “in the final stage” of developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, which they have threatened to fire “at anytime and anyplace.” South Korea’s Marine Corps commandant, Gen. Lee Sang-hoon, meanwhile, will visit the US and meet with high-level military officials -- including Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Gen. Robert Neller, commandant of the Marine Corps. Since President Trump took office on Jan. 20, Seoul’s defense and foreign ministries have been pushing for a meeting with Washington to reassure bilateral ties following the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, who will be removed from power if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment. “We usually have a bilateral summit  to set the tone for major security issues, but we are restricted from doing that right now,” Defense Minister Han said during his meeting with reporters on Jan 2. “I think we need to take a separate approach.”Defense Minister Han Min-koo In Korea-US relations, a meeting of the defense chiefs has often come after the two countries hold a bilateral summit following the inauguration of newly-elected presidents, as was the case in 2013 when President Park took office. Topping the agenda of the upcoming meeting will be the Korea-US alliance’s response to North Korea’s missile threats. The North is presumed to also be developing two additional types of ICBMs up to 15 meters long, shorter than the 19-20 meters of the KN-08 and the 17-18 meters of the KN-14.The allies are also expected to discuss the planned deployment of the US advanced anti-missile system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.

The witnesses  have consistently testified that the presidential office took a lead ” Kang Il-won, the lead justice for the ongoing trial, said. Park’s lawyers had asked the court to bring in 39 more witnesses to court including ex-chief presidential secretary Kim Ki-choon and ex-presidential aide Woo Byung-woo.Park, impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9, was stripped of substantial executive powers but remains immune from criminal liability. Some say she is seeking to buy time to restore support from the conservative bloc as well as to shield her from the sweeping investigation currently led by Special Counsel Park Young-soo. The top court decided to add two more hearings in early February to question Kim Ki-choon and officials from the entities linked to Choi, which means that the trial will proceed without the chief justice Park Han-chul whose term ends on Jan. 31. A decision to uphold Park’s impeachment would require consent from six of the eight remaining justices.  Fueling expectations that a ruling may be made as early as in February, the court has already quickened court proceedings by adopting statements of 46 suspects and witnesses at the prosecutorial questioning as valid evidence. The eighth hearing of the impeachment trial on Monday brought in ex-Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong, TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek and Lee Seung-cul, vice chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries as witnesses. They are all accused of colluding with Choi Soon-sil, President Park’s longtime friend and central figure in the scandal, to coerce donations from local firms and monopolize lucrative state-led projects. The former two are arrested and standing trial for abuse of authority and coercion. Park’s alleged collusion with Choi in extortion of the donations is one of the key charges for her impeachment.  Kim Chong, the ex-vice culture minister, admitted to being given orders from the presidential office to work with the K-Sports Foundation and the Blue-K, which Choi owned and used to embezzle donations, for its nationwide sports project. Kim also said that Park herself mentioned the name of Chung Yoo-ra, Choi’s daughter, to say the government should support “a talented athlete” like her. Chung is suspected of being illegally admitted to a prestigious university due to Choi’s ties to the president. On Monday, an independent counsel team investigating the corruption scandal brought in Yoo Jin-ryong, ex-culture and sports minister, accelerating its probe into Park‘s involvement in the blacklist allegations.Yoo earlier revealed that he had seen the blacklist of cultural figures critical of the Park administration while serving as a minister. The blacklist of some 10,000 left-wing figures was allegedly used to exclude them from state support.“I told Park that she should not make such a blacklist in 2014. But she remained silent ” he told reporters, appearing at the office of the independent counsel in southern Seoul. Yoo also said that Kim Ki-choon was the mastermind behind the blacklist. The counsel team suspects Park of ordering high-ranking government officials like Kim or ex-culture minister Cho Yoon-sun, who are both jailed, to draw up and manage the blacklist. The parliamentary impeachment committee plans to revise the version of the impeachment bill on Wednesday to possibly add the blacklist allegation, which could further implicate Park for a violation of her duty to uphold the Constitution.The independent counsel team also started to investigate allegations that Choi paid for Park’s clothes, which could constitute a bribery between the two.According to the counsel team, Park wore the clothes Choi picked and paid for from a dress shop in southern Seoul during presidential events and overseas trips. The clothes shop was raided and its employees were questioned earlier this month. The counsel team, meanwhile, is set to enforce a warrant to apprehend Choi, who is already in jail, on Thursday, as she has refused to respond to the investigators’ summons for questioning. By Ock Hyun-ju","the impeachment trial on monday ,ongoing trial said park lawyers ,impeachment trial on monday brought ,speed park lawyers again applied ,impeachment trial on monday","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park ’s', 'K - Sports', 'Cho Soon - sil', 'Kang Il - won', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Choi', 'Park Han', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Chong', 'Cha Eun - taek', 'Lee Seung - cul', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'Choi', 'Kim Chong', 'the K - Sports Foundation', 'the Blue - K', 'Choi', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi ’s', 'Chung', 'Choi', 'Yoo Jin - ryong', 'Seoul', 'Yoo', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Kim', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Seoul', 'Choi']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47148669  0.10361253

My due responsibility is to do my best to normalize state affairs early and prepare for our future.” In a latest survey unveiled Monday by Realmeter, he came in sixth with 4.6 percent, topping Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the conservative splinter Bareun Party, and former Democratic Party chair Sohn Hak-kyu. It was carried out on 2,520 South Koreans from Jan. 16-20.Hwang ranked fifth with 4 percent in the pollster’s previous survey from Jan. 16-18. In a separate Gallup Korea poll on Jan. 17-19, 38 percent of the 1,012 respondents gave a positive assessment to the acting president’s performance, and 48 percent viewed his performance negatively. The main opposition Democratic Party sought to undercut Hwang’s news conference, saying it had “no substance” and criticizing him for pretending to be an elected president.By Shin Hyon-hee","recent presidential election polls ,new us president donald trump ,run for president at recent ,of recent presidential election polls ,recent presidential election polls with","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'US', 'China', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'North Korea ’s', 'Hwang', 'US', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'Hwang', 'Japan', 'Hwang', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Hwang', 'Realmeter', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Bareun Party', 'Democratic Party', 'Sohn Hak - kyu', 'South Koreans', 'Gallup Korea', 'Democratic Party', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8878631   0.75154698

On Saturday, thousands of them -- 1.2 million according to an organizers' tally which seems grossly inflated -- gathered in central Seoul to oppose the impeachment of the conservative leader. Braving subzero temperatures, they --- mostly senior citizens from ultraright organizations and Protestant groups -- waved national flags and sang national anthems near Daehakno and Cheonggye Stream. “President Park was framed, the claims against her are completely fabricated, and the so-called candlelight vigils are led by politically far-left firebrands who hardly represent the right sentiment of the public,” said Park Je-hoon, 76, during the rally in Daehakno. “We won’t let them destroy our country.”  Kim Seon-gi, 75, criticized media reports for depicting the candlelit protestors as representing the Korean people as a whole. “I could not sit back at home anymore, as those who sympathize with North Korea are stirring up young students and women to overturn the country. I am worried our country will be sold off to  Kim Jong-un,” he said. Since the Dec. 9 impeachment, many Park sympathizers have been visibly angry, desperate and sometimes aggressive, disparaging political circles, the media and even the authorities. Although increasingly mobilized, they are hopelessly outnumbered, polls show. Public support of Park stood at just 4 percent, according to the latest available Gallup Korea survey conducted before her impeachment, “The independent counsel is too biased against the president. The tablet PC is a fake,” said Choi Yoo-young, 75, questioning the neutrality of the ongoing investigation by Special Prosecutor Park Young-soo into the presidential scandal and the validity of a key piece of evidence. The device, supposedly owned by Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil and obtained by a local TV channel, was what ignited the scandal in late October. “If the Constitutional Court follows the Constitution, the impeachment will be rejected,” said the pro-Park protestor.  Rep. Kim Jin-tae of the conservative ruling Saenuri Party took to a makeshift podium to defend Park’s actions during the sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014. Her lack of response during the disaster, which resulted in over 300 dead or missing, is one of the key reasons behind her impeachment. “Park’s lawyers submitted a document detailing what she did by the minute. She received 19 briefings and gave seven instructions. What on earth is wrong about it? The president spent 20 minutes doing her hair, but is it that a long time for a woman?”Choi Myung-jin, a priest who was collecting applications for Saenuri Party membership, criticized the Barun Party, a new conservative splinter group, for ditching President Park. The party was founded by former Saenuri members in an apparent attempt to break away from Park and her loyalists amid the scandal.  “The Saenuri Party should stand strong to make a ‘new’ Korea ruled by the law,” said Choi. “We are determined to participate more in the upcoming rallies to protect our country.” Park loyalists’ self-proclaimed fight to protect the president came to the fore last week, when the police announced that the turnout of their rally on Jan. 7 had exceeded that of an anti-Park protest on the same day.  According to the much-disputed police estimate, about 37,000 pro-Park protestors gathered, while the 11th candlelight vigil demanding Park’s ouster drew 24,000 people. The anti-Park rally organizers have denounced it as “a politically motivated attempt” to undervalue the candlelit protests in favor of Park’s supporters, citing that the chief of the Seoul National Agency Lee Chul-sung was appointed by the president. Amid the intensifying controversy, police dismissed the claims, saying, “We apply the same standards ” The police declared they would stop releasing their tally of protestors.   Behind the growing pro-Park rallies are many fervent conservatives who feel threatened by the collapse of the conservative administration, experts said.“Part of the reason behind the rise of the pro-Park rallies is that the anti-government candlelight vigils have lost momentum after the passage of the impeachment bill,” said Han Kyu-sup, a journalism professor at Seoul National University. “Another reason is that the fall of conservative President Park is seen by senior citizens as an attempt to deny their generation all together,” he said, pointing out that the older generation made up Park’s core support base. “The rallies might trigger more conservative voters to head to the ballot box in the upcoming presidential election.”Bae Jong-chan, chief director at Research & Research, said that once the presidential race begins, Park’s supporters will be more actively mobilized. “Park’s supporters are likely to hold more active and aggressive pro-government rallies to bring conservative leadership to the next government,” he said. But Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live, said pro-Park protestors’ active engagement in rallies could also be a bane for the conservative bloc.  “Such rallies could also give a bad image to conservative presidential hopefuls since Park’s approval rating is the lowest ever amid the corruption scandal,” Yoon said.

I am a grieving mother who is still living that day, begging for the life of my child,” said Lee Geum-hee.  A new year has arrived, but Lee is still stuck on the disaster that took place on April 16, 2014. As of Monday, 1,000 days have passed since the ferry Sewol sank with 304 people on board. However, Lee has still not left Paengmok port, the area close to the sea that claimed the life of her daughter, Cho Eun-hwa.Cho is among nine victims whose bodies remain missing, along with fellow Danwon High School students Nam Hyeon-cheol, Park Young-in and Heo Da-yun; teachers Yang Seung-jin and Go Chang-seok; and citizens Lee Young-suk, Kwon Jae-geun and his then 6-year-old son Hyeok-gyu.Out of the 304 victims, 250 were Danwon students who were told by the ship’s crew to stay put while they fled the vessel. A civilian-government special committee on the irregularities surrounding the incident was launched, but the Park Geun-hye administration pulled the plug on it in September without making much progress. A sea of yellow ribbons and flags, a “postbox to heaven” for the victims, and pictures of those who remain underwater serve as a reminder that the feelings of loss and pain caused by the accident continues. “People say they’ll remember, but what I want is to find her , I want the ship to be salvaged. I’ll be here until Eun-hwa comes out of the water,” Lee said, adding that she will stay at the port with families of others who remain missing.Citizens on Friday visit Paengmok port, the area close to the sea where Sewol ferry sank to claim the lives of 304 passengers en route to southern island of Jeju on April 16, 2014. Their wait was prolonged again in November, as the government flip-flopped on its decision to salvage the ship last July, saying the operation could only commence in April at the earliest.“The president and the government said they will find every last person and send them back to their families. It’s now been 1,000 days,” Lee said.There is ongoing dispute over the method of recovering the ship, with the installation of 33 lifting beams to eventually bring its hull to the surface with wires having ended in late December. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said that the preparation process of bring the ship to the surface is about 75 percent completed, but more time is likely to be needed due to weather conditions.Never forgetKim Yeon-sil, whose son Jeong Cha-woong died when the ship sank, said the bereaved families are “holding on” to ensure that one of the worst maritime accidents in Korean history is not forgotten.“Moms and dads  are doing all they can, some holding press meetings and others working on finding out the truth  and on having the ship salvaged,” said Kim. “I have felt that the accident is fading away in people’s memories, but President Park’s impeachment and the people’s protest  shed some hope,” she said. Park is currently undergoing an impeachment trial for a corruption scandal involving herself and her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Among other charges, she is being accused of acting inappropriately during the Sewol tragedy.“She just wasn’t working . The essence  is why she didn’t give instructions  to save the kids, not whether or not she received cosmetic treatment,” said Kim. Pictures of the 250 student victims of Danwon High School hang on the staircase inside the relocated Memorial Classroom. But with Park adamantly in denial of any wrongdoings on the day of the accident, and the investigative processes halted, fatigue is starting to set in.The parents have decided to change their method of fighting. After suffering from months of sorrow and missing their children, mothers and fathers have now gathered the strength to do various activities, such as acting out a play and singing in chorus.“In order to sustain our struggles, we should break out of our sadness and depression,” Kim said.Danwon High school’s Classroom 4 of second grade at Ansan Office of Education in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province on Dec. 30. Memory classroomsOne of the measures to ensure awareness about the Sewol disaster was the “Memory Classrooms,” originally set up in Danwon School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. These were later relocated to the Ansan Office of Education. The rooms have been preserved in the state when they were being used by their now-deceased youthful occupants.With playful words scribbled on the desks, and memos on calendars and whiteboards, the classrooms have an almost a merry atmosphere of teenagers -- before one realizes it is a memorial. “I could not help my eyes welling up in tears. All of us were utterly shocked on that day ,” said 30-year-old Jeong Gyeo-wun about her visit to the Memory Classrooms in December. “I think it is important to preserve these classrooms.” Post-its and letters are left on the desks of the then 17-year-olds, congratulating them on their adulthood which they would have reached by turning 19 in 2016.“I feel emotions which cannot be put into words as I walk through these traces,” said Park Jeong-min.According to officials at Ansan City Hall and the education office, over 642,025 visitors have paid their respects to the students at a district memorial altar in Danwon since the tragedy. More than 2,300 citizens visited the classrooms after they were moved, since Nov. 21 when they opened to the public.But many claimed that the preserved area is but a remnant of the real classrooms.Bereaved families and education authorities at Gyeonggi had been at loggerheads last August over the relocation, as the former insisted that the classrooms stay in Danwon. The families eventually caved in, but the complaints remain.“ are just a pretense, not the actual environment where the  students had actually spent their daily hours,” said Kim Yeon-sil. “It just feels like a soulless place.”A visitor looks at the wall of the Memorial Classrooms relocated to Ansan Office of Education, Gyeonggi Province on Dec. 30. These mock classrooms lack one crucial sentiment -- the feeling that the late students were actually there, according to Kim.Some of the bereaved families have cleared out their children’s desk, which was used to hold gifts and messages from well-wishers across the country. “I’m truly thankful to the people for remembering the children and for raising candles , but I urge them to think about what should be the priority. Because nine people are still in Sewol,” said Lee, the mother of Cho. By Yoon Min-sik, Jo He-rim  Photos of Memorial Classrooms:A sign reads ""4.16 Memorial Class.

Chung was arrested in the northern Danish city of Aalborg, on Sunday, local time, on charges of staying illegally. In a bid to add pressure on Chung, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that it has ordered her to turn in her passport by Monday, after which her passport will be nullified. While resisting being questioning, Chung has also been making a series of remarks, admitting her mother’s irregularity charges but denying her involvement in the process. “I thought I’d be expelled  in 2016, as I hardly ever attended classes and knew none of the teaching staff,” she told reporters at the Danish court on Monday, local time. “I moved to Germany, two months after giving birth, and then to Denmark. I know nothing about my grades or how they were evaluated.” Chung came under fire for receiving favors not only in entering the prestigious college but also in her academic grades, despite her nonattendance and attitude. She also claimed to have no knowledge on the covert connection between her mother and Samsung. “My mother asked me to sign a couple of documents and I did as told,” Chung said. “What I know is that Samsung sponsored a horse and that I rode it, that is all. I have no idea whatsoever how all the money involved was operated.” Choi and Chung are reported to be estranged from each other, following disputes caused by Chung’s premarital pregnancy. Citing the existence of her 19-month son, she demanded a non-arrest guarantee, but investigators immediately rejected this, stating that Chung is clearly a suspect in the given case.By Bae Hyun-jung","between her mother and samsung ,mother and samsung my mother ,her mother and samsung my ,her mother and samsung ,her mother irregularity charges but","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi', 'Samsung', 'Chung', 'Denmark', 'danish', 'Choi', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Chung ’s', 'Chung', 'Lee Kyu - cheol', 'Chung', 'danish', 'Chung', 'danish', 'Aalborg', 'Chung', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Chung', 'danish', 'Germany', 'Denmark', 'Samsung', 'Chung', 'Samsung', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29298368  0.19483715

""Defections by elites also rose.""North Korea is pressing its diplomats and overseas workers to send hard currency earnings home as it is being squeezed by international sanctions leveled by the UN Security Council.In April 2016, a group of 13 North Koreans who worked at a restaurant in China defected to the South en masse.Thae Yong-ho, a former ranking diplomat stationed in London, fled to South Korea in late July, becoming one of the highest-ranking officials to flee to Seoul.In November last year, the government unveiled a set of measures to help North Korean defectors better adapt to life in the South as their total number here surpassed the 30,000 mark.","last year more north korean ,2016 government data showed tuesday ,south korea rose 11 percent ,year more north korean overseas ,elites also rose north korea","['North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Unification', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'North Koreans', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'the UN Security Council', 'North Koreans', 'China', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'London', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'north korean']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65726453  0.85145128
