He was sent back to Sinuiju in the North on Nov. 17, according to the report. Huh must have been searched many times on his way to the city just across the border from China, but it was not known how he was able to conceal the poison, according to the source.

This file photo, taken on Feb. 22, 2017, shows a nearly empty infant unit of a hospital in Seoul, when Statistics Korea announced that the number of babies born in 2016 reached 406,300, the lowest since 1970 when the statistics agency started to compile such data. On Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in called for more effective measures to boost South Korea's low fertility rate as he warned of a serious demographic crisis.South Korea has spent 100 trillion won  over the past decade to tackle the low birth rate, though no significant progress has been made yet.Many young people delay marriage as they cannot find decent jobs after graduating university, which in turn has led to a low birth rate.South Korea's total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- stood at 1.17 in 2016, much lower than the replacement level of 2.1 that would keep South Korea's population of 51 million stable.Coupled with a rapidly aging population, low births can reduce the available workforce in Asia's fourth-largest economy and drive up welfare costs, which in turn could undermine the economy's growth potential.Meanwhile, the number of marriages dropped 20.9 percent on-year to 17,400 in October, while 8,400 couples divorced during the cited period, down 5.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the data.The number of deaths came to 24,600 for the month, up 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.","of marriages dropped 20 percent ,korea monthly childbirths have decreased ,korea dipped again in october ,marriages dropped 20 percent on ,marriages dropped 20 percent","['South Korea', 'asian', 'Statistics Korea', 'Seoul', 'Statistics Korea', 'Moon Jae -', ""South Korea 's"", 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's""]",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.86149192  0.84855682

From public toilets to schools and churches, the changes will affect South Koreans’ daily life. Here is a look at some of the new rules to come into effect in 2018. Bye-bye toilet trash cansStarting from Jan. 1, all public bathrooms are required to do away with trash bins and provide rapid dissolving toilet paper, hopefully resolving one of the most common complaints of foreign visitors here.  YonhapThe move comes as part of changes brought by the Cabinet, which in May passed a revision to the implementation ordinance of the Public Toilets, Etc. Act, the law governing public toilets. Under the amendment, garbage cans inside all bathroom stalls for both male and female restrooms will be removed. Bins with covers will be installed instead for the disposal of feminine hygiene products. Also, janitors and cleaning staff will be asked to place signs at the entrance of bathrooms when cleaning facilities for opposite genders. Among other changes is the introduction of bigger bathroom dividers -- 40 centimeters in width and 60 centimeters in length -- between urinals for men. “We hope other privately owned restrooms catch up with the newly introduced changes such as public restrooms without toilet trash bins, signs for cleaners of a different sex, more enclosed restroom designs and barriers between urinals,” said Yoon Jong-in, a senior official at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.Taxes on clergy Effective Jan. 1, priests, pastors, Buddhist monks and clergy of other religions will be levied income tax.  A group of activists from the Korea Taxpayers` Association hold a protest rally in front of the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee building in central Seoul on May 31, 2017, demanding that clerical workers pay taxes like all waged workers. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 35 member countries, Korea was the only allowing exemptions for religious leaders. A related revision in the nation’s tax code passed the National Assembly years ago, but its implementation was delayed due to opposition from religious circles. The clergy group’s tax burden, however, is envisioned to be just about half of that shouldered by ordinary wage earners, according to a Financial Ministry plan to be finalized Friday. A religious leader with a three-person household who earns 28.85 million won  a year and has one child under the age of 20 would pay a monthly withholding tax of just 1,330 won. The 28.85 million won is the average annual income of pastors, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Labor Ministry. For an annual income of 50 million won, a clergyperson leading a four-person household would shoulder 50,730 won in monthly income taxes, whereas nonclergy would pay 90,510 won. The Finance Ministry estimates roughly 16-20 billion won will be collected annually from around 50,000 religious leaders. No English for grades 1-2 Starting from March 1, elementary schools are banned from running English courses for first- and second-graders under the motto “No study burden on young kids.”  After-school teachers stage a protest in front of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education on Friday, demonstrating against the government`s decision to ban after-school English classes for first- and second-graders. Currently, English is taught from the third grade onward, but schools offer first- and second-graders after-hours courses in English. The global language is by far parents’ favorite among all extension programs. A law banning advanced learning to normalize the competition-driven education culture was adopted in September 2014, but after-school English curriculum remained intact due to strong demand from parents. Parents and thousands of English instructors, who are set to lose their jobs, are protesting the looming shutdown, but the Education Ministry appears firm this time. Some critics say the ban would deprive students of access to affordable English education and benefit private institutions. Minimum wage, vacation days and jobsThe minimum wage for 2018 is set at 7,530 won per hour, up 16.4 percent, or 1,060 won, from a year earlier. This is the first time for the bottom limit of wages to rise by more than 1,000 won at a time. President Moon Jae-in, having proclaimed a doctrine of “income-led economic growth,” aims to raise the rate to 10,000 won during his presidency, which ends in 2022, but said he would adjust the pace of the wage increases after watching how this year’s spike affects labor cost-sensitive sectors and SMEs. From June, newly hired employees will be entitled to 11 days of paid leave in the first year. So far, workers have become entitled only after completing a full year of service. Also there will be 24,300 job openings in the public service through 2018, including for teachers, police officers, firefighters and central and provincial government employees. The hiring scheme compares to previous years’ average of around 8,000. What’s a gift and what’s a bribe Since September 2016, civil servants, journalists, teachers and their spouses have been banned from receiving gifts, free meals and congratulations or condolences of certain monetary values, under the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.  123rfThe price ceilings are to be adjusted before the Lunar New Year holiday in February, a traditional gift-giving season, although the exact date of its implementation has yet to be determined. As for gifts, the cap is unchanged at 50,000 won, but there is a new exception: Up to 100,000 won is OK when the gifts are agricultural, livestock and fishery goods. The ceiling on gift money on occasions like weddings and funerals is down to 50,000 won from the previous 100,000 won.

They found that cyberattacks, which were usually conducted to gain confidential data and intelligence, have been recently shifting toward gaining digital currency. “I assume they will do more bitcoin attacks and of course they will keep targeting banks because that’s what they did before,” Shen said, according to Sky News.“One of the reasons why bitcoin is being attacked is because the price keeps increasing, and we think it’s reasonable for hackers. Digital currency might be easier to gain than physical currency.”One of Shen’s co-researchers working for a South Korean bank told Sky News, asking not to be named, that just a few years ago, North Korean hackers initiated attacks to paralyze society, but now they were hacking for money.Security firm FireEye said in report in September that hackers linked to North Korea have stolen bitcoins from at least three South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges since May 2017.“Now, we may be witnessing a second wave of this campaign: state-sponsored actors seeking to steal bitcoin and other virtual currencies as a means of evading sanctions and obtaining hard currencies to fund the regime,” the report said. The Korea Internet & Security Agency also forecast an increase of cyberattacks from North Korea targeting cryptocurrency exchanges in its outlook on next year’s cyberattacks released last week. One bitcoin, which was worth less than $1,000 at the beginning of this year, hit above $17,000 last week.By Kim So-hyun","north korea have stolen bitcoins ,north korean hackers initiated attacks ,actors seeking to steal bitcoin ,korea have stolen bitcoins ,korea have stolen bitcoins from","['North Korea', 'british', 'north korean', 'Sky News', 'Ashley Shen', 'Sky News', 'Shen', 'Lazarus', 'Bluenoroff', 'Andariel', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'ATM', 'Sky News', 'Digital', 'south korean', 'Sky News', 'north korean', 'FireEye', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'the Korea Internet & Security Agency', 'North Korea', 'Kim So - hyun']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29765788  0.55120856

""At these meetings, our side said the US policy of hostility toward the DPRK  and its nuclear blackmail are to blame for the current tense situation on the Korean peninsula,"" the report said.It added that the North had agreed with the UN ""to regularize communications through visits at various levels"".The report did not mention any meetings with leader Kim Jong-Un, who has ramped up his impoverished nation's missile and nuclear programme in recent years in order to achieve Pyongyang's stated goal of developing a warhead capable of hitting the US mainland.Feltman, the UN's under secretary general for political affairs, visited the country just after the United States and South Korea launched their biggest-ever joint air exercise.Pyongyang reiterated its view that these manoeuvres were a provocation on Saturday, accusing the drills of ""revealing its intention to mount a surprise nuclear pre-emptive strike against the DPRK"", using the acronym for the country's official name.The UN Security Council has hit the isolated and impoverished North with a package of sanctions over its increasingly powerful missile and nuclear tests, which have rattled Washington and its regional allies South Korea and Japan.Early Saturday Feltman flew to Beijing, a key transit point with the North, and left the city's airport without speaking to reporters. China, which is Pyongyang's sole major diplomatic and military ally, has called on the United States to freeze military drills and North Korea to halt weapons tests to calm tensions.","nuclear blackmail for soaring tensions ,in beijing saturday after wrapping ,korea blamed us nuclear blackmail ,on saturday accusing the drills ,saturday accusing the drills","['North Korea', 'US', 'UN', 'Jeffrey Feltman', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'UN', 'Ri Yong - Ho', 'Pak Myong - Kuk', 'KCNA', 'US', 'korean', 'UN', 'Kim Jong - Un', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Feltman', 'UN', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'the UN Security Council', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Feltman', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'the United States', 'North Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3229869   0.79928249

""You know the principle 'people should not be deported when they are at risk' is especially valid for North Koreans."" The high commissioner also commended South Korea's government policy to automatically take North Korean defectors coming to South Korea as its own citizens. ""I commended the foreign minister for this policy. They don't need us to do this particular work,"" according to him. Still, South Korea needs to do more to improve its system to take refugees from other part of the world, he pointed out. ""Korea is one of the few countries in the region that has had specific legislation for refugees since 2013 ...  the application of that law still needs to be improved,"" Grandi noted. Good refugee status determination systems need to be very precise ""because people come with very difficult stories,"" he said. ""If you make a mistake, if you say you are not refugees, so go back home, you may be risking this person's life. That's why it has to be almost like a medical examination.""He also said the process should also not be too slow. ""So you have to balance quality and speed.

YonhapA total of 1,118 people have been displaced and are living in 13 temporary shelters, according to the ministry’s morning briefing, while some 20,000 from the military, police and fire departments and public volunteers have mobilized for restoration work. So far 82 people have been treated for injuries at hospitals. Of them, 15 remain hospitalized. The country’s second-strongest earthquake on record also left cracks and damage in walls at 110 elementary schools and 106 middle and high schools in the coastal region, although no deaths were reported due to the quake. Education authorities also postponed the country’s national university entrance examination, originally slated for Thursday, by a week on safety concerns. The annual exam is the focus of 12 years of education leading to university. The recent disaster, followed by last year’s 5.8 magnitude quake in nearby Gyeongju, raises public concerns over safety in a country that rarely experiences tremors as geologists warn of bigger seismic activities to come. The Pohang quake occurred at around 2:29 p.m. on Wednesday, sending tremors as far as to the capital Seoul, more than 300 kilometers away. To allay public concerns, Rep. Cho Jeong-sik of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, who heads the parliamentary land, infrastructure and transport committee, submitted a legislative proposal to improve the earthquake resistance of age-old infrastructure, buildings and transportation systems nationwide. The bill calls for government monitoring of infrastructure facilities aged 30 years or over to upgrade the nation‘s quake preparedness. “Subways and highways that were constructed more than 30 years ago during the industrialization period are not functioning well, and have serious security concerns. It is time to shift our response mode from the current passive one to a proactive one against age-old infrastructure,” Cho said.By Bak Se-hwan","the magnitude quake last week ,magnitude quake last week yonhapa ,quake last week yonhapa total ,magnitude quake last week ,damaged some 000 private homes","['Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Ministry of Interior and Safety', 'the Korea Institute of Geosciences', 'Mineral Resources', 'Pohang', 'Gyeongju', 'Pohang', 'Seoul', 'Cho Jeong - sik', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Cho', 'Bak Se - hwan']",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.36919883  0.41197735

On Monday morning, three days before the original day when Korea’s national college entrance exam was to be held, a senior high school student in Gangneung, surnamed Kang, called the police after realizing that his tablet PC had gone missing. The exam has since been delayed to next week due to an earthquake in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, on Wednesday. Kang tried to recall where he had left his tablet PC. Tracing back his steps, the student remembered that he had left it on top of an ATM machine in the local post office.  High school seniors students study for the state-administered College Scholastic Ability Test, which is slated for November. The tablet PC contained study notes for Suneung that Kang had prepared. Following an investigation, police said security footage showed two tourists leaving the post office with the student’s tablet PC. With the stolen item in hand, the two suspects were seen getting on an express bus to Seoul. Police caught the two suspects on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Hongcheon rest area. The device was reportedly returned to the student, who will take the Suneung on Thursday. By Catherine Chung","suspects for stealing tablet pc ,arrested two suspects for stealing ,two suspects for stealing tablet ,the two suspects on wednesday ,bus to seoul police caught","['Suneung', 'Korea', 'Gangneung', 'Kang', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Kang', 'ATM', 'College Scholastic Ability Test', 'Suneung', 'Kang', 'Seoul', 'Catherine Chung']",17,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.74215978  0.24096394

Investigators from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office also searched four of its affiliated firms and the residences of four officials suspected of involvement to seize evidence, they said. The raid came as part of allegations that the 25th-largest family-controlled conglomerate has been running slush funds for former chairman Cho Suck-rai and his eldest son -- the group's current head -- Hyun-joon, through four affiliates.  Three of the affiliates are suspected of investing in deals that are irrelevant to their businesses and inflicting at least tens of billions of won in losses. Hyosung's real estate affiliate is believed to have incurred huge losses from investing in one of the three units. Cho and his son hold the biggest stakes in all of the four affiliates. Prosecutors said they plan to summon Hyosung officials for questioning once they finish analyzing the seized evidence. It is not the first time that Hyosung has been under a prosecutorial probe. The former and current chairmen have been investigated for embezzlement, tax evasion and accounting fraud charges in the past decade. Cho has received a suspended term for some of the charges. The allegations about slush funds were raised after Cho's younger son, Hyun-moon, filed a complaint with the prosecution seeking a probe against his father and older brother over the suspicion. Cho's three sons, including the youngest Hyun-sang, who is a vice president in the group, have been embroiled in a family feud over the leadership succession. Hyosung's businesses stretch from textiles, chemicals and trading to heavy industries and construction.","prosecutors office also searched four ,prosecutors said friday they raided ,district prosecutors office also searched ,older brother over the suspicion ,the seoul central district prosecutors","['south korean', 'Hyosung Group', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office', 'Cho Suck - rai', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Hyun - moon', 'Cho']",17,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.58831114  0.65699452

The ...","The widow of late singer Kim Kwang-seok filed a suit and an injunction Monday against a TV journalist and her brother-in-law for implicating her in the death of her daughter 10 years ago.  Seo Hae-soon lodged a defamation suit against Lee Sang-ho and his media company and against Kim Kwang-bok, her brother-in-law, seeking about 600 million won  in damages, her lawyer Park Hoon said in a Facebook post. The suit comes after police said last week they found no evidence linking Seo to the death of her teenage daughter in 2007, announcing their result of a recent probe launched at the request of Lee and Kim's brother.  They have accused Seo of negligence resulting in the child's unexpected death from acute pneumonia and said she might have intended to gain sole legal rights to Kim's musical assets. Kim committed suicide in 1996 at 32. Seo also filed for court injunctions seeking the suspension of Lee's documentary film about her late husband and a ban on any verbal or written slandering on her in relation to her daughter's death.The film raises suspicion that his death was a murder and pegs Seo and her brother as potential suspects. Seo requested Lee pay as much as 50 million won for every screening of his film in breach of the court order.She lodged a separate complaint with the prosecution seeking a criminal investigation into Lee and Kim for making false accusations, her lawyer said. The case surrounding the deaths in Seo's family began two months ago, when the daughter's death was made known by local media a decade after it happened. Lee, who has long raised questions over the singer's death, called for a reinvestigation into the death of Kim's only child, Seo-yeon. Seo has since appeared in many media interviews, flatly denying any involvement and blaming Lee for attacking her to attract publicity for his film. The death of the famed folk rock singer in the 1990s sent shock waves through fans and the public, who loved his plaintive yet captivating vocals and sentimental lyrics that critics say portrayed individuals' sorrow and frustration at a time when the society was struggling in its early stage of democracy following rapid industrialization.","death of her daughter 10 ,her daughter death the film ,death of her teenage daughter ,injunction monday against tv journalist ,widow of late singer kim","['Kim Kwang - seok', 'seo hae - soon', 'Lee Sang - ho', 'Kim Kwang - bok', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'seo', 'Lee', 'Seo', 'seo', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'seo', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39198944  0.1470418

The victims reported feeling “something cold” on their legs and discovered the ink-sprayed stockings with no one in sight. Business College students further reported falling victim to the ink-spraying through their social media. Multiple posts on Pusan National University’s Facebook student page revealed that the situation was getting out of hand and the students felt too anxious to attend class. Some students suspect that the suspect may be the actual “Gangnam Station  stocking terrorist” himself. Last year, a man was caught by the police for spraying black ink on 16 flight attendants and then keeping the thrown out stockings as souvenirs near Gangnam Station. It may be possible that the suspect in Busan is spraying ink intending to do the same. Busan District Police said that they could not find any security footage of the suspect committing the crime and do not know whether there are any more victims.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office banned Kim Jang-soo, a former defense minister and ambassador to China, from leaving the country over suspicions that he played a part in altering the presidential office‘s daily log concerning the Sewol ferry sinking that left 304 killed or missing, on April 16, 2014.  Kim Jang-soo The 68-year-old was the person who reported the disaster to the then state leader Park Geun-hye over the phone and in writing, as the NSC chief at the time of the incident. According to the evidence revealed by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae earlier this month, Kim is thought to have manipulated the daily record and pushed the time of his reporting to a later time, from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. Current Presidential Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok said that Kim’s fabrication appears to be an attempt to reduce the time between the first report and Park’s first order, which is said to have been made at around 10:15 a.m.Kim, who took the post in March 2013, was replaced in May the next year, after he came under fire over his statement that NSC is not the control tower of disasters. Former defense minister Kim Kwan-jin who succeeded the NSC is also suspected of ordering for the government’s crisis response manual to be changed without following the needed legal procedures. The presidential directive was changed in July of that year so that the duty of controlling disaster situations falls under the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, not the NSC. The presidential office had requested a probe into the two former NSC chiefs. The question of where the former President Park was at the time of the sinking remains, as she was absent from duty during the seven hours from when the sinking was first reported, until she appeared at the government task force at around 5:30 p.m. Park is currently behind bars, standing trial over a massive corruption scandal that led to her ouster in March.

We did not see any financial damage from the case,” the company said. It added it does not know whether other automobile components, needed in fixing the cars, were sold together at the time.The EKN alarms the communist state every six months on their liabilities, though they had not gotten any response. EKN said it would not give up on collecting the debts.According EKN’s annual report in 2016, North Korea currently owes SEK 2.7 billion  to Sweden as the debt has swollen due to the accumulated interest. It said the amount accounts for more than 45 percent of the entire debt owed by 16 countries, and that North Korea is the only debtor that has never implemented a debt repayment.

According to embassy officials, a total of 15 such cases involving 16 South Korean gamblers, who are either tourists or residents, have been reported to the embassy so far since April this year.A South Korean man in his 40s went missing last week after playing at a Manila casino with a loan of 13 million won from a Chinese gang. He was abducted after losing all of the funds and was unable to pay back the loan. After the victim alerted the embassy to his location with his cell phone, the embassy, in cooperation with local police, tracked him to a house just north of Manila, where they also found another Korean national and a Chinese woman detained against their will for at least one month.Lee Soo-bok, police consul at the embassy, said illegal lending by many Chinese loan sharks is rampant in the Philippines. ""Chinese private lenders offer loans to gamblers irrespective of their nationalities, and abduct and detain them as a way to collect their loans,"" he said.Following their rescue, some South Korean victims returned home without cooperating with the local police's investigation into the perpetrators, the embassy said.The embassy said, in order to prevent such similar cases from recurring, it plans to ask the South Korean police to investigate alleged gambling by South Koreans who don't cooperate with the local police and leave the Southeast Asian country.","korean gamblers visiting philippine casinos ,philippine casinos have been abducted ,south korean gamblers visiting philippine ,illegal lending by many chinese ,involving 16 south korean gamblers","['HANOI', 'south korean', 'philippine', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'Manila', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'Manila', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Manila', 'chinese', 'Manila', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Lee Soo - bok', 'chinese', 'Philippines', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'South Koreans', 'southeast asian']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29357216  0.74838459

Chung met Kiska at the Slovakian leader’s presidential office here and thanked him for the European nation’s continuous support of peace on the Korean Peninsula, where tensions have been rising with North Korea’s nuclear test and missile provocations.  “I think it’s not wise the way that US President Donald Trump and the North Korean leader  aggravated the situation with a war of words,” Chung said. “Although the United Nations is sanctioning North Korea that violated international rules, imposing sanctions can’t be the goal,” he said. “Our mission is to bring North Korea to the dialogue and cooperation table with various efforts.”Kiska said Slovakia is also worried about North Korea’s nuclear development and that he supports South Korea’s stance. He also told Chung that China and Russia will be useful to make North Korea appear at the dialogue table.Chung also asked Kiska to help South Korean businesses by improving infrastructure, saying companies are looking to expand investments in Slovakia. Kiska responded that his country understands the importance of establishing solid business infrastructure and will roll out policies supporting South Korean businesses including Kia Motors Corp. that has a production base in Zilina, Slovakia. Kiska also said that he will visit South Korea during the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games next year to further develop their relationship. Following his meeting with Kiska, Chung later met Slovakian Parliament Speaker Andrej Danko to talk about economic cooperation between two countries. “Both countries need to expand opportunities for cooperation in areas like education and R&D;,” Chung said during a joint press conference with Danko. “South Korea has experience and knowhow not only in the manufacturing industry, but also in the information technology industry. I think both countries need to further beef up cooperation in the culture and tourism area.”Danko said Slovakia is ready to listen to South Korean investors and hopes the friendly relationship between the two countries can continue. However, he also told Chung that South Korean business owners should pay careful attention to Slovakian workers. Chung’s visit to Slovakia was part of his diplomatic trip that began on Oct. 11.

Local media reports said Tuesday that Chinese police warned around 10 South Korean businesspeople, community associates and religious leaders residing near the border to evacuate due to the possibility of abduction by North Korea. They were notified during the Chuseok holiday earlier this month amid heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ahead of China’s upcoming Communist Party Congress. Among them, five had already left China as of 7 a.m. Wednesday, while the rest have chosen temporary escape or are considering to return to South Korea, added Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.The South Korean Consulate General in Shenyang pointed out that it was an unprecedented move for Chinese authorities to directly communicate with South Korean nationals on such matters. It also advised South Koreans to be cautious of strangers and alert family members or acquaintances.“Previously, the consulate made the safety measures whenever there were signs of such attacks by the North -- this is the first time Chinese authorities took direct action,” said Consul-General to Shenyang Shin Bong-sup. An unnamed consulate official suggested that the authorities’ actions were triggered by an obtained intelligence report hinting at North Korea’s secretive operation.In May, a 60-year-old North Korean defector reportedly went missing in the Chinese city of Yanji, near the North-China border, while in 2016, an ethnic Korean named Han Chung-ryeol was allegedly murdered by North Korean agents. Han was a Christian pastor who aided North Korean defectors in China.But experts here are skeptical that North Korea would make a move to kidnap South Korean nationals, despite heightening tensions. “It seems the warning is part of China’s efforts to adopt stricter security before its most important political event,” Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told The Korea Herald.“North Korea has been causing trouble near the North-China border and China needs to show that it is making all efforts to contain such problems both locally and globally,” Lee said. South Korea’s government data showed that about 500 of its citizens have been abducted by the reclusive state since after the Korean War . Those snatched away were often reportedly used for propaganda activities or intelligence gathering. However, for more than a decade, North Korean agents have been mainly targeting North Korean defectors rather than those who were born and bred in South Korea. Meanwhile, South Korea has been ramping up its reconnaissance operations ahead of the 19th national congress of China’s Communist Party, which Cheong Wa Dae has highlighted as a date when a North Korean provocation might take place. Anton Morozov, a senior Russian lawmaker, who visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, claimed the North is currently preparing for a new long-range missile test in order to prove it can “hit the west coast of the United States.”“As far as we understand, they intend to launch one more long-range missile in the near future,” he said.

The former leader has been detained since March 31.Whether the documents will lead to an extension of her arrest remains to be seen, but many have said fresh allegations may increase the possibility.The court is expected to reach a decision on Park's detention Friday. The tragic sinking of the passenger ferry partly triggered the start of candlelight vigils late last year that eventually led to the ouster of Park in March.Many, including the bereaved families of the 304 people who were killed or went missing in the accident, demanded the former president to reveal her whereabouts on the day of the accident, claiming she may have failed to carry out her duty while being caught up in personal affairs.Cheong Wa Dae said the documents discovered at its crisis management office also indicated the National Security Council may have altered its manual on crisis management, possibly to remove any blame that might fall on the former president.Before what Im called an ""illegal"" revision of the manual, the NSC guideline cleared named the NSC as the top control tower in dealing with any major disaster or accident.The printed phrase was crossed out with a red pen in late July, apparently at an instruction from then NSC chief Kim Kwan-jin, Im said.A handwritten phrase was added in its place stating the NSC was to act as a control tower only in security-related incidents. The revised manual was then delivered all government offices, according to Im.Such a revision apparently came after then presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon testified before the National Assembly that Cheong Wa Dae or the NSC were not the control tower in dealing with the ferry sinking, Im noted.The incumbent presidential chief of staff also said such a revision to the NSC manual required legal procedures, including a review and approval by the Ministry of Government Legislation, but that the former administration took none of such steps.""Cheong Wa Dae believes such an incident must never be repeated. Believing the incident represents the worst case of manipulation of power, the presidential office plans to request a formal investigation,"" Im said.","detention friday the tragic sinking ,coast killing more than 300 ,accident demanded the former president ,friday the tragic sinking ,friday the tragic sinking of","['Cheong Wa Dae', 'Im', 'Park Geun', '""The', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Dae', 'the National Security Council', 'NSC', 'NSC', 'NSC', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'NSC', 'Im', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'the National Assembly', 'NSC', 'NSC', 'the Ministry of Government Legislation', 'Dae']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55421138  0.57913786

Park's now-deceased colleagues, who had been convicted of the same charges, were also found innocent.Park's ordeal began when he and two others were abducted to the North in 1968 while fishing for yellow corvina aboard their boat, the Youngchang, near the western sea border. They were released from the North four months later, but then authorities in the staunchly anti-communist South Korea charged them with espionage. Former fisherman Park Choon-hwan  Park was sentenced in 1972 to seven years in prison on spy charges. He served out the term, but was indicted again for violating the then anti-communist law and fisheries law and sentenced to eight months in prison.The 1972 conviction was cleared in a retrial in 2011, and the second conviction was nullified this week.Park has said that upon his return from the North, he suffered various torture at the hands of police and made false confessions, saying he was a North Korean spy and tried to convince a friend to become a spy too. That friend was also convicted and served a prison term.""I was found to be completely innocent, but I feel unfair as I'm this old,"" Park said. ""I feel very badly about the government.""Park's lawyer, Lee Myong-choo, said that about 1,500 South Korean fishermen were punished after being abducted to the North, but only about 10 of them have been cleared of the convictions.""We have a long way to go, and in the case of the Youngchang, we're going to seek compensation from the government,"" he said.","acquitted an elderly former fisherman ,south korean fishermen were punished ,south korean court has acquitted ,korean fishermen were punished after ,korean court has acquitted an","['JEONJU', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'the Jeonju District Court', 'Park', 'Park', 'Youngchang', 'North', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Lee Myong - choo', 'south korean', 'Youngchang']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26426825  0.2973626

They are part of a self-reform road map unveiled Friday after its monthslong review of what needs to be done to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the ministry frequently criticized for elitism and exclusivism. Foreign minister Kang Kyung-hwa The ministry has 51 women in its manager-level positions, which accounts for a mere 8 percent of the total. Under the road map, it plans to raise the ratio to 20 percent, or around 120 women, by May 2022, when the current administration leaves. In a bid to enhance efficiency, it will launch the so-called diplomatic strategy planning office that will serve as a policy control tower. Currently, the ministry has a policy planning office, but it will be turned into the new one with more authority and power. The ministry also said that it will merge up to 10 divisions and teams deemed to be doing similar work into five in order to streamline its structure and assign personnel secured from the organizational consolidation for better use. To provide better consular services, the ministry said that it will expand and upgrade the current consular affairs bureau and assign at least one employee at each overseas mission tasked with responding to any accidents and complaints involving Korean people overseas. The ministry also plans to employ outside experts for up to 30 percent of heads of its overseas missions.To strengthen the overall diplomatic infrastructure, the ministry noted that it will push to increase its workforce and budget ""steadily"" and ""systematically"" over the next five years.Those measures are based on the work of an innovation task force the ministry launched in July. It has collected public opinion and proposals from inside and held debates with an advisory group consisting of experts from civic groups, businesses and relevant government agencies. Since her inauguration in June, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has underlined the need to create a foreign service workforce with more diverse backgrounds and capabilities, different from the closed and male-dominated organization.Kang, a former UN policy adviser, is the first female foreign minister in South Korea and also the first case in 14 years in which the ministry is headed by a person who didn't start as a career diplomat.

They are said to have induced conservative civic groups to bolster their campaigns against the mayor's key policies and spread Internet comments maligning him. The two former NIS officials allegedly had their subordinates exert pressure on government agencies to conduct tax probes on entertainment agencies that had contracts with those artists. They also peddled influence on public broadcasters to exclude them from the mainstream media.The prosecution said it plans to call in some of the blacklist victims for questioning and take statements from them. The task force was set up after liberal President Moon Jae-in took office in May, after his predecessor President Park Geun-hye was ousted over a massive corruption scandal in March. She has been detained and is standing trial. Park's top aide recently received a three-year jail term from a Seoul court for spearheading an artist blacklist project during her term. Won, who was appointed by Lee in 2009, is also being detained and is awaiting the top court's ruling on the charge that he interfered in the 2012 presidential election. The prosecution's probe now draws attention as to whether the investigation will eventually target former President Lee Myung-bak and his staff. The blacklist scandal involving Park's staff was one of the catalysts that triggered massive street protests by citizens calling for her impeachment.","blacklist scandal involving park staff ,ousted over massive corruption scandal ,his staff the blacklist scandal ,smear campaign against seoul mayor ,seoul prosecutors said thursday","['Seoul', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Lee Myung - bak', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'NIS', 'Moon Jae -', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Won', 'Lee', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.30554199  0.44948348

The prosecutors also suspect KAI inflated the value of the proceeds from the sale of a light attack aircraft, the FA-50, to Iraq, in a deal worth some 3 trillion won . One KAI executive was arrested early this month and another is awaiting a court decision on the prosecution's request for his arrest warrant.  The prosecutors' office said it uncovered some circumstantial evidence that indicates top officials may have worked together in cooking the books for the 18 trillion won KF-X project, ordered by the government in 2015 to develop Korea's own advanced fighter jets and produce more than 120 planes until 2026. The prosecution secured documents that suggest its former chief Ha Sung-yong was briefed on the situations, the prosecution said. Ha stepped down soon after the investigation began in July. The prosecution is expected to call in Ha soon for questioning.KAI has been involved in high-profile defense projects including the Surion, T-50 supersonic trainer jet and others. The fraud allegations were first raised in 2015 when the state auditor's inspection found that KAI pocketed some 24 billion won in illicit profits by manipulating development costs in the Surion project. According to KAI's financial reports, the company saw its revenue soar 53 percent to 3.1 trillion won from 2013 to 2016. Its operating profit also doubled to 314.9 billion won during the same period. The government established KAI in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s by combining ailing private defense companies. The government injected about 8 trillion won worth of taxpayer money to salvage the firm.","prosecutors investigating accounting fraud allegations ,build fighter jets locally prosecution ,prosecutors investigating accounting fraud ,the prosecutors also suspect kai ,fighter jets locally prosecution officials","[""South Korea 's"", ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Korea Aerospace Industries Co.', 'KAI', 'Iraq', 'KAI', 'KF - X', 'Korea', 'Ha Sung - yong', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'asian']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34705442  0.54152042

The epicenter of the 5.8 magnitude earthquake was not far from the nuclear facilities. Safety concerns remain as over 600 aftershocks have taken place over the past year in the historic city, which houses six nuclear reactors and related facilities. Experts have warned that recent earthquakes in nearby Japan could have destabilized the fault line in the Korean Peninsula, further raising anxiety among residents following Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.   Paik Un-gyu, the chief of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, visits a fault line located near the epicenter of a 5.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Gyeongju in 2016 to mark the first anniversary of the nation`s largest recorded quake on Sept. 12, 2017, in this photo provided by the ministry. ""Natural disasters like earthquakes could lead to grave disasters because the country's nuclear reactors are located near populous regions,"" Paik said. ""The government will put the priority on the safety of people with strengthened anti-quake measures and shift the focus to safe and renewable energy resources.""To better predict seismic activities, the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, a state geological research institute, said it has been inspecting fault lines in the southeastern region to complete the process by 2021 and expand the study across the nation by 2041. The policymaker said the government will come up with a comprehensive plan for its new energy policy by the end of this year, which will include a nuclear phase-out road map and investment plans for renewable resources. The latest move was in line with President Moon Jae-in's pledge to scrap all existing plans for new nuclear reactors and cancel lifetime extensions for aged reactors to reduce reliance on nuclear power. South Korea operates 24 reactors to supply about one-third of its electricity, making it the world's fifth-largest user of nuclear power.As follow-up measures, a state commission was launched in July to collect public consensus on whether to continue to build new reactors on the country's southeast, temporarily halting construction of two new reactors in Ulsan, located 414 kilometers south of Seoul.In a meeting with local residents and civic groups, Paik said the government will gather public opinions about the early closure of the Wolsong No. 1 reactor and the construction of a nuclear waste disposal facility for spent fuel. The country's second-oldest nuclear reactor was shut in 2012 after 30 years of operation, and its life span was extended by another 10 years in 2015. A decision to build a nuclear waste disposal repository for the heavy water reactor is imminent as an interim storage facility at Wolsong is expected to run out of space by early 2020, according to the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power. ""As an early closure of the Wolsong No. 1 reactor is currently under discussion, we ask for cooperation from local residents to push the plan forward without delay,"" Paik said. ""We will listen to public opinion about a low- to medium-level nuclear waste repository to build a safe facility for residents.""","korean energy minister on tuesday ,largest recorded quake on sept ,fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 ,two new reactors in ulsan ,nuclear disaster in 2011 paik","['GYEONGJU', 'south korean', 'Gyeongju', 'Gyeongju', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Fukushima', 'Paik Un - gyu', 'the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy', 'Gyeongju', 'Paik', 'the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources', 'Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'Ulsan', 'Seoul', 'Paik', 'Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power', 'Paik']",4,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.21728067  0.48687801

According to satellite images released by Planet, the areas near Punggye-ri nuclear test site displays surface disturbances -- they are centered on and around Mantapsan that embraces the blast zones, the North Korean watchdog 38 North explained. The photo also shows clear differences between pictures taken on Friday, two days before the Pyongyang’s sixth and strongest detonation. “The land turbulences appear to be more numerous and widespread than the previous five tests that the communist regime had conducted,” the watchdog, which is linked to Johns Hopkins University in the United States added.  Satellite images show the Punggye-ri nuclear test site before and after North Korea‘s sixth nuclear test. It was also noted by 38 North that there has not been any evidence of a collapsed crater as might have been suggested from the post-test tremor.There have been speculations that the underground tunnels were likely to have collapsed resulting in a quake of 4.1  that followed minutes after the initial shake.Other damages, such as collapsed buildings could not be found and further analysis may be possible with higher resolution imageries when they become available.North Korea on Sunday announced it had successfully conducted its sixth and the strongest nuclear test, hours after a large earthquake was detected in the North Hamgyeong Province. Regarding radioactive materials that may have been released into the atmosphere, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said on Wednesday it is closely monitoring for signs. The nuclear safety agencies here said they have not yet detected any traces of radioactive materials. “We are closely watching over the situation considering the seriousness of the damage such radiation exposure can incur,” Baik Tae-hyun, the ministry spokesman told reporters. A day before in a parliamentary briefing, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon also confirmed that North Koreans living near the test site could have been exposed to radiation after the detonation. Seoul’s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission and Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety revealed that they have not found any traces of radioactive materials, including xenon gas, following the North’s test. They analyzed the data they collected immediately after the nuclear test, Sunday, until noon the next day. Japan on Tuesday increased its estimated size of the rogue regime’s latest nuclear test to a yield of around 160 kilotons, following a revised magnitude of 6.0 by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.“This is far more powerful than their nuclear tests in the past,” Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said. The prospected figure -- upgraded from the previous 70 kilotons and 120 kilotons -- is 10 times stronger than that of the Hiroshima explosion in 1945, which carried a yield of 15 kilotons.Previously, the CTBTO had raised its estimate of the seismic event from its previous 5.8 to 6.1 in magnitude. The estimated figures are recorded differently by institutes in related nations. The US Geological Survey announced the earthquake measured 6.3 in magnitude, while the record of Seoul’s Defense Ministry appeared to be the lowest, at 5.7 magnitude. It said they estimate the latest detonation carried a yield of 50 kilotons.","rogue regime latest nuclear test ,the rogue regime latest nuclear ,after the nuclear test sunday ,rogue regime latest nuclear ,landslides have occurred around north","['North Korea ’s', 'US', 'north korean', 'Punggye', 'Mantapsan', 'north korean', 'North', 'Johns Hopkins University', 'the United States', 'Punggye', 'North Korea‘s', 'North Korea', 'the North Hamgyeong Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'Unification Ministry', 'Baik Tae - hyun', 'Unification', 'Cho Myoung - gyon', 'North Koreans', 'Seoul ’s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission', 'Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Defense', 'Itsunori Onodera', 'Hiroshima', 'ctbto', 'the US Geological Survey', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1952581   0.26162612

There are two launchers and a radar already deployed and in operation on the battery site, formerly a private golf resort. Four additional launchers, which are required to assemble one full THAAD battery, were widely expected to arrive at the site soon, after the government said Monday that preparations were all done to move them. The ministry stressed that it is only a “temporary” deployment and a final decision on the system’s dispatch here will come after a full-scale environmental impact assessment.  Nevertheless, experts see Thursday’s planned rollout of the remaining four launchers as marking a turning point in yearslong debate over the US weapon system, which has prompted pushback from the residents of Seongju and neighboring states China and Russia. Even before the official announcement of the deployment schedule Wednesday, activists and protestors opposing the weapon system started to converge in Seongju to block the launchers’ arrival in the area. “Four additional THAAD launchers will be brought into Seongju early tomorrow  morning,” a protestors’ group said in a text message sent out to residents and activists before 3 p.m., citing multiple tipoffs about the deployment schedule. “We ask all of you to gather here by 6 p.m.” The decision came as a part of the allies’ effort to boost their deterrence against North Korea, which conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test Sunday and has threatened to carry out more provocations, such as ballistic missile launches. The deployment of THAAD has unnerved the North’s main supporters such as China and Russia, which fear that the weapon system would pose a security threat by helping the US increase its military clout in the region. South Korea and the United States have sought to ease concerns, highlighting that the measure is only designed to prevent North Korea ballistic missiles targeting South Korea and the US troops stationed here. “THAAD is being deployed as a response to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat. If the North’s nuclear and missile issue is resolved, the THAAD issue will be resolved as well,” President Moon Jae-in said in his interview with Russian media Tuesday. Meanwhile, political parties, including President Moon’s governing Democratic Party of Korea, welcomed the decision, saying the deployment is necessary in preventing North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats. The minor opposition Justice Party was the only political party to criticize the decision.","seongju early tomorrow morning protestors ,tense wednesday evening as activists ,largest nuclear test sunday ,seoul defense ministry announced wednesday ,schedule wednesday activists and protestors","['South Korea ’s', 'Seongju', 'US', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'US', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'villager', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'US', 'Seongju', 'China', 'Russia', 'Seongju', 'Seongju', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'US', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'North ’s', 'thaad', 'Moon Jae - in', 'russian', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Justice Party']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3061024   0.18269244

Concerns have grown on possible environment damage on US bases in South Korea, including the largest one in Yongsan, central Seoul. A water survey by the Seoul city government showed an extremely high contamination of benzene, 587 times the permissible level. Activists have blasted the Seoul government for its lukewarm stance over the issue, urging the environment ministry to release the rest of the results of the joint environmental surveys conducted with the US Forces Korea.The ministry has revealed part of the reports and refused to make the full disclosure citing the South Korea-US Status of Forces Agreement.Ahn accepted the criticism that the government needs to be clearer about whether it will fully disclose the reports. ""Nothing is in process right now, but we see the need to reach a consensus and tell the US army what we need,"" he said. ""We'll deal with  with much caution because we're more than aware of the concerns stemming from North Korea's latest nuclear threat.""

The provocation overshadowed a China-led summit of the BRICS nation-- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- being held in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the nuclear test “absolutely unacceptable,” after calling a National Security Council meeting. He said the North’s nuclear and missile programs now pose a “more grave and urgent” threat to Japan. “It is significantly hurting regional and international peace and stability. Our country lodges a strict protest against North Korea and condemns it in the strongest words,” Abe said.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  and US President Donald Trump The test came just hours after Pyongyang claimed to have developed a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto a long-range missile and after Abe held talks over the phone with US President Donald Trump on the North’s weapons programs.Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said the ministry has begun flying “sniffer” planes capable of detecting radioactive fallout.Russia also expressed the “strongest condemnation” toward Pyongyang and warned that such continued actions are “fraught with serious consequences.”“This latest demonstrative disregard by Pyongyang of the requirements of the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the norms of international law deserves the strongest condemnation,” the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said in a statement “In the unfolding conditions, it is imperative to remain calm and to refrain from any actions that lead to a further escalation of tension.”It also called for “all interested parties” to immediately return to dialogue and negotiations as it is the “only possible way” for an overall resolution of the problems of the Korean Peninsula. The ministry insisted Moscow remains committed to a joint Russian-Chinese proposal that would see Pyongyang halt weapons tests in return for the US suspending military exercises in the region. The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization also issued a strong condemnation message.Its Chairwoman H.E. Paulina Maria Franceschi Navarro said in a statement, “This is a matter of the utmost concern to the international community and must be regarded as entirely unacceptable in that it poses a grave threat to international peace and stability.” “The announced test is a clear violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions. I call on the DPRK  to fully comply with its international obligations,” she added. The UN atomic watchdog said that Sunday’s provocation is an act that “completely disregards of the repeated demands of the international community.” The test was North Korea’s sixth and far more powerful than any weapon it had previously detonated.Pyongyang declared the test of what it called a hydrogen bomb to be a “perfect success.”By Jo He-rim & news reports","russia also denounced the nuclear ,strict protest against north korea ,also denounced the nuclear test ,china government expresses resolute opposition ,denounced the nuclear test north","['China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'the Chinese Foreign Ministry', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'the United States', 'China', 'BRICS', 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China', 'South Africa', 'chinese', 'Xiamen', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'National Security Council', 'North ’s', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Pyongyang', 'Abe', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'japanese', 'Defense', 'Itsunori Onodera', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'the UN Security Council', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Moscow', 'Moscow', 'russian - chinese', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'the Preparatory Commission', 'Maria Franceschi Navarro', 'UN Security Council', 'UN', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Jo He - rim']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65858221  0.41314963

That phrase, according to Malinowski, suggests the US will use military force to overthrow the regime and impose a different one.""I think if we use that rhetoric it diminishes the legitimacy of the appropriate things we do to defend human rights around the world,"" he said. ""Because if the people of North Korea had their rights, they would choose the right government.

Others said they called until their girlfriends picked up the phone, or put restrictions on how they dressed. Another 37.9 percent of 1,593 respondents, or 603 men, said the dating abuse involved sexual harassment, followed by psychological abuse , physical violence , sexual abuse  and inflicting injuries .In terms of psychological or emotional abuse, 23.1 percent said they had slammed a door or stamped on the ground in anger when they were with their girlfriends. Among those who had committed physical violence against their partners, almost 25 percent said they had touched a partner’s breasts, buttocks or genitals without agreement.About 100 people said they had bruised their partners or left them with small scars. Some even said their girlfriends had passed out or broken a bone. Hong Young-oh, the researcher from the KIC who led the study, said the high number of those who had restricted their partners’ movements stems from the deep-rooted patriarchal attitude of Korean men.“The high number of such actions show that the abusers themselves were not aware of or did not recognize their actions as dating abuse,” said Hong. “But victims who had their activities restricted by their boyfriends saw it as serious enough to say that they wanted to break up.”The study also showed that the acceptability of violence, childhood experience of domestic violence and emotional instability were attributed to various types of violent actions by abusers while dating. Earlier this month, data from the National Police Agency showed that 8,367 people were booked on charges of physical violence against their partners in 2015, up 8.8 percent from the previous year. The total number of physical assault cases here was 305,957 in 2015.In late July, police launched a 100-day action plan to crack down on violence against women amid increased public concerns following a viral video that showed a man assaulting his ex-girlfriend and then chasing her down with a 1-ton truck in Sindang-dong, central Seoul.By Kim Da-sol","man assaulting his ex girlfriend ,criminology 593 of 000 korean ,men said the dating abuse ,they had abused girlfriend while ,dating abuse involved sexual harassment","['korean', 'the Korean Institute of Criminology', 'korean', 'korean', 'Hong', 'the National Police Agency', 'Sindang - dong', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",7,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.59281933  0.32841742

The ministry’s data based on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development prison population statistics shows the capacity rate of the country’s prisons was at about 121.8 percent of their capacity last year as of June, holding considerably more people than they were designed to house. The rate is second highest among OECD member states, following Hungary, whose average capacity rate exceeded 131 percent. The United States hovered around the full occupancy level at 101.6 percent, while Japan’s inmate population remained far below at 66.8 percent. In terms of the number of inmates, 1,098.8 were housed per correctional facility last year, the highest of all the organization’s countries, followed by Spain’s 734.9. Jail population exceeded capacity for the first time in 2012, with 101.6 percent, and has since been on a rise due to lack of budget to expand facilities, the data shows.

But the country, a homogeneous society ethnically, linguistically and culturally for so long, must devise a well-advised policy in order not to follow the same path as Europe, which is struggling with social problems related to immigrants. “Accepting immigrants should no longer be confined to filling jobs in sectors facing labor shortages, nor to finding spouses for unmarried Koreans,” said Chung Ki-seon, director of the IOM Migration Research and Training Centre, during an interview with The Korea Herald. “It should serve as a growth engine for South Korea.” The economic benefits of an open-door immigration policy look clear. IOM Migration Research and Training Centre Director Chung Ki-seon The country is going through a population crisis, with its birth rate remaining one of the world’s lowest and the economically active population -- made up of those aged between 15 and 64 -- starting to shrink for the first time this year. It is set to become an aged society in 2018, with people aged 65 and older making up 14 percent of its population. But Chung called for “controlled” immigration -- selectively accepting highly educated and skilled foreign professionals into the country, while phasing out the current policy of importing low-skilled migrant workers. “If low-skilled, low-waged workers stay for a long time here, they are likely to form the low-income bracket in society and the government will have to shoulder the expenses of providing welfare to them,” she said. At the same time, the country must work seriously on how to integrate those immigrants into Korean society, Chung said, stressing the task would be critical for the country’s future.“Immigrants do not automatically integrate into society and even  who are born and raised in the country of relocation won’t,” she said, citing Europe as an example of this. In European countries, the rise in acts of terrorism -- those committed by Muslim extremists born and raised in the countries -- has raised public anxiety over immigration, with conservatives blaming the open-door immigration policy as the root cause of an increase in social unrest. Currently, South Korea has a narrow-minded and short-sighted approach when it comes to immigration, centering on multicultural families, or immigration through marriage, and the import of cheap labor from neighboring countries, Chung added. The immigration policy should target more diverse types of immigrants, such as ethnic Koreans, foreign students and refugees, she said. “A certain target group should not be singled out as a vulnerable group in need of help and the policy approach to them should be in line with a wider immigration policy,” Chung said, referring to the country’s focus on foreign spouses. In 2016, there were some 152,374 people who moved to Korea due to marriage. In 2014, South Korea ranked 18 out of 38 in terms of the migrant integration policy index, which measures each government’s policies to promote integration of migrants in 38 countries including the US, EU member states and Japan. “To draw up and implement a comprehensive immigration policy, there is a need to set up an independent body with its own budget to take charge of adjusting relevant ministries’ overarching tasks,” she said. As for the issue of migrant laborers, the chief of the IOM MRTC noted the problems of the current Employment Permit System. The EPS was introduced in 1993 to bring in foreign workers in the short term for low-skilled positions -- so-called “3-D” jobs shunned by locals for their dirty, dangerous and difficult working conditions -- to solve labor shortages mostly in the manufacturing and construction sectors. “The cheap labor is seen as benefitting the country now, but it will cost a lot in the long term.”While the system has alleviated the labor shortage at small and medium-sized businesses, the availability of cheap labor has also hurt the quality of jobs such as pay and working conditions, she said. “Employers won’t be motivated to improve working conditions and raise pay as long as they can turn to cheap foreign workers,” she said. “Locals will further avoid such jobs and SMEs will rely on low-skilled foreign workforce even more.” Migrant workers and their advocates have also long taken issue with poor working conditions, low pay and discrimination at workplaces. They even call it modern-day slavery, as migrant workers are not allowed to freely change their workplaces or extend their stay in the country without approval from their employers. “When foreign workers gain skills and expertise, they should be given pay raises accordingly and a chance to reside here longer and bring their families to settle here,” she said. The government is already moving in such a direction. The Justice Ministry said it would allow low-skilled workers only to work here for up to nine years and eight months. These low-skilled workers are holders of the E-9 visa , the E-10 visa  and the H-2 visa . It adopted a point system to allow workers with proven skills to switch to the E-7-4 visa for a longer stay. Chung also called for a tougher crackdown on employers who hire foreigners staying here illegally. There were some 209,000 people, about 10 percent of the foreign population, illegally staying here without valid visas in 2016, according to Statistics Korea. “By allowing unregistered migrant workers to get away, the government has given them a wrong message that it is OK to stay here illegally to earn more money,” she said. “And their illegal statuses give employers grounds to exploit them.”The IOM MRTC was set up in 2009 through a partnership between the Korean government and International Organization for Migration. Funded by Seoul’s Justice Ministry, it conducts research and training to promote the understanding of migrants and migration issues, as well as offers policy advice to the government.

But experts aren’t convinced the bomb could make it all that way intact.They cite lingering questions about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s nuclear know-how.“I don’t think North Korea has a good measure of how accurate the missile is at this point,” said Michael Elleman, an expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “They don’t know if the re-entry technologies will really hold up — whether the bomb will survive the trip.”North Korea has short-range missiles that can hit its neighbors. It has tested an intermediate one that could strike Guam, a US territory, as well as a longer-range missile that could reach Hawaii and perhaps the US West Coast. The intermediate and long-range missiles are still being developed and it’s still questionable whether they can reliably strike targets. The launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, in North Korea's northwest, Tuesday, July 4, 2017.The North must conduct more tests to master what is known as “re-entry” in missile parlance, experts believe. The process involves shielding a nuclear warhead from the high temperatures and force it faces when it re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere at about 15,500 mph .“In principle, Kim Jong Un could hit the United States with a nuclear weapon,” said Elleman, a former scientist at Lockheed Martin’s Research and Development Laboratory who also worked as missile expert for U.N. weapons inspection missions. “In practice, I think they are probably a half-year to a full year away from having something that will work more often than it would fail.”Joseph Bermudez Jr., an internationally recognized expert on North Korean defense and intelligence affairs and ballistic missile development, agrees.“Putting these things all together and making them work is extremely challenging, and they haven’t yet demonstrated a capability to produce a reliable re-entry vehicle, which is what houses the actual nuclear device,” he said. “Remember, they’ve only tested these systems very few times.”Still, Bermudez, said, North Korea is “on track” to figure it out.US officials also think it’s just a matter of time before Kim’s program fully matures.National Intelligence Director Dan Coats told Congress in May that Kim has been photographed beside a nuclear warhead design and missile airframes to show that North Korea has warheads small enough to fit on a missile.That same month, Lt. Gen Vincent Stewart, the Defense Intelligence Agency director, told lawmakers that while Kim must still work on the technical aspects of re-entry, it’s only a “matter of enough trial and error to make that work. They understand the physics, so it’s just a matter of design.” North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  applauding the launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, in North Korea`s northwest. Coats and Stewart testified before North Korea conducted its first test of an intercontinental missile on July 4. On July 28, it conducted a second test of its long-range Hwasong-14 ICBM.The second test flight was captured by a rooftop camera operated by Japan’s NHK television on the northern island of Hokkaido. Elleman, who analyzed the video, concluded that it most likely “disintegrated” before splashdown, suggesting North Korea is still struggling with re-entry.“I think it probably failed fairly late in the process,” said John Schilling, a consultant with 38 North, a respected website on North Korea at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.Schilling said the success of North Korean missiles also depend on the weight of the payload. That’s the weight of the nuclear weapon plus its heat-shielding re-entry system. North Korea is able to make one that weighs between 1,100 and 1,300 pounds, or between 500 and 600 kilograms. One that size might reach West Coast targets, Schilling said. But North Korea would need to make one lighter to strike farther east.""It needs to be light in order to achieve range, but it also needs to be built fairly tough to survive, and those two things are at odds with one another,” Schilling said. “Too light is a problem in that the payload would be too fragile and won’t survive the trip, particularly atmospheric re-entry at the far end.”On Tuesday, a news report said North Korea could now wed nuclear warheads with its missiles, including its longest-range ones that might be able to hit the continental United States. The nuclear advances were detailed in an official Japanese assessment and in a story by The Washington Post that cited US intelligence officials and a confidential Defense Intelligence Agency report.President Donald Trump is warning North Korea not to make any more threats or face “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”North Korea then announced a detailed plan to launch missiles toward the US Pacific territory of Guam, a major military hub and home to US bombers.On Friday, Trump tweeted: “Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.”","korea can put nuclear warhead ,trump is warning north korea ,missile expert for weapons inspection ,involves shielding nuclear warhead from ,north korea can put nuclear","['WASHINGTON', 'US', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong Un ’s', 'North Korea', 'Michael Elleman', 'the International Institute for Strategic Studies', '”North Korea', 'Guam', 'US', 'Hawaii', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong Un', 'the United States', 'Elleman', 'Lockheed Martin ’s Research and Development Laboratory', 'U.N.', 'Bermudez Jr.', 'north korean', 'Bermudez', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Kim', 'Dan Coats', 'Congress', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'Gen Vincent Stewart', 'the Defense Intelligence Agency', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'coat', 'Stewart', 'North Korea', 'Japan ’s NHK', 'Hokkaido', 'North Korea', 'John Schilling', 'North', 'North Korea', 'Johns Hopkins University ’s School of Advanced International Studies', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Schilling', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'United States', 'japanese', 'the Washington Post', 'US', 'Defense Intelligence Agency', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', '”North Korea', 'US Pacific', 'Guam', 'US', 'Trump', 'North Korea']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54665667  0.49837264

Two THAAD launchers and a radar are currently operational at the site, which was previously a golf course. They were installed under the previous government. A representative of local residents was to observe the evaluation. A handout photo made available by the US Missile Defense Agency, 30 July 2017, showing a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  interceptor being launched from the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska during a test of its system. “Considering on-site conditions, we decided to postpone the environmental survey,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement, calling for the cooperation of local residents and civic groups.The THAAD radar is known to emit strong electromagnetic waves, which are detrimental to the human body and environment. Local residents have voiced concerns that the level of electromagnetic waves might be high if THAAD’s X-band radar is in full operation.On Thursday morning, some 100 protesters demanding the suspension of the THAAD deployment staged a rally in an attempt to stop the environmental test. They accused the government’s planned examination of the site of being a way to facilitate and speed up the deployment process. Four more launchers, currently stored at a US base here, are awaiting deployment. Government officials and reporters sought to enter the THAAD site by using a military helicopter, as they were blocked by protesters who staged a rally in front of the only road to the site. However, the plan was aborted due to bad weather.A “small-scale” environmental impact assessment, required for a site smaller than 330,000 square meters, has been under way since December.In late July, the Defense Ministry said it would decide whether to roll out the four additional launchers required to complete one THAAD battery after the comprehensive environmental survey is conducted in accordance with a domestic law. It said the land size of the THAAD battery site is 700,000 square meters in total. By Kim Da-sol","korean government on thursday postponed ,thursday postponed its plan ,100 protesters demanding the suspension ,government on thursday postponed its ,on thursday postponed its plan","['south korean', 'US', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the US Missile Defense Agency', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Alaska', 'the Defense Ministry', 'US', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Kim Da - sol']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37109336 -0.05943629

She was sexually assaulted. In early 2016, the man once again took her to a motel room, this time injecting her with a shot that was “good for women on a diet,” and sexually assaulted her. She told the police she was unable to protest under the drug’s influence. The victim kept quiet, fearing what happened would shock her mother and trigger revenge from the man. In May she learned her friends had also been victims. One of the stepdaughter’s friends had taken the shot described to help shed weight when she had gone over to her house to hang out. She was allegedly taken to a motel room by the man and assaulted. Two other high school friends of the stepdaughter had received text messages from the man, saying, “You resemble my first crush,” “Let’s be in an intimate relationship,” several times.The students, fearing the man, had kept silent. It was only this May that they alerted their school teacher of what was happening. The man disappeared shortly after the police investigation began. He has been on the run for three months now.

The draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would also ban countries from giving any additional permits to North Korean laborers _ another source of money for Kim Jong Un‘s regime. And it would prohibit all new joint ventures with North Korean companies, and ban new foreign investment in existing joint ventures. Egypt, which holds the Security Council presidency, said a vote on the draft resolution has been scheduled at 3 p.m. EDT on Saturday.     The proposed new sanctions follow North Korea’s first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States on July 3 and July 27. The Security Council has already imposed six rounds of sanctions that have failed to halt North Korea‘s drive to improve its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities. The draft resolution condemns the launches ``in the strongest terms’‘ and reiterates previous calls for North Korea to suspend all ballistic missile launches and abandon its nuclear weapons and nuclear program ``in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.’‘ The United States spent weeks following the initial ICBM launch negotiating the text with China, North Korea’s neighbor and ally.  The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, called it the ``most impactful and expansive set of sanctions to date‘’ and said the resolution is expected to be approved unanimously. Agreement on the draft to be put to a vote followed US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson‘s comments Wednesday reassuring North Korea that Washington isn’t seeking regime change or an accelerated reunification of the Korean Peninsula -- comments welcomed by China‘s foreign minister.  Tillerson also said the US wants to talk eventually with North Korea, but doesn’t think discussions would be productive if the North comes with the intention of maintaining its nuclear weapons. North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it sees as a guarantee of its security. The draft resolution reiterates language in previous Security Council resolutions supporting a return to six-party talks with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, expressing the Security Council‘s commitment ``to a peaceful, diplomatic, and political solution to the situation,’‘ and reiterating the importance of maintaining peace and stability in northeast Asia. It also expresses regret at North Korea’s ``massive diversion of its scarce resources toward its development of nuclear weapons and a number of expensive ballistic missile programs‘’ noting UN findings that well over half the population lacks sufficient food and medical care and a quarter of the population suffers from chronic malnutrition.  While the draft resolution would impose biting economic sanctions, the US didn‘t get everything it wanted. In early July, US Ambassador Nikki Haley told the Security Council that if it was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions, and hold senior officials accountable. Oil was not included in the draft resolution and neither are new air restrictions. But the draft resolution would ban all exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. According to the diplomat, coal has been North Korea’s largest export, earning $1.2 billion last year which was then restricted by the Security Council to a maximum $400 million. This year, Pyongyang was estimated to earn $251 million from iron and iron ore exports, $113 million from lead and lead ore exports, and $295 million from seafood exports, the diplomat said. That total‘s over $1 billion. It’s unclear exactly how much money North Korea earns from sending workers overseas but in 2015 the UN special investigator on human rights in North Korea, Marzuki Darusman, estimated it was earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion annually.  Under the draft, countries would be unable to hire any new North Korean workers.  The proposed resolution would also add nine North Koreans, mainly officials or representatives of companies and banks, to the UN sanctions blacklist, banning their travel and freezing their assets. It would also impose an asset freeze on two companies and two banks.

But the assessment result will not change the fact that the US anti-missile system will be stationed as agreed by South Korea and the US, the ministry official stressed.  “The government’s stance is that it will not withdraw its plan to deploy THAAD,” the official said, adding the assessment will be done “as soon as possible.”  The regular environmental impact assessment takes 10 to 15 months, the ministry said, as it requires an inspection of the site in more detailed 21 categories and the process of gathering opinions from the public. “The assessment period can be considerably shortened on the condition that various procedures smoothly proceed as a small-scale assessment was already done,” the official said.The Environment Ministry has conducted a small-scale test on part of the THAAD deployment site -- 328,779 square meters of land -- since December under the previous administration. The small-scale evaluation omits the process of consulting with the public and takes about six months.Seoul agreed to donate the land for the THAAD deployment in two stages: 328,779 square meters first and the remaining 370,000 square meters later, with a combined 700,000 square meters of land subject to the environmental assessment. The Moon administration earlier said that the previous government might have offered only a part of the site to the US Forces Korea to avoid going through the regular environmental impact assessment to speed up the deployment of THAAD. On a site smaller than 330,000 square meters, only a small-scale environmental test is required. President Moon Jae-in ordered a thorough environmental inspection of the deployment site in June after the Defense Ministry failed to inform him that four more launchers for the US anti-missile system had been brought into the country. The Defense Ministry said that it will allow the supply of fuel and extra construction to temporarily run the deployed launchers and facilities for soldiers stationed there. It also said it will take proper measures for residents in the neighborhood near the deployment site, promising to hold public hearings and an inspection of the safety of the launchers if residents want. The delay of the THAAD deployment will likely remain a thorny issue between South Korea and the US, amid continued tensions with North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The allies initially agreed to finish stationing the US missile shield in Korea by the end of this year. The US has underscored the role of THAAD to counter growing threats from North Korea. It has stepped up its pressure on North Korea, with the US Senate on Thursday passing sanctions on the reclusive regime. A local media outlet earlier reported that the US asked South Korea to finish deploying the anti-missile program by March at the latest during working-level consultations ahead of the Korea-US summit last month, but the presidential office denied the reports. Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Lu Kang said that China’s stance on the THAAD issue is consistent and clear, calling on South Korea and the US to stop the THAAD deployment. China has objected to its installation, saying that the missile defense system and its radar system could be used to spy into its territory and undermine regional security. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party and minor Bareun Party blasted the government’s decision, calling it “irresponsible.”  “The Defense Ministry stressing procedural legitimacy when our people’s lives are at stake just shows that its insensitivity to national security is out of control,” said Rep. Kim Young-woo of the minor conservative Bareun Party who chairs the defense committee in the National Assembly. According to a Gallup Korea survey of 1,003 Koreans released on June 16, 53 percent of the 1,003 respondents were in favor of the stationing of THAAD, while 32 percent were against it. Anti-THAAD activists and residents near the anti-missile battery deployment site strongly opposed the plan for the “regular” environmental test, saying the government should instead conduct a “strategic” assessment of the site. The strategic environmental assessment looks into whether the project itself is appropriate, which in this case could signal the possible retraction of the THAAD deployment. They have long protested the stationing of THAAD, citing worries over health and environmental risks from electromagnetic waves emitted by its AN/TPY-2 radar system, doubts over the effectiveness of the anti-missile system in protecting Koreans and Chinese economic retaliation.

Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN special rapporteur on North Korean human rights, said Beijing has been intensifying its crackdown on North Korean escapees, detaining and deporting many of them. The practice is not only fueling the risks of punishment after repatriation, but also generating a “second cycle of separation of families,” he said. “There is, in fact, the tendency to tighten control in the border areas, there is the tendency to crack down on those who finally cross the border and transfer them for detention and there’s the tendency to increase repatriations,” he said in an interview marking the end of his five-day trip here on Friday. His remarks coincide with a Radio Free Asia report Saturday that a group of five family members of a local Workers’ Party official had committed suicide after being apprehended in the southwestern city of Kunming by Chinese authorities, who were transporting them back to North Korea. “There’s a serious issue of the separation of families because sometimes people leave in groups from the North and the groups are split in China; some are fortunate enough to finally reach South Korea but others are detained and repatriated,” he said. “It’s like a second cycle of separation of families.”  Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN special rapporteur on North Korean human rights, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald at the UN Human Rights Office in Seoul on Friday. At a news conference Friday, Quintana also said he has spotted “inconsistencies” in the case of 12 North Korean restaurant workers in China who came to Seoul last year. Pyongyang argues they were kidnapped by agents from Seoul’s National Intelligence Service, demanding their return as a precondition for a new round of family reunions. While the 12 are “safe and living in principle under free conditions,” the envoy said he will continue to work to establish the facts so as to help eliminate hurdles for family reunions, which he called an urgent human rights matter. “My main message is that you need to be careful with your procedures,” the Argentine human rights lawyer said. “Second, which is important, I wanted to be sound to the North Korean claim because they responded to the South Korean proposal invoking the case, and also responded to me in my communication invoking the case again,” he noted, referring to his recent public appeal for a restart of family reunions. During his stay, he met with a defector who aspires to go back to the North after having struggled for years to adapt to the competitive South Korean society and to shake off authorities’ suspicions he may be a spy.The man is not alone in missing his communist homeland. Pyongyang also urges the return of Kim Ryon-hui, a defector who has been asking to return to the North since 2015, saying she is “being detained by force.” Last week, a young female defector known for her role on a South Korean reality TV show stirred furor after appearing in a North Korean propaganda video in which she said life in the South was “like living in hell.” Seoul has dismissed the defectors’ return requests in light of legal and administrative barriers and political and security risks. Quintana stressed the significance in taking greater heed of individual voices to better cater to the defectors’ needs, noting that just like the man, many of the escapees have left their families in the North and China. Without proper care, more people may emerge hoping to return, which would hardly improve their own human rights while egging on social cohesion here. “I really believe that we need to focus on individuals and their rights. This is a person who is supposed to be free here in the South, and you should respect his situation,” the rapporteur said. “In principle, I agree that he should be able to return, but then all other questions would arise including what the situation is like in the North, because he might even face reprisals if he goes back and he might be used by the media, so there are different implications.”  North Koreans work on farm fields along the Pyongyang-Wonsan highway on Thursday in Sangwon County, North Hwanghae Province. Quintana has a task he is eager and determined to tackle: visit North Korea and build a communication channel with authorities there. He has been working on it ever since who took up the job in March 2016 but Pyongyang remains unchanged in its opposition.“I believe that having dialogue is a starting point in trying to build trust and trying to seek the areas of common understanding,” he said. “In the end, I’d really like to help the people in North Korea and offer my services. ... So my objective is to try to have a relationship with the North Korean government and ultimately have a chance to visit the country, and at the same time I will continue to raise my voice on the human rights and the plight of North Koreans.” By Shin Hyon-hee  A video clip from a reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War is shown on a TV screen at the Red Cross headquarters in Seoul on Friday. Following are excerpts from the interview. –Ed. The Korea Herald: We’ve learned that China has recently been stepping up its crackdowns on North Koreans seeking to come to South Korea, currently detaining dozens of them. Are you aware of the tendency, and what do you make of it?Quintana: There is in fact the tendency to tighten control in the border areas, there is the tendency to crack down on those who finally cross the border and transfer them for detention and there’s the tendency to increase repatriations. So the situation has become really serious. It deserves more attention from the international community. I’ve raised these specific concerns with the diplomatic corps that I met here in South Korea because they also have a role to play. What I cannot tell is what other reasons are behind the increase. I’ve heard different speculations regarding the domestic dynamics in China and others. But it is important to address the other reasons, because if you understand the reasons, you might have different answers to address the problem. For the time being, I’m raising my voice and expressing my concern, and I’ve also had communication with the Chinese government already. These are things that I’m doing. During the conference, I commented about not only the plight of those trying to cross the border and being repatriated, but also that we need to understand that there’s a serious issue of the separation of families because sometimes people leave in groups from the North and the groups are split in China; some are fortunate enough to finally reach South Korea, but others are detained and repatriated. They all face the serious issue of separation of families, I’ve met them, and this is becoming a very serious problem, and we need to make it more visible -- it’s like a second cycle of separation of families. KH: You met a defector who wants to go back to North Korea. Do you think he should be repatriated from the perspective of human rights, despite legal and political constraints that make it difficult?Q: I met one man who came to the office to offer me his testimony about his situation. I explored the reasons why he wants to go back, and there’s a combination of factors. First, it has to do with the difficulties to integrate into South Korean society. Second, there’s an issue of being accused of spying activities by South Korean authorities while living here. He went through the whole process of verification when he arrived here at different government facilities where they checked if in fact he had any connection with DPRK  authorities and if he might have an intention of spying. Nothing came up, and he was released, and started to integrate. Then this accusation appeared again, and it was a wrong accusation and there was no evidence. So the bottom line is that if you put all the factors together, he wants to go back. And his son and wife remained in the North. Because of legal constraints and mechanisms, he’s facing obstacles, but he was very clear with regard to his willingness to return.At the same time, the majority of escapees leave their families in the North, and some of them leave their children in China. There’s an issue of family rights and it’s starting to be more visible with respect to the lives in South Korea. And it’s very complicated to address. But at least we need to start making it visible. KH: What can be done by South Korean authorities to address this problem? Q: This might not sound like something very substantive, but it is important to let their voices be heard. Because when you start to understand their problems, and once you understand the problems, you can think about solutions. With all the legislation against the possibility for these people to return, and with regard to the situation in North Korea, it’s difficult to bring solutions to these people. One of my intentions coming here on my second mission and among other elements I addressed is to try to talk to someone in that position; as the UN envoy to deliver messages to make the situation visible, though I don’t have specific solutions so far. I really believe that we need to focus on individuals and their rights. This is a person who is supposed to be free here in the South, and you should respect his situation. In principle, I agree that he should be able to return, but then all other questions would arise including what the situation is like in the North because he might even face reprisals if he goes back to the North, and he might be used by the media so there are different implications. There’s another complex issue coming from the division of Korea and it has to do with the Korean people. KH: From your statement on inconsistencies in the case of the 12 restaurant workers, I sense that there could be a source of controversy in terms of South Korean authorities’ operation in bringing high-profile defectors here. Do you have any advice with regard to this? Q: You’re getting my message. I wanted to make a clear point that I’ve found inconsistencies. I know that it isn’t quite specific, but I was trying to make that point. I’m not talking about the current situation, that’s another issue. They are safe and living in principle under free conditions. What I’m saying is that there are consistencies in the circumstances that they left. This is a group of 12 people. We shouldn’t be just talking about them as one decision, but 12 different tasks at the restaurant and different positions. So there are inconsistencies regarding the situations of each of them. I’m willing to continue addressing the issue with concerned authorities. My main message is that you need to be careful with your procedures, and that’s first. Second, which is important, I wanted to be sound to the North Korean claim because they responded to the South Korean proposal invoking the case, and responded to me in my communication invoking the case again. I came here to have and seek information so that I can say something, not just ignore . I wanted to have communication with the South Korean government, therefore I had to look into the issue and how I respond. KH: Do you know if any of the 12 regret their decision and want to go back?Q: If I knew, maybe I would decide to disclose the information. But to be honest, I don’t know. I have some information about what happened at the moment, but what is their feeling and what they want to do -- it’s a delicate situation. These are people who belong to families living in Pyongyang generally in good positions. There might be implications on my responsibilities to avoid any other negative implications. KH: The UN Commission of Inquiry was a milestone in raising international attention on North Korean human rights. What would be the next breakthrough that the UN and international community may be able to achieve? Do you possibly see a future where the Security Council discusses how to apply the notion of the responsibility to protect to the situation of North Korea and takes intervention measures?Q: Currently the dynamics in New York, among the three UN agencies -- which are the office of the secretary-general, the General Assembly and the Security Council -- are very political ones. The current dynamics are very complicated, with China, Russia and the new government in the US. So in such a time when there’s no flexibilities coming from different institutions and governments, it’s difficult to advocate for the use of the principle of responsibility to protect, and any kind of intervention. This is not a discussion the Security Council has been holding with regard to North Korea. The Security Council has been using and increasing the sanctions regime against North Korea, and there is a committee following up on the implementation by member states on the sanctions, so the sanctions regime is there. KH: What’s your goal as the special rapporteur? Q: What I’d really like is to visit North Korea, because I believe that having dialogue is a starting point in trying to build trust and trying to seek the areas of common understanding. These are very strong and useful elements to gradually improve human rights in a specific region or country.

In the end, I’d really like to help the people in North Korea and offer my services. And it has to do with authorities at some point. So my objective is to try to have a relationship with the North Korean government and ultimately have a chance to visit the country, and at the same time I will continue to raise my voice on the human rights and the plight of North Koreans.","repatriating more north koreans seeking ,been repatriating more north koreans ,repatriating more north koreans ,korean escapees detaining and deporting ,china has recently been repatriating","['China', 'North Koreans', 'UN', 'the Korea Herald', 'Tomas Ojea Quintana', 'UN', 'north korean', 'Beijing', 'north korean', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Kunming', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Tomas Ojea Quintana', 'UN', 'north korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'the UN Human Rights Office', 'Seoul', 'Quintana', 'north korean', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul ’s National Intelligence Service', 'argentine', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Ryon - hui', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Quintana', 'China', 'North Koreans', 'Sangwon County', 'North Hwanghae Province', 'Quintana', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Red Cross', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'China', 'North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'China', 'chinese', 'China', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'China', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'Korea', 'korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'the UN Commission of Inquiry', 'north korean', 'UN', 'the Security Council', 'North Korea', 'New York', 'UN', 'the General Assembly', 'the Security Council', 'China', 'Russia', 'US', 'the Security Council', 'North Korea', 'the Security Council', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Myanmar', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Koreans']",13,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.36722943  0.56293213

Pyongyang's mouthpiece Korea Central News Agency broadcasts about North Koreans relaxing on a beach.There are no indications that the North's economy has suddenly improved since late 2011 when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power on the sudden death of his father and long-time leader Kim Jong-il, an official said.During late Kim's 17-year rule, the North's economy grew just 0.2 percent on average.""North Korea's economic structure is very fragile and is not really set up for high growth,"" the official spoke on the condition of anonymity.The BOK estimated North Korea's gross national income stood at 36.4 trillion won  in 2016. South Korea's per-capita GNI stood at 31.98 million won, which is 22.1 times larger than the North's 1.46 million won.Daniel Pinkston, a Korea expert at Troy University in Seoul, said there seems to be some improvement in North Korea's economy, though he said it is always hard to trust the figures.As North Korea does not release its official economic data, South Korea estimates North Korea's annual economic performance since 1991 based on information provided by South Korea's spy agency and other relevant organizations.Related to last year's growth, the central bank said North Korea's mining industry grew 8.4 percent, the highest since 1999 when it expanded 14.2 percent.North Korea's trade volume came to $6.55 billion in 2016, up 4.7 percent from a year earlier, the BOK said. The increase came despite tightened UN sanctions imposed on North Korea over its repeated nuclear tests and its long-range rocket launches.The sanctions call for, among other things, a ban on the country's exports of coal and other mineral resources to cut off North Korea's access to hard currency.Still, the provision will not apply if transactions are determined to be exclusively for livelihood purposes and unrelated to generating revenue for North Korea's nuclear or ballistic missile programs or other activities prohibited by previous UN resolutions.China accounts for nearly 90 percent of North Korea's foreign trade, and mineral resources are a key part of their bilateral trade.","korea economy grew percent last ,economy grew percent last year ,last year the fastest pace ,36 trillion won in 2016 ,north economy grew just percent","[""North Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'UN', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'the Bank of Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'Korea Central News Agency', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'BOK', ""North Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'GNI', 'Daniel Pinkston', 'Korea', 'Troy University', 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'BOK', 'UN', 'North Korea', ""North Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'UN', 'China', ""North Korea 's""]",8,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.74076188  0.61331332

Presidential spokesman Park Soo-hyun speaks during a press conference at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on July 20, 2017.

The NPS, then a major shareholder of Samsung companies, is suspected of voting in favor of a merger between two Samsung affiliates, which in turn is widely believed to have helped strengthen the group's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong's control over the conglomerate.The Samsung heir, Lee, is currently standing trial on charges of offering bribes to the former leader and her friend Choi Soon-sil allegedly in exchange for the NPS' support for the merger scheme.The spokesman pointed out that another document dealt with how to respond in the case of foreign hedge funds' ""aggressive interference"" in the conglomerate's managerial rights.","presidential spokesman park soo hyun ,former president and her aides ,thursday more than 500 documents ,conglomerate power succession scheme presidential ,press conference at the presidential","['Cheong', 'Samsung', 'Park Soo - hyun', 'Seoul', 'Cheong', 'Park Soo - hyun', ""the National Pension Service 's"", 'Samsung', 'NPS', 'Samsung', 'Samsung', ""Lee Jae - yong 's"", 'Samsung', 'Lee', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'NPS']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.53100693  0.64213932

As part of efforts to secure experienced workers in the sectors facing chronic labor shortages, the Justice Ministry has created the E-7-4 visa for those with proven skills. “The ministry believes that the system will greatly contribute to stable supply of skilled laborers for employers facing labor shortages,” an official from the Justice Ministry told The Korea Herald.Migrant workers pick tomatoes at a farm. According to the ministry, holders of an E-9 visa , an E-10 visa  and an H-2 visa  who have stayed here for four years are entitled to apply. Under the current work visas, foreign workers were required to return to their countries after a four-year and 10-month stay. Few workers, who met strict conditions, could switch their visas to E-7 visas to extend their stay here. “We diversified conditions foreign workers should meet to make it easier for employers to use skilled workers in the crucial manufacturing sectors,” the official said. According to Statistics Korea, there were 962,000 foreigners working in the country last year. Among them, the number of foreign workers on the H-2 visa was 254,950, while there were 279,187 on the E-9 visa and 15,312 on the E-10 visa as of the end of 2016, according to the ministry. Under the new visa scheme, workers, who score more than 50 points, can receive the visa on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers are given points in accordance with their work experience, income, age, Korean proficiency and level of education, among other things.Those holding the E-7-4 visa can extend it every two years upon a review, which will allow them to live here indefinitely once conditions are met. They can also bring their families to the country. As the cap has already been reached this year, the ministry will issue 300 additional visas for the remainder of the fiscal year as part of the pilot program. Next year’s quota for the E-7-4 visa will be set after consulting with relevant ministries at the end of this year, it said. South Korea has been relying on imported labor to fill jobs in the manufacturing, fishing and agricultural sectors, which are shunned by locals, especially the young, for low pay and poor working conditions. A researcher from the Korea Small Business Institute said that the latest measure will help small and medium-sized companies struggling to retain highly-skilled foreign workers. “I think the new visa policy is a win-win for both companies and foreign workers,” said Noh Mean-sun from the KSB. “SMEs can hire workers with skills and expertise and train them in the long term. For foreign workers, they will be motivated to accumulate skills to work longer and earn more money in the country.”Migrant workers were more cautious about the policy. “I welcome the establishment of the new visa, but it will be virtually very difficult for migrant workers to get the visa with all those conditions attached,” said Shekh al-Mamun, a Bangladeshi official from Korea’s first migrant workers’ union.“For example, not many migrant workers are able to make that much income and save that much money in bank accounts ”Activists have long called for the abolishment of the current EPS system, instead suggesting that the government issue a “Labor Permit System” that will allow foreign workers to freely change their workplaces without having to get approval from their employers and to extend their stay here.

Led by Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, who made sound city finance as his top priority, Incheon metropolitan government has carried out a 3-year debt resolution plan and is now seeing their efforts pay off. An official poster that promotes Incheon’s city slogan, “All Ways Incheon.” Incheon Metropolitan GovernmentThe city’s debt was estimated to be around 13 trillion won  in 2014, when Yoo took office, but that is now down to 11 trillion won this year. It is forecast to further scale down to 9 trillion won by the end of the year, according to the city officials. Accordingly, the city’s debt ratio fell from 39.9 percent in 2015 to 24.1 percent this June, allowing it to avoid Interior Ministry sanctions. According to the city, its financial burden stemmed mainly from big-scale projects such as the 2014 Asian Games. The city also repurchased municipal bonds worth 45.3 billion won in June for early redemption. “Incheon will make efforts to reduce an additional 280 billion won worth of debt by the end of the year,” Yoo said during a recent interview. The city government plans to evenly invest in the local social welfare, culture, education and environment sectors as soon as it achieves fiscal stability to promote the welfare of its citizens. Solving its landfill issues was another core project Yoo has pursued throughout his term. In 2015, the city obtained the license to own and manage a waste dump site spanning 15.8 square kilometers of land, shared with Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. The city is to earn waste commission fees worth 75 billion won per year. The municipal and provincial governments were experiencing difficulties finding an alternative dumping ground for a site which was originally scheduled to shut down in 2016 due to pollution and bad odors. The site, which opened in 1992, caters to the needs of around 25 million citizens in Incheon and adjacent areas, according to government data. Incheon City Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok talks of his achievements and goals three years into his term in an office interview. Incheon Metropolitan GovernmentDespite its global reputation as one of the best airline hubs, Incheon has been seeing sluggish developments in its land transportation. It is widely known that its commuters experience difficulties traveling from Incheon to another city. Yoo revealed his dedication to the construction of high-speed underground rail networks, including the Incheon-bound GTX that connects Songdo International Business District in Incheon with central Seoul. Suin Line, a subway line that connects Songdo Station to Incheon Station was also launched this month in an effort to grease its stiff inter-city transportation. The expansion of its transportation infrastructure is in line with the city’s goals to promote its tourist sites and boost its regional economy. The city is currently enhancing access to 168 nearby islands such as Yeongjongdo, which is expected to blossom into South Korea’s own Las Vegas with its proximity to Incheon airport. Its geographical advantage has successfully grabbed the attention of local and international resort and casino operators such as Paradise Group and Hong Kong’s Chow Tai Fook. “My wish is to open an era of ‘great Incheon’ where citizens of the city can experience joy through integration of citizens and local development,” Yoo said. “I also hope Incheon will be able to secure a power for sustainable development and morph into a city that can lead South Korea’s growth.” Yoo’s four-year term is slated to end next year.

Eleven companies, including Seoul Metro, Seoul Facilities Corp. and Seoul Medical Center, are currently preparing for the transition, which would require budget expansions and organizational changes, the city said. Those who will benefit are workers on “unlimited term contracts” only, not all contract workers, the city said. “Improving the treatment of long-term contract positions has long been a concern for us. We decided to get rid of such positions, considering that they do the same work as regular employees,” a city government official said. Employees on unlimited term contracts are paid less, though their job responsibilities and workload are almost similar to that of regular workers. Seoul’s move is in line with President Moon Jae-in’s push to better protect the rights and job security of irregular workers in the public sector. In 2011, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon vowed to reduce the number of contract workers and create more regular positions. Since March 2012, the city government has changed the status of some 8,000 workers under unlimited term contracts into regular positions. By Kim Da-sol","seoul metropolitan government on wednesday ,incheon international airport on may ,12 eleven companies including seoul ,sector in 2011 seoul mayor ,government on wednesday announced plan","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Moon Jae -', 'Seoul Metro', 'Seoul Facilities Corp.', 'Seoul Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Kim Da - sol']",4,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.57514268  0.68271351

The detector appeared to have a tiny camera lens pointing directly toward the bed. The couple talked about what would happen if the detector were actually a hidden camera. Things went downhill from there.A green light came on in the device, with what appeared to be a camera lens pointing toward the bed. “The night became a nightmare after we searched online and found an exact same-looking cameras up for sale on the internet,” the Korean man wrote online. Shocked, they disassembled the fire detector and found a micro-SD memory card inside. The card turned out to have recorded everything that had happened in the room. The couple disassembled the device and found a micro-SD card with footage of them inside the house after entering the room. The footage was recorded in one-minute intervals. “Fortunately we hadn’t done anything that night, but this was an Airbnb house we had previously rented on an earlier trip,” the distressed man said. The couple contacted the South Korean Embassy in Japan for help in reporting the case to police.“People from the embassy came to the police station to offer support. They drove us to different accommodations to stay at for the remainder of the trip,” the man wrote. The couple searched online and found similar-looking clandestine cameras openly for sale.

At the site stretching about 200,000 square meters located in Yanggu-gun, Gangwon Province, the Association of Korean Goral Conservation is trying to restore Korean gorals -- a goat-like animal native to Korea. There, the association is currently raising 26 gorals -- designated as a natural monument No. 217 and grade I endangered species by the government -- to later release them into the wild. Only hundreds of gorals are thought to be living in the wild nationwide. Gorals typically have brown fur with shades of gray and black. They have short, backward-facing horns. They are called “living fossil” and “animal of fantasy” as their legs are short -- relics of an ancient form. Gorals used to live across the Korean Peninsula from Mount Baekdu, which straddles the China-North Korea border, to Mount Jiri. But they are now in danger of extinction due to poaching and destruction of their natural habitat.“As I have observed for more than 10 years, a goral produces a single offspring at a time, defying our belief that gorals give birth to two to three offspring at once,” said Ahn Jae-yong, secretary-general of the association, underscoring the importance of goral conservation efforts.Photographed by Park Hyun-koo Written by Ock Hyun-ju","watch endangered korean gorals roaming ,to restore korean gorals goat ,two hour drive from seoul ,restore korean gorals goat ,endangered korean gorals roaming through","['Seoul', 'korean', 'Yanggu', 'Gangwon Province', 'the Association of Korean Goral Conservation', 'korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Mount Jiri', 'Ahn jae - yong', 'Park Hyun - koo write', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",17,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.64135891  0.47357547

It feels like summer comes right after winter now,” said a 32-year-old office worker Kim Jin-hee.  A child plays by a water fountain in Seoul. It’s only mid-June, but it has been a while since Kim started carrying a handy fan in her bag for the commute, she added. In fact, South Korea is experiencing an early arrival of sweltering summer heat right now, coupled with an extreme drought, which experts say are impacts of the climate change on the Korean Peninsula. The season’s first heat advisory was issued on June 16 for Seoul, with a midday high soaring to 33 degrees Celsius in the capital. Nearly a month before that, the southern city of Daegu has seen the nation’s first issuance of the heat advisory. Not surprisingly, air conditioners are becoming a must-have at home. And the sales of the appliance are not restricted to summer season. According to local retail giant Lotte Hi-mart, the sales of air conditioners from January to May have shot up by 110 percent over the same period last year. Most number of air conditioners were sold in April, followed by March and May, Lotte said. “We started receiving order reservations from January for those who want installation at home. If you order it now, it will take at least 3 weeks up to 2 months,” said Lotte Mart official.But while some industries are enjoying their heyday, health concerns are rising along with heat-related illnesses.As of this week, a total of 58 heat-related illnesses were reported across the country, according to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security.Separate figure by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that at least 2 in 10 patients suffering from heat-related illnesses developed symptoms while indoors, advising citizens to be careful regardless of where they are during the summer heat wave.Medical experts have long warned that rising global temperatures can impact public health because deadly heat can spread infectious diseases and even lead food shortages. “Most believe that heat-related illnesses occur from being directly in the sun. But the biggest cause is the temperature where one is,” said Park Hee-jin, a professor of family medicine at Severance Hospital.“Dehydration, dizziness and vomiting all occur as our body tries to adjust to the surrounding temperature. It is the most basic step to drink enough water to help the body adjust,” she said.To protect health of citizens outdoor, Seocho-gu district office installed some 50 parasol umbrellas by pedestrian crossings in Seoul so passersby can stop and wait in the shade, providing oases in the desert-like concrete streets. The district office said it planned to install 60 more by end of this month.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it activated the main water fountain in Gwanghwamun Square on April 14 this year, earlier than the normal beginning of operations in May. The capital’s public swimming pools by Han River are slated to open this weekend. Jejudo Island’s four beaches, including Hyeopjae Beach, will open this weekend as well, earlier than usual July opening. By Kim Da-sol","south koreans but climate change ,korea once distinctive four seasons ,summer comes right after winter ,seasonal chore for south koreans ,seoul it only mid june","['closet', 'South Koreans', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Jin - hee', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Daegu', 'Lotte Hi - mart', 'Lotte', 'Lotte Mart', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Park Hee - jin', 'Severance Hospital', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Jejudo Island ’s', 'Hyeopjae Beach', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.68403083  1.07818103

Although almost all respondents said they were receiving anti-retroviral treatment for HIV, 70 percent said they had still avoided going to a clinic when it was needed.The economic difficulties faced by respondents were also serious. Although most were college educated and around two-thirds were aged between 30 and 50, only 37 percent were employed full-time.Less than 1 in 10 full-time workers had told their employees they had HIV and more than half of respondents said they had quit school or work because of their HIV status.A separate report released by the National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday found 91 percent of people with HIV said they faced discrimination at work and 83 percent were discriminated against at school.Asked about sources of negative attitudes, the UNAIDS report found media to be no better than general internet comments, with both cited by three-quarters as a source of negative views toward people with HIV. Religious groups were cited by 64 percent.Citing a lack of funding and government support, the authors of the report conceded the limitations of the survey due to small sample size, noting particularly that women were not properly represented. Just one woman with HIV was surveyed, partly because only 7.6 percent of people with HIV are women and there is a lack of networks for them. Kwon Mi-ran, a consultant for Korean Network for People living with HIV/AIDS , which conducted the research with UNAIDS’ support, said more research was required into women with HIV, who faced some specific issues. “Women with HIV face serious stigma and the government’s policies have nothing that addresses women with HIV specifically,” she said. “There are no communities for women to share their experiences and support each other and they are isolated.” Kwon said it was more difficult for women to report sexual assault, partly because of the attitudes of people in the legal system toward people with HIV and partly because of a law that criminalizes acts that can spread the virus.Another growing form of discrimination against people with HIV was that nursing homes were refusing to accept them as an increasing number reached old age.“Antiretroviral treatment is widely available in South Korea, and so most people living with HIV can keep their health. But when they need long-term care because of old age or other HIV-related diseases, there is no place they can go,” said Seo Bo-kyung of KNP+.Only 27 percent said they were confident their medical records would be kept private and 17 percent said doctors had disclosed their HIV status to other people without permission.Despite UNAIDS and World Health Organization recommendations to avoid testing without informed consent, the majority of respondents found they had HIV after being tested without their knowledge. The NHRC report also found discrimination in health care, with 26 percent saying treatment had been refused, and a similar number saying their status was indicated on their bedside charts.“Health care settings should be stigma-free environments to ensure people living with HIV not only stay healthy, but their loved ones and community are also protected from HIV,” Steve Kraus, director of the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific, said in a news release accompanying the report. “It is imperative that we have protective laws and empowered communities.”The report recommends consideration of HIV as a disability to bring it under existing discrimination protections, and for a comprehensive discrimination law. It also calls for NGOs to work with the government.The respondents’ most favored policy is public education on HIV, but Seo Bo-kyung of KNP+ stressed that the quality of that education was important. “In many cases, HIV education is conveyed as a means to deliver homophobic messages and tends to describe people living with HIV as pathogens, and not as humans,” he said. “That is the reason that we emphasize a human rights-centered approach.”By Paul Kerry","korean people with hiv still ,korean people with hiv ,women with hiv face serious ,most people living with hiv ,their employees they had hiv","['korean', 'UNAIDS', 'the People live with HIV Stigma', 'South Korea', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'UNAIDS', 'Kwon Mi - ran', 'Korean Network', 'UNAIDS', 'Kwon', 'South Korea', 'Seo Bo - kyung', 'UNAIDS', 'World Health Organization', 'NHRC', 'Steve Kraus', 'the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia', 'Seo Bo - kyung', 'knp+', 'Paul Kerry']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72687966  0.39861593

Only 50 people will pass this round. Following the exam, which will continue until Saturday, there will be no more opportunities to enter the legal profession through written tests that have nurtured more than 20,000 legal professionals -- lawyers, prosecutors and judges -- in South Korea over the past 54 years.A man looks at the timetable and instructions for the state-bar examination at Yonsei University in Seoul on Wednesday. “I feel sorry for myself as it is my last opportunity after all these years of studying,” Kwon Ho, 40, who has been preparing for the bar exam since 2000, told The Korea Herald during a lunch break on campus. Many of the test takers have prepared for the bar exam for years despite its scheduled phasing-out, refusing to be enrolled at costly law schools for three years to qualify as a legal professional. “The reason I chose to continue studying for the exam is it guarantees a fair opportunity for all. The test result is all it takes to be in the legal profession, whereas law schools require more than that,” said Park Seung-wook, 30, who has been preparing for the exam for six years. “Besides, I have no decent educational background nor family support to enroll in the school, anyway.” The bar exam was first introduced in 1963. In South Korea, the state-administered exam has long been a symbol of “fair competition” and a “rags-to-riches” story as a rare chance to climb up the social ladder for anyone regardless of their academic, family and regional backgrounds. Under the system, those who pass the traditional bar exam receive training at the Judicial Research and Training Institute before practicing law as lawyers, prosecutors and judges. “Law schools’ tens of millions of won in tuition fees hinder fair competition among candidates, making it virtually impossible for poor, ordinary citizens to seek legal careers,” said Lee Jong-bae, 39, a representative of bar exam takers.“Even after students graduate from law schools, the name values of their schools affect their future careers and those with powerful parents tend to get more advantages,” Lee claimed. Rep. Oh Sin-hwan of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party last year proposed a bill to maintain the bar exam. It is currently pending at the Assembly.But the prospects of the passage of the bill appear grim. The Constitutional Court ruled in September last year that the abolishment of the bar exam was constitutional. President Moon Jae-in -- who also become a human rights lawyer through the bar exam -- openly expressed his support for its abolishment.A US-style law school system was introduced in 2007 under the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun -- who himself was a human rights lawyer after passing the state bar exam -- to stem prevalent academic elitism in the legal circle. Though the exam was open to anyone regardless of academic background, the exam passers tended to be law students from a few prestigious schools, instigating the creation of school-based cartels. Under the system, 25 law schools were set up with an aim to draw aspiring legal professionals equipped with varying experience and backgrounds and increase the number of lawyers to improve the quality of legal services through competition. Only those attending the law schools are entitled to an attorney-qualifying exam at the end of their three years of study. But the law schools, which cost students on average of about 50 million won for a three-year course, have been accused of being too expensive and lacking transparency and fairness in their admission process.A student representative speaks at a press conference in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday, calling for the government not to abolish the state-run bar exam. Their opponents claim the law schools only benefit the privileged and discriminate against candidates by age, family and academic background when accepting students. Some of the lawmakers and high-profile figures were embroiled in controversies in the past for allegedly pulling strings to help their children secure entry into prestigious law schools. Lee Ho-young, spokesperson for Association of Law School Graduates, refuted the bar exam proponents’ claims that law schools are taking away opportunities from low-income households. “There are more chances for the less privileged to enter the legal sector,” he said. “It would be more costly to prepare for bar exams for years nowadays without financial support from family. The rags-to-riches story is possible at law schools, too. It is the only way to foster competent, experienced lawyers from various backgrounds.”The Education Ministry made it possible in January for the bottom half of the income bracket to have up to 70 percent of their tuition fees covered by scholarships to relieve the financial burden in attending law schools. “But we agree that law schools’ admission process should be reformed and measures should be enforced to get rid of irregularities in the process,” he added. As the controversy persists, bar-exam proponents argue the bar exam should be administered, too, while the law school system is in operation. “I am not saying that the law schools should be abolished. The bar exam should be in operation so that the two-way system can keep one another in balance through competition,” the bar exam takers’ representative Lee said.Rha Seung-chul, a lawyer and former head of Seoul Bar Association, said that there should be a separate exam to screen candidates. “For those who are unable to afford tuition fees at law schools, there should be a separate exam – not necessarily a bar exam – to grant those selected qualifications,” he said. But law school advocates point out it is inefficient and goes against its original purpose of establishing the law school system.By Ock Hyun-ju  and Bak Se-hwan","assembly in seoul on wednesday ,very last state bar exam ,university in seoul on wednesday ,last state bar exam ,in seoul on wednesday morning","['Yeonsei University', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Yonsei University', 'Seoul', 'Kwon Ho', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park Seung - wook', 'South Korea', 'the Judicial Research and Training Institute', 'Lee Jong - bae', 'Lee', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Moon Jae - in', 'US', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Lee Ho - young', 'Association of Law School Graduates', 'Education Ministry', 'Lee', 'Rha Seung - chul', 'Seoul Bar Association', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Bak Se - hwan']",17,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.15749821  0.09532756

There are signs that Koreans are beginning to take vegetarianism more seriously, as they are increasingly exposed to reports of the destructive impact that meat consumption can have on their health, on animals and on the planet. “When I was young, I wondered why human beings destroy the environment when trees, mountains and other animals do not and why human beings survive at the expense of animals’ lives and suffering,” a 26-year-old office worker Hong Seung-yon said. “I felt guilty and depressed every time I ate meat.” Hong became vegetarian in 1999. At first, she could not stop thinking about the taste of meat. She gradually converted herself to lifelong veganism -- a way of living that eliminates all forms of animal consumption. “In the first year of becoming vegetarian, I still ate chicken and fish. I then quit red meat four months later. After six months, I didn’t crave meat anymore.”Hong is one of a growing number of people pursuing a vegetarian lifestyle here.Although there is no official record available, the Korean Vegetarian Union estimates the number of vegetarians to be up to 1.5 million here, accounting for about 3 percent of the entire population. The number of vegetarian establishments hovers at around 350. To protect the environment and fight against factory farming, many of these individuals choose to go meat-free, ranging from vegans -- who do not eat eggs, dairy products or meat -- to ovo-lacto vegetarians, who do not eat meat, but consume eggs and dairy products.It is no secret that animals suffer in the industrial farming system, and livestock farming is considered a major factor in deforestation and carbon emissions. Others go vegetarian for health benefits or based on religious or personal beliefs.A 20-year-old student who wanted to be identified only as Diol said he refuses to eat meat because he knows what it is like to be discriminated against as a sexual minority. Going vegan is his way of standing in solidarity with another group of voiceless minorities -- animals.“There are things people cannot know or see unless they make an effort,” said Diol, who has been on a strict vegan diet for four years. “It is a privilege that the majority don’t have to care. So I started to care .”The beginning of the vegetarian movement goes back to early 2000s, vegan activists here said.“With the advent of the internet in the early 2000s, people started to share information about vegetarianism online. Foreign books on going meat-free began to be translated into Korean, too, at the time,” said Lee Won-bok, head of the Korea Vegetarian Union. Lee, who has been a vegan for 30 years ago, has founded the Vegetarian Union -- a platform to share tips on leading a vegan lifestyle -- with its number of members at around 25,000 now. “I can clearly see that Koreans are steadily taking interest in being vegetarian, especially those in their 20s and 30s,” he said. “Back in 2000, few people knew what being a vegetarian meant. Now, there is a more positive perception of vegetarianism. There are more restaurants, books and products catering to vegetarians, too.”But the growing awareness is also accompanied by persistent debate over the healthfulness of shunning meat, the “conventional” source of protein.Those against vegetarianism argue that meat is a natural source of iron, zinc and selenium, Vitamin A, B and D and the balanced diet is crucial for one’s body in carrying out metabolic functions.  Lee Do-kyung, a vegan chef, meanwhile, denies the claims, saying there are plenty of plant-based protein sources such as beans. Vegetarians instead point to studies that suggest consumption of meat – especially red meat – puts people at a higher risk of developing diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The World Health Organization classifies diets high in processed meat and red meat as carcinogenic and “probably carcinogenic,” respectively.Lee, who has cooked and developed vegan food for the past 20 years, also pointed out that Korean dishes were originally vegetarian-friendly.“With the nation’s long history of farming, Korean dishes are usually based on vegetables. It has been only a few decades since Koreans began to eat meat following the nation’s rapid economic development in the 1970s and 1980s,” he said.  “For Korean dishes, there is no need for meat. There is plenty of room to develop vegan Korean food,” he said. “Kimchi tastes even better without the usual fish sauce.”In a reflection of Koreans’ growing interest in the vegetarian diet, vegan cafes and restaurants are swarming with Korean customers. “When we opened the cafe in April last year, about 8 in 10 customers were foreigners. Now, I can see a lot more Korean customers than before,” said Kang So-yang, head of vegan cafe Dalnayang in northern Seoul. In the past, Kang had struggled to stick to her vegan lifestyle due to a lack of food joints for those on a strict vegan diet. She ended up opening her own. “I wanted to make it a place where like-mined people come together, eat good food and share their vegan values,” she said. “That’s the way the vegan movement can go on for long.”  Still, being a vegetarian here is not easy. Vegetarians struggle every day to find food options outside their homes and fight prejudice that they are undernourished or peculiar. “It is still difficult to find restaurants offering strict vegan dishes outside. Away from Seoul, there is even less infrastructure for vegetarians,” the office worker Hong said. “Koreans tend to hate me for behaving in a different way and scold me for pursuing an unhealthy diet. They ask me, ‘Would that be enough?’” “But now, I feel less tired and less sick. I cannot return to my old meaty diet,” she said. “I just hope society becomes more embracing of different lifestyles and choices.” By Ock Hyun-ju","korean dishes were originally vegetarian ,depressed every time ate meat ,vegetarians too but the growing ,vegetarians struggle every day ,beans vegetarians instead point to","['South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Hong Seung - yon', 'the Korean Vegetarian Union', 'Diol', 'Diol', 'Korean', 'Lee Won - bok', 'the Korea Vegetarian Union', 'Lee', 'the Vegetarian Union', 'Koreans', 'Vitamin A', 'Lee do - kyung', 'Vegetarians', 'the World Health Organization', 'Lee', 'korean', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kimchi', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kang So - yang', 'Dalnayang', 'Seoul', 'Kang', 'vegetarian', 'Seoul', 'Hong', 'Koreans', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",7,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.34190622  1.16474581

The total number of Koreans aged 15-64 will start decreasing this year to account for just 47.0 percent of the total population by 2065. In 2015, it took up 73.4 percent. Decreased membership means a drop in the rate at which the fund’s revenues increase, according to the data. The rate is expected to stand at 3.45 percent in 2018 and to fall to 2.79 percent in 2021.“The projections reveal that amid a decrease in the number of the working population and low birth rate, the fund would run out much faster than  expected,” NPS’s public relations director Yoon Young-seok told The Korea Herald.The total fertility rate, or the number of children born per woman, remained at 1.25 last year, the lowest among the 35 member countries of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, according to the CIA’s World Factbook.The pension fund, managed by the NPS, meanwhile, is expected to grow in size from 600 trillion won at the end of 2017 to 789 trillion won in 2021, thanks to increased premiums to be collected as workers receive more salaries in line with the inflation rate.By Bak Se-hwan","pension scheme will peak next ,begin to shrink from 2019 ,scheme will peak next year ,will start decreasing this year ,pension scheme will peak","['National Pension Service', 'Statistics Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'decrease', 'NPS', 'Yoon Young', 'the Korea Herald', 'Organization for Economic Co - operation and', 'CIA', 'World Factbook', 'NPS', 'Bak Se - hwan']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22555889  0.13379104

The government must devise fundamental measures,” Rep. Lee Kai-ho, a member of President Moon Jae-in‘s de facto transition team, said during a briefing by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. The ministry said it would look further into the sudden outbreak of the H5N8 virus strain, believed to be less likely in the warm season so far, while continuing carry out culls to curb its spread.Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-woo holds a video conference from his office in Sejong, south of Seoul, on June 7, 2017, with provincial chiefs to discuss joint efforts to contain avian influenza. The bird flu alert was raised to the highest level after the virus was found to be of a highly pathogenic strain of H5N8 that has high death rates. All transportation of live poultry was halted for 24 hours on Wednesday, while small-scale farms with less than 100 livestock were recommended to carry out a cull. Approximately 176,100 chickens and ducks on 66 different farms had been slaughtered as of Wednesday, with the number expected to rise. The first report of the outbreak came Friday, from an owner of a small backyard chicken farm on the southern island of Jeju after his birds died from the disease. All domesticated birds living within 500 meters of the Jeju farm were culled within 24 hours of the first report, and shipments of poultry on and off the island were immediately halted. Amid the ongoing investigation, authorities suspect some infected farms of deliberately delaying reports of the disease and vowed an in-depth investigation into the matter. Min Yeon-tae, head of the Agriculture Ministry’s livestock policy bureau said in a press briefing Wednesday that this year’s sudden outbreak is believed to be largely due to a group of farmers’ efforts to conceal the outbreak. “The nature of these poultry farms are more like distributors, which is why we suspect the possibility of delayed reports out of fear of financial loss,” said Min. The ministry unveiled plans to strengthen punishments for farm owners who delay reports related to livestock diseases or deliberately ignore signs of an outbreak. The current law allows them to be sentenced to up to one year in jail or a fine of 10 million won , but the revised law aims to increase these maximums to 3 years in jail or a 30 million won fine. Concerns over a lack of relevant agricultural knowledge among small-scale farm owners have also been raised. Unauthorized “hobby farms” on 10-square-meters of land or less, which were not subject to government surveillance are now obligated to register with the government. A special quarantine unit will be formed to inspect the trade of poultry and sanitation of bird houses. Close watch over the illegal slaughtering of birds in traditional markets will be initiated and more hygienic packaging methods will be suggested to the vendors. According to government reports, outbreak is thought to have started in a group of birds at a farm in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, which were later shipped to areas including Paju, Gyeonggi Province, and Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province. The Agriculture Ministry suspects the signs showed up in early May based on a retrospective analysis. The outbreak this year follows one of the worst-ever bird flu outbreaks last year, which resulted in the demise of a fifth of the total poultry population here.

He was immediately taken to a hospital and a 119 rescue team performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but he was soon pronounced dead.Police found about 120 capsules of nitrous oxide, balloons and rubber tubes at the scene. Seventeen of the capsules had signs of being used.The National Forensic Service concluded that the cause of death could not be identified. But it said that there was a possibility that the man died from overuse of nitrous oxide. Balloons filled with nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, have grown more popular nationwide, especially in entertainment districts and college towns here, as they are sold at a relatively low price of around 5,000 won .Nitrous oxide can be used as an anesthetic in hospitals and in the production of whipped cream. When inhaled, it allows the user to feel euphoria for about 20 seconds and to become insensitive to pain. It may cause hysteria, damage to the brain and nerve cells, and even death in severe cases when large amounts are ingested. The incident in April was the first death in the country caused by laughing gas. “Although there are no accurate statistics, I’ve never seen this type of accident before,” a police official said.Currently, there are no regulations on nonmedical uses of happy balloons here, as they are not classified as drugs or a psychotomimetic agent. “We are reviewing the measures on nitrous oxide, as it is being used for other purposes than producing whipped cream,” said an official at the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.The US and UK strictly ban the use of nitrous oxide except for specific permitted purposes, such as for medical reasons, as many have died from inhaling the gas in the past 10 years.By Byun Hee-jin","man died from inhaling laughing ,died from overuse of nitrous ,20 year old man died ,died from inhaling laughing gas ,old man died from inhaling","['South Koreans', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the National Forensic Service', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'US', 'UK', 'Byun Hee - jin']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83607179  0.60786998

This provided photo, taken on Feb. 24, 2014, shows flowers placed in front of a photo of Hyunsoo O'Callaghan, a South Korean adoptee, in Seoul as people pay tribute to the boy who was killed by his American adoptive father. Hyunsoo O'Callaghan, born in South Korea in 2010, was killed by his adoptive father Brian O'Callaghan, in 2014, just four months after he was adopted, a National Security Agency worker.The statue depicting a boy holding a butterfly is a replica of the same sculpture installed in April this year at the Daniel School, a school and orphanage for children with disabilities, in southern Seoul. Thomas Park Clement, a sculptor and a Korean-American adoptee, and his wife Kim Won-sook made the matching sculptures.On the website, the US school said the two schools ""share a meaningful connection through their work of providing special education programming for children with disabilities. To mark this new partnership, both schools received a donation of matching sculptures"" from the couple.As a result of plea-bargaining over a trial process that had stretched for more than two years, O'Callaghan pled guilty to first-degree murder and child abuse for the death of his own son in exchange for having his first-degree murder dismissed.

According to the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, in one fourth of the 9,853 reported cases, victims died. Of the total, 2,467 were recognized by the Environment Ministry to have asbestos-related diseases. About 40 percent or 1,006 of the victims have died mostly due to lung-related diseases.Asbestos is defined as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization, as exposure to worn out asbestos materials can cause diseases such as lung cancers and mesothelioma. Asbestos was widely used in the 1970s here to build slate roofs, interior materials, soundproof walls and insulators at low costs.Despite the ban on its use for construction material, there are still a large number of buildings that contain asbestos in the country, posing health threats to citizens amid the frequent redevelopment and reconstruction of such buildings, the report said. Yonhap.Also, the total number of 5,615 victims, including infants, pregnant women and elderly, have filed damage reports to the government as of May for having suffered from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant.About 21 percent, or 1,195, of them have died since August 2011 when the government officially confirmed the link between the health damages of victims and the toxic substances widely used to sterilize humidifiers here until six years ago, the report said. A recent state-led survey estimated that at least 3.5 to 4 million Koreans had been exposed to the toxic humidifier disinfectant.The report also mentioned that 1,763 victims who live around 11 cement factories across the nation and reported their lung-related sickness since 2007 were turned out to having suffered either lung cancer, pneumoconiosis or ventilatory failure.Eight others who reported their difficulty of breathing to the National Institute of Environmental Research were residents living near a briquette manufacturer in southern city of Daegu, the report said. Choi Ye-yong, head of the ACCEH and publisher of the report said that large number of victims from toxic humidifier disinfectant as well as asbestos-related diseases are still suffering other long-term health illnesses and underlying diseases. “While the most common environmental diseases were both lung-related and closely linked to inhaling the polluted air, the government should come up with stronger measures to provide practical damage treatment, not only tallying up the damage figures,” Choi told The Korea Herald. An independent investigative body to manage the damage reports and provide medical treatment based on law should be established to control the number of victims suffering from disease caused by exposure to toxic chemical products or environmental factors, Choi added.","asbestos related diseases about 40 ,000 south koreans have suffered ,853 reported cases victims died ,615 victims including infants pregnant ,million koreans had been exposed","['South Koreans', 'the Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the World Health Organization', 'Koreans', 'the National Institute of Environmental Research', 'Daegu', 'Choi Ye - yong', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'Choi']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.3623395   0.38993028

Some of the birds died off suddenly, which caused quarantine officials to check the farm.The ministry is set to conduct a more comprehensive probe while culling all birds at the infected farm as well as restricting movement in the area to contain further outbreaks.Up till Sunday, poultry from Gunsan was sold to Busan, Jeju, Paju and Yangsan. The government is currently seeking to find out if birds originating from the city had been shipped to other regions as well.Park Bong-kyun, the quarantine chief of the ministry, later pinpointed the southern city of Jeongeup as the origin of the avian influenza's breakout. The virus is believed to have affected Gunsan when chickens sold to a Jeongeup farm were recalled after some of them died, the official said. Reports of dead chickens from Gunsan farm skyrocketed following the recall, he said.Another official from the ministry said it has confirmed the major destinations of the chickens sold from Gunsan, but will still take more time to locate all the buyers. South Korea's southern resort island of Jeju also said earlier in the day that it culled some 10,000 chickens and ducks amid concerns over the spread of avian influenza.Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo highlighted efforts to prevent further spread of the flu.""At this stage, the most important thing is to prevent the avian influenza from proliferation,"" Kim said in a meeting of officials in Jeju Island.

When Kwon Ji-hyun, a 36-year-old working mom, decided to bear it and relocate to an unheard-of village in west Seoul four years ago, there was only one thing on her mind: a daycare center where her child can be in good hands.""I was at a loss for what to do when my mother said she had to move out of town. She was of great help in taking care of my son,"" she said, asking for an alias to be used.She couldn't find anyone to help her care for the baby who was just four years old at the time. All child care centers were booked up and she was so desperate.While searching the Internet for days, Kwon stumbled upon a child care center with one opening located in a village called Sungmisan. As soon as she heard that her baby was accepted, she didn't hesitate at all to move. South Korea`s first ""shared"" child care center The child care center might seem to be no different from others but it is the country's first ""shared"" child care facility where parents are actively engaging in caring for and educating their kids, not to mention its management.In 1994, a few young couples pooled their money and launched this child care center here in a bid to help each other in caring for babies and actively getting involved in ensuring transparency and getting more access to food, education and so on.In pursuit of alternative child care and more involvement in raising their kids, more young couples moved in, naturally turning the neighborhood into what is now commonly known as Sungmisan Village.Building on the initial child care infrastructure, Sungmisan residents -- estimated at around 1,000 in 2015 -- are now jointly running around 70 community activities ranging from a school, cafe, small theater, and food cooperative to small stores tailored to meet their own needs.Through such joint activities, many meet quite often to have drinks over their kids and daily life which brings them closer to the level of first-name friends. An annual festival, group learning classes, and info and news bulletin boards are also making their friendship and community more closely knit. Food cooperative  and community cafe ""Joining in activities at the child care center, I have made many friends, though most of them are older than me. We talk about kids, how to raise and educate them and sometimes share our views on our daily life and jobs,"" Kwon said.""We have gotten close enough to leave our children with those living next door in times of emergency, which you cannot begin to expect while living in a big city like Seoul,"" she added.Sungmisan Village, named after a small mountain in the region and located in Mapo-gu, west Seoul, has emerged as a rare but vibrant urban community steadily growing and getting attention from people fed up with typical life in a large city like Seoul.Seoul, home to around 10 million people, has turned into a megacity teeming with high-rise apartments and buildings over the past few decades.Long gone in the process are the close-knit communities and friendly neighbors, and even casual greetings with those living just next door have become few and far between. Bulletin boards in which villagers share community news Sungmisan has been attracting people especially nostalgic about the ""good old days"" where many things were shared among neighbors, including food and worries about their daily life, jobs and family issues. Such nostalgia and longing to return to those days was stirred recently by a popular cable TV drama ""Reply 1988,"" which featured the daily life of friendly neighbors in a cohesive village in the 1980s. Still, child care and education are the top reasons for many opting to settle in Sungmisan Village.Kong Byung-gak in his late 40s was one who came to the village for education. He sent his two children to an alternative school launched in the early 2000s here, which focuses less on textbooks and rote learning and more on hands-on and ecological experiences. ""It was like an escape from education that makes our kids unhappy. I couldn't have my kids get education solely focused on college entrances,"" Kong said.He now leads a de facto community operation council where major decisions in the village are discussed and made. He recently opened a beer shop that serves as a meeting place for the council and other neighbors. ""This is a place where people get together and chit-chat. Sometimes, a party is held on the spur of the moment. This is fun and we like this small happiness,"" he said. ""You can experience what was featured in such dramas as 'Reply 1988.'"" Sungmisan map There was a crisis that put the fate of the village in jeopardy.When the Seoul government pushed to build a new water distribution system in the Sungmisan region in the early 2000s, its residents staged a strong protest and campaign against it. The movement went on for about two years and the city project was withdrawn.The worst, however, could be yet to come. One of the potential threats is the steadily rising rent of buildings and houses in the region partly buoyed by brisk development and hot spots springing up in neighboring regions such as Mangwon, Hongdae and Seogyo.""Ironically, as we are getting more attention, the rent is rising due to hot spots springing up in nearby regions. This is forcing some of our landmark stores out of the market,"" Kong said.""People say that we can buy happiness with money, but that belief, I think, is destroying human relationships and making them unhappy. I think that enjoying happiness through relationships with people, albeit small, is genuine happiness,"" he noted.","year old working mom decided ,36 year old working mom ,year old working mom ,south korea first shared child ,daycare center where her child","['Kwon Ji - hyun', 'Seoul', 'Kwon', 'Sungmisan', 'Sungmisan Village', 'Sungmisan', 'Kwon', 'Seoul', 'Sungmisan Village', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Sungmisan', 'Sungmisan Village', 'Kong Byung - gak', 'Kong', 'Sungmisan', 'Seoul', 'Sungmisan', 'Mangwon', 'Kong']",4,"[ 0.          6.          0.         ... -0.79221088  0.33353546

The Seoul-based Korean Sharing Movement submitted a request to the Unification Ministry early this month to make contact with North Korean officials to carry out preventive activities against malaria. The approval was made for the first time since Jan. 6, 2016, when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test which brought virtually all inter-Korean exchanges to a standstill. “The government’s position is that we will sternly respond to North Korea’s provocations, but the current severance of inter-Korean relations is undesirable in light of stability on the peninsula,” deputy ministry spokesperson Lee Eugene said at a news briefing. “In this regard, we plan to flexibly contemplate humanitarian aid and other private exchanges within the extent that does not undermine international sanctions.” South Korean individuals and entities are required to obtain the ministry’s approval to visit the North or communicate with its nationals. With many North Koreans exposed to malnutrition, infectious diseases and adverse living conditions, civic groups at home and abroad have been carrying out relief programs. But humanitarian relief has become a source of debate in line with Pyongyang’s unbridled military provocations, as critics say the communist state may siphon off any outside handouts for military and other unintended uses. The former Park Geun-hye administration also took flak for its about-face in its own principle that humanitarian assistance should carry on regardless of political ups and downs. Friday’s decision may signal a reinstatement of the government’s long-held humanitarian principles. Foreign Minister nominee Kang Kyung-wha, who served in various human rights-related posts at the UN, also said Thursday that humanitarian aid should be provided apart from political consideration, calling it a “universal value of mankind.”Last year, the government gave the green light only to Eugene Bell Foundation Korea, an international organization that specializes in providing tuberculosis medication to the impoverished country. The KSM said it will discuss the shipment of malaria prevention goods with its North Korean counterparts via fax and email. Together with Gyeonggi Province, the group has since 2008 been undertaking joint prevention projects with North Korean authorities, dishing out fumigator trucks, diagnostic kits, mosquito nets, drugs and other supplies. If the work proceeds smoothly, it plans to dispatch officials in mid-June to the North, including Rep. Won Hye-young of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea who co-heads the group, according to its Secretary-General Kang Young-sik. “Malaria prevention is a project that’s necessary for both Koreas, because disease and insect pests come and go across the border, so the work should be done in the North to ensure no one contracts malaria in the border areas in the South,” Kang told The Korea Herald. According to Gyeonggi Province, the number of malaria patients in border regions here sharply dropped from 1,616 in 2007 to 339 in 2013. Kang says the joint efforts played a “decisive role.” Since the program’s halt in 2013, the figures have surged again, reaching 458 in 2014, 545 in 2015 and 492 in 2016. “We’ve been unable to carry out the activity for the past four years, and if this vacuum continues for a few more years, the figures would skyrocket again in both the North and South,” Kang said, adding the goods should be shipped no later than May or June, given higher risks of malaria in summer.

The reform panel will also explore ways to restructure the military's top commanding structure, enhance the arms acquisition process, upgrade key weapons systems and boost the morale of the country's 625,000 troops.""All these  tasks are related to the budgetary issues,"" Park said, noting that the new government will seek to jack up defense spending.Moon has called for a phased increase of the country's defense budgets to around 3 percent of the gross domestic product, tallied at US$1.47 trillion, from 2.4 percent now.The spokesman also said that the defense reform will be carried out in a way that will ensure the ""balanced"" development of the Army, Navy and Air Force and promote seamless cooperation among all armed services.The defense briefing was part of a series of policy presentations to the advisory committee formed to make up for the lack of a transition period for Moon. The new president was sworn in earlier this month without any preparatory time due to the March 10 ouster of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye.A major issue at the defense briefing was whether the installation of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on the peninsula requires parliamentary approval although its key elements have already been delivered to the site.On his campaign trail, Moon repeatedly said that the THAAD deployment requires parliamentary ratification, noting that the former government failed to build public consensus on the crucial security decision.Those supportive of Moon's position have mentioned a constitutional clause stipulating that the legislature has the right to consent to any treaty involving an ""important financial obligation."" Seoul has provided land worth around 89 billion won  to host the US battery.However, the defense ministry has insisted that the deployment was not a matter for parliamentary consent as it is covered under the South Korea-US mutual defense treaty already approved by the National Assembly.At the briefing, the issues of retaking wartime operational control from Washington were also expected to be discussed.During the election campaign, Moon pledged to push for the transfer of wartime operational control within his five-year term that ends in 2022. In 2014, Seoul and Washington agreed to a ""conditions-based"" OPCON transfer in light of evolving North Korean threats, delaying the transition previously scheduled for December 2015. They did not set a specific date for the transfer, but observers presume it may come in the mid-2020s.Lee Su-hoon, the chief of the committee's subpanel on security, stressed that the nation has to be able to provide for its own defense -- an apparent allusion to the need for the OPCON transition.""We should strengthen our capabilities to respond to the North's nuclear and missile threats, and push for the OPCON transfer while ensuring a firm South Korea-US alliance,"" Lee said during his opening remarks.""It is time to ensure security not just in our words ... but real security capabilities that can ably safeguard the lives of our citizens and their properties ... The Moon government will, for sure, ensure security.""He also stressed the need to stamp out deep-rooted corruption in the defense industry and enhance the welfare and human rights conditions for military draftees.","thursday the ministry will also ,during the election campaign moon ,moon the new president ,may 25 2017 the reform ,panel to deliver on president","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee', 'Lee Su - hoon', ""the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee 's"", 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'the National Assembly', 'Washington', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'north korean', 'Lee Su - hoon', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Lee', 'Moon']",10,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.58294153  0.30928874

""The decision to extradite Chung has been confirmed by the Danish Justice Ministry and we have begun discussing with our Danish counterparts over when to extradite her,"" the Ministry of Justice said in a statement. Refusing to return to South Korea, Chung, arrested by local authorities in northern Danish city of Aalborg in January, has been in custody at a detention center.According to Danish law, Chung will be extradited to South Korea within 30 days of the decision. Chung is likely to face a probe immediately after she arrives here over allegations she received undue academic and financial favors based on her mother Choi Soon-sil's ties with the former president.Park and Choi -- both in jail -- are standing trial over a string of corruption allegations, including that they took bribes from the country's largest business group Samsung and other conglomerates.","on wednesday danish prosecutors confirmed ,order on wednesday danish prosecutors ,wednesday danish prosecutors confirmed ,wednesday danish prosecutors confirmed that ,on wednesday danish prosecutors","[""South Korea 's"", 'Justice Ministry', 'Denmark', 'Park Geun', 'danish', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'South Korea', 'the High Court of Western Denmark', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Denmark', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun - hye`s', 'Chung', 'the Danish Justice Ministry', 'danish', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'South Korea', 'Chung', 'danish', 'Aalborg', 'danish', 'Chung', 'South Korea', 'Chung', ""Choi Soon - sil 's"", 'Choi', 'Samsung']",0,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.41028354  0.4814972

To that end, the zoo will hold a seminar on the conservation of Amur leopards by inviting renowned zoologist Jo Cook, the head of the London-based Amur Leopard and Tiger Alliance on Friday, Seoul Zoo head Lee Ki-seop said. Cook is also the chief manager of a program to breed and manage Amur leopards at the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. ""We plan to intensively introduce our preparations, including a leopard pen, as Jo Cook's judgment is crucial in introducing Amur leopards,"" he said. While in Seoul, the ALTA leader is scheduled to discuss the zoo's introduction of Amur leopards from Russia or Europe after inspecting their breeding facilities, Lee said. According to the zoo, extinct Korean leopards are genetically identical to Amur leopards, which are currently found only in the Russian Far East and northeastern China. The Korean Peninsula was their major habitat in the past. Many Korean leopards were found on the peninsula even until the Joseon Dynasty . Their population rapidly declined due to indiscriminate poaching during the Japanese colonial rule . Moreover, their habitats were destroyed since the nation's liberation in 1945, and they have completely disappeared without a trace from the peninsula from the 1970s. ""Hence, the introduction of Amur leopards, if realized, virtually means the restoration of Korean leopards,"" Lee said. Seoul Zoo has been trying to introduce Amur leopards for years, and completed a pen satisfying international standards in May last year.At present, some 200 Amur leopards are reportedly living in zoos around the world, and only about 70 survive in the wild.","effort to restore korean leopards ,leopards by inviting renowned zoologist ,the zoo extinct korean leopards ,the zoo will hold seminar ,alliance on friday seoul zoo","['Seoul Zoo', 'amur', 'korean', 'japanese', 'amur', 'Jo Cook', 'London', 'Amur Leopard', 'Tiger Alliance', 'Seoul Zoo', 'Lee Ki - seop', 'Cook', 'amur', 'the World Association of Zoos', 'aquarium', ""Jo Cook 's"", 'amur', 'Seoul', 'ALTA', 'amur', 'Russia', 'Lee', 'korean', 'amur', 'Russian', 'China', 'korean', 'japanese', 'amur', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Seoul Zoo', 'amur', 'amur']",17,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54469168  0.39968178

Controversy has persisted over the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here, which China argues constitutes Seoul’s de facto participation in the US-led global missile defense program. South Korea has dismissed the view, as it has been developing its own missile defense system such as the Korea Air and Missile Defense pre-emptive strike scheme, which it said will be interoperable with -- but not part of -- the US’ systems.In his testimony to the US House Committee on Armed Service last Wednesday, however, US Pacific Command Commander Adm. Harry Harris said otherwise, signaling the ongoing THAAD stationing might be a part of US efforts to build a regional missile defense scheme. “USPACOM will continue working with Japan, the ROK, and Australia to improve our level of staff coordination and information sharing and the goal of creating a fully-integrated Ballistic Missile Defense architecture that must also address the increasing cruise missile threat,” he said. US Pacific Command Commander Adm. Harry Harris Jr. testifies on Capitol in Washington before a House Armed Services Committee hearing on North Korea on April 26. It was not the first time that top US officials laid out plans for a global and regional missile defense initiative, but it was rare for them to specify countries by name as partners. About two weeks before the allies announced the THAAD deployment on July 8 last year, US Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said that the US and its allies should build missile defense to fend off North Korea’s missile threat. During his confirmation hearing on the US Senate Committee on Armed Services in 2013, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, former commander of US Forces Korea, set out his plan to establish an integrated ballistic missile defense system with the deployment of an upper-tier platform such as THAAD, Aegis BMD and AN/TPY–2 radar.South Korea’s Defense Ministry, however, has reiterated its previous pledge not to join the US-led global missile defense program, highlighting that South Korea’s THAAD deployment and the US BMD initiative are “totally separate issues.” “Gen. Scaparrptti’s comment was a part of his explanation as a nominee for USFK Commander about what sort of weapon system will be needed to defend South Korea against North Korea’s ballistic missile threat. It is unrelated to integrated missile defense,” ministry spokesperson Moon Sang-gyun said Tuesday.Although the THAAD platform is not connected to South Korea’s Korea Air and Missile Defense, it is only a matter of time that both systems are integrated into the US-led efforts to create ballistic missile defense in the Asian-Pacific region, analysts noted. South Korea, Japan and the US have been able to share intelligence about North Korea’s missile threats since they inked a trilateral intelligence transfer arrangement in December 2014. Two years later, the two Asian countries agreed to share intelligence without having to use the US as an intermediary. “Now the US is describing THAAD as a part of the US missile defense system in the East Asia. Combined with their demand for payment for THAAD, the US appears to be increasing pressure on us,” said Rep. Kim Jong-dae, a lawmaker of the minor opposition Justice Party and a prominent military expert. By Yeo Jun-suk","president donald trump wants seoul ,donald trump wants seoul ,donald trump wants seoul to ,trump wants seoul to pay ,korea against north korea ballistic","['US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Seoul ’s de', 'US', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'US', 'the US House Committee on Armed Service', 'US Pacific Command', 'Harry Harris', 'US', 'USPACOM', 'Japan', 'ROK', 'Australia', 'Ballistic Missile Defense', 'US Pacific Command', 'Harry Harris Jr.', 'Washington', 'a House Armed Services Committee', 'North Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'the US Senate Committee on Armed Services', 'Curtis Scaparrotti', 'US', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'US', 'South Korea ’s', 'Scaparrptti', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon Sang - gyun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'US', 'asian', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'asian', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'Kim Jong - dae', 'Justice Party']",15,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49932334  0.4817681

Moon of the Democratic Party of Korea garnered 38-42.4 percent of support, maintaining a considerable lead over his four other main rivals, according to three pollsters – Realmeter, Gallup Korea and Hankook Research. His lead over the runner-up was from 18 to 23.8 percentage points, respectively. From left to right: Presidential candidates Sim Sang-jeong, Ahn Cheol-soo, Hong Joon-pyo and Moon Jae-in pray during a ceremony to mark the 2,561st anniversary of birth of Buddha at Jogyesa Temple in central Seoul on Wednesday. The polls, conducted on Monday and Tuesday and released Wednesday, six days before the May 9 election, also showed centrist Ahn Cheol-soo and conservative Hong Joon-pyo in a tight race for the second spot, with the latter extending his strong upward momentum. In two of the surveys, Ahn of the People’s Party maintained a lead over Hong of the Liberty Korea Party by 20-16 or 19.7-16.2. In another, the two tied at 18.6 percent. Despite Moon’s huge lead of around 20 percentage points, political watchers remain cautious about predicting the winner. There are several variables that may drastically affect the shape of the race, they warned. “Many liberal voters seem to have made up their minds . On the contrary, a large chunk of centrists and conservatives have a floating mind as to who they should support,” said Park Sang-byung, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Other political watchers shared the view. While Moon’s support is stable, those of Ahn and Hong are fluctuating and are likely to do more so in the home stretch to the election day. Many right-leaning voters who previously supported Ahn seem to be moving over to Hong, they said. Professor Park warned that actual vote turnouts could be quite different from poll results at the present stage.Moa Online researcher Yoon Tae-gon also forecast that the gap between the front-runner and the runner-up usually narrows in the last stage of a race. “It is hard to predict whether the No. 1 position will eventually be replaced, but the ratings of the second- and third-placed contenders are unlikely to remain similar to the current stage.” Moon’s camp is on alert for a possible upset by conservatives, urging all liberal voters to consolidate behind him. Warning that conservative forces behind the corruption scandal of former President Park Geun-hye are seeking a return, he says more than 50 percent of voter support is needed for him to push for liberal reforms. Meanwhile, the nation’s election law bans publishing of any public opinion surveys that were conducted less than a week before the election. Advance voting will take place for two days from Thursday.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government came under fire Monday for removing some of them recently, allegedly because they were not visually appealing to pedestrians who are not blind.Tactile paving is used for the visually impaired on sidewalks in Yongsan, Seoul. Exact data on how much tactile paving has been removed was not immediately available Monday, but last year, 500 meters of tactile paving was removed from a sidewalk between Sadang Station and Isu Station during a renovation project. More recently, 10 meters of tactile paving was removed near Hoehyeon Station. The removal of such paving from sidewalks is like “a road suddenly disappearing after a night’s sleep,” Hong-Seo-jun, a 37-year-old spokesperson for the Korea Blind Union, an association for the visually impaired in South Korea, told The Korea Herald. The group issued an official statement on April 14, denouncing Seoul’s decision to remove the paving. “The paving exists as a daily guide to protect us from injury and losing our way,” said Hong, who lost his sight when he was 2-years-old after suffering from a high fever. “The government manual on the matter is very vague -- it allows too many interpretations.”An official at the Seoul Metropolitan Government was quoted by local media as saying that the color -- a vivid yellow that tends to darken from age and dust -- could be “visually distracting.” According to the guidelines set by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, sidewalks or routes frequented by those with vision problems must have tactile paving for safety. However, under a manual written by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on sidewalk construction, it states “if there are no ‘risk factors’ on the sidewalk, then the installation of tactile paving is necessary to the point of helping visually impaired pedestrians decide their direction.”The clause does not provide specific taglines on what the risk factors are nor the exact length of the paving. “We didn’t completely remove the paving, but only the parts that were determined ‘unnecessary’ by the district offices,” said Seo Kwan-suk, a spokesperson for the city government.By Jung Min-kyung","bumpy yellow patterns on sidewalks ,impaired on sidewalks in yongsan ,government came under fire monday ,the busy streets of seoul ,on april 14 denouncing seoul","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Yongsan', 'Seoul', 'Hong - seo - jun', 'the Korea Blind Union', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Hong', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seo Kwan - suk', 'Jung Min - kyung']",4,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.15608776  0.14494129

The garrison around Noksapyeong Station has been suspected as the main source of contaminants such as petroleum and benzene that have polluted the neighborhood of Yongsan for decades.The revelation came after the Supreme Court ordered the South Korean government to disclose the results of a 2015 study on underground water contamination found within its proximity. The Environment Ministry conducted several site inspections on possibly polluted 12,000 square meters of land and 7 million liters of underground water around the army base from May 2015, but declined to release the outcome to the public, citing possible diplomatic friction with the US.Civic groups demand the government release information about the level of pollution at the US military base in central Seoul at press conference held near the camp last June. Lawyers for a Democratic Society, a group of activist attorneys, filed a petition with a local administrative court three months after the ministry’s announcement.An internal investigation revealed the average concentration of benzene in the groundwater was 162 times over the safety limit of 0.015 milligrams per liter. Among 14 monitoring wells of 15 to 20 centimeters in diameter, four contained benzene levels higher than the standard, showed the report. “We suspect the environment in the army base to be seriously polluted based on the US defense report acquired by a South Korean civic group,” said the Seoul Metropolitan Government. “We have strongly urged the Environment Ministry to take immediate measures on the matter.”The report written by the US Department of Defense revealed there were at least 84 environmental issues associated with the military base. Along with the recovery of the base, the government has requested specific details and measures on all contaminations, a US-Korea bilateral meeting, and renegotiation of the Status of Forces Agreement. The current agreement only emphasizes the US military’s legal responsibility for contamination within its camp, not adjoining areas. Efforts to recover the area were launched by the city government in 2001 and a total of 5.1 billion won  was invested in the project.

Park, dismissed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, faces a probe on 13 criminal allegations, including graft and abuse of power. Upon arrival at the prosecution's office, Park said she will comply with the investigation with sincerity. The investigation was wrapped up around 9:20 p.m. after more than 12 hours of intense questioning, the longest-running interrogation they have done so far on the former president since she was put behind bars last month.The investigators are planning to conduct one more interrogation on Wednesday before leveling formal charges against the country's former leader.Though prosecutors said they cannot confirm if Wednesday's inquiry will be the last, legal experts say it is likely that they will indict Park before next Monday, when the official campaign period for the May 9 election begins.Park was named an accomplice in her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil's bribery allegations involving South Korea's largest business group Samsung. She is also suspected of colluding with her friend in pressing local conglomerates into donating tens of billions of won to two non-profit foundations allegedly controlled by Choi.Both Park and Choi have denied the allegations.","presidential election begins next week ,their investigation into ousted president ,indict park before next monday ,one more interrogation on wednesday ,investigation into ousted president park","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', ""Choi Soon - sil 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.31392473  0.43504107

And so the whole reasons underlying the development of a nuclear program in North Korea are simply not credible.”US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson North Korea has been decrying South Korea-US joint military drills and efforts to intensify sanctions and pressure as a plot to topple its regime in line with what it calls a “hostile policy.” In recent years, the allies have been scaling up the exercises with the participation of top US strategic assets and special forces tasked with eliminating the North Korean leadership in an emergency. Then the US’ strike in Syria in the middle of a summit between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping last Thursday fueled speculation that could be a veiled warning to Pyongyang. On Sunday, the US Pacific Command ordered a strike group to return to waters off the Korean Peninsula, citing North Korea’s “reckless, irresponsible, and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.” The group, led by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, took part in a military drill here last week and was going to Australia from Singapore. “I think the message that any nation can take  is if you violate international norms, if you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken,” Tillerson said. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” called the diversion of the strike group a “prudent” move, saying Trump has asked for a “full range of options to remove” the North’s threats. “North Korea has been engaged in a pattern of provocative behavior. This is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear-capable regime,” McMaster said.US National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster Though they did not hold a joint news conference nor release a joint statement, Trump and Xi discussed a “full range of options” on North Korea during the summit, including through one-on-one talks, Tillerson said. With Beijing calling for dialogue to defuse tension, the secretary also signaled a halt in nuclear and missile tests as a possible step before a restart of talks, calling for a greater Chinese role in fostering the right conditions. “ have called on the government on China to take additional steps. We expect that they will. They have indicated that they will. And I think we need to allow them time to take actions,” he said. “So what we would hope is that with no further testing, obviously their program doesn’t progress. And that’s what we have asked for, is for them to cease all this testing before we can begin to think about having further talks with them.”In particular, his unprecedented reference to the regime change could be part of a joint action plan the sides may have agreed on, or the US’ efforts to encourage China to do more to change the Kim Jong-un regime’s thinking, a senior Seoul official said. “I have no information on the summit, but the remarks seemed to be a message intended to follow up on what’s agreed on during the meeting, and to strengthen China’s hand in setting it in motion,” the official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “To induce Pyongyang’s attitude toward denuclearization, I believe there will need to be assurances on regime security -- that we have no intention to overthrow the regime -- not by word but through some kind of mechanism.” In another development, Wu Dawei, special representative for Korean Peninsula affairs at Beijing’s Foreign Ministry, arrived in Seoul on Monday and met with his counterpart Kim Hong-kyun, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs at the Foreign Ministry here. They were expected to discuss the Trump-Xi summit and future steps, and explore the possibility for another major provocation ahead of key national holidays, including a party congress on Tuesday, the 105th birthday of late founding father Kim Il-sung on Saturday and the anniversary of the military’s establishment on April 25. Pyongyang has been carrying out a string of missile and engine tests in recent months, with satellite imagery suggesting preparations for a fresh nuclear experiment. Last week, it fired another ballistic missile into the East Sea, though it appears to have failed.“We’ve agreed to take additional strong action if the North conducts a new nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile test,” Kim Hong-kyun told reporters after the meeting, reaffirming their commitment to continue ramping up sanctions and pressure against the regime. Wu declined to comment on reporters’ questions. During his stay here until later this week, Wu is also likely to visit leading South Korean presidential candidates to discuss North Korea policy and China’s opposition to the ongoing deployment here of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system.By Shin Hyon-hee","korean presidential candidates to discuss ,sunday ruled out regime change ,peninsula citing north korea reckless ,nuclear experiment last week ,korean presidential candidates","['US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Syria', 'North Korea', 'ABC ’s', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'State', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'north korean', 'US', 'Syria', 'Donald Trump', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Pyongyang', 'the US Pacific Command', 'North Korea ’s', 'Australia', 'Singapore', 'Tillerson', 'H.R.

The summons date is not negotiable, the official added. A flag of Prosecution Service If summoned, Park will face a grilling similar to her jailed confidante Choi Soon-sil who is at the center of the scandal.“The summoning by prosecutors will possibly take place at the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, part of their efforts to show courtesy to the former president,” said Nam Kyoung-kook, a law professor at University of Seoul Law School.Other observers said Park could be questioned on the seventh floor of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, where Choi had undergone questioning in October. Park’s legal team has yet to let out comments on the prosecution’s announcement. The prosecution’s move comes four days after the Constitutional Court unanimously voted to unseat Park over a scandal involving bribery, influence peddling and systematic leaks of government secrets. The decision stripped her of presidential immunity to criminal prosecution. Upon returning to her private residence in southern Seoul on Sunday, Park said through a spokesman that the truth would be revealed someday, which was largely taken as a continuation of her earlier stance to deny any wrongdoings and a hint at a legal fight against the charges raised against her. Special counsel Park Young-soo, who investigated Park’s scandal until Feb. 28, has booked Park as an accomplice in a bribery case involving Choi and Samsung Group. The state prosecutors have handed over all investigative records from the counsel to continue the probe. If the questioning session realizes, Park will become the fourth president of South Korea to be investigated by state prosecutors after retirement, following ex-presidents Roh Tae-woo, Chun Doo-hwan and now-deceased Roh Moo-hyun. The three were all openly summoned by the prosecution.The prosecution said it will confirm the way Park will be summoned and questioned after reviewing the past practices involving former presidents. Ex-President Roh Tae-woo was brought in to prosecutors’ office in November 1995 over allegations he created a slush fund worth hundreds of billions won. “I feel sorry that I caused a stir,” he told reporters as he stepped into the top prosecutors’ office.A month later, the prosecution summoned ex-state chief Chun Doon-hwan on charges of treason and munity after his crackdown on pro-democracy movement in southern city of Gwangju in May 1980 killed hundreds of the protestors. Chun refused summons by the prosecution and stayed at his hometown, which led the prosecution to detain him and investigate him behind bars. Roh and Chun later respectively received a 17-year prison term and life sentence on charges of mutiny and treason for their roles in the 1979 coup and the 1980 Gwangju Uprising. They were pardoned in December 1997.Former President Roh Moo-hyun, who committed suicide during a probe into bribery allegations involving his family members, appeared before the top prosecutors’ office in April 2009 after his presidential term ended. He said “I am ashamed” before entering the prosecutors’ office.

Last year, a group of lawmakers from the Democratic Party who protested against the plan initiated by President Park Geun-hye visited China to jointly discuss the issue.Woo emphasized China's latest ban on tours to South Korea will hurt the relationship of the two countries.The main opposition party also urged the South Korean government to hand over the issue to the new administration, claiming the matter needs to be approved by the National Assembly.","china latest ban on tours ,over beijing economic retaliation we ,china to withdraw the retaliatory ,suspend tours to south korea ,concern over beijing economic retaliation","[""South Korea 's"", 'Democratic Party', 'China', 'US', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Democratic Party', 'Beijing', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Democratic Party China', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'south korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'Beijing', 'the Democratic Party', 'Park Geun', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'the National Assembly']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.55397385  0.51732415

The move followed the delivery of an official letter from South Korea's foreign ministry to municipalities asking for the relocation, Japan's public broadcaster NHK said Sunday.South Korea's foreign ministry said Thursday it sent the letter to the Busan regional government, the city's dong ward office and the Busan municipal assembly to resolve the diplomatic rift with Japan over the statue. The ministry said that the location of the statue is not desirable given the safety for overseas missions and international courtesy and manners.This file photo, taken on Feb. 3, 2017, shows a statue symbolizing victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery in front of the Japanese consulate general in the southeastern city of Busan. In December, civic groups installed the statue in front of the Japanese consulate in the nation's second-largest city. Japan demanded an immediate removal and recalled its ambassador to South Korea in protest last month. The envoy has yet to return to his post.South Korea and Japan reached a deal on Dec. 28, 2015, under which Tokyo apologized and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for the creation of a foundation aimed at supporting the victims, euphemistically called comfort women.Tokyo argues that installing such statues including the one in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul is against the spirit of the deal aimed at resolving the issue ""once and for all."" According to NHK, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said Friday the South Korean government has expressed there is no change to its position that it will steadily implement the agreement, adding that Japan will seek to have Seoul do so.Kishida's remarks are interpreted as Tokyo's stance that it will wait for South Korea to have the statue removed.""South Korea's move has yet to meet Japan's expectations over the implementation of the deal,"" an official at Japan's foreign ministry was quoted by NHK as saying, apparently stressing the importance that South Korea will manage to have the statue removed.Japan's wartime sexual slavery has been a major source of a diplomatic rift between Seoul and Tokyo.

Chung Yoo-ra, 21, has been in the custody of Danish authorities since she was arrested in this northern city of Aalborg last month.She is under suspicions of receiving undue favors in admission to Seoul-based Ewha Womans University and other academic affairs based on her mother Choi Soon-sil's ties to the president. This file photo, taken from a clip on YouTube on Jan. 3, 2017, shows Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi Soon-sil at the center of a corruption scandal that has led to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's impeachment, holding an interview with Korean reporters at a court in the northern Danish city of Aalborg. The court has decided to further detain Chung until March 22 while the prosecution reviews whether to accept an extradition request made by South Korean authorities. It is the third time the court has ruled in favor of the prosecution's request for an extension since Chung was arrested. South Korean special prosecutors team, led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo, has asked Denmark to send Chung to Seoul for a questioning on a series of alleged wrongdoings in connection to the influence-peddling scandal.The Danish prosecution was expected to deliver a decision by Wednesday, but it said it needs more time to review the documents handed over from the South Korean investigation team. The 21-year-old has so far refused to voluntarily return home to face a probe.  Following the court's decision, she is likely to avoid the investigation's deadline of Tuesday. The team has asked Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend the period for a month, but it is unclear whether he will approve the request.Even if the Danish prosecution decides to repatriate Chung in the near future, she is expected to take the case to court.Chung's mother Choi, whose alleged wrongdoings led to President Park's impeachment late last year, is currently standing trial over allegations she meddled in state affairs and amassed profits using her ties to the president.The president is awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on her impeachment.Special prosecutors are also looking into whether South Korea's Samsung Group supported Chung's equestrian training in return for the government's backing of its controversial merger of two affiliates in 2015.The Seoul Central District Court on Friday issued a warrant to formally arrest Lee Jae-yong, the de facto head of the conglomerate, over suspicions on a string of charges, including bribery and embezzlement.","daughter of south korean president ,park impeachment late last year ,arrested south korean special prosecutors ,her impeachment special prosecutors ,president park impeachment late","['danish', 'south korean', ""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'danish', 'Aalborg', 'Seoul', 'Ewha Womans University', ""Choi Soon - sil 's"", 'YouTube', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'korean', 'danish', 'Aalborg', 'Chung', 'south korean', 'Chung', 'south korean', 'Independent Counsel Park Young', 'Denmark', 'Chung', 'Seoul', 'danish', 'south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'danish', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Choi', 'Park', ""the Constitutional Court 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung Group', 'Chung', '2015.The Seoul Central District Court', 'Lee Jae - yong']",0,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.56897146  0.14480983

The ATM maintenance firm inspected the machines the next day, learned the cash was gone and reported the crime to the police.The police tracked down the suspects after examining security camera videos taken at the scene and determining that employees doing ATM security or maintenance work were likely involved as the time taken to complete the heist was very short and the cash machines were undamaged.","stealing cash from atms at ,chain last week the heist ,the stolen cash 229 million ,tuesday they have arrested two ,with stealing cash from atms","['Costco', 'Yongin', 'Seoul', 'the Yongin Dongbu Police Station', 'ATM', 'ATM']",17,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54088306  0.31418964

204,204,‘Park had 590 calls by burner phone with Choi’,"An independent counsel looking into the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye said Wednesday that Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil made hundreds of phone calls while Choi was on the run in Germany amid the spiraling corruption scandal. The independent counsel said that President Park and Choi had some 570 calls using phones registered under borrowed names from April to late October in 2016, with t...","An independent counsel looking into the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye said Wednesday that Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil made hundreds of phone calls while Choi was on the run in Germany amid the spiraling corruption scandal. The independent counsel said that President Park and Choi had some 570 calls using phones registered under borrowed names from April to late October in 2016, with the last phone conversation made on Oct. 26 a few days before Choi’s return to Korea to face the prosecutorial probe.Choi Soon-sil, a close friend of President Park Geun-hye “President Park had 127 calls with Choi while Choi was in Germany ,” lawyers for the counsel team said at the court, saying that a search of the presidential office was necessary to obtain the evidence.The revelation came as the Seoul Administrative Court held a hearing on the counsel team’s request to suspend and cancel the presidential aides’ disapproval of a search and seizure operation on the presidential compound. The “burner” phones respectively used by President Park and Choi were registered by Yoon Jeon-choo, a Cheong Wa Dae staffer, on the same day, the lawyers said. Choi was staying in Germany to avoid public scrutiny after the scandal surfaced in late October. Earlier last month, former presidential aide Jeong Ho-seong admitted that President Park had used a phone under a borrowed name for security reasons and he personally had paid for it, during Park’s impeachment trial. “It is certain the material to prove it is in the presidential compound. If the search is blocked, it poses a great difficulty to the investigation to finding the truth about the corruption scandal,” the team said.The independent counsel filed a lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court on Friday after presidential aides denied the team’s entry into the presidential compound, citing security reasons. Two focal points are whether the counsel team has the legal mandate to file a suit against another government body to invalidate an administrative action and whether the search is in the national interest. Under Korean law, searching top security sites with state secrets requires approval from the person in charge of the location. But the law prohibits the person from stopping the search unless it undermines the national interest.The ruling is expected Thursday at the earliest, given the court-issued search warrant is valid until Feb. 28 and the deadline for the investigation also ends on the same day. If their request is dismissed, it is “impossible” to execute the search warrant on the presidential office, the counsel team had earlier said. The counsel team has been investigating Park’s involvement in extorting donations from local firms for the K-Sports and Mir foundations, creating a blacklist of left-wing cultural figures and Choi’s meddling in state affairs -- key reasons behind Park’s impeachment. The lawsuit increases pressure on the presidential office amid the continued deadlock between President Park and the counsel team over its plan to question Park face-to-face.  Park’s lawyers and the counsel team are allegedly in the process of discussing the timing and location for the questioning. Park earlier called off the planned interrogation, accusing the team of leaking information to the media. The counsel team appears to have made another last-ditch effort to prove Park’s involvement in the scandal by requesting an arrest warrant for Samsung Group’s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong for the second time a day earlier. Lee is suspected of offering donations to the K-Sports and Mir foundations, both allegedly under Choi’s control, in return for the Park administration’s backing of its merger of two affiliates.By Ock Hyun-ju","friday after presidential aides denied ,corruption scandal involving president park ,an arrest warrant for samsung ,last month former presidential aide ,during park impeachment trial","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Germany', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Korea', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Germany', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Yoon Jeon - choo', 'Choi', 'Germany', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'korean', 'Park ’s', 'the K - Sports', 'Choi ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Samsung Group ’s de', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Lee', 'the K - Sports', 'Choi ’s', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27244431  0.44392037

This file photo taken on June 20, 2016, shows a court hearing under way on Sorok Island in South Korea's southwest for the judges to hear the testimonies on the abuse against lepers that were carried out by the state, including castrations and forced abortions. It was the top court's first ruling after lepers began their legal fight against the government that has been denying compensations.South Korea began to carry out forced abortions and vasectomies on leprosy patients in the 1930s during Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45. The practice, based on the false belief that the disease was hereditary, is known to have lasted until the 1990s.    ""In order to carry out the operations there should have been a legal basis and prior informed consent from the plaintiffs,"" the court said. ""The state failed to meet such conditions in practicing its authority.""Even if the plaintiffs gave a prior consent, they were forced to make such a decision based on prejudice, discrimination and poor social, educational and economic conditions without being fully informed of whether the disease was hereditary or if it can be cured,"" it added.

While the liberal Moon Jae-in is holding onto his firm, but slightly weakened lead, the nation’s acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn appears to be the biggest beneficiary of Ban’s unexpected exit from contention Wednesday. Hwang Kyo-ahn In the latest poll, conducted after Ban’s surprise announcement and released Thursday by Realmeter, Hwang saw his support jump to 12.1 percent, placing himself second only to Moon. With a remarkable 7.5 percentage point rise in less than a week, the acting president rose to second place, formerly held by the UN top official. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. An Hee-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea also pulled off a surprise rise, garnering 11.1 percent support. He took the third place. Moon’s popularity fell slightly to 26.1 percent from 29.1 percent last week. Of the three, only An has formally announced his presidential bid. An Hee-jung Moon is thought to be gauging the best timing to announce his candidacy, but Hwang has not yet made clear whether he plans to run. Political pundits say he appears to be harboring presidential ambitions, making high-publicity moves as the acting president filling in for the impeached President Park Geun-hye. President Park, impeached by the National Assembly on Dec. 9, is suspended from duty, pending a final verdict from the Constitutional Court on her fate. If the top court finalizes her impeachment, an election to pick a successor must be held within 60 days.If Hwang decides to run in the election, he would have to resign from his prime ministerial position at least a month before the election to declare his run. Calls are rising inside the beleaguered ruling Saenuri Party to push for Hwang’s candidacy in the presidential race, as Hwang is seen as the party’s best shot at salvaging its election chances after President Park Geun-hye’s scandal-ridden demise.But his moves are difficult to predict, as he is currently representing the incumbent Park administration as the acting leader of the nation.Other conservative candidates include Reps. Yoo Seong-min and Nam Kyung-pil of the splinter Bareun Party, which broke from Saenuri last December after the faction clashed with the party’s leadership of Park loyalists. The approval rates of the two presidential hopefuls edged up after Ban’s dropout but are still weak, with Yoo’s standing at 4.3 percent and Nam’s, 2 percent, falling far behind Hwang and other liberal candidates. Since his return to South Korea on Jan. 12, the former career diplomat had not been affiliated with any political party, thereby letting loose of his supporters to drift to presidential candidates across the aisle.It is not so clear where the unclaimed votes from Ban’s withdrawal are heading, but some liberal candidates saw increases in their approval ratings as well. As voting results are often seen as to be swayed by regionalism in South Korea, many of Ban’s supporters were thought to have come from the Chungcheong Province from which he hailed. If following this regional tendency, these voters may gravitate toward the Chungcheong Province-based candidate An. Opinions are divided over whether Ban’s exit help Moon’s chances. A competitor from the same party, Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung predicted it may even harm his support.“Though Moon is currently the No. 1 candidate of the left wing, he will have to hit a ceiling ,” Lee said in a local radio broadcast on Thursday. “Moon is indeed in a dominant position now, but has some limits to expanding the range of his supporters.”Another liberal presidential candidate, the People’s Party’s Ahn Cheol-soo, may benefit from Ban leaving the race. “The election dynamics are changing and Ban’s dropout can be seen as an opportunity for Ahn, as Ban and Ahn had somewhat similar centrist stances in politics. He can differentiate himself from other candidates now,” Myongji University politics professor Kim Hyung-joon said. Ahn has been teetering to hold some 10 percent of approval rate in polls, with the latest figure standing at 9.3 percent in Wednesday’s Realmeter poll. Still, Moon is thought to be in high spirits after the exit of his main rival Ban from contention.By Jo He-rim","korean presidential contest are shifting ,in south korean presidential contest ,south korean presidential contest are ,south korean presidential contest ,presidential contest are shifting significantly","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Ban ’s', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Ban ’s', 'Moon', 'UN', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'an Hee - jung', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Moon', 'Hee - jung Moon', 'Hwang', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Bareun Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Ban ’s', 'Yoo', 'Nam ’s', 'South Korea', 'Ban ’s', 'South Korea', 'Ban ’s', 'the Chungcheong Province', 'the Chungcheong Province', 'Ban ’s', 'Moon', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'the People ’s Party ’s', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Ahn', 'Myongji University', 'Kim Hyung - joon', 'Moon', 'Ban', 'Jo He - rim']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.90386087  0.70533955

Voters who disapprove of Moon will turn to our candidate.” The party’s joint founder and potential presidential candidate Ahn Cheol-soo is also expected to benefit from Ban’s departure from the race. “The election dynamics are changing and Ban’s dropout can be seen as an opportunity for Ahn, as Ban and Ahn had somewhat similar centrist stances in politics. He can differentiate himself from other candidates now,” Myongji University politics professor Kim Hyung-joon said. Ahn has held support ratings of about 10 percent, with the latest figure standing at 9.3 percent in Wednesday’s Realmeter poll. President Park, impeached by the National Assembly on Dec. 9, is suspended from duty, pending a final verdict from the Constitutional Court on her fate. If the top court finalizes her impeachment, an election to pick a successor must be held within 60 days.If acting President Hwang decides to run in the election, he would have to resign from his prime ministerial position at least a month before the election to declare his run. Calls are rising inside the beleaguered ruling Saenuri Party to push for Hwang’s candidacy in the presidential race, as Hwang is seen as the party’s best shot at salvaging its election chances after President Park’s scandal-ridden demise.Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn Other conservative candidates include Reps. Yoo Seong-min and Nam Kyung-pil of the splinter Bareun Party, which broke from Saenuri last December after the faction clashed with the party’s leadership of Park loyalists. The approval rates of the two presidential hopefuls edged up after Ban’s dropout but are still weak, with Yoo’s standing at 4.3 percent and Nam’s, 2 percent, falling far behind Hwang and other liberal candidates. Since his return to South Korea on Jan. 12, Ban had not been affiliated with any political party, thereby letting loose of his supporters to drift to presidential candidates across the aisle.As voting results are often seen as to be swayed by regionalism in South Korea, many of Ban’s supporters were thought to have come from the Chungcheong Province from which he hailed. If following this regional tendency, these voters may gravitate toward the Chungcheong Province-based candidate An.South Chungnam Province Gov. An Hee-jung Opinions are divided over whether Ban’s exit help Moon’s chances. A competitor from the same party, Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung predicted it may even harm his support.“Though Moon is currently the No. 1 candidate of the left wing, he will have to hit a ceiling ,” Lee said in a local radio broadcast on Thursday. “Moon is indeed in a dominant position now, but has some limits to expanding the range of his supporters.”By Jo He-rim","korean presidential contest have shifted ,south korean presidential contest ,presidential contest have shifted significantly ,south korean presidential contest have ,the south korean presidential contest","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Ban ’s', 'Ban ’s', 'Moon', 'UN', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'an Hee - jung', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Hwang', 'Park Geun', 'the Democratic Party', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Democratic Party', 'the National Assembly', 'People ’s Party', 'the Democratic Party', 'People ’s Party', 'People ’s Party ’s', 'Park Jie - won', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Ban ’s', 'Ban', 'Ban', 'Ahn', 'Myongji University', 'Kim Hyung - joon', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Bareun Party', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Ban ’s', 'Yoo', 'Nam ’s', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'South Korea', 'Ban ’s', 'the Chungcheong Province', 'the Chungcheong Province', 'an Hee - jung', 'Ban ’s', 'Moon', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Moon', 'Lee', 'Moon', 'Jo He - rim']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88350844  0.60404789

He cited a Senate committee finding that the government has no policy condoning unlawful killings and that the anti-drug campaign was being carried out ""within legal processes.''Duterte, a former government prosecutor, has defended the crackdown and says he and his top police officials have authorized law enforcers to open fire only when threatened by suspects.Police say the deaths of at least 35 policemen and three soldiers prove that suspects have fought back during raids.Duterte took office in June, and since then more than 7,000 suspects have been killed, including many slain in clashes with police. That is an average of 34 a day, Amnesty International noted. The deaths have alarmed Western governments, including the United States and the European Union.The rights group said its investigation found in several cases that ""witnesses described alleged drug offenders yelling they would surrender, at times while on their knees or in another compliant position. They were still gunned down.''It said police officers often appear to have planted evidence and falsified incident reports.It cited a police officer involved in the crackdown in Manila as saying that police and hired killers profit from the killings, with some law enforcers getting paid by funeral parlors for each body brought in.The group said it interviewed two killers involved in the campaign who were paid 10,000 pesos  by a police officer for each execution they carried out, adding they gunned down three to four suspects a week.On Monday, National Police chief Director-General Ronald Dela Rosa indefinitely stopped all police anti-drug raids and disbanded police anti-narcotics units after the anti-drug crackdown was used as a cover by a group of rogue officers to kidnap and kill a South Korean man for money in a still-unraveling scandal.The widely publicized scandal prompted Dela Rosa to form a counterintelligence force to cleanse the 170,000-strong police force of criminals and corrupt officers. He has tried to resign twice but Duterte, who has pledged to defend police enforcing his crackdown, has ordered him to stay on.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court prohibited a group of police officers from entering a slum community to stop them from threatening villagers who have accused the officers of ruthlessly killing four residents in an anti-drug raid.","widespread killings of alleged drug ,000 suspects have been killed ,killings of alleged drug offenders ,suspects police say the deaths ,of ruthlessly killing four residents","['MANILA', 'Philippines', 'philippine', 'Rodrigo Duterte', 'Amnesty International', 'London', 'Duterte', 'south korean', 'Philippines', 'Duterte', 'Ernie Abella', 'Senate', 'Amnesty International', 'western', 'the United States', 'the European Union', 'Manila', 'National Police', 'Ronald Dela Rosa', 'south korean', 'Dela Rosa', 'Duterte', 'the Supreme Court']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49869165  0.3948217

It did not reveal when or why Kang died.Kim called him a ""revolutionary soldier"" who fulfilled his duty in a responsible manner, saying that Kang successfully ensured the operation of regular international and domestic air services, the report said.The visit marked the first time since December 2015 when the North's leader visited a funeral altar of party secretary Kim Yang-gon who died in a traffic accident.

The obesity rate has been rising faster among young children from low-income families.According to recent data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, some 3.4 percent of children under 6 from the poorest 25 percent of families were obese in 2015, above the overall average of 2.8 percent. The richest 25 percent of families reported a rate of 2.6 percent. Overall, child obesity has doubled in seven years from 1.4 percent in 2008.“Kids from low-wage families are more exposed to high-calorie food, such as processed foods, fast food, instant noodles and snacks, since they are cheaper and more convenient,” said Cho Eun-kyu from the National Health Insurance Service’s health care division. The link between obesity and income is found across age and gender, being the most palpable among the young and among girls. Morbid obesity is more strongly tied to financial status, the ministry data shows. That obesity tends to run in the family works to reinforce this correlation between income and weight, experts pointed out. Low-wage parents are more likely to be obese themselves, and create an environment where their children are more likely to get fat, they explained. Dr. Kim Dae-joong of Ajou University Medical Center pointed to a study which shows when both parents are obese, children are 2.8 times more likely to become obese than the average child from parents of average weight. “Studies have shown that family members’ eating habits and diet patterns do have significantly influence on children’s health status, often a deciding factor behind children’s obesity,” said Kim, who is also a policy director at Korean Society for the Study of Obesity. Pediatrician Kim Ki-yeong said children of parents who both work often feed themselves on their own. “They are most likely not under adult supervision to regularly exercise or receive timely medical checkups for their health status,” he said. Cho of the National Health Insurance Service pointed out the perils of unsupervised, unbalanced diet patterns in children, warning eating habits developed in early age tend to continue into adulthood. The medical cost of obesity treatment is another issue. Kim Sung-hyun , 15, is 165 centimeters tall but weighs 95 kilograms, 40 kilograms heavier than his average peers. He is suffering complications of obesity that include high blood pressure and diabetes and has numerous times been advised to lose weight. Yet, the teenager said he has never visited a doctor for medical assistance in weight loss or bariatric surgery. Currently, the national health insurance does not cover costs for obesity-related medical procedures or surgeries. Health experts stress that the government should devise a policy measure to help obese children from the low-income families.  Currently, three different ministries -- the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and Ministry of Education -- have mapped out three different obesity-control policies to run until 2020. “The government should integrate them and concentrate more on improving South Korean’s heath,” said Moon Chang-jin, head of NHIS’s obesity control division.According to a Health Ministry white paper on obesity earlier this month, the authorities will expand support for morbid obesity patients and those with obesity-related disorders and push to revise the national health insurance system to cover medical treatments for obesity patients.It added that they would continue to promote a healthy diet and recipes using less sugar as well as alternatives, expanding the scope of the processed food subject to mandatory nutrition labeling to cereals, cocoa products, salad dressings and sauces.By Kim Da-sol","overall child obesity has doubled ,child obesity has doubled ,child obesity has doubled in ,shaming is rampant childhood obesity ,girls morbid obesity is more","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Cho Eun - kyu', 'the National Health Insurance Service ’s', 'morbid', 'Kim Dae - joong', 'Ajou University Medical Center', 'Kim', 'Korean Society for the Study of Obesity', 'Pediatrician', 'Kim Ki - yeong', 'the National Health Insurance Service', 'Kim Sung - hyun', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare , Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs and', 'Ministry of Education', 'South Korean ’s', 'Moon Chang - jin', 'NHIS ’s', 'Health Ministry', 'Kim Da - sol']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84533519  0.44264656

Women were found to have less opportunities in education, health services and political participation.  They spend about 2 hours and 20 minutes preparing meals and cleaning houses, seven times more than the amount of time spent by men, the SWFW report said. Women also spend more time taking care of children and pets, maintaining cars and buying groceries. Meanwhile, the report noted that men spend slightly less than seven hours at work compared to about 5 1/2 hours for women. Women, however, get 10 minutes less sleep per night than their husbands and spend less time eating meals. After work and on weekends, men have more than four hours of leisure time per day, 49 minutes more than women. Both genders devoted most of their free time to watching TV, playing computer games or surfing the internet. The report also showed that the higher the couple’s combined income, the less time they spend on household chores. A couple with 1 million won  of monthly income spend about 6 hours and 40 minutes per day doing housework, while those who earn more than 7 million won spent about five hours. By Yeo Jun-suk","korean women spend on household ,working mothers spend around hours ,women on housework in 2014 ,household chores is three times ,women women however get 10","['south korean', 'the Seoul Foundation of Women and Family', 'korean', 'the World Economic Forum', 'Korea', 'SWFW']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75068241  0.50033259

There was no move by Japanese planes to approach Dokdo in the East Sea, a defense ministry official said. The intrusions into the zone by the Japanese military appear to be part of Japan's stepped-up efforts to respond to frequent flights by the Chinese military over the sensitive maritime region, he said. Air defense zones of the three neighbors overlap in the area.On Monday, 10 Chinese military planes flew into the Korean Air Defense Identification Zone near Ieodo, prompting South Korea to scramble 10 fighters, including F-15Ks.Previously, Chinese planes crossed into the KADIZ 59 times in 2016 and 62 times in 2015, according to the ministry.The Chinese authorities said its planes were conducting military drills there but Seoul's defense ministry didn't rule out the possibility that the flights were part of China's efforts to show its opposition toward the planned deployment of an advanced US missile defense system to South Korea this year.Since Seoul and Washington agreed to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here to defend against growing missile threats from North Korea, China expressed strong opposition to the plan, claiming that the system could be used against it. Beijing in particular has raised objection to the THAAD's powerful X-band radar which it claims compromises its security interests.  In 2013, South Korea expanded its own KADIZ to cover Ieodo after China included it in its own air defense identification zone, which is designed to give a country more time to check unauthorized planes that may pose security problems.","monday 10 chinese military planes ,said thursday japanese military planes ,kadiz breaches japanese military planes ,thursday japanese military planes entered ,japanese military planes entered south","['Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'KADIZ', 'japanese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Air Defense Identification Zone', 'japanese', 'Ieodo', 'Jeju', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'the Korean Air Defense Identification Zone', 'Ieodo', 'South Korea', 'F-15Ks', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'China', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'Ieodo', 'China']",13,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.34476435  0.75125825

The volume is sufficient to manufacture around 10 nuclear weapons, as one bomb generally requires 4 to 6 kilograms of the material.  “We have come up with this number based on when its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon began operation  how much plutonium it has obtained after using it for nuclear tests,” a Defense Ministry official said on the customary condition of anonymity.  The North has been ratcheting up its threats to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US mainland. On Sunday, Pyongyang vowed to fire the missile “anytime at anyplace,” and its leader Kim Jong-un said the regime has reached the final stage of its ICMB development.   Reflecting Seoul’s mounting concerns, the paper underscored Pyeongyang’s increasing missile threat, describing for the first time that the North is developing the ICBM and submarine-launched ballistic missile and that it has finished deployment of the Scud-ER missile with a range of 1,000 kilometers.  The 2016 report described in detail information about Pyeongyang’s various ICBMs, including the KN-08 and KN-14 with a range of up to 12,000 kilometers as well as the SLBM that the North test-fired last August. Pyeongyang has yet to test-fire the KN-08 and KN-14, which were revealed during a military parade in 2012. “We decided to classify the KN-08 and KN-14 as ICBMs because we want to track their development process,” the Defense Ministry official said. “It is part of our efforts to figure out the missiles’ capabilities and technological process.” The white paper also noted that Pyongyang has made “considerable” progress in producing highly enriched uranium, another type of fuel for nuclear bombs. But the report did not provide information about the specific amounts of weapon-grade HEU -- a material produced by a centrifuge plant usually run in a secretive environment.  Meanwhile, North Korea has increased its number of cyberwarfare troops to 6,800 from 6,000 in 2014, said the paper, reflecting mounting concerns over the growing threat of North Korea’s cyberattacks targeting South Korea’s defense system and socioeconomic infrastructure.  Last December, the military intranet run by Seoul’s Defense Ministry was hacked for the first time, resulting in a number of military secrets being leaked. The ministry suspected Pyeongyang was behind the attack because the code used in the attack was similar to that previously used by North Korean hackers. “Recently, the North Korea military has reshuffled its organization,” said the paper, adding that Pyongyang’s General Staff Department, equivalent to Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, has created a new organization dealing with intelligence operation and increased military personnel for the mission.Kim Jong-un The paper noted that Pyongyang has increased the number of standing troops to 1.28 million in 2016 from 1.2 million two years earlier, highlighting the regime’s efforts to enhance conventional military power despite its decreasing population and shrinking economy.  Specifically, the army boasted 1.1 million troops, 80,000 higher than two years earlier. Among them, 100,000 were assigned to “strategic forces” dedicated to nuclear and missile warfare. The air force shrank from 120,000 to 110,000. The navy remained unchanged at 60,000. North Korea’s army has increased the number of corps-level units to 17 from 15, and division-level units by one to 82, the paper said. The newly established units are dedicated to massive construction missions such as building highways and monuments idolizing Kim Jong-un, it added. “North Korea believes that it will need a more unified command and control system for construction missions glorifying Kim’s legacy,” said the official. “They think the military is more suitable for doing such missions than civilian organizations.” By Yeo Jun-suk","plutonium stockpile reaching 50 kilograms ,manufacture around 10 nuclear weapons ,its plutonium stockpile reaching 50 ,plutonium stockpile reaching 50 ,up to dozen fission bombs","['North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Defense Ministry ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Yongbyon', 'Defense Ministry', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'ICMB', 'Seoul', 'Pyeongyang ’s', 'icbm', 'Pyeongyang ’s', 'SLBM', 'Pyeongyang', 'kn-08', 'Defense Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'HEU', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Pyeongyang', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'General Staff Department', 'Seoul', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'Kim ’s']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.7822988   0.68809289

They were indicted Tuesday and charged with participating in an international bribery scheme.Former UN chief Ban Ki-moonBan Ki-sang, the 69-year-old brother of the former UN chief, and his son, Ban Joo-hyun, 38, arranged to pay a $500,000 bribe upfront to the head of a Middle Eastern sovereign fund to buy the complex for $800 million, and another $2 million payment when the deal was closed, according to the indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court.He allegedly blew the $500,000 on luxuries, including expensive restaurants and hotels and a penthouse apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, according to the indictment. A fourth man, Sang Woo, 35, of Edgewater, New Jersey, was also charged, with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the anti-bribery law.Lawyers for the four couldn’t immediately be contacted for comment. Bahn and Woo were arrested and were scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday, authorities said. Ban and Harris remain at large, authorities said. Landmark 72The skyscraper complex, known as Landmark 72, consists of two 48-story residential towers and a 72-story office tower that was the tallest in the region in 2012, when it was completed. It was built for about $1 billion by Keangnam Enterprises Ltd, a South Korean firm where Ban was a senior executive.In early 2013, the company struggled to make debt payments that were coming due and was looking for an investor or buyer who could ease the cash crunch, according to court records.Ban convinced the firm to hire his son to find an investor. Bahn, who also went by “Dennis,” was working for a New York commercial real estate broker at the time and stood to make a commission of at least $5 million, prosecutors said.Instead, the father-and-son team devised a scheme to bribe the unidentified Middle Eastern official through Harris, who held himself out as an insider who could use his influence to get the sovereign fund to buy the complex. Harris told Bahn to use the word ""roses"" for the bribe payment.Believing the bribe scheme would eventually work, Bahn allegedly created phony e-mails and other records to make it appear the deal with the sovereign wealth fund was coming together.

The two sides agreed to work closely together to get China to vigorously enforce sanctions, he said. ""National Security Advisor-designate Flynn expressed a strong willingness to strengthen the Korea-US alliance, comparing the alliance to a sticky rice cake,"" Kim said at a briefing to South Korean correspondents.National Security Adviser-designate Michael Flynn waits for an elevator at Trump Tower in New York It is the latest in a series of remarks that Flynn has made to dispel concerns about the fate of the alliance and underscore the point that the incoming administration of Donald Trump will do everything to move relations with South Korea forward. Trump's election had raised questions about the fate of the alliance, as he has expressed deeply negative views of US security commitments overseas, as well as a willingness to withdraw 28,500 American troops from the South unless Seoul pays more for them. Since his election, however, Trump has shown signs of retreat from his campaign rhetoric, making remarks reaffirming the alliance with South Korea and filling some key posts with Flynn and other people valuing the alliance. The sides also reaffirmed their plan to deploy the THAAD missile defense system in the South, Kim said. ""THAAD is a purely defensive weapon.

The aircrafts also entered an equivalent air defense zone near the Tsushima Strait of Japan. In response, the South Korea military sent out 10 fighter jets, including F-15Ks and KF-16s. They sent a warning signal to the Chinese planes who, the Korean military said, were in and out of the KADIZ until they exit the area without conflict.It was not the first time that Chinese aircrafts have entered the area since it was expanded in 2013. This latest action has, however, prompted fresh speculation over China’s motive in light of its clashes with Seoul over its decision to station the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here. “ gave us the answer that it was for training purposes,” said a JCS official on the customary condition of anonymity. “We believe they have a different purpose at different times. It needs further analysis to find out what they were getting at.” Beijing has adopted a series of retaliatory measures against Seoul since it reached an agreement with the US to deploy the THAAD battery here last July. Not only did China impose punitive trade measures against Korean companies, it has even banned Korean actors and actresses from appearing on its shows.During a meeting on Jan. 4 with lawmakers of Korea’s main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi condemned Seoul’s decision to deploy THAAD, saying the process should be “delayed and frozen” if South Korea wants to expand cooperation with Beijing.Air defense identification zones have been a friction point among Northeast Asian countries who have endured decadeslong territorial disputes. The conflicts have been further exacerbated by China, which has recently become assertive over its territorial claims, prompting protests from neighboring states.   Particularly, Beijing’s ADIZ in the East China Sea unveiled in 2013 drew protests from Korea, Japan and the US, as it includes spaces over the South Korea-controlled Ieodo, a submerged rock located around 150 kilometers southwest of Jeju, as well as a chain of islands controlled by Japan and claimed by China. The measure prompted Korea and Japan to declare their own ADIZs. Seoul, for its part, expanded its own KADIZ to cover Ieodo, on which it has scientific research facilities. Prior to the expansion, Korea’s ADIZ, demarcated by the US in 1951 during the Korean War, did not cover Ieodo. Since the ADIZs are not officially recognized airspace, military officials noted, states are not able to exercise sovereign rights to evict aircrafts flying over them. Instead, individual states can issue warnings to other nations who enter the area without prior notice. “Under the KADIZ, we are only allowed to detect and track unidentified aircrafts. We are not able to take forcible measures to evict those who intrude in the zone. It is different from what we can do in the airspace,” said the JCS official. According to the JCS, Chinese military planes intruded into the KADIZ on more than a dozen occasions last year. But the incident Monday was “unusual,” they said, because it involved more than 10 aircrafts. In 2015, there were only few aircrafts flying into the area. Mounting tensions over the air defense areas has spurred the call for building a proper communication channel between Korea, China and Japan -- such as to inform each other of their entry into the areas and to take preventive measures to prevent potential armed conflicts. Currently, the three countries are not obliged to notify each other of their entry into the ADIZs, the JCS said. South Korea often shares flight information with Japan when their aircrafts fly along the ADIZs under bilateral agreement. It has not yet to make such a pact with China.By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday after beijing fighter jets ,some 10 chinese military planes ,china flared up tuesday after ,flared up tuesday after beijing ,2013 drew protests from korea","['South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'US', 'the Korea ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'chinese', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'F-15Ks', 'KF-16s', 'chinese', 'korean', 'chinese', 'China', 'Seoul', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'JCS', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'US', 'China', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'northeast asian', 'China', 'Beijing ’s', 'ADIZ', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Ieodo', 'Jeju', 'Japan', 'China', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Ieodo', 'Korea', 'ADIZ', 'US', 'JCS', 'JCS', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'JCS', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",16,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.42540812  0.60671812

For 2-year-olds, the average is 2.6 times a week and 47.6 minutes per session. The findings are based on a survey conducted between August and October last year on 1,241 parents with children aged 2 or 5. There were 537 of them with 2-year-olds and the remaining 704 had 5-year-olds.Multiple signs for hagwons, or cram schools, are seen in downtown Seoul Korean language, sports and arts were the most common subjects for private education for the children, followed by English. The report encompassed private academies, known as hagwon here, as well as private tutoring and home learning programs. In many cases, 5-year-olds attend normal kindergarten classes by day and go to a hagwon for after-school studies, the report found. The after-school sessions last as long as four hours, it added.  Nearly 70 percent of the surveyed parents with 2-year-olds said the level of their child’s education was adequate, with 27 percent saying it was not enough. As for those with 5-year-olds, 54.3 percent of the parents said their education level was adequate, while 40 percent said they needed more. “Children, especially at a younger age, should be able to build a healthy relationship with their parents during the critical early years, which would later help them to get along with their peers. Spending most of their time at a hagwon is a hurdle to the process,” Kim Eun-young, who headed the study, told The Korea Herald. She warned that excessive education at an early age could led to notable problems, such as depression and lack of concentration, or even the development of aggressive forms of behavior.  By Bak Se-hwan","54 percent of the parents ,private education study revealed monday ,korean kid receives private education ,year old korean kid receives ,last year on 241 parents","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education', 'korean', 'Seoul korean', 'Kim Eun - young', 'the Korea Herald', 'Bak Se - hwan']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65333885  0.41990316
