According to Radio Free Asia, the defector who was a researcher at the physics center of the State Academy of Sciences in Pyongyang took poison in a state security cell while awaiting interrogation. “He killed himself only a few hours after he was placed in solitary confinement at the State Security Department in Sinuiju city,” the broadcaster quoted a source from North Hamgyong Province as saying on condition of anonymity. “He died before he could be questioned about the reasons for his escape, who had helped him, and what his route had been.”The scientist, reportedly identified as Huh Hyun-cheol who was in his early 50s, had been detained in Shenyang, China, on Nov. 4. He was sent back to Sinuiju in the North on Nov. 17, according to the report. Huh must have been searched many times on his way to the city just across the border from China, but it was not known how he was able to conceal the poison, according to the source. The source also told RFA that Huh disappeared after taking vacation leave from his job because he was showing signs of anxiety over his research projects.By Jo He-rim","interrogation yonhap he killed ,defect north korean nuclear ,scientist takes own life ,yonhap he killed himself ,nuclear scientist takes own","['north korean', 'China', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Radio Free Asia', 'the State Academy of Sciences', 'Pyongyang']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.29677778  0.14276637

UNSC Resolution 2375, adopted in September, bans member countries from ship-to-ship transfer of any goods for North Korea. Resolution 2397, adopted just a week earlier allows a country to capture and look into a vessel suspected of engaging in prohibited activities with North Korea.  This composite photo of oil transfer between China and North Korea is captured from the website of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Hong Kong-flagged ship was chartered by Taiwanese company Billions Bunker Group and previously visited South Korea's Yeosu Port on Oct. 11 to load up on Japanese refined petroleum and head to its claimed destination in Taiwan four days later, the authorities noted. Instead of going to Taiwan, however, the vessel transferred the oil to a North Korean ship, the Sam Jong 2, and three other non-North Korean vessels in international waters in the East China Sea, they said. ""The actions taken will be reported to the UNSC sanctions committee on North Korea in the future,"" according to the authorities. ""This marks a typical case of North Korea shrewdly circumventing UNSC sanctions by using its illegal networks."" The officials said South Korea has shared intelligence with the US for the detection of the illegal transaction.In their search of the seized vessel, South Korean authorities secured navigation logs and testimony from the crew that the oil transaction was ordered by the Taiwanese group through the vessel's caption. But motive of the transaction with North Korea is not known, the officials noted. South Korea will be keeping the Hong Kong-flagged vessel for about six months, during which time Hong Kong is expected to file a request for the ship's release with the UNSC's sanctions committee on North Korea. The US has reportedly called on the UNSC to blacklist 10 ships for engaging in proscribed trade with North Korea although China and Russia are opposed to that. Lighthouse Winmore was reportedly one of the 10 targeted ships. The Security Council sanctions committee will make a decision on the request on Friday , according to the officials.","oil transfer to korea ,friday south korean customs ,korea seizes hk vessel ,oil to north korean ,south korean customs authorities","['Hong Kong', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'south korean', 'Lighthouse Winmore']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.13063845  0.55575347

This file photo, taken on Feb. 22, 2017, shows a nearly empty infant unit of a hospital in Seoul, when Statistics Korea announced that the number of babies born in 2016 reached 406,300, the lowest since 1970 when the statistics agency started to compile such data. On Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in called for more effective measures to boost South Korea's low fertility rate as he warned of a serious demographic crisis.South Korea has spent 100 trillion won  over the past decade to tackle the low birth rate, though no significant progress has been made yet.Many young people delay marriage as they cannot find decent jobs after graduating university, which in turn has led to a low birth rate.South Korea's total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- stood at 1.17 in 2016, much lower than the replacement level of 2.1 that would keep South Korea's population of 51 million stable.Coupled with a rapidly aging population, low births can reduce the available workforce in Asia's fourth-largest economy and drive up welfare costs, which in turn could undermine the economy's growth potential.Meanwhile, the number of marriages dropped 20.9 percent on-year to 17,400 in October, while 8,400 couples divorced during the cited period, down 5.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the data.The number of deaths came to 24,600 for the month, up 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.","monthly childbirths have decreased ,statistics korea monthly childbirths ,october down 11 percent ,childbirths continue to slide ,decreased on year every","['South Korea', 'asian', 'Statistics Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6663965   0.70420253

Korea sent troops to Vietnam during its civil war in an effort to push the communists back. There have been voices, both domestic and international, calling for the Korean government to recognize and apologize for the massacres of Vietnamese civilians by its troops, during the war.  Yoon Mi-hyang, chairman of the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, stands in front of the Vietnam Embassy in Seoul, apologizing for massacres and sexual violence committed by Korean troops during the Vietnam War. A 72-year-old veteran recounted on an incident through an interview with a local media outlet No Cut News, confessing that his military unit killed local civilians, unable to differentiate them with Viet Cong guerrillas, also known as Vietnamese communists.According to his testimony, some of the soldiers were unexpectedly shot and killed while approaching a village. The surviving members called up around 20 villagers and questioned them. Unable to find the evidence nor successfully communicate with them, the platoon leader shot three male adults, out of fear that the unit might be attacked again. The veteran explained that in almost every operation, the military killed some civilians, mistaking them for the enemy. He denied any deliberate massacre. Saying that he has lived the past 50 years in regret and sorrow, the veteran argued that the Korean government must officially apologize to the people of Vietnam.

From public toilets to schools and churches, the changes will affect South Koreans’ daily life. Here is a look at some of the new rules to come into effect in 2018. Bye-bye toilet trash cansStarting from Jan. 1, all public bathrooms are required to do away with trash bins and provide rapid dissolving toilet paper, hopefully resolving one of the most common complaints of foreign visitors here.  YonhapThe move comes as part of changes brought by the Cabinet, which in May passed a revision to the implementation ordinance of the Public Toilets, Etc. Act, the law governing public toilets. Under the amendment, garbage cans inside all bathroom stalls for both male and female restrooms will be removed. Bins with covers will be installed instead for the disposal of feminine hygiene products. Also, janitors and cleaning staff will be asked to place signs at the entrance of bathrooms when cleaning facilities for opposite genders. Among other changes is the introduction of bigger bathroom dividers -- 40 centimeters in width and 60 centimeters in length -- between urinals for men. “We hope other privately owned restrooms catch up with the newly introduced changes such as public restrooms without toilet trash bins, signs for cleaners of a different sex, more enclosed restroom designs and barriers between urinals,” said Yoon Jong-in, a senior official at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.Taxes on clergy Effective Jan. 1, priests, pastors, Buddhist monks and clergy of other religions will be levied income tax.  A group of activists from the Korea Taxpayers` Association hold a protest rally in front of the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee building in central Seoul on May 31, 2017, demanding that clerical workers pay taxes like all waged workers. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 35 member countries, Korea was the only allowing exemptions for religious leaders. A related revision in the nation’s tax code passed the National Assembly years ago, but its implementation was delayed due to opposition from religious circles. The clergy group’s tax burden, however, is envisioned to be just about half of that shouldered by ordinary wage earners, according to a Financial Ministry plan to be finalized Friday. A religious leader with a three-person household who earns 28.85 million won  a year and has one child under the age of 20 would pay a monthly withholding tax of just 1,330 won. The 28.85 million won is the average annual income of pastors, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Labor Ministry. For an annual income of 50 million won, a clergyperson leading a four-person household would shoulder 50,730 won in monthly income taxes, whereas nonclergy would pay 90,510 won. The Finance Ministry estimates roughly 16-20 billion won will be collected annually from around 50,000 religious leaders. No English for grades 1-2 Starting from March 1, elementary schools are banned from running English courses for first- and second-graders under the motto “No study burden on young kids.”  After-school teachers stage a protest in front of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education on Friday, demonstrating against the government`s decision to ban after-school English classes for first- and second-graders. Currently, English is taught from the third grade onward, but schools offer first- and second-graders after-hours courses in English. The global language is by far parents’ favorite among all extension programs. A law banning advanced learning to normalize the competition-driven education culture was adopted in September 2014, but after-school English curriculum remained intact due to strong demand from parents. Parents and thousands of English instructors, who are set to lose their jobs, are protesting the looming shutdown, but the Education Ministry appears firm this time. Some critics say the ban would deprive students of access to affordable English education and benefit private institutions. Minimum wage, vacation days and jobsThe minimum wage for 2018 is set at 7,530 won per hour, up 16.4 percent, or 1,060 won, from a year earlier. This is the first time for the bottom limit of wages to rise by more than 1,000 won at a time. President Moon Jae-in, having proclaimed a doctrine of “income-led economic growth,” aims to raise the rate to 10,000 won during his presidency, which ends in 2022, but said he would adjust the pace of the wage increases after watching how this year’s spike affects labor cost-sensitive sectors and SMEs. From June, newly hired employees will be entitled to 11 days of paid leave in the first year. So far, workers have become entitled only after completing a full year of service. Also there will be 24,300 job openings in the public service through 2018, including for teachers, police officers, firefighters and central and provincial government employees. The hiring scheme compares to previous years’ average of around 8,000. What’s a gift and what’s a bribe Since September 2016, civil servants, journalists, teachers and their spouses have been banned from receiving gifts, free meals and congratulations or condolences of certain monetary values, under the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.  123rfThe price ceilings are to be adjusted before the Lunar New Year holiday in February, a traditional gift-giving season, although the exact date of its implementation has yet to be determined. As for gifts, the cap is unchanged at 50,000 won, but there is a new exception: Up to 100,000 won is OK when the gifts are agricultural, livestock and fishery goods. The ceiling on gift money on occasions like weddings and funerals is down to 50,000 won from the previous 100,000 won.

More than half of those who said they consumed alcohol within the last six months responded that they had at least one shot of boilermaker. Called poktanju in Korea, boilermaker, a combination of beer and liquor, was the most popular alcoholic drink among those in their 20s and 30s, with 55.7 percent of the former and 54.5 percent of the latter responding they have had one recently.The average alcohol consumption per day among the respondents marked 6.1 shots  for soju, 4.8 glasses  for beer and 2.9 glasses of rice wine.

In the past five years, as many as 100 law enforcement officers have killed themselves, 27 percent more than the 79 who died while on duty during the same period. Last year alone, 26 took their own lives, up 44 percent from 18 in 2012. Nearly half of the deaths were linked to work-related stress, according to the Korean National Police Agency. Police authorities and society at large should promote better understanding of mental illnesses and provide effective ways to seek help, a police officer who attempted suicide a few years ago said. “It’s just the nature of our job that we experience traumatic events while on duty. And many police officers have or are at risk of serious mental health crisis,” the senior police officer -- who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to talk to the media -- told The Korea Herald. After responding to several suicide cases, the officer said he was haunted by the faces of the victims. In addition, a sense of failure for not preventing them from taking their lives before he arrived on the scene led to insomnia and suicidal thoughts for quite some time.“One of the suicide victims was my daughter’s age. I simply wasn’t prepared for that kind of traumatic experience, and was left with nowhere to go for emotional support,” the officer said. “It’s still hard for me to talk about it, even several years later,” he said.As of 2016, South Korea, a country of 51 million, has 114,658 police officers. There are six counseling centers serving police officers, designed to provide free medical treatment and psychological counseling. By next year, nine such centers will be in place and three additional centers are scheduled to open each year until 2021, according to the Korean National Police Agency. Apart from insufficient mental health services available for police officers, many delay or avoid treatment at the centers out of fear that they might be discriminated against or misunderstood by colleagues, according to the officer. “They say medical records are kept secret, but sooner or later we find out who received what treatment and why. The fact that one needs psychological treatment is seen as a sign of weakness in a heavily male-oriented culture. So we find a way to get expensive therapy elsewhere at private hospitals and pay out of our own pocket,” he said. Hope for changeIn June, the police reform committee, an independent body of civilian experts, was launched. Several months later, the committee recommended the establishment of a labor union-like workplace council in police stations to help guarantee the basic labor rights of lower-level officers. By law, police are banned from forming a labor union.Separately, the National Assembly increased next year’s budget for police welfare by 3.6 percent. In October, the committee announced a set of reform proposals for the police force, including the improvement of working conditions, such as frequent day-night shifts. It highlighted that the average lifespan of police officers is much shorter than those of people with other jobs.“Around 80 percent of police officers overwork, along with working on night shifts, while most work more than 40 hours a week on average,” the committee said in a report.A legislative bill pending at the National Assembly would allow law enforcement officers and firefighters to establish a workplace council, one of President Moon Jae-in’s pledges. During the annual Police Day ceremony in October, Moon said that police officers “should not be forced to make sacrifices.” He promised to hire 20,000 additional police officers before his five-year term ends in May 2022, as well as increase state support and improve working conditions. The workplace council will not immediately alleviate work-related stress. But it would create a safe place for low-ranking officers to talk about topics previously taboo in the highly hierarchical police force, experts predict. Not everyone is sympathetic toward the country’s police force, as the police are often deemed overly politicized and associated with the excessive use of force. On Nov. 14, 2015, police fired a water cannon toward the public during a street protest against former President Park Geun-hye. Activist farmer Baek Nam-ki was struck by the blast and died of a cerebral hemorrhage after 10 months in a comatose state.Baek’s death prompted a public outcry. Shortly after Moon took office, the head of the National Police Agency Lee Cheol-seong apologized for Baek’s death, promising to restrict the use of water cannons and ensure the right to peaceful assembly.Sweeping reform is necessary from the top down to ensure a democratic police system and regain public trust, experts say.“Police authorities and society should make sure that the police can continue to play a central role in the law enforcement system, which is to serve the public’s best interests. And the responsibility should not only be on police officers alone,” Kwack Dae-gyung, a professor of police administration at Dongguk University, told The Korea Herald.By Bak Se-hwan","south korean police suicides ,korean police suicides on ,korean police suicides ,wielding drunken man police ,enforcement officers have killed",[],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46723834  0.35668084

Song Shin-do died at the age of 95, in Tokyo Prefecture, the Seoul-based foundation that deals with the issue said. Song, originally from South Chungcheong Province, was forcibly taken to China by the Japanese military to serve at a brothel during the World War II in 1938, when she was 16.  This photo dated Aug. 13, 2011, shows Song Shin-do, a Korean victim of Japan`s wartime sexual slavery. After the war ended, she moved to Japan in 1946 with a Japanese soldier with whom she was in a relationship, but the man left her later, according to the foundation. She has since lived in Japan with her Korean-Japanese partner. She is known for her active legal fight against the Japanese government over the wartime crime. She was the first and only victim so far living in Japan who has filed a damages suit against the Japanese government, although her decade-long court battle ended up in a loss at the highest court.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during wartime.In December 2015, Seoul and Tokyo reached a deal to resolve the issue, in which Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation aimed at supporting the victims.But critics in Seoul called for the repeal of the deal citing the lack of consensus from the victims and Japan's refusal to recognize its legal responsibility for their forced mobilization.","wartime sexual slavery dies ,dies an elderly korean ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,slavery dies an elderly ,elderly korean victim of","['korean', 'Japan', 'Song Shin - do', 'Tokyo Prefecture', 'Seoul', 'song', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'China', 'japanese']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.76924771  0.23438576

Perhaps, some still remember a breathtaking triumph of a Ukrainian athlete Sehii Bubka at 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Those into football probably know Andrii Shevchenko, a “Golden Ball” winner and legendary striker for Milan and Chelsea. Some Koreans probably think of Ukraine as a mysterious country in Europe, with the most beautiful women in the world. Of course, there is a lot more to Ukraine waiting for Korean people to discover. Take, for example, Ukrainians’ constant aspirations to reach far beyond Earth. Starting with George Gamow, born in Odesa, who proposed a physical model of the Universe origins known as the “Big Bang,” and continuing with a first turbo-jet engine that was developed by a Ukrainian scientist Arkhip Lyulka from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Ukraine has always been at the forefront of the world’s most cutting-edge airplane and space program efforts. Everyone in the world knows about a titanic Antonov‑225 Mriya airplane, originally developed for the space program. The airplane can lift record-breaking 253,800 kg and is nowadays used for super heavy cargo transportation.Another Ukrainian who truly deserves recognition as a front-runner of human space exploration is Sergei Korolev. Born and grew up in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, Korolev is sometimes referred to as the “father of modern astronautics.” He engineered and made possible the launch of the first satellite Sputnik, as well as the first human being in space.Down on Earth, Ukrainians worked hard to advance humanity into technological era. Numerous fundamental discoveries in physics, mathematics, medicine, electronics have been made by Ukrainian scientists. Ukrainians have pioneered in computers industry, both hardware and software. MESM, the first computer in Europe, was built in Kyiv in 1948. As computers became more popular, Ukrainians made technology more accessible for people. For example, Ukrainian company PocketBook is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of electronic readers based on the E Ink  technology. World-famous software companies, such as PayPal and WhatsApp, and many others, have Ukraine-born founders.But what if we turn around, and explore what does an average Ukrainian know about Korea? One of Four Asian Tigers, the Miracle on Han River, the home of world-famous innovators such as Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and global events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup and Winter Olympics 2018. Perhaps, considering that Ukraine’s national football team did not qualify for 2018 FIFA World Cup, many Ukrainians will cheer for the Korean national team. Ukrainians welcome and enjoy Korean traditional culture, its food, music, fashion and architecture. Popular Korean restaurants in Kyiv serve authentic Korean food and drinks. K-Pop stars visit Kyiv for concerts, gathering huge crowds. Ukrainian TV channels broadcast Korean drama for Ukraine’s 45 million strong audience. Kyiv residents spend their weekends at a recently opened Korean traditional garden, immersing themselves into a Korean spirit.Ukrainians know that the advances of Korean society are hard-earned. Thanks to the unbreakable spirit of the Korean people, the country could fight Japanese occupation and communists, rising from the ashes of Korean War into one of the most developed countries in the world. Ukrainian people can relate to Korea, because they also suffered from occupation by its powerful neighbor. Korean media have echoed the news from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. The government of the Republic of Korea expressed serious concerns over these developments in Ukraine, and stated that Korea will not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea .Clearly, in the age of information technology warfare, the so-called “hybrid wars,” it requires insurmountable amount of efforts and collective stand up to the aggressor. Take, for example, the spread of “fake news.”Everybody knows that Yuzhnoye design office and Yuzhmash, world’s leading manufacturers of space rockets, are in a full compliance with the Missile Technology Control Regime. The companies have a long standing and well-documented history of directly supporting the US government efforts in non-proliferation since the 90’s. Also, the European Vega light-class launch vehicle was made in Ukraine, and was successfully launched from the Kourou Space Centre  on Aug. 2 delivering two satellites for the Israel Aerospace Industries into orbits. Since the Vega program began, Ukraine has helped deliver 25 satellites into space, for 19 customers. In fact, just on Nov. 12, Yuzhnoye and Yuzhmash helped launch a modernized launcher “Antares” from the Space Flight Facility on the Wallops Island, Virginia, successfully delivering cargo to the International Space Station. Twenty-five years ago, in 1992, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea was opened in Kyiv. Soon after, the Embassy of Ukraine began its activities in Seoul. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our states, we have made considerable efforts to build deep cooperation in areas of mutual interest.Air and SpaceAs already mentioned, Ukraine is famous for its aerospace engineering industry, as it possesses a full cycle of aerospace hardware engineering and production. At the same time, Korea aspires to become a space nation, and recently succeeded in its advance into space. In fact, Korea Aerospace Research Institute and Yuzhnoye design office have already cooperated on the launch services: From 2013-2015, Dnepr rockets successfully delivered Korean satellites to orbit. Another legendary Ukrainian airspace company is Antonov. The company has designed over 100 passenger, cargo and special purpose airplanes, with over 22,000 of them used by 55 countries around the world. With more than 70 years of experience in airplane design, engineering, manufacturing, sales and even operation, it is ready to work with Korean partners to open a new era in aviation. Co-developing a brand-new NATO-compliant An-148 marine patrol airplane, and even delivery of super large cargo using record-breaking An-124 “Ruslan” and An-225 “Mriya” -- all of these opportunities are fully available to Korea. In addition, in order to fully replace Russia-produced parts of its An-148, An-158, An-132 and An-70 airplanes, Antonov is open to consider Korean-manufactured parts and systems for its products.For over 70 years Ivchenko-Progress design bureau is developing and manufacturing aviation gas turbine engines for a wide range of purposes and applications, such as ground use or aviation. The scientific and technical potential and experimental research complex of Ivchenko-Progress SE allows developing turbo-jet engines of various types with a thrust of 500-50,000 kilonewtons and a power of 300-15,000 horsepower. The company is open to cooperation with Korean partners who are interested in turbine engines. AgricultureUkraine has long been called the “breadbasket of Europe” for its fertile black soil, perfect climate and landscapes for agriculture. Korean companies are actively participating in development of Ukraine’s agricultural potential. For example, Posco Daewoo and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food will jointly upgrade agricultural machines in Ukraine for small and medium farms. The company will also construct grain elevators in Ukrainian ports, as grain exports continue to be a very popular commodity in international markets. The potential of Ukraine’s agriculture, however, is far from being fulfilled, so Korean agritech and agriculture companies are more than welcome to explore possibilities in Ukraine and take advantage of world’s most fertile soils.TechnologyKorean companies are successfully developing and selling their products in Ukraine. For example, Samsung Electronics operates an R&D; center that employs more than 1,000 Ukrainians. Ukraine, on the other hand, is a leading software engineering country, with total market value over $2 billion. Ukrainian software engineers are among the best in the world. This year, Korean National IT Promotion Agency selected Ukrainian-founded Cards out of over 1,500 worldwide for “K-Startup Grand Challenge 2017,” a governmental support program. Cards is developing “andCards,” a software service that helps foster networking culture and build community at coworking centers.The time has never been better to invest into Ukraine, and to cooperate with the Ukrainian companies. Asian investors have already been actively investing into Ukraine. For example, Japanese electric equipment manufacturer Fujikura is already opening its second factory in Ukraine. Chinese construction companies are building ports and metro lines all around Ukraine. Various Chinese companies already invested over $7 billion into Ukraine. Tempered by the past, both Korea and Ukraine are emerging as a new type of nations: more united, competitive and creative.

The journalists were trying to cover Moon’s attendance of a trade event, and the Chinese guards blocked them and assaulted them when they protested. A petition posted on the website of the presidential office on Thursday called for minimizing the number of journalists stationed at Cheong Wa Dae, and scrapping the traveling press corps system. “The behavior of the traveling press corps during the president’s visits to the US and China showed that they were incapable of living up to the values sought by Cheong Wa Dae,” the post reads. The writer of the post accused the press corps of “causing an accident by ignoring instructions” at a critical time for diplomacy between South Korea and China, and demanded that the press corps no longer travel abroad with the president.Close to 45,000 people had joined the online petition as of Monday morning. If a petition on the Cheong Wa Dae website gathers more than 200,000 signatures within 30 days, the government is supposed to announce its position on the matter.The security guards that assaulted the journalists belonged to a firm set up by retired officers of China’s Ministry of Public Security, according to Rep. Lee Chan-yeol of the opposition People’s Party.Citing documents he received from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, which hosted the trade event, Rep. Lee said KOTRA hired the security firm as they were told to by the Chinese state enterprise that ran the event venue. An organization affiliated with the Ministry of Public Security was in charge of security personnel, he said. KOTRA had initially agreed to hire 50 security personnel and 30 safety inspection personnel from the firm, but ended up hiring 190 after signing an additional contract without knowing how much more they would have to pay, Lee said.By Kim So-hyun","chinese security guards beat ,44 000 south koreans ,beijing last week chinese ,thousands call for disbanding ,injured two south korean","['South Koreans', 'Blue House', 'chinese', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'Moon']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59272736  0.39320531

But the government denied the request, saying they are unlikely to face persecution even if sent back to the African country. The girl filed a lawsuit against the decision, arguing that she could be forced to undergo circumcision. Both a district and an appeals court ruled against her, saying circumcision is a crime perpetrated privately and she could expect protection from the government as the country's political situation is stable.The highest court, however, struck down the ruling and sent the case back to the Seoul High Court, saying circumcision constitutes an act of persecution and the lower court didn't look sufficiently into whether Liberia is making enough efforts to eradicate the practice.""Circumcision, which inflicts an injury on a key part of a woman's body, is an act that is performed not for medical but for traditional, cultural and religious reasons. It is an act that comes with extreme pain and infringes upon human dignity, and thus amounts to persecution,"" the court said.","liberian girl seeking asylum ,girl seeking asylum for ,girl seeking asylum ,girl from liberia seeking ,mother and sought asylum","['the Supreme Court', 'Liberia', 'South Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61971676 -0.27308574

But they often struggle to make a living in the capitalist South and sometimes fail to adjust to their new lives.Dressmaker Kim Ryon-Hui arrived seven years ago but has since has made several desperate attempts to return to her family -- including forging a passport, for which she was imprisoned, and falsely confessing to espionage in the hope she would be expelled.""I'm a citizen of Pyongyang of the Democratic Republic of Korea,"" Kim told dozens of reporters at a briefing in Seoul by Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN's Special Rapporteur on human rights in the North. ""I have been forcefully detained in the South for seven years,"" she added.Kim accused Seoul of violating her human rights, saying it had prevented her from going back to her aging parents and daughter.""A mother is someone who can't be apart from her daughter for even a moment, but seven years just hurts too much,"" she said, her voice trembling, adding she had attempted suicide.Most North Korean defectors are issued a South Korean passport six months after arrival, but Kim still has not received one and said the South's intelligence services had told her she ""might escape to the North"".South Koreans need government permission -- which is only granted in exceptional circumstances -- to go to the North, with which the country is technically still at war.Pyongyang repeatedly cites Kim's case and has said it will not allow any more reunions of relatives divided by the Korean War until she -- and 12 North Korean waitresses who it says were kidnapped from a restaurant in China -- are returned.The divided families are one of the most emotive outcomes of the conflict, which saw the peninsula partitioned in 1953, with around 60,000 increasingly elderly South Koreans still hoping to meet their relatives again.Quintana said the case was an example of the ""absurd cost of division"".The North is accused by the UN and many other countries of widespread human rights violations and Quintana said social and economic structures that fulfil ordinary people's rights and needs had largely ""disappeared"".""What remains intact is the comprehensive system of control and surveillance over the population,"" he said.There was also a ""widening gap in living standards between Pyongyang residents and the majority of the population"". ""It is alarming that this situation occurs in a country that is devoting a vast proportion of its resources to its defence budget and strengthening its border controls in unprecedented ways,"" he added.""The order of priorities in the DPRK requires a major shift that recognises the urgency to fulfil the basic needs of the population.","north korean defector interrupted ,koreans have fled poverty ,thursday to plead tearfully ,in seoul on thursday ,korean defector interrupted united","['north korean', 'United Nations', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Koreans']",3,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.55182898  0.42535231

They found that cyberattacks, which were usually conducted to gain confidential data and intelligence, have been recently shifting toward gaining digital currency. “I assume they will do more bitcoin attacks and of course they will keep targeting banks because that’s what they did before,” Shen said, according to Sky News.“One of the reasons why bitcoin is being attacked is because the price keeps increasing, and we think it’s reasonable for hackers. Digital currency might be easier to gain than physical currency.”One of Shen’s co-researchers working for a South Korean bank told Sky News, asking not to be named, that just a few years ago, North Korean hackers initiated attacks to paralyze society, but now they were hacking for money.Security firm FireEye said in report in September that hackers linked to North Korea have stolen bitcoins from at least three South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges since May 2017.“Now, we may be witnessing a second wave of this campaign: state-sponsored actors seeking to steal bitcoin and other virtual currencies as a means of evading sanctions and obtaining hard currencies to fund the regime,” the report said. The Korea Internet & Security Agency also forecast an increase of cyberattacks from North Korea targeting cryptocurrency exchanges in its outlook on next year’s cyberattacks released last week.

""The South Korean government plans to start with contact  to achieve those specific tasks in the process of seeking a more meaningful inter-Korean relationship,"" said the foreign minister.North Korea's participation in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea would be ""a favorable opportunity"" in that vein, she also noted.  Kang said the issue of North Korea's nuclear weapons development entered ""a new stage"" with its long-range ballistic missile launch on Nov. 29 and its declaration of its completion of the state nuclear force. ""North Korea's nuclear  and missiles have now become a direct threat to the whole world, not just a limited threat to the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia."" She said the international community will never tolerate North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons and will strengthen diplomacy and pressure to bring the country to the negotiating table.At the core of South Korea's policy toward North Korea is ""a solid South Korea-US  alliance,"" she stressed. The allies are currently in close consultation on ways to increase the frequency of the deployment of US strategic military assets on the Korean Peninsula and beef up South Korea's high-tech defense capabilities, Kang also noted.Colin Powell, a former US secretary of state, also called for continued diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.""I am all for using diplomatic and peaceful means to get rid of nuclear weapons throughout the world, especially with respect to North Korea,"" he told the forum. Powell analyzed that the survival of its regime seemed to be ""the most valuable thing"" in its development of nuclear weapons. ""They will do whatever is necessary to make sure the regime is sustained and this really is part of the background for solving the problem of nuclear weapons.""""But to use such weapons against the US or against our friends and allies, if we suspect that such weapons are about to be used, we need to make sure Kim Jong-un understands that will be the destruction of his regime, beginning the very next day. ... I think they are too smart to want to commit suicide.""Powell also said that China ""has the ignition key to the North Korean car,"" by providing North Korea with energy and resources that keep the regime afloat. ""I think they have the ability to turn it off,"" he said, calling for a more active role by China in isolating the regime.Lee Do-hoon, South Korea's top envoy in negotiating North Korea's denuclearization, later said in the forum that the country will continue to seek opportunities for dialogue as it pursues a peaceful way out of the current nuclear deadlock.""We will not forget that the ultimate purpose of the sanctions and pressure is to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. Under the dire circumstances, we will continue to seek opportunities for dialogue,"" Lee said. ""Considering the current situation in which North Korea has justified its nuclear and missile development with its security concerns, North Korean nuclear issues cannot be resolved based on sanctions and pressure alone. In the end, North Korean nuclear issues can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiations,"" the envoy said.There will be a window open for North Korea to discuss issues of ""mutual concern"" with South Korea if the regime participates in the upcoming Olympics, refrains from any further provocations and communicates its intent to engage in sincere dialogue, Lee suggested, adding that ""North Korea must not let this valuable opportunity pass by.""","korean diplomat calls for ,korean diplomat calls ,top korean diplomat calls ,korean foreign minister ,korean foreign minister kang","['south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Kang']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50469422  0.69275993

Investigators raided the boat, unloading machines and electronic items.The remaining seven crew members, including one in hospital, will be sent to Japan's immigration office, public broadcaster NHK reported.Dozens of North Korean fishing vessels wash up on Japan's coast every year, but last month Japanese coastguards registered 28 cases, the highest monthly figure since records began in 2014.A record number of North Korean fishermen have been rescued alive -- 42 this year compared to zero in 2016 -- but there are still cases of ""ghost ships"" packed full of bodies, with 18 corpses recovered so far this year.Experts say some North Korean fishermen are travelling far out to sea in order to satisfy government mandates for bigger catches.But their old and poorly equipped vessels are prone to mechanical and other problems, including running out of fuel, and there are few ways for them to call for rescue.","korean ghost ship fishing ,police on saturday arrested ,10 north korean fishermen ,korean fishermen spotted aboard ,japanese police on saturday","['japanese', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'japanese', 'north korean', 'Hokkaido']",3,"[ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  3.00000000e+00 ... -2.07530451e-03

""At these meetings, our side said the US policy of hostility toward the DPRK  and its nuclear blackmail are to blame for the current tense situation on the Korean peninsula,"" the report said.It added that the North had agreed with the UN ""to regularize communications through visits at various levels"".The report did not mention any meetings with leader Kim Jong-Un, who has ramped up his impoverished nation's missile and nuclear programme in recent years in order to achieve Pyongyang's stated goal of developing a warhead capable of hitting the US mainland.Feltman, the UN's under secretary general for political affairs, visited the country just after the United States and South Korea launched their biggest-ever joint air exercise.Pyongyang reiterated its view that these manoeuvres were a provocation on Saturday, accusing the drills of ""revealing its intention to mount a surprise nuclear pre-emptive strike against the DPRK"", using the acronym for the country's official name.The UN Security Council has hit the isolated and impoverished North with a package of sanctions over its increasingly powerful missile and nuclear tests, which have rattled Washington and its regional allies South Korea and Japan.Early Saturday Feltman flew to Beijing, a key transit point with the North, and left the city's airport without speaking to reporters. China, which is Pyongyang's sole major diplomatic and military ally, has called on the United States to freeze military drills and North Korea to halt weapons tests to calm tensions.","beijing saturday after wrapping ,nuclear blackmail for soaring ,blamed us nuclear blackmail ,test fired new ballistic ,in beijing saturday after","['North Korea', 'US', 'UN', 'Jeffrey Feltman', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.91055483  0.41734171

He even captured the exact location of the ship through a mobile phone application and sent the information. The passenger and two others were trapped in an air pocket inside the overturned boat and waited two hours to be rescued, according to a survivor surnamed Lee. “I think if the sea was deeper, the boat would have been filled with water,” Lee told local daily Hankyeoreh. “It was a situation where  was not arriving an hour after we reported the accident. Anyway, the Coast Guard came. By the time they came, we couldn’t breathe.” According to Lee, they found themselves stuck in an air pocket as the boat capsized on an outgoing tide when water flowed away from the shore. They were able to see the captain’s office as the steering room, where they were trapped, was draining, and shouted, he said. The 9.77-ton recreational fishing vessel Seonchang-1 collided with the 336-ton Myeongjin-15 tanker in waters near the island of Yeongheungdo at around 6 a.m. on Sunday. The first report was a 6:09 a.m. call made with the water-resistant phone. The deadly collision left 13 people dead and two missing. Seven were rescued. Coast Guard officials are trying to determine the cause of the accident. The tanker’s captain, identified only by his surname Jun, and another crew member were detained on charges of professional negligence resulting in death. They are suspected of not making enough effort to avoid a collision even though they knew the fishing boat was operating nearby.

The man-made disaster was carried out under the order of Joseph Stalin, who saw a nationwide famine as instrumental in forestalling a Ukrainian independence movement, according to scholars. It is also known as the “terror famine,” “famine genocide,” or the “Ukrainian genocide of 1932-33.” “Eighty-five years ago, the Ukrainian nation faced a disaster that should not have happened on our fertile land,” said Ukrainian Ambassador to Korea Olexander Horin on Wednesday at the National Assembly in Seoul, where a photo exhibition on Holodomor was held for two days. From left: Georgian Ambassador to Korea Otar Berdzenishvili; spouse of the Ukrainian ambassador Nataliia Tymoshenko; Rep. Cho Jeong-sik, member of the National Assembly and chairman of the Ukraine-Korea Friendship Association; Ukrainian Ambassador to Korea Olexander Horin; Ukrainian Honorary Consul in Korea Lee Woo-jong; and businessman Lee Young-chae “It is important to tell the story of Holodomor, since there is no certainty that such an event will not repeat itself in today’s world. On the contrary, signs of genocide are seen in our modern world, and we should learn Holodomor’s lessons to avoid such crimes in the future and confront those who plan and organize them.”Ukraine has recognized the event as genocide, and the Ukrainian parliament has urged its international partners to acknowledge it as the crime of genocide, the embassy told The Korea Herald. Holodomor was the result of a “well-planned Kremlin policy,” the diplomatic mission said, adding the Soviet government confiscated all food from Ukrainian villages en masse, followed by isolating them and forbidding people to leave the country. “Collective farms and villages were surrounded by armed militias and Soviet Special Forces. All food stocks were taken, and trade and import of any goods were prohibited. It was a death sentence for residents,” the envoy said.Furthermore, the Soviet Union’s People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs deliberately blocked information about Holodomor across the vast expanse of the communist union, while at the same time blockading foreign aid. It was done to suppress national desires for independence, which grew among Ukraine’s economically independent peasants and educated intelligentsia.Holodomor is officially considered as genocide by 16 countries around the world, a criminal act of the Soviet Union by six countries and a tragedy or crime against humanity by five international organizations. Aside from Ukraine, it is remembered in Canada, the United States, Poland and other countries through various annual commemorations organized by community groups and religious institutions.

Thai citizens from all walks of life gather together to show their “profound respect” for the monarch who passed away over a year ago, said Thai Ambassador to Korea Sarun Charoensuwan. He added that Bhumibol  worked tirelessly to uplift Thai people’s lives, particularly those on the bottom rungs of society, after he ascended to the throne in 1946.“Through thousands of development projects he initiated over his lifetime, his majesty oversaw a period of profound social, economic and developmental transformations across Thailand. He helped the rural people become self-reliant and escape their poverty,” the envoy said in a speech at a reception in Seoul on Friday. “His majesty developed the philosophy of ‘sufficiency economy,’ which underlines the middle path as an overriding principle of appropriate conduct, moderation and wisdom.”Thai Ambassador to Korea Sarun Charoensuwan The philosophy -- prioritizing the pursuit of all national stakeholders’ interests over a long time span -- has been elaborated upon by Thai academics, promoted by the government and applied to over 23,000 villages throughout the country. Bangkok has utilized the philosophy over the last 40 years to overcome various national crises and advance in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, the envoy explained. Nothing that the late monarch’s birthday also coincides with the UN-designated World Soil Day -- designed to raise awareness on soil’s importance in agriculture, development, nutrition and food security around the world -- Charoensuwan said Thailand remembers Bhumibol’s dedication to national agricultural development and agrarian livelihood as the economy’s backbone. “With the passing of our late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand now has His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, the late king’s son who assumed his throne on Dec. 1 last year,” the diplomat said. “The monarchy will remain an important and inseparable part of our country and people, and continue to serve as an institution keeping them together.” Turning to relations with Korea, he said “our strong bond was forged through heroic sacrifices of our brave servicemen and women who fought side by side with Korean troops during the Korean War.” When North Korea invaded the South in 1950 with the aim of communizing it, Thailand was one of 21 countries that responded to the United Nations’ call to send troops to the peninsula. Thailand -- under the reign of King Bhumibol -- was the second after the United States to declare its participation, said Rep. Park Joo-sun, deputy speaker of the National Assembly, in a speech. Thai Ambassador to Korea Sarun Charoensuwan  and Rep. Park Joo-sun “It is my belief that his majesty’s resolution and the noble sacrifices of Thai soldiers served as a foundation on which my country achieved its rapid industrialization and democratization,” Park stressed, adding he attended the late king’s cremation ceremony in Bangkok on Oct. 26 as Korean President Moon Jae-in’s special envoy. The Royal Thai Expeditionary Forces to Korea, the 21st Combined Regiment, dispatched 11,786 troops to the war, with 136 dying as casualties. They, together with the Royal Thai Navy and Air Force, engaged in major battles that helped determine the fratricidal conflict’s outcome, including the battle of the Pork Chop Hill and Third Battle of Seoul. “What had started as a military and security cooperation between our countries quickly expanded to encompass all-inclusive ties, eventually maturing into a strategic partnership,” said Charoensuwan. “Thailand will continue its role helping maintain peace and security in the Korean Peninsula by strictly implementing relevant UN Security Council resolutions.” On the trade side, Korea continues to be one of Thailand’s top trading partners, underscored the ambassador. The bilateral trade turnover reached $10 billion from January through October, a 14 percent on-year uptick. Korea is the sixth-largest foreign investor in Thailand, led by global conglomerates like Samsung, LG and Posco that have plowed vast capital into Thailand’s manufacturing industry.Foreign ambassadors at the Father's Day reception organized by the Royal Thai Embassy in Seoul on Dec. 1 Highlighting that Seoul and Bangkok are stepping up collaboration in railway and water management, the envoy said Thailand will progressively contribute to regional integration through various infrastructure, logistics and social connectivity projects. Bangkok has embarked on a policy of nationwide economic overhaul known as “Thailand 4.0,” aiming at injecting innovation, knowledge, technology and creativity into its economy and escaping the “middle income trap.” “To realize all this, we hope to learn from Korea’s expertise and best practices in developing its infrastructure, smart cities, and innovative research and development capacities, especially the digital technology, information communications technology, Internet of Things and biotech,” according to the diplomat. On the tourism front, nearly 1.7 million Koreans are expected to travel to Thailand this year, while nearly 500,000 Thai tourists are forecast to visit Korea. The two nations will celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations next year. President Moon’s pivot toward the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as envisioned in his “New South Policy,” will give an additional impetus to the prospering two-way ties, underlined Charoensuwan.

Thanks to you, the incident did not develop into a more dangerous situation,"" he added.The JSA, also known as Panmunjom, is one of the very few places where South and North Korean troops stand face to face without a fence dividing them.

The situation did not turn into a crisis because you controlled the situation calmly and accurately,"" the president said.The North Korean defector was said to have suffered at least five gunshot wounds to the abdomen and other parts of his body.

It has not been confirmed, however, whether his father is still in active service.  North Korea watchers have assumed Oh to be an elite, as soldiers with good family backgrounds are usually deployed to the JSA. The fact that he drove a military vehicle and wore socks instead of foot muffs that ordinary soldiers wear was another indicator of his family connections.

He was admitted to the intensive care unit at first, but is now reportedly in a stable condition after regaining consciousness, officials at the hospital said Friday. The loudspeaker messages, which have reportedly influenced North Korean soldiers to defect in the past, have been deemed “psychological warfare” by the South Korean military. A North Korean soldier who crossed the MDL in June 2016 reportedly said that it pushed him to make the decision. Although Oh has yet to issue a similar statement, he has expressed familiarity with South Korean culture, including K-pop girl groups. Sunday’s broadcasts mentioned severe malnutrition among Korean soldiers, based on Oh’s medical records here. He was suffering from pneumonia and Hepatitis B, and dozens of fully grown parasitic worms were found in his ruptured small intestine, some as long as 27 centimeters, during surgery. Pyongyang has yet to issue a direct comment on the matter, but the North Korean army dug a trench and planted trees near the Demilitarized Zone in an apparent move to prevent its soldiers from following Oh’s actions. “he North Koreans have planted two trees and are digging a trench at the spot where their soldier crossed the MDL,” Marc Knapper, acting US ambassador to South Korea, tweeted Wednesday. The remark was accompanied by a photo of several North Korean men carrying out the work while North Korean soldiers surrounded them. Oh drove a jeep at about 70 kph before the vehicle got stuck in a ditch north of the Military Demarcation Line, the de facto border between the two Koreas. He was forced to abandon the vehicle and make a 50-meter dash for freedom. A South Korean lawmaker acknowledged the spot in the photo as an area linked to Oh’s defection. “I’m certain that’s the same spot where the soldier defected,” Kim Young-woo, chairman of the National Assembly’s defense committee in Seoul, said Friday. “North Koreans appear to be digging a trench in an attempt to prevent others soldiers from defecting to South Korea,” he said. Kim also added that the North had replaced most of its troops dispatched at the JSA, likely due to their failure at preventing Oh’s defection. “It was obviously part of punishment for failing their mission to deter the North Korean soldier’s escape. North Korea has always punished those responsible for similar failures,” he added. The United Nations Command said that the North Korean soldiers who fired gunshots at their former compatriot clearly violated the 1953 armistice agreement. The agreement that halted the 1950-1953 Korean War stipulates that any person -- military or civilian -- is prohibited from crossing the Military Demarcation Line unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.In line with recent events, a senior US diplomat referred to Oh’s defection to the South as an event that showcases North Korea’s human rights abuses, in a weekend op-ed published in the New York Times. “This defector’s plight is a window onto North Korean life,” Brian Hook, director of policy planning and senior policy adviser at the State Department wrote. Hook lambasted the current North Korean regime for spending money on its weapons program, monuments honoring its leader Kim Jong-un and his family, and bribes for elites in Pyongyang, while its soldiers suffer from malnourishment. A “vast majority” of North Korean citizens are subject to even worse treatment, Hook said. He also criticized the Chinese government for repatriating North Korean defectors found within its borders, and called on China and Russia to halt its “slave labor” made up of North Korean workers. Hiring North Koreans makes $230 million a year for the North Korean regime, he said. Hook said that the US would not “sit idly” while the regime in Pyongyang “lawlessly pursues” North Korean defectors and urged other members of the international community to join in the movement to bring about the North’s denuclearization.

The replacement seems to be a response to their failure to deter his escape.""Signs were detected that North Korea has replaced all border security officials following the defection,"" the source said. ""Given this situation, commanders of the responsible military unit and senior officers might have undergone punishment."" The United Nations Command said Wednesday that North Korea clearly violated the 1953 Armistice Agreement twice last week when its border guards tried to hunt down the soldier fleeing to South Korea via the truce village of Panmunjom.The defector drove a jeep southwards in an apparent bid to cross the Military Demarcation Line, but exited the vehicle near the border after its wheel seemed to come loose, according to a video clip released by the UNC.Four armed North Korean guards chased the defector, who tried to dash toward the South. He was shot five times and some of the gunshots flew over the MDL. A North Korean guard also crossed the MDL for a few seconds and then returned to the North's side.It was a rare defection through the Joint Security Area in the Demilitarized Zone that bisects the two Koreas, where South and North Korean forces stand face-to-face.The intelligence source also said that North Korea appears to have temporarily closed the so-called 72-hour bridge, over which the defector drove the jeep at high speed to reach the northern side of the JSA.The source added that the North is apparently tightening its screening of forces coming in and out of the DMZ.Meanwhile, Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, the UNC commander, awarded the Army Commendation medal to six US and South Korean soldiers in recognition of their efforts to rescue the defector, according to the US Forces Korea Facebook page.Three members of South Korea's JSA security battalion forces -- a deputy commander and two noncommissioned officers -- crawled on their stomachs to recover the wounded defector lying against a wall. Brooks said Wednesday that the battalion personnel's actions were appropriate.","korean soldier recent defection ,korean soldier was shot ,thursday north korean soldier ,guards after soldier defection ,soldier recent defection","['North Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'inter - korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.33895892  0.45954683

Based on an analysis of CCTV footage and satellite images, the North Korean solider is thought to have run more than 50 meters toward the South Korean side before he made it to a building next to the Freedom House inside the South-controlled Joint Security Area in the Demilitarized Zone. His run came after his jeep became stuck in a ditch north of the Military Demarcation Line, the de facto border between the two Koreas. Based on CCTV analysis, the solider appeared to be driving his vehicle at about 70 kilometers per hour before he was forced to abandon it.  UNC security footage captures dramatic moments of North Korean soldier defecting to South Korea. “After talking to the , I realized he came here voluntarily and was attracted to what he viewed as a positive image of South Korea,” his doctor Lee Cook-jong, who treated the wounded solider, said during a press briefing. The soldier, who has regained consciousness after two recent surgeries, sustained five gunshot wounds from the four North Korea soldiers who gave chase.

UNHCR is also known as the UN Refugee Agency.""The appeal that I make all the time, to all the countries, is that North Korean asylum seekers and refugees should never be sent back to their country because they risk their lives,"" Grandi said. ""You know the principle 'people should not be deported when they are at risk' is especially valid for North Koreans."" The high commissioner also commended South Korea's government policy to automatically take North Korean defectors coming to South Korea as its own citizens. ""I commended the foreign minister for this policy. They don't need us to do this particular work,"" according to him. Still, South Korea needs to do more to improve its system to take refugees from other part of the world, he pointed out. ""Korea is one of the few countries in the region that has had specific legislation for refugees since 2013 ...  the application of that law still needs to be improved,"" Grandi noted. Good refugee status determination systems need to be very precise ""because people come with very difficult stories,"" he said. ""If you make a mistake, if you say you are not refugees, so go back home, you may be risking this person's life. That's why it has to be almost like a medical examination.""He also said the process should also not be too slow. ""So you have to balance quality and speed. This is what needs to be improved in Korea and in many other places,"" the high commissioner said. He said he suggested the improvement during his meeting with the South Korean justice minister and the minister ""fully accepted"" the government's cooperation on the issue.South Korea also committed its increased financial contribution to UNHCR, he also said, referring to his meetings with the foreign and justice ministers here as well as the acting head of South Korea's official development assistance provider KOICA, lawmakers and civic groups. ""I thanked Korea for its growing support. Now Korea has been, for the last couple of years, part of the group of major donors for UNHCR,"" Grandi said. ""I was assured by the foreign ministry this trend will continue. I believe that Korea, as a G-20 country and a prosperous country, can afford to make even additional efforts to help us in the time refugees are increasing all over the world."" He also extended special thanks to the South Korean public who doubled their financial assistance to UNHCR.

According to security camera footage, four North Korean soldiers armed with guns and rifles aimed shots at the defecting soldier, with one of them doing so in a prone position. They continued shooting even after he crossed the Military Demarcation Line, the de facto border between the two Koreas.Another violation occurred when one of the chasing soldiers, who appeared to carry an AK-47 assault rifle, temporarily crossed the borderline for a few seconds before turning back to the North’s territory inside the Joint Security Area, the UNC added. “The armistice agreement was challenged, but it remains in place,” said UNC Commander Vincent K. Brooks, who doubles as commander of the United States Forces in South Korea and Combined Forces Command between the US and South Korea. The armistice agreement that halted the 1950-153 Korean War stipulates that any person -- military or civilian -- is prohibited from crossing the Military Demarcation Line or MDL unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.A North Korean soldier, who chased his former compatriot defecting to South Korea, turned back to the North’s territory inside the Joint Security Area after temporarily crossing the borderline for a few seconds. YonhapAs it is in charge of operational control inside the JSA, the UNC said it had notified the North Korean People’s Army of these violations and requested a meeting to discuss the investigation results and measures to prevent future violations. But the prospect of holding such talks remains unclear, military officials said, as North Korea has shut down its communication channels with the UNC and South Korea. Cross-border military talks have been halted since 2009. North Korea had yet to respond to the request as of Wednesday afternoon. “The measure will be dealt with through relevant international regulations and legal proceedings,” said South Korea’s Unification Ministry spokesman Baek Tae-hyun during a press briefing, without elaborating on the procedures. Based on an analysis of CCTV footage and satellite images, the North Korean solider is thought to have driven his jeep at about 70 kph before running more than 50 meters toward the South while being chased by fellow soldiers. Appearing to be caught off guard, the North Korean soldiers came from guard towers -- some from Panmungak inside the JSA --- and ran toward the location of the vehicle, which was stuck in a ditch north of the MDL. The wounded soldier jumped out of the jeep and started running toward the South while four North Korean soldiers started shooting at him. The wounded soldier was found by a building near the Freedom House inside the South Korea-controlled part of the Joint Security Area in the Demilitarized Zone. Lying against a wall on a pile of leaves, the defector was rescued by three South Korean soldiers who crawled to him. One of them was identified as the South Korean deputy JSA commander, while two of them were noncommissioned officers. The US commander was directing overall rescue efforts, the UNC said. The rescue efforts demonstrated “considerable courage and self-discipline” during the urgent situation in a volatile area where small-scale skirmish can escalate into major conflicts, said US Army Col. Chad Carroll, the UNC’s public affairs chief, during the briefing.  “The action taken by  battalion was in a manner that is consistent with  armistice agreement,” he said “ demonstrated appropriate, self-disciplined and sound decision making at a time when the situation on the ground was not nearly as clear as we can see on the video.”By Yeo Jun-suk","chasing north korean soldiers ,north korean soldier defecting ,korean soldier defecting to ,korean soldier defecting ,four north korean soldiers","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'the United Nations Command', 'north korean', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.06167334  0.18538298

The man, surnamed Kim, 40, had a two-year affair with Netchanok Nokyungtong, 20, during which she became pregnant.  Twenty-year-old Netchanok Nokyungtong admitted throwing the baby from the window of her apartment in Pattaya, Thailand. When Nokyungtong informed him of her pregnancy, Kim urged her to abort the baby and left Thailand. Nokyungtong went into labor in her apartment in Pattaya. After giving birth to the baby, she put the baby in to a plastic bag and threw it out the bedroom window from the 17th floor. She later testified that she was not ready for a child, nor had the money to support it. A witness, her neighbor, called the police after seeing “a large object fall down past the window.” When the neighbor got to the scene, the baby was already dead. Pattaya Police said, “The suspect admitted to her crime, but showed no signs of remorse.”By Im Eun-byel","thai woman kills new ,woman kills new born ,after her korean boyfriend ,woman threw her new ,her thai woman threw","['thai', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Netchanok Nokyungtong', 'Netchanok Nokyungtong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79031503  0.21917364

YonhapA total of 1,118 people have been displaced and are living in 13 temporary shelters, according to the ministry’s morning briefing, while some 20,000 from the military, police and fire departments and public volunteers have mobilized for restoration work. So far 82 people have been treated for injuries at hospitals. Of them, 15 remain hospitalized. The country’s second-strongest earthquake on record also left cracks and damage in walls at 110 elementary schools and 106 middle and high schools in the coastal region, although no deaths were reported due to the quake. Education authorities also postponed the country’s national university entrance examination, originally slated for Thursday, by a week on safety concerns. The annual exam is the focus of 12 years of education leading to university. The recent disaster, followed by last year’s 5.8 magnitude quake in nearby Gyeongju, raises public concerns over safety in a country that rarely experiences tremors as geologists warn of bigger seismic activities to come. The Pohang quake occurred at around 2:29 p.m. on Wednesday, sending tremors as far as to the capital Seoul, more than 300 kilometers away. To allay public concerns, Rep. Cho Jeong-sik of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, who heads the parliamentary land, infrastructure and transport committee, submitted a legislative proposal to improve the earthquake resistance of age-old infrastructure, buildings and transportation systems nationwide. The bill calls for government monitoring of infrastructure facilities aged 30 years or over to upgrade the nation‘s quake preparedness. “Subways and highways that were constructed more than 30 years ago during the industrialization period are not functioning well, and have serious security concerns. It is time to shift our response mode from the current passive one to a proactive one against age-old infrastructure,” Cho said.By Bak Se-hwan","government speeds up earthquake ,homes and injured dozens ,after pohang magnitude earthquake ,magnitude earthquake and series ,speeds up earthquake","['Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Ministry of Interior and Safety', 'the Korea Institute of Geosciences', 'Mineral Resources']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24953619 -0.01258367

On Monday morning, three days before the original day when Korea’s national college entrance exam was to be held, a senior high school student in Gangneung, surnamed Kang, called the police after realizing that his tablet PC had gone missing. The exam has since been delayed to next week due to an earthquake in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, on Wednesday. Kang tried to recall where he had left his tablet PC. Tracing back his steps, the student remembered that he had left it on top of an ATM machine in the local post office.  High school seniors students study for the state-administered College Scholastic Ability Test, which is slated for November. The tablet PC contained study notes for Suneung that Kang had prepared. Following an investigation, police said security footage showed two tourists leaving the post office with the student’s tablet PC. With the stolen item in hand, the two suspects were seen getting on an express bus to Seoul. Police caught the two suspects on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Hongcheon rest area. The device was reportedly returned to the student, who will take the Suneung on Thursday. By Catherine Chung","stole student tablet pc ,tablet pc police arrested ,arrest tourists who stole ,tourists who stole student ,who stole student tablet","['Suneung', 'Korea', 'Gangneung', 'Kang']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71113366 -0.05154643

Investigators from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office also searched four of its affiliated firms and the residences of four officials suspected of involvement to seize evidence, they said. The raid came as part of allegations that the 25th-largest family-controlled conglomerate has been running slush funds for former chairman Cho Suck-rai and his eldest son -- the group's current head -- Hyun-joon, through four affiliates.  Three of the affiliates are suspected of investing in deals that are irrelevant to their businesses and inflicting at least tens of billions of won in losses. Hyosung's real estate affiliate is believed to have incurred huge losses from investing in one of the three units. Cho and his son hold the biggest stakes in all of the four affiliates. Prosecutors said they plan to summon Hyosung officials for questioning once they finish analyzing the seized evidence. It is not the first time that Hyosung has been under a prosecutorial probe. The former and current chairmen have been investigated for embezzlement, tax evasion and accounting fraud charges in the past decade. Cho has received a suspended term for some of the charges. The allegations about slush funds were raised after Cho's younger son, Hyun-moon, filed a complaint with the prosecution seeking a probe against his father and older brother over the suspicion. Cho's three sons, including the youngest Hyun-sang, who is a vice president in the group, have been embroiled in a family feud over the leadership succession. Hyosung's businesses stretch from textiles, chemicals and trading to heavy industries and construction.","prosecutors office also searched ,fund prosecutors said friday ,suspected slush fund prosecutors ,prosecutors raid hyosung group ,said friday they raided","['south korean', 'Hyosung Group', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.43248829  0.41481292

The presidency has changed since, from the former Park Geun-hye administration to the incumbent Moon Jae-in’s, but the tension is continuing to build up with North’s reluctance to denuclearize and come forward for dialogue. The Immigration office between South and North Korea, the only gateway leading to the Kaesong industrial park, was closed with red barricades blocking access to its premises in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, on Nov. 1.Power was cut and a minimal number of people were seen in the area, creating an eerie atmosphere around the modern factory buildings. There were 124 South Korean companies that had been involved in the Kaesong park, with affiliated businesses counting up to over 5,000. The combined assets of the businesses and the governmental project in Kaesong amount to 924 billion won .

It's also unclear whether the North's troops actually crossed the MDL, even for seconds, during the hunt.He was recovered by South Korean and US soldiers later Monday and transported to a hospital south of Seoul,He underwent a surgery at Ajou University Hospital in Suwon and is still unconscious.He's in critical condition, and it's unclear whether he will live, given the seriousness of the wound, according to Lee Cook-jong, a doctor at the hospital. "" will have to ride out the crucial moments  over the next 10 days,"" he told reporters.The JCS confirmed that the North Korean man approached the JSA by car at around 3:15 p.m. Monday.The car sped towards a guard post but its wheels fell into a nearby drain, the JCS spokesman Army Col. Roh Jae-cheon said earlier. At the time of the defection, the soldier was clad in the Korean People's Army uniform and had no weapon, he added.""We closely monitored the situation with a surveillance system,"" Roh said. At a parliamentary defense committee session, Suh Wook, the chief director of operations at the JCS, said that Seoul's military believes four North Korean soldiers fired about 40 shots towards their runaway comrade.""Three North Korean soldiers, along with one from a guard post, went after him and fired at him,"" Suh said. ""At 3:31 p.m., we detected one defector who fell to the ground among fallen leaves 50 meters from the MDL,"" he added.At the same session, Defense Minister Song Young-moo said the incident marked the first time the North had fired shots into the South Korean side of the JSA.Song simply answered, ""Yes,"" when Liberty Korea Party Rep. Chung Jin-suk asked him if this was indeed the first such case.JCS officials said later there's a bullet mark on the southern side but an additional probe is needed to confirm whether it's associated with the latest firing incident at the JSA.As for the South Korean military's response, Song said, ""I think our military minimized the damage and handled the defected soldier well in such a short period of time.""When pressed if North Korea had violated the terms of the armistice, Song said he would ask the UNC's Military Armistice Committee to take appropriate measures.""If our request is not met, then we'll have no choice but to take legal steps and release a statement, among other measures,"" Song added.There was no report of any exchange of fire between the two Koreas.A North Korean soldier defected to the South via the JSA in 1998 and another in 2007.The UNCMAC is looking into the incident.The commission notified the North's military that the individual is being medically treated at this time. The message was conveyed verbally since there's no other communication channel between the two sides and the North's guards at the JSA listened to it, a UNC official said.","korean soldier drove car ,korean soldier who defected ,korean soldier drove ,soldier drove car before ,drove car before defecting","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'Panmunjom', 'north korean', 'the United Nations Command', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.53172803  0.28757563

The CCL was drawn just below the Demilitarized Zone bisecting the two Koreas from the west to the east in 1954 to strictly protect the security of military facilities and operations there. The 58-year-old American, only identified as ""A,"" was seized at 9:55 a.m. as he trespassed on the northern side of the control line in the border county of Yeoncheon, 62km north of Seoul, according to the authorities.  This undated file photo shows a checkpoint at the Civilian Control Line near the inter-Korean border. A villager in the county's Baekhak Ward found and reported him to the Army in the region about one hour before his arrest. He was captured in the nearby Misan Ward.

The ...","The widow of late singer Kim Kwang-seok filed a suit and an injunction Monday against a TV journalist and her brother-in-law for implicating her in the death of her daughter 10 years ago.  Seo Hae-soon lodged a defamation suit against Lee Sang-ho and his media company and against Kim Kwang-bok, her brother-in-law, seeking about 600 million won  in damages, her lawyer Park Hoon said in a Facebook post. The suit comes after police said last week they found no evidence linking Seo to the death of her teenage daughter in 2007, announcing their result of a recent probe launched at the request of Lee and Kim's brother.  They have accused Seo of negligence resulting in the child's unexpected death from acute pneumonia and said she might have intended to gain sole legal rights to Kim's musical assets. Kim committed suicide in 1996 at 32. Seo also filed for court injunctions seeking the suspension of Lee's documentary film about her late husband and a ban on any verbal or written slandering on her in relation to her daughter's death.The film raises suspicion that his death was a murder and pegs Seo and her brother as potential suspects. Seo requested Lee pay as much as 50 million won for every screening of his film in breach of the court order.She lodged a separate complaint with the prosecution seeking a criminal investigation into Lee and Kim for making false accusations, her lawyer said. The case surrounding the deaths in Seo's family began two months ago, when the daughter's death was made known by local media a decade after it happened. Lee, who has long raised questions over the singer's death, called for a reinvestigation into the death of Kim's only child, Seo-yeon. Seo has since appeared in many media interviews, flatly denying any involvement and blaming Lee for attacking her to attract publicity for his film. The death of the famed folk rock singer in the 1990s sent shock waves through fans and the public, who loved his plaintive yet captivating vocals and sentimental lyrics that critics say portrayed individuals' sorrow and frustration at a time when the society was struggling in its early stage of democracy following rapid industrialization.","singer wife sues journalist ,late singer wife sues ,wife sues journalist for ,wife sues journalist ,damages her lawyer park","['Kim Kwang - seok', 'seo hae - soon', 'Lee Sang - ho', 'Kim Kwang - bok']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.00050962  0.13682805

Doctors can consult via live, online video conferencing, and lectures at prestigious Kim Il-sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes. People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones. In the wallets of the privileged are ""Jonsong"" or ""Narae"" cards for e-shopping and online banking. Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web.  It's just not the World Wide Web. This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium-sized company might use for its employees.  The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes, and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea, North Korea is still the least Internet-friendly country on Earth. Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable. Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn’t shared, and the price for trying to get around the government‘s rules can be severe.  But for Kim Jong-un, the country’s first leader to come of age with the Internet, the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive. It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology -- and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of. It also allows for the possibility of cyber-attacks on the West.  Pyongyang's solution is a two-tiered system where the trusted elite can surf the Internet with relative freedom while the masses are kept inside the national intranet, painstakingly sealed off from the outside world, meticulously surveilled and built in no small part on pilfered software.  The regime created, in other words, an online version of North Korea itself.  Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea Surfing the intranet Rising from Ssuk Island in the Taedong River, which divides Pyongyang east and west, is a building shaped like a colossal atom.  The ""knowledge sector"" is a key priority for Kim Jong-un, and the sprawling, glassy Sci-Tech Complex, a center for the dissemination of science-related information throughout the country, is one of his signature development projects. It houses North Korea’s biggest e-library, with more than 3,000 terminals where factory workers participate in tele-learning, kids in their bright red scarves watch cartoons and university students do research.  Pak Sung-jin, a 30-year-old postgraduate in chemistry, came to work on an essay. It‘s a weekday and the e-library is crowded.  Unlike most North Koreans, Pak has some experience with the Internet, though on a supervised, need-only basis. If Pak needs anything from the Internet, accredited university officials will find it for him. As a scholar and a scientist, Pak says, it’s his patriotic duty to be on top of the most up-to-date research.  He echoes the official condemnation that the Internet has been poisoned by the American imperialists and their stooges. ""There ought to be a basic acceptance the Internet should be used peacefully,"" he says.  Today, he is relying on the Internet‘s North Korean alter ego, the national intranet.  Below a red label that states his black ""Ullim"" desktop computer was donated by Dear Respected Leader Kim Jong-un, what’s on Pak's screen is for North Korean eyes only. The IP address, 10.76.1.11, indicates he’s on the walled-off network North Koreans call ""Kwangmyong,"" which means brightness or light.  Using the ""Naenara"" browser -- the name means ""my country"" but it's a modified version of FireFox -- Pak visits a restaurant page, his university website, and cooking and online shopping sites.  There are very few actual sites on Kwangmyong. An official at the Sci-Tech Center said they number 168.  They are spread across separate networks for government agencies, schools and libraries, and companies. It’s all domestically run, though government-approved content culled from the Internet can be posted by administrators, primarily for researchers like Pak.  North Korea's national intranet concept is unique and extreme even when compared with other information-wary countries. China and Cuba, for example, are well known for the extent of control the government exerts over what citizens can see. But that is done primarily through censorship and blocking, not complete separation.  Like most North Korean computers, the desktops at the Sci-Tech Complex run on the ""Red Star"" operating system, which was developed by the Korea Computer Center from Linux open-source coding.  Red Star 3.0 has the usual widgets: the Naenara browser, email, a calendar and time zone settings, even ""kPhoto"" . Older versions featured a Windows XP user interface but it now it has a Mac design, right down to the ""spinning beach ball"" wait icon.  Versions of Red Star that have made it out of North Korea and into the hands of foreign coding experts also reveal some rather sinister, and for most users invisible, features.  Any attempt to change its core functions or disable virus checkers results in an automatic reboot cycle. Files downloaded from USBs are watermarked so that authorities can identify and trace criminal or subversive activity, a security measure that takes aim at the spread of unauthorized content from South Korea, China and elsewhere.  Red Star also uses a trace viewer that takes regular screenshots of what is being displayed. The screenshots can’t be deleted or accessed by the typical user but are available for checking if a trained government official decides to take a look.  Outside North Korea, Android phones have a similar trace-viewer feature, noted Will Scott, who taught computer science at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in 2013 and is now a doctoral student at the University of Washington. But the Red Star version reflects the regime‘s very specific surveillance and violation-busting priorities. It doesn’t collect much more than the Android would; however, it is designed to make getting at that information easier for a local authority who isn‘t an expert programmer.  Scott said the North has been ""very effective"" in using such technology to serve its goals.  Nat Kretchun, deputy director of the Open Technology Fund, said the kinds of censorship and surveillance software in Red Star and the mobile operating systems of phones and tablets reveal a new information control strategy.  Under Kim Jong-un’s predecessors, the flow of information was primarily controlled through a resource-intensive human network -- the State Security Ministry's ""thought police,"" for example, or Pyongyang’s iconic traffic controllers -- that kept tabs on what people were up to. But the advent of the Internet and advances in communication technology poked holes in that strategy, particularly among the better educated, younger and more affluent, the very segment of society that could be most likely to pose a political threat.  So, while maintaining its old school tactics on the ground and enforcing the blackout of the global Internet, North Korean officials have learned to adapt by using the online devices themselves as yet another tool for surveillance.  ""In North Korea cell phones and intranet-enabled devices are on balance pro-surveillance and control,"" said Kretchun, who has been studying North Korea‘s relationship to the Internet for years.  The Azalea smart phone and the Ryonghung iPadThe most common online experience for North Koreans isn’t on a laptop or desktop. It‘s on a smart phone.  A decade ago, only a small cadre of select regime and military officials had access to smart phones. Now, according to the main provider’s most recent financial reports, there are an estimated 2.5-3 million mobile phones in North Korea, a country of 25 million.  The rapid spread of mobile phones is one of the biggest success stories of the Kim Jong Un era. After a couple of false starts, the North‘s foray into mobile telecoms began in earnest in 2008 under Kim Jong Il. But it has truly blossomed over the past five years with the introduction of 3G services, thanks in large part to two foreign investors -- Loxley Pacific of Thailand and Egypt’s Orascom Telecom Media and Technology.  Like the walled-off intranet, North Korea‘s phones deny access to the outside world.  Local phones allow North Koreans to call and text each other, play games, surf the domestic intranet and access some other services. Users have hundreds of ring tones to choose from, and can get weather updates, look words up in dictionaries and snap selfies. But they cannot receive or place calls to numbers outside that network -- the rest of the world, in other words.  It’s easy enough for North Koreans to buy phones, though the phones must be registered and approved. A good ""Pyongyang"" or ""Arirang"" model smart phone costs from $200 to $400. More basic phones go for much less, especially if the phone is second-hand.  On the second floor of the Pottonggang IT center, a clerk stands behind a glass display cabinet filled with tablets and USB flash drives. Signs on the wall behind her advertise anti-virus software and apps to put on mobile phones, which they can do by Bluetooth at the store. One of the most popular apps is a role playing game based on ``Boy General,‘’ a locally created hit anime series. It costs $1.80.  Foreigners in North Korea are relegated to a different network and cannot make calls to, or receive calls from, local numbers. They can buy local phones if they want, but the devices will be stripped of the apps and features that they normally carry and securely coded so that the apps can‘t be added on later. Wi-fi use is banned for North Koreans, and tightly restricted and monitored to block surreptitious piggybacking on foreigners’ signals.  North Korea undoubtedly imports and rebrands some of its IT products. But over the past few months, two companies have generated quite a stir among Apple fans with products billed to be wholly domestic: the ""Jindallae  III"" mobile phone and the ""Ryonghung iPad."" The gadgets‘ insouciant similarity to Apple products, and the flat-out appropriation of the ``iPad’‘ name, isn’t especially surprising. Kim Jong Un likes Apple products _ he has been photographed with a MacBook Pro on his private jet, and even had a 21-inch iMac on the desk beside him when state media showed him reviewing a nuclear ""U.S. mainland strike plan"" four years ago.  It seems North Korean coders have also lifted some ideas from Apple.  Outside experts believe a program similar to what Apple uses in its OS X and iOS is believed to be the basis of the booby-trap that thwarts attempts to disable security functions in Red Star. It‘s now a staple on North Korean phones. And by 2014, all mobile phone operating systems had been updated to include the watermarking system to reject apps or media that don’t carry a government signature of approval.  It‘s the same mechanism used by Apple to block unauthorized applications from the App Store, but in North Korea’s case serves instead to control access to information.  ""The stakes are infinitely higher in North Korea, where communications are monitored and being caught talking about the wrong thing could land you in a political prison camp,"" Kretchun noted.  Wired elites and cybersoldiersWhile blocking off the masses, North Korea allows more Internet access to a small segment of society, including the country‘s elite and its cybersoldiers.  To create a snapshot of the online behavior of the elite, US-based cyber threat intelligence company Recorded Future and Team Cymru, a non-profit Internet security group, analyzed activity in IP ranges believed to be used by North Korea from April to July this year. They found that the limited number of North Koreans with access to the Internet are much more active and engaged in the world and with contemporary services and technologies than many outsiders had previously thought, according to Priscilla Moriuchi, Recorded Future’s director of strategic threat development and a former NSA agent.  ""North Korean leaders are not disconnected from the world and the consequences of their actions,"" she said.  How deep the access goes isn‘t known. Recorded Future and Team Cymru officials contacted by The AP refused to comment on details of their dataset, including how many ""elite"" users were observed and how foreign tourists or residents in the North were excluded.  Even so, it stands to reason at least some members of the North Korean leadership have the access they need to keep up on world events and that specialist agents are allowed to monitor and cull intelligence from the internet.  There is also strong evidence that North Korea allows people involved in hacking or cyber operations the access necessary for a deep engagement in cyberattacks and cybercrime.  According to the FBI, the North’s bigger hacks include the recent WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in May and crippled parts of Britain‘s National Health Service. It has been linked to attacks on the Bangladeshi central bank last year and on banks in South Korea going back to 2013. There was also the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures over the release of the ""Interview,"" a black comedy that graphically portrayed Kim Jong Un being killed. U.S. authorities recently dubbed North Korea’s cyber presence ""Hidden Cobra.""  Weaponizing cyberspace is a logical option for the North because it can be done at relatively low cost and at the same time denied, according to a Congressional report submitted in August.  Pyongyang has denied hacking allegations, but the ability to carry out sophisticated cyber operations is a powerful military weapon in the hands of a state. Just as assuredly as North Korea is developing its nuclear and missile capabilities, most experts assume, it‘s honing its cyber warfare tool box.  Beau Woods, the deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, cautioned of a ""preponderance of question marks"" regarding North Korea’s cyber skills. But he warned of how potentially devastating a more cyber-active North Korea could be.  Those concerns are turned on their head back at the Sci-Tech Center in Pyongyang.  Pak, the chemist, supports the official line in North Korea that the increasing danger of cyberattacks and slanderous Internet propaganda comes from the U.S. against Pyongyang. The government says that justifies ""protective"" walls to shield the masses from aggressive propaganda, and virtually requires extensive cybersecurity measures in the name of national defense.  ""Don't you see how severe the anti-Republic slander of our enemies on the Internet is?"" Pak said, although the restrictive policies make it difficult for him to carry out his research.

Vietnam War veterans are hailed here as patriotic heroes who helped propel Korea’s rise in the 1960s and ’70s. But many Vietnamese remember it differently. It is not well known here, but South Korean soldiers are accused of brutally killing Vietnamese civilians, including many women and children, during Korea’s 1964-73 involvement there. Civic groups put the total killed in these massacres at 9,000. For history teacher Moon Yong-po, it is something South Korea should study, apologize for and teach its children about. Moon and his 11 students flew to Seoul from Jeju Island last week to join a rally in front of Cheong Wa Dae, calling on President Moon Jae-in to apologize. Kim Ji-ho holds a board reading ""I am sorry, Vietnam. Apology to Vietnam, Justice to the future generation, Peace to Asia! “We demand an apology from the Japanese government for what it did to us in the past. I think our offering an apology to Vietnam would serve as a good example for Japan,” Kim Ji-ho, 13, one of the teacher’s pupils, told The Korea Herald outside Cheong Wa Dae on Nov. 2.The Nov. 2 rally was part of a relay of one-person protests timed for the president’s scheduled visit to Vietnam later this week. President Moon, currently in Indonesia as part of a three-nation tour, is to touch down on Saturday in Danang, Vietnam, to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Under the military-backed authoritarian Park Chung-hee administration, South Korea sent over 300,000 soldiers to Vietnam to support the US in the fight against communism in Vietnam. No official figures are available for the number of Vietnamese civilians killed at the hands of Korean soldiers in villages including Phong Nhi, Phong Nhat and Ha My in Quang Nam Province. Former liberal President Kim Dae-jung expressed his regret in 1998 during his visit to Vietnam, saying, “I am sorry that Korea participated in an unfortunate war and inflicted suffering on Vietnamese people.” President Roh Moo-hyun also said in 2004 that Korea had a “debt” to repay while paying tribute to Vietnam’s communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh. But South Korea has never formally acknowledged civilian massacres by its troops or officially investigated any related allegations. Vietnam has also not asked for an apology from the Korean government, seeking to leave the past behind and instead look to the future. Now, South Korea and Vietnam share close ties. Korea is Vietnam’s biggest foreign investor and second-biggest donor in official development assistance. Vietnam is one of Korea’s largest trading partners. “I wanted to teach my students the meaning of peace. Peace can be made when we know our own wrongdoings and ask for forgiveness,” history teacher Moon said. “It is not the crime I or my students committed, but history will only repeat itself if we forget about our own wrongdoings.” “I wanted to teach them that the future generation should develop relations of peace, aware of past mistakes.” Moon and his pupils, holding boards reading “I am sorry, Vietnam,” caught the attention of Vietnamese tourists who happened to pass by the presidential office. Students hold art-works and boards that read ""I am sorry, Vietnam"" in front of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in central Seoul on Nov. 2 After, they approached the protesters, read the information on when and where the massacres by the Korean troops took place, and took pictures with them.“I don’t hate Korea. They made a mistake in the past. But it is meaningful that they want to show that they are really sorry about what happened,” said Thao Nguyen, a 19-year-old Vietnamese tourist. Vietnamese tourists take a picture with Korean protesters holding up a placard reading ""I am sorry, Vietnam"" in front of the presidential office on Nov. 2 A war veteran who fought alongside the US forces in Vietnam in 1967 told The Korea Herald that he had witnessed his own troops massacring Vietnamese civilians. “I still cannot forget the moment I saw dead bodies of Vietnamese people lying on both sides of the road I was patroling every morning,” Ryu Jin-seong claimed. “It was a wrong war that should have not taken place. We went there because we were told to do so.”“If needed, we should make an apology.” Seok Mi-hwa, secretary-general of Korea-Vietnam Peace Foundation, urged President Moon to deliver a message of peace to Vietnam by recognizing its own wartime atrocities during the Vietnam War.“The South Korean government should investigate the Korean troops’ massacre of Vietnamese civilians and, if confirmed, it should take responsibility for their wartime atrocities,” Seok said. On this year’s Memorial Day on June 6, President Moon addressed the country’s Vietnam War veterans, declaring that Korea’s economic takeoff was thanks to their dedication and sacrifice in Vietnam.His remarks prompted the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry to release an official statement asking Seoul to “refrain from statements and actions that hurt the Vietnamese people and have a negative impact on friendship and cooperation between the two countries.” But above all, apologizing for Korea’s wartime crimes is in the interest of the Korean people, Seok said. “Whether it is a history of being assailant or victim, it should be reflected upon so that something like this will never happen again,” she said. “It is not Vietnam’s problem. It is a problem of our own.” By Ock Hyun-ju","korean soldiers fighting alongside ,war crimes in vietnam ,south korean soldiers fighting ,korea own war crimes ,korean soldiers fighting","['South Koreans', 'south korean', 'US', 'Korea ’s', 'Vietnamese', 'south korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30862373  0.43458009

Lee Chul-hee of the ruling Democratic Party, a typical army trainee shares a squadroom with up to 40 other trainees during the 5-week intensive training for basic combat skills. Each room is about 4.91 square meters, about one third of the minimum housing space stated in the Housing Act, which is 12.28 square meters. Living in such a crowded and confined space is not just inhumane but it could also pose trainees at risk of various contagious illnesses, the lawmaker pointed out. South Korean squadrooms typically have no bed and trainees sleep on the floor.   The government data showed that at least 460 army trainees suffered pneumonia last year. So far this year, 545 people were diagnosed with pneumonia while in training. About 35 percent of the 462 adenovirus - causative virus for pneumonia - infection cases reported in the military occurred at these training centers, separate data showed.","korean army training camps ,army trainee shares squadroom ,news korean army training ,army training camps crowded ,korean army training","['South Korea ’s', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Lee Chul - hee', 'Democratic Party']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35477728  0.33215192

The victims reported feeling “something cold” on their legs and discovered the ink-sprayed stockings with no one in sight. Business College students further reported falling victim to the ink-spraying through their social media. Multiple posts on Pusan National University’s Facebook student page revealed that the situation was getting out of hand and the students felt too anxious to attend class. Some students suspect that the suspect may be the actual “Gangnam Station  stocking terrorist” himself. Last year, a man was caught by the police for spraying black ink on 16 flight attendants and then keeping the thrown out stockings as souvenirs near Gangnam Station. It may be possible that the suspect in Busan is spraying ink intending to do the same. Busan District Police said that they could not find any security footage of the suspect committing the crime and do not know whether there are any more victims.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office banned Kim Jang-soo, a former defense minister and ambassador to China, from leaving the country over suspicions that he played a part in altering the presidential office‘s daily log concerning the Sewol ferry sinking that left 304 killed or missing, on April 16, 2014.  Kim Jang-soo The 68-year-old was the person who reported the disaster to the then state leader Park Geun-hye over the phone and in writing, as the NSC chief at the time of the incident. According to the evidence revealed by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae earlier this month, Kim is thought to have manipulated the daily record and pushed the time of his reporting to a later time, from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. Current Presidential Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok said that Kim’s fabrication appears to be an attempt to reduce the time between the first report and Park’s first order, which is said to have been made at around 10:15 a.m.Kim, who took the post in March 2013, was replaced in May the next year, after he came under fire over his statement that NSC is not the control tower of disasters. Former defense minister Kim Kwan-jin who succeeded the NSC is also suspected of ordering for the government’s crisis response manual to be changed without following the needed legal procedures. The presidential directive was changed in July of that year so that the duty of controlling disaster situations falls under the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, not the NSC. The presidential office had requested a probe into the two former NSC chiefs. The question of where the former President Park was at the time of the sinking remains, as she was absent from duty during the seven hours from when the sinking was first reported, until she appeared at the government task force at around 5:30 p.m. Park is currently behind bars, standing trial over a massive corruption scandal that led to her ouster in March.

We did not see any financial damage from the case,” the company said. It added it does not know whether other automobile components, needed in fixing the cars, were sold together at the time.The EKN alarms the communist state every six months on their liabilities, though they had not gotten any response. EKN said it would not give up on collecting the debts.According EKN’s annual report in 2016, North Korea currently owes SEK 2.7 billion  to Sweden as the debt has swollen due to the accumulated interest. It said the amount accounts for more than 45 percent of the entire debt owed by 16 countries, and that North Korea is the only debtor that has never implemented a debt repayment.

According to embassy officials, a total of 15 such cases involving 16 South Korean gamblers, who are either tourists or residents, have been reported to the embassy so far since April this year.A South Korean man in his 40s went missing last week after playing at a Manila casino with a loan of 13 million won from a Chinese gang. He was abducted after losing all of the funds and was unable to pay back the loan. After the victim alerted the embassy to his location with his cell phone, the embassy, in cooperation with local police, tracked him to a house just north of Manila, where they also found another Korean national and a Chinese woman detained against their will for at least one month.Lee Soo-bok, police consul at the embassy, said illegal lending by many Chinese loan sharks is rampant in the Philippines. ""Chinese private lenders offer loans to gamblers irrespective of their nationalities, and abduct and detain them as a way to collect their loans,"" he said.Following their rescue, some South Korean victims returned home without cooperating with the local police's investigation into the perpetrators, the embassy said.The embassy said, in order to prevent such similar cases from recurring, it plans to ask the South Korean police to investigate alleged gambling by South Koreans who don't cooperate with the local police and leave the Southeast Asian country.","korean gamblers being abducted ,gamblers visiting philippine casinos ,korean gamblers visiting philippine ,casinos have been abducted ,she borrowed 15 million","['HANOI', 'south korean', 'philippine', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'Manila', 'chinese', 'south korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.01265542  0.5207907

Kim Tae-nyeon, chief policymaker of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, said Tuesday that his party will push to revise the Animal Protection Act to punish owners in pet attack cases. He also spoke of the possible addition of clauses calling for mandatory education for owners and the training of misbehaving dogs. “By thoroughly reviewing cases abroad and public sentiment, the ruling party will establish a legal framework for pet attack cases and revise the Animal Protection Act so that it ensures the safety of both animals and humans,” said Rep. Kim. At the moment, four bills that intend to reinforce the responsibility of the owners of fierce dogs and the punishment of owners in the event of dog attacks are pending at the National Assembly. Similar bills were proposed before, but discarded in 2006 and 2012.On Monday, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs also said it would push to add specific dog bite clauses to the same law. The ministry said it would seek to raise fines for owners caught not putting their dogs on leash in public to 200,000 won  for the first-time offense, and 300,000 won and 500,000 won for second- and third-time violations, respectively. The current law imposes a penalty of 50,000 won, 70,000 won and 100,000 won, respectively. Also, more breeds of dangerous dogs will become subject to stricter management, under the ministry’s plan. Currently, there are only five breeds under the category that must be leashed and muzzled in public: American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, Rottweilers, Tosa dogs and their mixed breeds. Officials said they would consider any type of breed that is highly likely to attack and injure humans under the category of dangerous dogs and set specific examples of such dogs in the revised law. The ministry also unveiled a plan to give out rewards to those who report negligent dog owners who do not leash or muzzle their dogs in public in violation of the law. About 10 to 20 percent of the levied fine in the reported cases will be given as reward money. The ministry, however, remained cautious about the possible euthanasia of dogs involved in fatal attacks, citing possible opposition from animal rights group.“, we should first set principles in the revised law so that the owners of dogs and their pets are not treated like potential criminals in our society,” said ministry official Park Byung-hong during a briefing. Earlier this month, the owner of a famous Korean restaurant chain died six days after being bitten by a French bulldog, which was later revealed to be owned by popular singer and actor Choi Si-won. But Choi’s father wrote on his personal social media account that investigations showed that she died of blood poisoning and that it was “difficult to determine the exact cause of her death due to a possibility of problems in the process of hospital treatment or secondary infection,” worsening the public’s anger toward his irresponsible attitude over the case. As of Tuesday, over 800 people had flocked to the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae’s online petition webpage to call for stronger legal measures to urge compulsory leashing and muzzling of dogs in public. According to the Korea Consumer Agency, a total of 1,019 dog bite accidents occurred here last year, more than quadrupling from 245 in 2011.By Kim Da-sol","owners in pet attack ,korea moves to toughen ,moves to toughen law ,dog owners south korea ,negligent dog owners south","['South Korea', 'YonhapRep', 'Kim Tae - nyeon', 'Democratic Party of Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57339239  0.21219267

He also told Chung that China and Russia will be useful to make North Korea appear at the dialogue table.Chung also asked Kiska to help South Korean businesses by improving infrastructure, saying companies are looking to expand investments in Slovakia. Kiska responded that his country understands the importance of establishing solid business infrastructure and will roll out policies supporting South Korean businesses including Kia Motors Corp. that has a production base in Zilina, Slovakia. Kiska also said that he will visit South Korea during the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games next year to further develop their relationship. Following his meeting with Kiska, Chung later met Slovakian Parliament Speaker Andrej Danko to talk about economic cooperation between two countries. “Both countries need to expand opportunities for cooperation in areas like education and R&D;,” Chung said during a joint press conference with Danko. “South Korea has experience and knowhow not only in the manufacturing industry, but also in the information technology industry. I think both countries need to further beef up cooperation in the culture and tourism area.”Danko said Slovakia is ready to listen to South Korean investors and hopes the friendly relationship between the two countries can continue. However, he also told Chung that South Korean business owners should pay careful attention to Slovakian workers. Chung’s visit to Slovakia was part of his diplomatic trip that began on Oct. 11. He previously visited Russia and Poland before landing in Slovakia. Chung will return home Saturday.","thursday met slovakian president ,assembly speaker meets slovakian ,korean national assembly speaker ,met slovakian president ,slovakian leader to discuss","['Slovakia', 'Yonhap', 'south Korean National Assembly', 'Chung Se - kyun', 'slovakian', 'Andrej Kiska', 'North Korea', 'Chung', 'Kiska', 'slovakian', 'european']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.96435547  1.0361526

Gil Won-ok ""I may have realized my dream at 90, but I guess it's not the same as realizing it at a young age,"" she said.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were mobilized to work in frontline brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910-45.The issue of the ""comfort women,"" Japan's euphemism for the sex slaves, has long been a thorn in the two countries' ties.In 2015, the two sides struck a deal to resolve the issue once and for all through a Japanese government apology and reparations to the South Korean victims. But many of the survivors and civic groups rejected the agreement over what they perceived as Tokyo's lack of sincerity and violations of the spirit of the deal.In Washington, Gil was supposed to attend the unveiling of a girl statue symbolizing the victims at Salisbury University, Maryland.But the plan was abruptly canceled due to what Korean activists said was likely opposition from the Japanese government.""I think it's fair to say that installing such statues is hope for your future,"" Gil said.She will still visit the university on Thursday at the request of the professors who had pushed for the project. The professors, the activists said, have promised to keep trying.Asked if she would come back if the statue is placed, Gil said, ""Wherever a girl statue is erected, I go to visit because I want to see it, but also because I have to meet her.""Tokyo has bristled at the erection of such figures, one of which is a rallying point outside the former Japanese embassy building in Seoul. Earlier this year Tokyo recalled its ambassador to Seoul to protest the installation of another statue outside its consulate in Busan, South Korea's second largest city.""History is not something that can be erased because you want it to be erased,"" Gil said.

Abe visited Yasukuni war shrine in a move sure to infuriate China and South Korea. The visit to the shrine, which honors 2.5 million war dead including convicted class A war criminals, appears to be a departure from Abe`s pragmatic approach to foreign policy, in which he tried to avoid alienating neighboring countries. It was the first visit by a sitting prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi went to mark the end of World War II in 2006. ""Japan should demonstrate humble soul-searching and repentance through sincere behavior based on the appropriate recognition of history,"" he added. According to local media reports, Abe, along with other senior politicians, sent ritual offerings to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo to mark its annual autumn festival. The shrine honors around 2.4 million of Japan's war dead, including 14 Class-A war criminals. Visits or offerings usually spark strong criticism from neighboring countries, including South Korea, as it is regarded as a symbol of Japan's militaristic past.","japanese politicians sending offerings ,controversial war linked shrine ,korea voiced concern tuesday ,concern tuesday over ritual ,responsible japanese politicians sending","['South Korea', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Noh Kyu - duk']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17280209  0.81735766

North Korean leaflets are not hard to find in South Korea while the communist state is said to periodically send leaflets using balloons and unmanned aerial vehicles, but it marked a rare incident for such bills to be found near the presidential office. This photo shows a propaganda leaflet, allegedly from North Korea, that was found on a street near South Korea`s presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Oct. 16, 2017. The bills found this week near Cheong Wa Dae carried at least three different phrases, all condemning South Korea or the United States for taking a hostile policy toward Pyongyang.One, for instance, took pity on Seoul for relying on the United States for its own defense while claiming the US itself was afraid of North Korea.A Cheong Wa Dae official said an investigation will soon be launched to find out how the leaflets found their way to the presidential office.""The security team has collected the bills, and related offices will soon investigate how they came to be found in the area,"" the official said, while speaking on the condition of anonymity.","korean propaganda leaflets find ,north korean propaganda leaflets ,south korea presidential office ,korean propaganda leaflets have ,presumed korean propaganda leaflets","['north korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'Cheong', 'Chunchugwan']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.3907077   0.39370957

Local media reports said Tuesday that Chinese police warned around 10 South Korean businesspeople, community associates and religious leaders residing near the border to evacuate due to the possibility of abduction by North Korea. They were notified during the Chuseok holiday earlier this month amid heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ahead of China’s upcoming Communist Party Congress. Among them, five had already left China as of 7 a.m. Wednesday, while the rest have chosen temporary escape or are considering to return to South Korea, added Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.The South Korean Consulate General in Shenyang pointed out that it was an unprecedented move for Chinese authorities to directly communicate with South Korean nationals on such matters. It also advised South Koreans to be cautious of strangers and alert family members or acquaintances.“Previously, the consulate made the safety measures whenever there were signs of such attacks by the North -- this is the first time Chinese authorities took direct action,” said Consul-General to Shenyang Shin Bong-sup. An unnamed consulate official suggested that the authorities’ actions were triggered by an obtained intelligence report hinting at North Korea’s secretive operation.In May, a 60-year-old North Korean defector reportedly went missing in the Chinese city of Yanji, near the North-China border, while in 2016, an ethnic Korean named Han Chung-ryeol was allegedly murdered by North Korean agents. Han was a Christian pastor who aided North Korean defectors in China.But experts here are skeptical that North Korea would make a move to kidnap South Korean nationals, despite heightening tensions. “It seems the warning is part of China’s efforts to adopt stricter security before its most important political event,” Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told The Korea Herald.“North Korea has been causing trouble near the North-China border and China needs to show that it is making all efforts to contain such problems both locally and globally,” Lee said. South Korea’s government data showed that about 500 of its citizens have been abducted by the reclusive state since after the Korean War . Those snatched away were often reportedly used for propaganda activities or intelligence gathering. However, for more than a decade, North Korean agents have been mainly targeting North Korean defectors rather than those who were born and bred in South Korea. Meanwhile, South Korea has been ramping up its reconnaissance operations ahead of the 19th national congress of China’s Communist Party, which Cheong Wa Dae has highlighted as a date when a North Korean provocation might take place. Anton Morozov, a senior Russian lawmaker, who visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, claimed the North is currently preparing for a new long-range missile test in order to prove it can “hit the west coast of the United States.”“As far as we understand, they intend to launch one more long-range missile in the near future,” he said.

The former leader has been detained since March 31.Whether the documents will lead to an extension of her arrest remains to be seen, but many have said fresh allegations may increase the possibility.The court is expected to reach a decision on Park's detention Friday. The tragic sinking of the passenger ferry partly triggered the start of candlelight vigils late last year that eventually led to the ouster of Park in March.Many, including the bereaved families of the 304 people who were killed or went missing in the accident, demanded the former president to reveal her whereabouts on the day of the accident, claiming she may have failed to carry out her duty while being caught up in personal affairs.Cheong Wa Dae said the documents discovered at its crisis management office also indicated the National Security Council may have altered its manual on crisis management, possibly to remove any blame that might fall on the former president.Before what Im called an ""illegal"" revision of the manual, the NSC guideline cleared named the NSC as the top control tower in dealing with any major disaster or accident.The printed phrase was crossed out with a red pen in late July, apparently at an instruction from then NSC chief Kim Kwan-jin, Im said.A handwritten phrase was added in its place stating the NSC was to act as a control tower only in security-related incidents. The revised manual was then delivered all government offices, according to Im.Such a revision apparently came after then presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon testified before the National Assembly that Cheong Wa Dae or the NSC were not the control tower in dealing with the ferry sinking, Im noted.The incumbent presidential chief of staff also said such a revision to the NSC manual required legal procedures, including a review and approval by the Ministry of Government Legislation, but that the former administration took none of such steps.""Cheong Wa Dae believes such an incident must never be repeated. Believing the incident represents the worst case of manipulation of power, the presidential office plans to request a formal investigation,"" Im said.","former president lied ,the passenger ferry sank ,former president lied about ,president lied about her ,indicate former president lied",['Cheong Wa Dae'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57950944  0.28945935

Park's now-deceased colleagues, who had been convicted of the same charges, were also found innocent.Park's ordeal began when he and two others were abducted to the North in 1968 while fishing for yellow corvina aboard their boat, the Youngchang, near the western sea border. They were released from the North four months later, but then authorities in the staunchly anti-communist South Korea charged them with espionage. Former fisherman Park Choon-hwan  Park was sentenced in 1972 to seven years in prison on spy charges. He served out the term, but was indicted again for violating the then anti-communist law and fisheries law and sentenced to eight months in prison.The 1972 conviction was cleared in a retrial in 2011, and the second conviction was nullified this week.Park has said that upon his return from the North, he suffered various torture at the hands of police and made false confessions, saying he was a North Korean spy and tried to convince a friend to become a spy too. That friend was also convicted and served a prison term.""I was found to be completely innocent, but I feel unfair as I'm this old,"" Park said. ""I feel very badly about the government.""Park's lawyer, Lee Myong-choo, said that about 1,500 South Korean fishermen were punished after being abducted to the North, but only about 10 of them have been cleared of the convictions.""We have a long way to go, and in the case of the Youngchang, we're going to seek compensation from the government,"" he said.","korean court has acquitted ,49 years after abduction ,former fisherman of charges ,acquitted an elderly former ,retrial 49 years after","['JEONJU', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'the Jeonju District Court', 'Park']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42990729  0.18594362

The online community offered mainly voyeur photographs and videos of so-called revenge porn. Most of the content circulated through the website was considered likely to have been taken or uploaded without the consent of the women appearing in them. But the crackdown on Soranet has done little to address the wider problem, with the number of such crimes -- taking illicit videos without consent and distributing them online -- continuing to rise. According to the National Police Agency, the number of cases leading to arrest came to 2,400 in 2012, but jumped to reach 7,623 three years later. As of August this year, 3,914 offenses have been reported. Aware of the gravity of the situation, President Moon Jae-in has called for comprehensive measures to curb “hidden camera crimes.”“We need to come up with stronger punishment against the criminals and come up with special arrangement for the victims,” he said in a Cabinet meeting on Aug. 8. On Sept. 27, the government announced a set of plans to prevent and punish such digital sex crimes, which include conducting regular inspections of public facilities and stronger regulations to stop import, sale and possession of cameras modified for illegal purposes.The measure also includes stronger punishment for those spreading revenge pornography, including imprisonment of up to five years. Circulating videos without consent will also be punishable with up to seven years in prison. Despite the government’s resolve to take on the issue, experts say it will not be an easy fight.Technology has made hidden cameras more difficult to identify, with miniaturized devices now coming in all shapes and sizes. They are designed to resemble car keys, pens, spectacles and watches, among other things.For the victims, the matter becomes much more serious once videos are posted online. After they are uploaded it becomes almost impossible to stop them from spreading. A lawmaker called for a special investigation system to be introduced for the victims to prevent secondary damage.“The government said it would provide funds to remove such videos, but the internet makes redistribution too easy,” Rep. Song Hee-kyoung of Liberty Korea Party said. According to government data revealed by the first-term legislator, the Korea Communications Commission has received more than 15,000 requests to have such videos removed from online during the past three years. But only 3.7 percent, 570, were erased. The average number of days it took for them to be deleted was also 10.9 days. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency conducted a monthlong crackdown in September to detect hidden cameras in 1,474 public facilities. But they announced on Saturday they had not found a single camera.The inspection areas include 290 subway and train stations, five bus terminals 660 public toilets and 90 universities.""We received the budget to buy devices to detect such hidden cameras only this year, and bought 92 of them,” Han Ye-ri at the National Police Agency told The Korea Herald. “The 92 detectors are not enough for the whole nation. While it would be good if we can actually catch the cameras, we aim for our efforts and inspections to reassure citizens and possibly prevent further crimes.”When asked about future plans to make regular the inspections, she said it was likely but nothing had been decided yet. Lee Su-jeong, a professor of criminal psychology at Kyonggi University stressed that a fundamental solution can only come when society changes. “The hidden camera crime trend now is not a matter to be dealt with as psychological voyeurism. There are already illegal routes to distribute illicit footage and it is not too much to say it has formed an industry,” she told The Korea Herald.“Society should openly discuss and draw a conclusion that it is not okay to sell such illicit videos. Without a comprehensive view change, the government’s countermeasures would only have a temporary effect.”By Jo He-rim","south korean women fear ,korean women fear ,korean women fear that ,hidden cameras the fear ,many south korean women",['south korean'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6885801   0.200736

Indonesia declared its right to sovereign rule on the day in 1945, marking the start of diplomatic and armed resistance against forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians, who officially acknowledged the country’s independence in 1949. “August 17 is an important day for Indonesia, when all our people were freed from the bondage of a foreign occupation,” said Indonesian Ambassador to Korea Umar Hadi in a speech at Lotte Hotel on Thursday. “This declaration conveyed a strong message that colonialism had no place in the world. The spirit of independence has also inspired decolonization efforts all around the globe.”Indonesia’s constitution explicitly mandates the nation’s commitment to fully participating in and contributing to a world order based on freedom, peace and social justice, he stressed, adding that his country has actively taken part in various peacekeeping operations of the United Nations since 1957. Indonesian Ambassador to Korea Umar Hadi  poses with Indonesian diplomats and embassy staff at a National Day reception marking the proclamation of independence on Thursday. Currently, there are some 2,800 Indonesian military, police and civilian personnel on UN peacekeeping missions and the number is expected to reach over 4,000 by 2019, according to the envoy. “This commitment to freedom, peace and social justice is the underlying pillar of our foreign policy,” Hadi stressed. “Indonesia is also a strong proponent of moderation and tolerance. We are living proof that democracy, Islam and modernity can flourish together.”Touching on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where Indonesia is the largest country in terms of economy and population size -- over $1 trillion and 261 million people -- the ambassador argued that ASEAN has become an influential regional organization promoting peace and prosperity “not by accident, but by design,” on the basis of a collective responsible leadership.The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands spanning three time zones has the world’s seventh-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, according to the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook. One of the world’s leading emerging markets, the PriceWaterhouseCoopers has projected its economy to reach the status of the world’s fourth-largest by 2030. Hadi said Indonesia’s economic growth cannot continue without investing in various infrastructures, equally distributing wealth and weeding out corruption and promoting good governance -- top policy priorities of the current government under Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. Indonesian artists at the National Day reception at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Thursday marking the proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945. “The Republic of Korea is one of our most important economic partners,” the ambassador highlighted, noting “significant improvements” have been made across almost all sectors, particularly after the two countries became strategic partners in 2006. Jakarta and Seoul established diplomatic ties in 1973. The bilateral trade volume reached nearly $15 billion last year, with Indonesia being Korea’s 14th largest trade partner and Korea being Indonesia’s sixth largest trade partner. “In light of dynamic changes taking place around the world, our two countries bear the responsibility to play a greater role in promoting sustainable peace and development on regional and global levels,” he asserted. “To this end, our strategic partnership, based on action-oriented, forward-looking objectives, is poised to advance further over the coming decades.”CJ Co-chairman Sohn Kyung-shik, who spoke at the event, said Indonesia is “a country of great potential, with its rich natural resources and a large population.” “Indonesia is turning its potential into remarkable achievements, and beginning to make vigorous strides to become an economic powerhouse in Asia,” he said. “Indonesia is also a good country to do business. The government encourages foreign investment and maintains political stability.” There are many Korean enterprises operating in the Indonesian market, Sohn pointed out, mentioning that the CJ Group has successfully expanded operations into biotechnology, animal feed, cinema, franchise and logistics since launching business there in 1988.By Joel Lee Indonesian artists at the National Day reception at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Thursday marking the proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945.","day celebrating indonesia proclamation ,independence last week commemorating ,national day celebrating indonesia ,day celebrating indonesia ,marked the 72nd anniversary","['the Indonesian Embassy', 'South Korea', 'Indonesia', 'Netherlands']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44195601  0.91797352

It rather means a hard work of removing paper, wrapping and plastic from the gift.” Under regulations by the Environment Ministry, gift sets specially on sale for holiday season are recommended to be packaged twice at most. Packing materials, such as plastic covers, polystyrene and bubble wrap must fill less than 25 percent of the package. Those who infringe the regulation can be fined up to 3 million won. Department store operators say it costs at least 200 won  to wrap each apple in a gift set box, while a typical box costs about 10,000 won. Photo: YonhapConsidering a gift box of apples is sold at 50,000 to 70,000 won at a department store, packaging costs account for 14-20 percent of the final price of the gift set. Each year, the Environment Ministry and local governments launch campaigns at retail stores and distribution markets to prevent excessive packaging, but it is difficult to crack down on gift sets while they are on the shelf. “Unless they unpack the wrapped gift sets, I think it will be hard for them to see the packaging,” said a housewife in her 40s who said she recently bought several boxes of anchovies for her husband’s employees.Experts and civic groups say the government’s effort to crack down on excessive packaging should lead to actual legislation on curbing excessive packaging. “Packaging materials, which are mostly plastic, aluminum and Styrofoam, which cannot be recycled, do greater than expected harm to the environment. That’s why simple, powerful solutions for reducing packaging waste are needed,” Ahn Seong-joon, an official from the Korea Environment Corp., told The Korea Herald.What may be more necessary is the consumer’s voluntary efforts to oppose the culture of excess packaging.“Moving away from excessive packaging doesn’t have to undermine convenience or the ability to maintain product freshness, particularly for food,” said Choi Hong-sik, an official from Seoul Metropolitan Government’s recycling bureau. “Consumers should also put pressure on companies to reduce their environmental impact and go green, moving away from products made with unsustainable packaging practices.”By Kim Da-sol","year old housewife ,seoul apartment block trash ,her seoul apartment block ,parcels from her doorstep ,55 year old housewife","['Kim Mi - hee', 'Chuseok', 'Seoul', 'Styrofoam', 'Kim']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.86865681  0.42012146

They are part of a self-reform road map unveiled Friday after its monthslong review of what needs to be done to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the ministry frequently criticized for elitism and exclusivism. Foreign minister Kang Kyung-hwa The ministry has 51 women in its manager-level positions, which accounts for a mere 8 percent of the total. Under the road map, it plans to raise the ratio to 20 percent, or around 120 women, by May 2022, when the current administration leaves. In a bid to enhance efficiency, it will launch the so-called diplomatic strategy planning office that will serve as a policy control tower. Currently, the ministry has a policy planning office, but it will be turned into the new one with more authority and power. The ministry also said that it will merge up to 10 divisions and teams deemed to be doing similar work into five in order to streamline its structure and assign personnel secured from the organizational consolidation for better use. To provide better consular services, the ministry said that it will expand and upgrade the current consular affairs bureau and assign at least one employee at each overseas mission tasked with responding to any accidents and complaints involving Korean people overseas. The ministry also plans to employ outside experts for up to 30 percent of heads of its overseas missions.To strengthen the overall diplomatic infrastructure, the ministry noted that it will push to increase its workforce and budget ""steadily"" and ""systematically"" over the next five years.Those measures are based on the work of an innovation task force the ministry launched in July. It has collected public opinion and proposals from inside and held debates with an advisory group consisting of experts from civic groups, businesses and relevant government agencies. Since her inauguration in June, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has underlined the need to create a foreign service workforce with more diverse backgrounds and capabilities, different from the closed and male-dominated organization.Kang, a former UN policy adviser, is the first female foreign minister in South Korea and also the first case in 14 years in which the ministry is headed by a person who didn't start as a career diplomat. ""I expect that the road map we unveiled today will be faithfully enforced in a way that it will lay the groundwork for us to carry out diplomacy in which national interest is at its center and also we have public trust,"" Kang told reporters. The ministry said that it will run a team that will oversee the implementation of the reform measures by their respective deadlines.","to launch new office ,foreign ministry said friday ,launch new office ,ministry unveils road map ,launch new office that","[""South Korea 's""]",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74363983  0.39493287

""Trump and his clique, for their anti-DPRK propaganda, are again exploiting the death of Otto Warmbier,"" it said, using the acronym for the North's official name. Warmbier, who was visiting North Korea as a tourist in January 2016 when he was arrested and imprisoned by the regime, died in June a few days after he was sent home in a mysterious coma after more than a year in prison in North Korea.In the statement, the North accused ""an anti-DPRK conspiracy organization in the U.S"" of giving Warmbier a criminal ""mission"".The US was now ""employing even a dead person for the conspiracy campaign to fuel the international atmosphere of putting pressure on the DPRK"", it said.Warmbier's parents and Trump this week accused the reclusive regime of torturing the young man, who had been convicted of trying to steal a propaganda poster from a Pyongyang hotel.""Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea,"" Trump said on Twitter.The parents, in a series of TV interviews Tuesday, said their son showed signs of torture, including teeth that appeared to have been ""rearranged,"" and hands and feet that were disfigured. On Wednesday, an Ohio medical examiner said Warmbier displayed no obvious signs of torture. He had suffered brain damage caused by the lack of oxygen to the brain, the coroner said.","thursday accused donald trump ,american student was tortured ,accuses old lunatic trump ,warmbier death north korea ,korea accuses old lunatic","['North Korea', 'Donald Trump', 'Otto Warmbier', 'US', 'american', 'Pyongyang', 'KCNA news agency', ""North Korea 's"", 'US']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29076198  0.55161977

It said many of them were embedded in key fobs, spectacles and even ballpoint pens.There were no such confiscations in 2013, but the numbers rose to 355 in 2014, surged to 1,135 in 2015, went back down to none in 2016 and then rebounded to 764 during in the first eight months this year.No hidden cameras were seized in 2013 or 2016 because authorities did not conduct concerted crackdowns on hidden cameras in those years, a KCS official said. Seized items containing hidden cameras The government conducted full-fledged crackdowns on hidden cameras in 2015 and this year when public anger was aroused over a series of crimes involving such devices.Secretly filmed sex clips were released by people in retaliation for for breakups with their former partners that caused considerable upheaval.The Prime Minister's Office earlier this month announced measures to curb the crime of secretly filming and taking pictures, including regular inspections of subways and other public facilities to ensure they are free of hidden cameras.The measures also called for those spreading revenge pornography to be punished not with fines but with imprisonment of up to five years. The government and the ruling Democratic Party agreed Tuesday to explore ways to curb the import, sale and possession of cameras modified for covert image capture.They also decided to ask Internet service providers to delete or block any illicit films when they become aware of them.According to the National Police Agency, the number of hidden camera crimes, which was 2,400 in 2012, jumped to 6,623 in 2014 and stood at 5,185 last year.","govt seizes 254 smuggled ,254 smuggled hidden cameras ,seized thousands of smuggled ,seizes 254 smuggled hidden ,government has seized thousands",['the Korea Customs Service'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26579568 -0.06556514

According to a poll on 834 workers by job portal site Saramin, 39.4 percent of the respondents said that they had no plans to go back to their hometowns during the holiday that begins on Saturday. Chuseok is similar to Thanksgiving in the US, with people travelling to their hometowns to spend time with family and friends. This year, with the government designating Oct. 2 as a temporary holiday to bridge the weekend, Chuseok holiday and another national holiday, Koreans have 10 straight days off.As for reasons, most of the people, or 37.1 percent, said that they wanted to rest, followed by those who had other plans such as a trip or had to go to work at 19.5 percent. Nearly 18 percent of the people said that going back to their hometown was a financial burden and 11.6 percent said that they did not want to be nagged, in the survey where respondents could select multiple answers. Artificial intelligence-based big data analytics from a local firm Daumsoft showed a trend of more Koreans choosing to spend the holiday alone without going to their hometowns. “Hometown” was the fifth-most-searched keyword with 3,243 searches online between Aug.1 and Sept. 18 this year. It came in second with 58,648 searches during the same period in 2015 and third with 30,909 searches last year. The most-searched activity during the Chuseok holiday this year was “travel” , followed by “class” , “work”  and part-time job .A separate survey on 1,231 workers by recruitment site Job Korea showed that 52.9 percent of the surveyed will enjoy the 10-day Chuseok break. Some 25 percent said they will work both Oct. 2 and Oct. 6, which were designated as days off by the government to facilitate the 10-day break.","alone survey more koreans ,chuseok holiday alone survey ,koreans spending chuseok holiday ,spending chuseok holiday alone ,survey more koreans spending","['Koreans', 'Chuseok', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'South Korea', 'Saramin']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56906945  0.58627075

Regardless of its outcome, they are convinced any armed conflict here would end with millions of casualties and the complete devastation of the South’s flourishing economy. Such worries are shaped by the notion that Seoul and its surrounding provinces, home to some 25 million Koreans and well within the range of the communist North’s artillery and ballistic missiles, would be reduced to ashes if attacked. Although Seoul is within the North’s striking range, it is not as vulnerable as many seem to believe, said Shin Won-shik, a retired Army three-star general who has overseen numerous computerized military exercises simulating all-out war with North Korea. The North will not have “unlimited freedom” in attacking the South, he added.  “Exaggerating North Korea’s threat or minimizing it -- both harm our national security,” Shin, who served as commander of the Capital Defense Command and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before leaving the Army in 2016, said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “It seems like all South Korean people are treating North Korea as if they are facing their own death. Since they are so afraid to face death, they choose to turn away from it. It’s time for a reality check on what we are really facing.” Shin Won-shik, a retired army three-star general who served as a top operational strategist at South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, poses during an interview with The Korea Herald. Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldThe defense of South Korea and US forces stationed here focus on denying the North the chance to launch those rockets and other weapons, he continued. “Usually, one TEL  carries one missile, and others are placed in storage sites. If we destroy the storage, we only have to deal with the weapons mounted on TELs. And if we take out the communication centers, the TEL becomes useless because it can’t receive an order for launch,” he said.Then the question comes down to taking out the TELs and those weapons already mounted on them. If they are not destroyed near storage sites, they could be at launch sites or on their way to them. “The route is a fixed target like a tunnel or a bridge. So we can detect and destroy it,” Shin said. “Then the TELs will end up at exposed launch sites. By concentrating on reconnaissance and airstrike assets, we can neutralize the remaining TELs.”However, if some TELs manage to survive and launch missiles, the missile shield should shoot down incoming missiles, which is more difficult than eliminating them before their launch. But the chance of interception will be dramatically increased if South Korea completes the building of a multilayered missile defense system by 2020 as planned, Shin said. North Korea released a computerized footage of Hwasong-14 missile launches in August. YonhapSimilar tactics -- destroying operational links to the weapon system before the launch -- can be applied to North Korea’s artillery cannons and rocket launchers, Shin said. North Korea has a massive artillery force deployed along the border, which it claims could turn Seoul into a “sea of fire.” The North’s 240-mm multiple rocket launchers are considered to be capable of raining up to 10,000 rounds during the first hour of such a conflict.But Shin said the North’s artillery shells are not powerful enough to penetrate the concrete structures of Seoul, and South Korea can minimize its civilian casualties by taking precautionary measures before the shells hit the ground.Evidence of this can be found in the North’s shelling of Yeonpyeongdo in 2010. Pyongyang launched an artillery barrage at the island, but it only scratched houses and facilities there. Four people died, but they were outside and without cover. Those who stayed indoors survived. “Our counterfire radar will detect incoming artillery shells and can figure out where they would come down. As long as people can find shelter in concrete structures and underground shelters when the siren goes off, they will survive,” he said.Of course, there is no “100 percent guarantee.” Unlike simulation exercises, in a real wartime situation, things can go wrong in unanticipated ways. He also warned against the growing asymmetry between the two Koreas, as the North develops nuclear weapons.  Still, Shin believes that South Koreans are overly pessimistic about their chances of surviving a North Korean attack and this could make North Korean leader Kim Jong-un think that he has a trump card in that the South would never risk a war.  “South Korea’s insensitivity to national security takes on a very negative form. It is built upon extreme fear, not self-confidence. We have to constantly signal to Kim Jong-un that any provocation would cost his life,” he stressed. “The military has been reluctant to share such information due to operational security. But that is the very reason why we are left to do nothing and turn North Korea into an invincible monster that we can never defeat.”   North Korea stages a massive rally at Pyongyang to support the regime`s missile and nuclear program. YonhapShin said one of the most efficient ways to boost deterrence against North Korea is the development of a “decapitation plan,” a clandestine operation designed to assassinate Kim, possibly with bunker-busting cruise missiles or the dispatch of special warfare elite units. It is crucial to restore the “balance of terror” with the nuclear-armed North, as the North is likely to place more value on the life of its supreme leader Kim than the millions living in Pyongyang. “The balance of terror between the two Koreas can be better achieved by putting Kim Jong-un’s life at risk,” said Shin.  “The South having the ability to take out the North’s leadership at any time would be extremely stressful not only to Kim, but his inner circle. It definitely can make them reluctant to use a nuclear weapon.” Despite Kim’s relentless pursuit of nuclear capabilities and his bellicose rhetoric for nuclear warfare, Shin said it is extremely unlikely for him to use a nuclear weapon as a pre-emptive strike because he has no death wish. “North Korea develops nuclear weapons for survival. I don’t think they will use it. ... If they drop a nuclear weapon on US territory -- or even Seoul, they know they will be wiped off the map,” he saidBy Yeo Jun-suk","most south koreans war ,south koreans war with ,with millions of casualties ,koreans war with north ,25 million koreans","['South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'North ’s']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.45295307  0.43688956

North Korea’s state media Korean Central News Agency claimed on Monday that the North Korean ruling party and parliament sent open letters to political parties and parliaments of various nations calling on them to join the “anti-US movement.”North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. YonhapThe letters justified North Korea’s nuclear program as being a deterrence against US aggression, and claimed that US President Donald Trump was pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war. The North’s state media, however, did not clarify whether the letters have been sent and did not specify the recipients of the letters. “Justice and truth are being crushed in the international stage due to the self-righteousness and abuse of authority, nuclear threat from the likes of Trump,” the Workers’ Party of Korea said, referring to the US president as a “degenerate, main culprit in destruction of peace.”The statement went on to claim that the sovereignty of nations, and the rights of the people were being violated, and called on political parties of various nations to work together against the US.“ calls on the parties of the countries that value sovereignty, justice and peace to join the anti-US movement, the anti-US front as one, to destroy the US’s reckless scheme to push the world into a nuclear disaster.”North Korea’s Supreme People’s Assembly also issued a letter repeating such claims. The letter claimed that the purpose of North Korea’s nuclear program was to “defend the sovereignty, and rights to exist and develop the country and the people against the nuclear threat and blackmail of the US.”The alleged letters come two days after the US flew bombers and fighter jets in international airspace close to North Korea in a show of force on Saturday. Although the maneuver did not involve South Korea’s military, South Korea’s presidential office has since stated that concerned authorities in Seoul were closely informed.North Korea has responded harshly to Trump’s UN address in which he lambasted Pyongyang and its leader Kim Jong-un in a typically colorful and direct manner. Saying that Kim was on a “suicide mission,” Trump said that the price of an attack against the US or its allies would be complete destruction. In response, North Korea warned of retaliation of the “highest measure,” which according to Pyongyang’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho could take the form of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific. As for the US travel ban, North Koreans were added to the list of those subjected to new restrictions in entering the US.The measures, implemented under a proclamation signed by the US president, apply to individuals from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. The restrictions, varying to some degree depending on the nationality, will go into effect on Oct. 18.Under the new measures, North Koreans will no longer be eligible for immigration and non-immigration visas. The latter includes business and tourism visas. “Making America safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,” Trump tweeted late Sunday after the new policy was announced.By Choi He-suk","us barring north koreans ,korea anti us rhetoric ,north korea state media ,north korea anti us ,north korean ruling party","['Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'North Koreans', 'North Korea ’s', 'anti - us', 'North Korea ’s', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.42678735  0.81315362

The Central American country renounced its military in 1949, and has since spearheaded a path of peace and development in a region perennially engrossed in conflict and violence. According to Costa Rican Ambassador to Korea Rodolfo Solano Quiros, the pursuit of pacifism and dialogue as a national strategy has enabled channeling resources to education, health care and the environment instead, tangibly improving people’s lives.As Costa Rica and Korea mark the 55th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year, the two countries can join hands in international cooperation and laws for global peace and security, the envoy said in an interview. “We have only two armies to defend our right to live in peace and democracy -- those of our teachers and diplomats,” he told The Korea Herald last week. At a time of exacerbating tensions in and around the Korean Peninsula, “The perseverance of these common values will bring our nations closer together and forge new partnerships and collaboration in the future.”  Costa Rican Ambassador to Korea Rodolfo Solano Quiros At $12,000, Costa Rica has the second-highest per capita gross domestic product in Central America. Its politics, economy and society are stable by many estimates, and it is home to numerous global companies in advanced manufacturing, life sciences and agri-food industries, among others. Dubbed the “Switzerland of Central America,” Costa Rica frequently scores high on global happiness rankings, and last year topped the Happy Planet Index that measures welfare, life expectancy, social equality, ecological environment and other factors. Oscar Arias Sanchez, Costa Rican president from 1986 to 1990 and 2006 to 2010, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to end the Central American crisis.“One of the key factors that make us the happiest nation on earth has been our decision to abolish our military, which undoubtedly facilitated our national development,” he stressed. “The money that would otherwise go to purchasing and maintaining weapons are redirected to causes promoting people’s prosperity. For three generations since the historic decision 68 years ago, our children have not seen a single Costa Rican soldier, warplane or combat tank on our land.”In place of the military, law enforcement agencies maintain public security, and people put their faith in democracy, the rule of law, human rights and social justice, Solano Quiros said. Pointing to the popular expression “pura vida” -- meaning “pure life” -- he said his countrypeople live the good life of enjoying hot springs, beaches, golf, ecotourism and various healthful outdoor activities. Costa Rica's natural landscape “Our solidarity with our future generations also extends to our commitment to nature and sustainable development,” said the ambassador, adding Costa Rica has identified ecotourism as a vital means of increasing national wealth. Located between the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, Costa Rica is among the world’s leading ecological destinations, with more than 25 percent of its territory devoted to national parks, covering rain forests, inactive and active volcanoes, hot springs, islands, beaches, caves, river canyons and waterfalls. Over 52 percent of its land is covered by forests home to rich wildlife and vegetation. Costa Rica is also harnessing its medical and wellness tourism by drawing on its cutting-edge medical technology, professional expertise and facilities, including 29 internationally accredited hospitals. The country received 3 million tourists last year, with some 5,000 Koreans among them. The embassy in Seoul has identified companies that will provide multidestination packages for Korean travelers, said Solano Quiros.“Costa Rica’s transfer of knowledge and sharing of best practices in sustainable tourism constitutes one of the main areas of collaboration with Korea,” he said, citing the Certification for Sustainable Tourism introduced in 1997 by the Costa Rica Tourism Board, which awards entrepreneurs for their environment-conscious practices in tourism. Other initiatives in conservation and sustainable development include the government’s funding of the Environmental Services Program and the recently established Environmental Bank Foundation, designed to foster public-private partnerships involving local and micro entrepreneurs. Costa Rica is a founding member of the Global Green Growth Institute and a board member of the Green Climate Fund in Songdo, Incheon. Costa Rica's natural landscape Solano Quiros also said Costa Rica is keen to learn from Korea’s successful practices in wastewater management and public infrastructure. By drawing on renewable energy from its rich natural resources, Costa Rica is heavily committed to being a carbon-neutral economy by 2021, the year of its 200th anniversary of independence, he said. The country produces over 95 percent of its electricity from hydroelectric, geothermal and wind power, and last year had more than 150 days powered by renewable energy sources. Marking the bicentennial celebration, the Costa Rican government has sent 200 of the country’s best and brightest students to leading universities worldwide on scholarships. It also launched the Green Peace Spanish Learning Initiative through which 75 students are studying Spanish in Costa Rica’s ecological, peaceful environment. Turning to bilateral relations, Solano Quiros said the high point of the last 55 years of diplomacy was Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis Rivera’s visit to Korea in October last year. His visit culminated in the Comprehensive Strategic Cooperation Partnership between the two countries, offering a road map to strengthen ties within bilateral and multilateral settings. Key areas of cooperation in the future lie in trade and investment; environmental preservation and sustainable development; transport infrastructure; education and technical training; health care; citizen security; science, technology and innovation; good governance in public administration; gender equality; administrative decentralization; and culture, tourism and sports, according to the diplomat.  Costa Rica's natural landscape During the eighth ministerial meeting of the Forum for East Asia-Latin American Cooperation in Busan in late August, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Manuel Gonzalez Sanz came to Korea and reiterated the importance of revitalizing the interregional organization. “Under the slogan ‘two regions, one vision,’ we are taking a leap forward toward the institution’s 20th anniversary in 2019, and working to create synergies among our members, international organizations and financial institutions,” the envoy explained. The FEALAC Fund has been launched, and various working groups are enhancing collaboration in politics, sustainable development, commerce, tourism, small and medium-sized enterprises, culture, youth, gender and sports, science and technology and education and innovation. Korea and Central American countries are also awaiting the formal signing of a free trade agreement after negotiations were completed on both sides. Following parliamentary or congressional ratifications, the deal will expand trade and investment manifold from current levels, the ambassador forecast. In terms of bilateral commerce, trade between Costa Rica and Korea reached nearly $400 million last year, a 42 percent increase from the year before. Costa Rica exports to Korea electrical components, biomedical devices and components, intellectual services, coffee, pineapples, bananas and other organically grown foods. Solano Quiros said his country offers an ideal environment for foreign investors on the back of its strategic location linking Central and South Americas and abundant ecological resources. In recent years there has been a rising interest in the country’s biomedical, aerospace, renewable energy and ecotourism sectors, he added.

They are said to have induced conservative civic groups to bolster their campaigns against the mayor's key policies and spread Internet comments maligning him. The two former NIS officials allegedly had their subordinates exert pressure on government agencies to conduct tax probes on entertainment agencies that had contracts with those artists. They also peddled influence on public broadcasters to exclude them from the mainstream media.The prosecution said it plans to call in some of the blacklist victims for questioning and take statements from them. The task force was set up after liberal President Moon Jae-in took office in May, after his predecessor President Park Geun-hye was ousted over a massive corruption scandal in March. She has been detained and is standing trial. Park's top aide recently received a three-year jail term from a Seoul court for spearheading an artist blacklist project during her term. Won, who was appointed by Lee in 2009, is also being detained and is awaiting the top court's ruling on the charge that he interfered in the 2012 presidential election. The prosecution's probe now draws attention as to whether the investigation will eventually target former President Lee Myung-bak and his staff. The blacklist scandal involving Park's staff was one of the catalysts that triggered massive street protests by citizens calling for her impeachment.","seoul prosecutors said thursday ,bak administration compiled blacklist ,prosecutors said thursday ,govt seoul prosecutors said ,prosecutors said thursday they","['Seoul', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Lee Myung - bak', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'NIS']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31418905  0.79234397

The prosecutors also suspect KAI inflated the value of the proceeds from the sale of a light attack aircraft, the FA-50, to Iraq, in a deal worth some 3 trillion won . One KAI executive was arrested early this month and another is awaiting a court decision on the prosecution's request for his arrest warrant.  The prosecutors' office said it uncovered some circumstantial evidence that indicates top officials may have worked together in cooking the books for the 18 trillion won KF-X project, ordered by the government in 2015 to develop Korea's own advanced fighter jets and produce more than 120 planes until 2026. The prosecution secured documents that suggest its former chief Ha Sung-yong was briefed on the situations, the prosecution said. Ha stepped down soon after the investigation began in July. The prosecution is expected to call in Ha soon for questioning.KAI has been involved in high-profile defense projects including the Surion, T-50 supersonic trainer jet and others. The fraud allegations were first raised in 2015 when the state auditor's inspection found that KAI pocketed some 24 billion won in illicit profits by manipulating development costs in the Surion project. According to KAI's financial reports, the company saw its revenue soar 53 percent to 3.1 trillion won from 2013 to 2016. Its operating profit also doubled to 314.9 billion won during the same period.

Despite the war six decades ago and occasional military conflicts with it thereafter, North Koreans were always “brethren” who share the same history, culture and language. Even at the height of inter-Korean tensions, there were always people in the South who sympathized with the sufferings of those across the border. This complex sentiment toward North Korea is now giving way to a more hawkish one, as the communist regime, under the young third-generation leader Kim Jong-un, has been stepping up military provocations. Many interviewed by The Korea Herald expressed anger and frustration at how a peace-loving nation, which has abided by rules and stayed away from nuclear weapons, has become more vulnerable, while a defiant, rogue regime made headway toward becoming a formidable military power. “Now that North Korea appears to be equipped with nuclear arms, I believe we also need to have the same power to stop the North,” Yu Young-eun, an office worker, told The Korea Herald. “We are the weakest country here now, and I think we also need to let neighboring and related countries know that we should be in charge of the North Korean issues.”A recent poll by Gallup Korea, conducted from Sept. 5, after the Sept. 3 nuclear weapons test by the North, shows a clear sign of hardening attitudes among South Koreans. Of 1,004 respondents, 76 percent considered the sixth atomic detonation as a threat to security. But when asked if they thought the North would initiate a war, only 37 percent answered it was possible, while 58 percent responded that that was little to no chance of such an outcome. However, 60 percent approved of South Korea rearming with nuclear weapons to respond to the North Korean threat, while 35 percent opposed the idea. US tactical nuclear weapons were withdrawn from South Korea in 1991, when the two Koreas signed an agreement on denuclearization, non-aggression and reconciliation. While the South has clung to the principle of a neclear-free Korean Peninsula, the North has abandoned it, conducting six nuclear tests so far.While nuclear rearmanent is mainly pushed by conservatives that pursue tougher policies against the North, more liberal voters also appeared to be in support of the idea, the data showed. Of the 353 respondents who viewed themselves as liberals, 47 percent approved of stationing nuclear weapons here, while 48 percent of the group opposed the idea. What is more surprising perhaps is that more Koreans even said that humanitarian aid should be cut if the North does not give up its nuclear program. In 2013, a Gallup poll showed that 47 percent of South Koreans said that humanitarian aid should continue even if North Korea continues its nuclear program. In the latest poll, the figure dropped to 32 percent, while the proportion of South Koreans opposed to the idea rose to 65 percent. Left-leaning respondents were also skeptical of offering any kind of humanitarian aid, with 52 percent of them calling for a halt. Experts viewed that the change in public sentiment reflects disappointment toward North Korea, which South Koreans considered their “northern brother” after the painful separation.“The liberals, who were thought to be relatively more friendly toward the North, are now turning their backs, as they see their northern neighbor is not so brotherly anymore,” a Gallup Korea researcher said. “Despite President Moon Jae-in’s suggestions for dialogue and peaceful approaches, the North is not taking the kindness and has only become a threat.”The researcher, who declined to reveal his name, also explained that there have been actual cases of attacks against South Korea. “One of the prime cases would be North Korea’s attack on Yeongpyeong Island. There, Koreans witnessed that, however we treat them, they can actually attack us,” he said.In November 2010, North Korea shelled the island located 80 kilometers west of Incheon, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians, and wounding 18. Another reason behind the shift in attitude may be Kim Jong-un, the North's leader who inherited power from his father and is now reinforcing his authority in such provocative ways, he added. “The way the communist state continues to show enmity toward the international society is childish. It does not know what is good for them, and we see that our kindness is not returned with kindness but ignorance and hostility,” Yang Jin-young, a 26-year old student, told The Korea Herald. Other members of the public say that the apparent irrationality of the North Korean leader seems to be the biggest threat. “I heard Kim is very impulsive and I believe that he may really launch a nuclear bomb. We should never let that happen, and I wish all concerned nations would just ignore North Korea,” said Kim Su-jin, a 30-year-old office worker. There also seems to be concerns about the changes in the way Pyongyang deals with Seoul and its allies. “What the North is demanding from the South and the international society has changed. In the past, it was just financial aid to its poor economy, but now it is calling for the ouster of the US armed forces in South Korea,” said Yeo Young-soo, a 60-year-old business owner. “What is more serious is that the North is now ignoring the South.”By Jo He-rim","koreans were always brethren ,north koreans were always ,seoul streets hawks outnumber ,koreans were always ,south koreans north korea","['South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'Nort']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74176347  0.6573835

The epicenter of the 5.8 magnitude earthquake was not far from the nuclear facilities. Safety concerns remain as over 600 aftershocks have taken place over the past year in the historic city, which houses six nuclear reactors and related facilities. Experts have warned that recent earthquakes in nearby Japan could have destabilized the fault line in the Korean Peninsula, further raising anxiety among residents following Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.   Paik Un-gyu, the chief of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, visits a fault line located near the epicenter of a 5.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Gyeongju in 2016 to mark the first anniversary of the nation`s largest recorded quake on Sept. 12, 2017, in this photo provided by the ministry. ""Natural disasters like earthquakes could lead to grave disasters because the country's nuclear reactors are located near populous regions,"" Paik said. ""The government will put the priority on the safety of people with strengthened anti-quake measures and shift the focus to safe and renewable energy resources.""To better predict seismic activities, the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, a state geological research institute, said it has been inspecting fault lines in the southeastern region to complete the process by 2021 and expand the study across the nation by 2041. The policymaker said the government will come up with a comprehensive plan for its new energy policy by the end of this year, which will include a nuclear phase-out road map and investment plans for renewable resources. The latest move was in line with President Moon Jae-in's pledge to scrap all existing plans for new nuclear reactors and cancel lifetime extensions for aged reactors to reduce reliance on nuclear power. South Korea operates 24 reactors to supply about one-third of its electricity, making it the world's fifth-largest user of nuclear power.As follow-up measures, a state commission was launched in July to collect public consensus on whether to continue to build new reactors on the country's southeast, temporarily halting construction of two new reactors in Ulsan, located 414 kilometers south of Seoul.In a meeting with local residents and civic groups, Paik said the government will gather public opinions about the early closure of the Wolsong No. 1 reactor and the construction of a nuclear waste disposal facility for spent fuel. The country's second-oldest nuclear reactor was shut in 2012 after 30 years of operation, and its life span was extended by another 10 years in 2015. A decision to build a nuclear waste disposal repository for the heavy water reactor is imminent as an interim storage facility at Wolsong is expected to run out of space by early 2020, according to the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power. ""As an early closure of the Wolsong No. 1 reactor is currently under discussion, we ask for cooperation from local residents to push the plan forward without delay,"" Paik said. ""We will listen to public opinion about a low- to medium-level nuclear waste repository to build a safe facility for residents.""","reactors in quake hit ,energy minister on tuesday ,of reactors in quake ,reactors in quake ,tuesday checked the safety","['GYEONGJU', 'south korean', 'Gyeongju', 'Gyeongju', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.97642779  1.01462424

In particular, trade vehicles from the northeastern Chinese cities of Dandong, Liaoning Province, and Longjing, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, are now under strict customs inspections, the sources said. In addition, barricades made of sandbags have been set up on rural roads leading to the Amrok and Tumen Rivers dividing North Korea and China in order to control vehicles, as they are main routes for bilateral smuggling, the sources said.

According to satellite images released by Planet, the areas near Punggye-ri nuclear test site displays surface disturbances -- they are centered on and around Mantapsan that embraces the blast zones, the North Korean watchdog 38 North explained. The photo also shows clear differences between pictures taken on Friday, two days before the Pyongyang’s sixth and strongest detonation. “The land turbulences appear to be more numerous and widespread than the previous five tests that the communist regime had conducted,” the watchdog, which is linked to Johns Hopkins University in the United States added.  Satellite images show the Punggye-ri nuclear test site before and after North Korea‘s sixth nuclear test. It was also noted by 38 North that there has not been any evidence of a collapsed crater as might have been suggested from the post-test tremor.There have been speculations that the underground tunnels were likely to have collapsed resulting in a quake of 4.1  that followed minutes after the initial shake.Other damages, such as collapsed buildings could not be found and further analysis may be possible with higher resolution imageries when they become available.North Korea on Sunday announced it had successfully conducted its sixth and the strongest nuclear test, hours after a large earthquake was detected in the North Hamgyeong Province. Regarding radioactive materials that may have been released into the atmosphere, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said on Wednesday it is closely monitoring for signs. The nuclear safety agencies here said they have not yet detected any traces of radioactive materials. “We are closely watching over the situation considering the seriousness of the damage such radiation exposure can incur,” Baik Tae-hyun, the ministry spokesman told reporters. A day before in a parliamentary briefing, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon also confirmed that North Koreans living near the test site could have been exposed to radiation after the detonation. Seoul’s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission and Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety revealed that they have not found any traces of radioactive materials, including xenon gas, following the North’s test. They analyzed the data they collected immediately after the nuclear test, Sunday, until noon the next day. Japan on Tuesday increased its estimated size of the rogue regime’s latest nuclear test to a yield of around 160 kilotons, following a revised magnitude of 6.0 by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.“This is far more powerful than their nuclear tests in the past,” Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said. The prospected figure -- upgraded from the previous 70 kilotons and 120 kilotons -- is 10 times stronger than that of the Hiroshima explosion in 1945, which carried a yield of 15 kilotons.Previously, the CTBTO had raised its estimate of the seismic event from its previous 5.8 to 6.1 in magnitude. The estimated figures are recorded differently by institutes in related nations. The US Geological Survey announced the earthquake measured 6.3 in magnitude, while the record of Seoul’s Defense Ministry appeared to be the lowest, at 5.7 magnitude. It said they estimate the latest detonation carried a yield of 50 kilotons.","landslides around nk nuclear ,satellite image shows landslides ,north korea nuclear test ,signs that multiple landslides ,shows landslides around nk","['North Korea ’s', 'US', 'north korean', 'Punggye', 'Mantapsan', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.25254187 -0.13031352

There are two launchers and a radar already deployed and in operation on the battery site, formerly a private golf resort. Four additional launchers, which are required to assemble one full THAAD battery, were widely expected to arrive at the site soon, after the government said Monday that preparations were all done to move them. The ministry stressed that it is only a “temporary” deployment and a final decision on the system’s dispatch here will come after a full-scale environmental impact assessment.  Nevertheless, experts see Thursday’s planned rollout of the remaining four launchers as marking a turning point in yearslong debate over the US weapon system, which has prompted pushback from the residents of Seongju and neighboring states China and Russia. Even before the official announcement of the deployment schedule Wednesday, activists and protestors opposing the weapon system started to converge in Seongju to block the launchers’ arrival in the area. “Four additional THAAD launchers will be brought into Seongju early tomorrow  morning,” a protestors’ group said in a text message sent out to residents and activists before 3 p.m., citing multiple tipoffs about the deployment schedule. “We ask all of you to gather here by 6 p.m.” The decision came as a part of the allies’ effort to boost their deterrence against North Korea, which conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test Sunday and has threatened to carry out more provocations, such as ballistic missile launches. The deployment of THAAD has unnerved the North’s main supporters such as China and Russia, which fear that the weapon system would pose a security threat by helping the US increase its military clout in the region. South Korea and the United States have sought to ease concerns, highlighting that the measure is only designed to prevent North Korea ballistic missiles targeting South Korea and the US troops stationed here. “THAAD is being deployed as a response to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat. If the North’s nuclear and missile issue is resolved, the THAAD issue will be resolved as well,” President Moon Jae-in said in his interview with Russian media Tuesday. Meanwhile, political parties, including President Moon’s governing Democratic Party of Korea, welcomed the decision, saying the deployment is necessary in preventing North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats. The minor opposition Justice Party was the only political party to criticize the decision.","seongju was tense wednesday ,defense ministry announced wednesday ,ministry announced wednesday afternoon ,wednesday evening as activists ,tense wednesday evening","['South Korea ’s', 'Seongju', 'US', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'US']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.471957    0.5945586

The provocation overshadowed a China-led summit of the BRICS nation-- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- being held in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the nuclear test “absolutely unacceptable,” after calling a National Security Council meeting. He said the North’s nuclear and missile programs now pose a “more grave and urgent” threat to Japan. “It is significantly hurting regional and international peace and stability. Our country lodges a strict protest against North Korea and condemns it in the strongest words,” Abe said.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  and US President Donald Trump The test came just hours after Pyongyang claimed to have developed a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto a long-range missile and after Abe held talks over the phone with US President Donald Trump on the North’s weapons programs.Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said the ministry has begun flying “sniffer” planes capable of detecting radioactive fallout.Russia also expressed the “strongest condemnation” toward Pyongyang and warned that such continued actions are “fraught with serious consequences.”“This latest demonstrative disregard by Pyongyang of the requirements of the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the norms of international law deserves the strongest condemnation,” the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said in a statement “In the unfolding conditions, it is imperative to remain calm and to refrain from any actions that lead to a further escalation of tension.”It also called for “all interested parties” to immediately return to dialogue and negotiations as it is the “only possible way” for an overall resolution of the problems of the Korean Peninsula. The ministry insisted Moscow remains committed to a joint Russian-Chinese proposal that would see Pyongyang halt weapons tests in return for the US suspending military exercises in the region. The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization also issued a strong condemnation message.Its Chairwoman H.E. Paulina Maria Franceschi Navarro said in a statement, “This is a matter of the utmost concern to the international community and must be regarded as entirely unacceptable in that it poses a grave threat to international peace and stability.” “The announced test is a clear violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions. I call on the DPRK  to fully comply with its international obligations,” she added. The UN atomic watchdog said that Sunday’s provocation is an act that “completely disregards of the repeated demands of the international community.” The test was North Korea’s sixth and far more powerful than any weapon it had previously detonated.Pyongyang declared the test of what it called a hydrogen bomb to be a “perfect success.”By Jo He-rim & news reports","also denounced the nuclear ,denounced the nuclear test ,denounced the nuclear ,china condemns nk for ,russia also denounced the","['China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'the Chinese Foreign Ministry']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59153646  0.42198333

Setia claimed the Korean man was rude, “being so racist to us without any reason.” “They let my friends, who hold Korean nationality, in easily. And when it comes to me and my Indonesian friend, he made it difficult ” Setia told The Korea Herald.When she saw her friend, another Indonesian who only gave her first name Gabrielle, was pushed down by the bouncer and had her ID card thrown on the pavement, she pushed the bouncer, Setia said.A fight ensued and she had her mouth punched by the bouncer several times until her lips were torn and bleeding. She was taken to a hospital and given eight stitches in her lips. Gabrielle said that the ordeal was linked to her ethnicity based on her experience in general in Korea. “I am used to people looking down on Indonesians. I thought that he did not like foreigners so he might have been rude to us especially because we were not white Caucasians,” she said. “When we got upset and showed it to him, I think it made him angry.” Jessica Setia says she was beaten by a male bouncer of the Busan club Groove. The club told The Korea Herald that there had been no discrimination based on ethnicity or gender that night, expressing regret over criticism of the establishment due to her “one-sided” argument. “Our club checks identities of all customers, regardless of their ethnicities, through the same procedure. There is no racial discrimination at all,” the club said in a statement.It was Setia who first used curse words and shook her fist at the bouncer and the bouncer's action to defend himself led to the injury on her lips, the club added.Busan Seomyeon Police Station said that an investigation was underway, with those involved to be called in again to testify. “The man argues that it was a two-way assault. Due to the fight, the left side of his cheek became swollen, according to our investigation. We are going to further investigate the case on Monday,” said a police officer from the team in charge of the initial investigation into the case. Setia’s experience at the club went viral on social media after her friend Joshua Irwin wrote a post that describes what happened to Setia and him that night, along with a picture of her bleeding in her mouth. The post received more than 1,000 likes, 650 shares and 200 comments as of Sunday afternoon after it was first published on Saturday morning. Many of the comments made by foreign residents in Korea showed support for Setia and rage at what they view as discriminative action. They also shared similar treatment they had experienced here.Behind the reason that such a “small” provocation could lead to such brutal treatment is the “outdated” and “misogynistic” belief that men are superior to women, Irwin said.“This idea is endemic in many societies . This altercation happened because within this way of thinking, if woman doesn’t follow protocols and by doing so disrespects a man then she needs to be checked and punished,” he said. “Furthermore, being a white foreigner is unquestionably more influential than being a foreigner who doesn’t look white or is from another Asian country,” Irwin said. “Had it been a Korean woman, or a white woman, or a male then I am sure this would not have escalated as quickly as it had.”Amanda Bastos, an American citizen who has lived here for seven years, also talked about foreigners’ distrust toward the police. “Most likely, it happened because she was a foreigner and he knew that no one would do anything about it. Also, I think there is very little accountability when violence happens towards foreigners.”It is not the first time that foreigners in Korea have said that clubs and bars discriminate against them based on their ethnicity. In early June, Kislay Kumar, a 25-year-old Indian national, was denied entry to a bar in Itaewon, multicultural district in Seoul, because of his nationality. He was told “No Indian” by a bouncer, according to a video footage. His friends from other countries were allowed entry. South Korea, one of the most homogenous countries in Asia, lags behind in international standards in terms of racism and diversity, experts say. The United Nations special rapporteur on racism, Mutuma Ruteere, urged South Korea in 2014 to enact an anti-discrimination law to curb racism and xenophobia, given the country’s history of ethnic and cultural homogeneity. According to a 2015 survey of 4,000 adults by the Ministry of Gender and Family Affairs, 25.7 percent of respondents said that they did not want people of different races as neighbors.

That phrase, according to Malinowski, suggests the US will use military force to overthrow the regime and impose a different one.""I think if we use that rhetoric it diminishes the legitimacy of the appropriate things we do to defend human rights around the world,"" he said. ""Because if the people of North Korea had their rights, they would choose the right government.

McCain.   He said Malaysian authorities, involved in the three-nation air and sea search for the sailors, had also found a body and it was being transferred to the US Navy for identification. USS John S. McCain. Yonhap   Apart from the missing, five sailors were injured.     The latest accident happened before dawn Monday in busy shipping lanes around the Strait of Singapore, with water flooding into the vessel after the huge hole was torn in the hull.   It was the second fatal collision in two months -- after the USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship off Japan in June and left seven sailors dead -- and the fourth accident in the Pacific this year involving an American warship.   The incidents have sparked concerns that the US Navy could be overstretched in Asia -- both ships were from the Japan-based Seventh Fleet -- as they tackle China's rising assertiveness and North Korea's nuclear ambitions.   The McCain had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a ""freedom of navigation operation"" in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August, sparking a furious response from Beijing.   On Monday the Chief of US Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered commanders within a week to set aside time, perhaps ""one or two days"", for crews to sit down together for discussions.   A ""comprehensive review"" of practices would also begin.    ""As you know, this is the second collision in three months and the last of a series of incidents in the Pacific theatre,"" Richardson said.   ""This trend demands more forceful action. As such, I have directed an operational pause be taken in all of our fleets around the world.""   The admiral did not rule out some kind of outside interference or a cyber-attack being behind the latest collision, but said he did not want to prejudge the inquiry. His broader remarks suggested a focus on ""how we do business on the bridge.""   The damaged vessel is named after US Senator John McCain's father and grandfather, who were both admirals in the US navy.   The tanker involved in the collision, which was used for transporting oil and chemicals and weighed over 30,000 gross tonnes, sustained some damage but no crew were injured, and Singapore said there was no oil pollution.","latest deadly warship collision ,us navy divers searching ,for 10 missing sailors ,the latest deadly warship ,navy divers searching for","['US', 'Singapore', 'the US Pacific Fleet', 'the US Navy']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19953832  0.38131434

But the June photo showed none of the vehicles remained except for a truck parked there. This file photo, taken Aug. 11, 2017, from the Dora Observatory in Paju, north of Seoul, shows the now-shuttered South Korean industrial park  in the North Korean city of Kaesong. The missing vehicles, which were used by many South Korean companies, were reportedly gathered at the apparels company's spacious parking lot after the complex's shutdown.VOA said it looked at other companies' premises but failed to locate any of the vehicles.There is speculation that the North's authorities may have moved the vehicles out of the complex to liquidate the South's assets there.Shortly after Seoul decided to shut down the complex, the North deported South Korean workers from the complex and one month later said it would liquidate all of the assets held by the South.Opened in 2004, the factory zone had housed 124 South Korean firms hiring more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.South Korea's unification ministry said it has no information to verify whether the VOA report is true but made clear that North Korea's possible use of those vehicles is an illegal act that violates local firms' property rights.""Cars and other property at the Kaesong complex belong to South Korean firms. , North Korea should immediately stop as they don't have our authorization,"" a ministry official said.","korean vehicles disappear from ,korean vehicles disappear ,100 south korean owned ,south korean owned cars ,100 south korean","['south korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kaesong', 'Voice of America', 'US', 'Digital Globe Inc.', 'US']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.74499404  0.24629554

Others said they called until their girlfriends picked up the phone, or put restrictions on how they dressed. Another 37.9 percent of 1,593 respondents, or 603 men, said the dating abuse involved sexual harassment, followed by psychological abuse , physical violence , sexual abuse  and inflicting injuries .In terms of psychological or emotional abuse, 23.1 percent said they had slammed a door or stamped on the ground in anger when they were with their girlfriends. Among those who had committed physical violence against their partners, almost 25 percent said they had touched a partner’s breasts, buttocks or genitals without agreement.About 100 people said they had bruised their partners or left them with small scars. Some even said their girlfriends had passed out or broken a bone. Hong Young-oh, the researcher from the KIC who led the study, said the high number of those who had restricted their partners’ movements stems from the deep-rooted patriarchal attitude of Korean men.“The high number of such actions show that the abusers themselves were not aware of or did not recognize their actions as dating abuse,” said Hong. “But victims who had their activities restricted by their boyfriends saw it as serious enough to say that they wanted to break up.”The study also showed that the acceptability of violence, childhood experience of domestic violence and emotional instability were attributed to various types of violent actions by abusers while dating. Earlier this month, data from the National Police Agency showed that 8,367 people were booked on charges of physical violence against their partners in 2015, up 8.8 percent from the previous year. The total number of physical assault cases here was 305,957 in 2015.In late July, police launched a 100-day action plan to crack down on violence against women amid increased public concerns following a viral video that showed a man assaulting his ex-girlfriend and then chasing her down with a 1-ton truck in Sindang-dong, central Seoul.By Kim Da-sol","korean men admit abuse ,they had abused girlfriend ,had abused girlfriend while ,abused girlfriend while they ,had abused girlfriend","['korean', 'the Korean Institute of Criminology', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26024562  0.06915984

The ministry’s data based on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development prison population statistics shows the capacity rate of the country’s prisons was at about 121.8 percent of their capacity last year as of June, holding considerably more people than they were designed to house. The rate is second highest among OECD member states, following Hungary, whose average capacity rate exceeded 131 percent. The United States hovered around the full occupancy level at 101.6 percent, while Japan’s inmate population remained far below at 66.8 percent. In terms of the number of inmates, 1,098.8 were housed per correctional facility last year, the highest of all the organization’s countries, followed by Spain’s 734.9. Jail population exceeded capacity for the first time in 2012, with 101.6 percent, and has since been on a rise due to lack of budget to expand facilities, the data shows. Critics say overcrowding in the state’s prison system can lead to violent acts and unsafe conditions for inmates.“As the Constitutional Court ruled that overcrowding in prisons is a human rights violation, we need more spending on building additional correctional facilities to cope with the rising inmate population,” said Rep.

But the country, a homogeneous society ethnically, linguistically and culturally for so long, must devise a well-advised policy in order not to follow the same path as Europe, which is struggling with social problems related to immigrants. “Accepting immigrants should no longer be confined to filling jobs in sectors facing labor shortages, nor to finding spouses for unmarried Koreans,” said Chung Ki-seon, director of the IOM Migration Research and Training Centre, during an interview with The Korea Herald. “It should serve as a growth engine for South Korea.” The economic benefits of an open-door immigration policy look clear. IOM Migration Research and Training Centre Director Chung Ki-seon The country is going through a population crisis, with its birth rate remaining one of the world’s lowest and the economically active population -- made up of those aged between 15 and 64 -- starting to shrink for the first time this year. It is set to become an aged society in 2018, with people aged 65 and older making up 14 percent of its population. But Chung called for “controlled” immigration -- selectively accepting highly educated and skilled foreign professionals into the country, while phasing out the current policy of importing low-skilled migrant workers. “If low-skilled, low-waged workers stay for a long time here, they are likely to form the low-income bracket in society and the government will have to shoulder the expenses of providing welfare to them,” she said. At the same time, the country must work seriously on how to integrate those immigrants into Korean society, Chung said, stressing the task would be critical for the country’s future.“Immigrants do not automatically integrate into society and even  who are born and raised in the country of relocation won’t,” she said, citing Europe as an example of this. In European countries, the rise in acts of terrorism -- those committed by Muslim extremists born and raised in the countries -- has raised public anxiety over immigration, with conservatives blaming the open-door immigration policy as the root cause of an increase in social unrest. Currently, South Korea has a narrow-minded and short-sighted approach when it comes to immigration, centering on multicultural families, or immigration through marriage, and the import of cheap labor from neighboring countries, Chung added. The immigration policy should target more diverse types of immigrants, such as ethnic Koreans, foreign students and refugees, she said. “A certain target group should not be singled out as a vulnerable group in need of help and the policy approach to them should be in line with a wider immigration policy,” Chung said, referring to the country’s focus on foreign spouses. In 2016, there were some 152,374 people who moved to Korea due to marriage. In 2014, South Korea ranked 18 out of 38 in terms of the migrant integration policy index, which measures each government’s policies to promote integration of migrants in 38 countries including the US, EU member states and Japan. “To draw up and implement a comprehensive immigration policy, there is a need to set up an independent body with its own budget to take charge of adjusting relevant ministries’ overarching tasks,” she said. As for the issue of migrant laborers, the chief of the IOM MRTC noted the problems of the current Employment Permit System. The EPS was introduced in 1993 to bring in foreign workers in the short term for low-skilled positions -- so-called “3-D” jobs shunned by locals for their dirty, dangerous and difficult working conditions -- to solve labor shortages mostly in the manufacturing and construction sectors. “The cheap labor is seen as benefitting the country now, but it will cost a lot in the long term.”While the system has alleviated the labor shortage at small and medium-sized businesses, the availability of cheap labor has also hurt the quality of jobs such as pay and working conditions, she said. “Employers won’t be motivated to improve working conditions and raise pay as long as they can turn to cheap foreign workers,” she said. “Locals will further avoid such jobs and SMEs will rely on low-skilled foreign workforce even more.” Migrant workers and their advocates have also long taken issue with poor working conditions, low pay and discrimination at workplaces. They even call it modern-day slavery, as migrant workers are not allowed to freely change their workplaces or extend their stay in the country without approval from their employers. “When foreign workers gain skills and expertise, they should be given pay raises accordingly and a chance to reside here longer and bring their families to settle here,” she said. The government is already moving in such a direction. The Justice Ministry said it would allow low-skilled workers only to work here for up to nine years and eight months. These low-skilled workers are holders of the E-9 visa , the E-10 visa  and the H-2 visa . It adopted a point system to allow workers with proven skills to switch to the E-7-4 visa for a longer stay. Chung also called for a tougher crackdown on employers who hire foreigners staying here illegally. There were some 209,000 people, about 10 percent of the foreign population, illegally staying here without valid visas in 2016, according to Statistics Korea. “By allowing unregistered migrant workers to get away, the government has given them a wrong message that it is OK to stay here illegally to earn more money,” she said. “And their illegal statuses give employers grounds to exploit them.”The IOM MRTC was set up in 2009 through a partnership between the Korean government and International Organization for Migration. Funded by Seoul’s Justice Ministry, it conducts research and training to promote the understanding of migrants and migration issues, as well as offers policy advice to the government.

The movie released this month is based on the true story of a Korean taxi driver and Jurgen Hinzpeter, a German journalist who covered the armed revolt.Moon was accompanied by Edeltraut Brahmstaedt, the wife of Hinzpeter, and her family. In May 1980, citizens of the southern city rose up against a military junta led by Chun Doo-hwan, an Army general, who assumed power via a coup after his predecessor President Park Chung-hee was assassinated. Special operations forces cracked down on the protests leaving hundreds of citizens dead or missing.President Moon Jae-in  flanked by Edeltraut Brahmstaedt  and actor Song Kang-ho watch the movie ""A Taxi Driver"" at a movie theater in Seoul on Aug. 13, 2017. Moon told Brahmstaedt most South Koreans were unaware of what happened in Gwangju due to the government's media censuring and that many journalists who tried to report about it were sacked during the authoritarian rule, according to the presidential office.""We got to know the truth thanks to your husband,"" Moon was quoted as saying.Brahmstaedt said her husband would have been ""so pleased"" with the movie about Gwangju, which was a large part of his life. ""The movie shows how a foreign reporter's efforts contributed to Korea's democratization,"" a presidential official said. "" saw the film to honor Hinzpeter in respect for what he did for the country."" This photograph, released by the May 18 Memorial Foundation on Aug. 10, 2017, is one of the pictures taken by Jurgen Hinzpeter during the nine-day pro-democracy uprising in Gwangju, some 329 km southwest of Seoul. Hinzpeter, who passed away in May last year, is one of a few foreign journalists who exposed the military's bloody quelling of citizens. Upon Hinzpeter's will, part of his body has been enshrined in a special cemetery dedicated to the victims in Gwangju. The film surpassed 7 million in attendance on Saturday, 11 days after its release, according to the film's distributor.","taxi driver movie about ,sunday watched taxi driver ,democracy uprising president moon ,korean taxi driver ,watched taxi driver movie","['Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Jurgen Hinzpeter', 'german', 'Moon', 'Edeltraut Brahmstaedt', 'Hinzpeter']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.55493402  0.50755978

But experts aren’t convinced the bomb could make it all that way intact.They cite lingering questions about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s nuclear know-how.“I don’t think North Korea has a good measure of how accurate the missile is at this point,” said Michael Elleman, an expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “They don’t know if the re-entry technologies will really hold up — whether the bomb will survive the trip.”North Korea has short-range missiles that can hit its neighbors. It has tested an intermediate one that could strike Guam, a US territory, as well as a longer-range missile that could reach Hawaii and perhaps the US West Coast. The intermediate and long-range missiles are still being developed and it’s still questionable whether they can reliably strike targets. The launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, in North Korea's northwest, Tuesday, July 4, 2017.The North must conduct more tests to master what is known as “re-entry” in missile parlance, experts believe. The process involves shielding a nuclear warhead from the high temperatures and force it faces when it re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere at about 15,500 mph .“In principle, Kim Jong Un could hit the United States with a nuclear weapon,” said Elleman, a former scientist at Lockheed Martin’s Research and Development Laboratory who also worked as missile expert for U.N. weapons inspection missions. “In practice, I think they are probably a half-year to a full year away from having something that will work more often than it would fail.”Joseph Bermudez Jr., an internationally recognized expert on North Korean defense and intelligence affairs and ballistic missile development, agrees.“Putting these things all together and making them work is extremely challenging, and they haven’t yet demonstrated a capability to produce a reliable re-entry vehicle, which is what houses the actual nuclear device,” he said. “Remember, they’ve only tested these systems very few times.”Still, Bermudez, said, North Korea is “on track” to figure it out.US officials also think it’s just a matter of time before Kim’s program fully matures.National Intelligence Director Dan Coats told Congress in May that Kim has been photographed beside a nuclear warhead design and missile airframes to show that North Korea has warheads small enough to fit on a missile.That same month, Lt. Gen Vincent Stewart, the Defense Intelligence Agency director, told lawmakers that while Kim must still work on the technical aspects of re-entry, it’s only a “matter of enough trial and error to make that work. They understand the physics, so it’s just a matter of design.” North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  applauding the launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, in North Korea`s northwest. Coats and Stewart testified before North Korea conducted its first test of an intercontinental missile on July 4. On July 28, it conducted a second test of its long-range Hwasong-14 ICBM.The second test flight was captured by a rooftop camera operated by Japan’s NHK television on the northern island of Hokkaido. Elleman, who analyzed the video, concluded that it most likely “disintegrated” before splashdown, suggesting North Korea is still struggling with re-entry.“I think it probably failed fairly late in the process,” said John Schilling, a consultant with 38 North, a respected website on North Korea at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.Schilling said the success of North Korean missiles also depend on the weight of the payload. That’s the weight of the nuclear weapon plus its heat-shielding re-entry system. North Korea is able to make one that weighs between 1,100 and 1,300 pounds, or between 500 and 600 kilograms. One that size might reach West Coast targets, Schilling said. But North Korea would need to make one lighter to strike farther east.""It needs to be light in order to achieve range, but it also needs to be built fairly tough to survive, and those two things are at odds with one another,” Schilling said. “Too light is a problem in that the payload would be too fragile and won’t survive the trip, particularly atmospheric re-entry at the far end.”On Tuesday, a news report said North Korea could now wed nuclear warheads with its missiles, including its longest-range ones that might be able to hit the continental United States. The nuclear advances were detailed in an official Japanese assessment and in a story by The Washington Post that cited US intelligence officials and a confidential Defense Intelligence Agency report.President Donald Trump is warning North Korea not to make any more threats or face “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”North Korea then announced a detailed plan to launch missiles toward the US Pacific territory of Guam, a major military hub and home to US bombers.On Friday, Trump tweeted: “Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.”","korea can put nuclear ,nuclear warhead on an ,north korea still mastering ,can put nuclear warhead ,put nuclear warhead on","['WASHINGTON', 'US', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong Un ’s', 'North Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.92831588  0.66330916

Two THAAD launchers and a radar are currently operational at the site, which was previously a golf course. They were installed under the previous government. A representative of local residents was to observe the evaluation. A handout photo made available by the US Missile Defense Agency, 30 July 2017, showing a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  interceptor being launched from the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska during a test of its system. “Considering on-site conditions, we decided to postpone the environmental survey,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement, calling for the cooperation of local residents and civic groups.The THAAD radar is known to emit strong electromagnetic waves, which are detrimental to the human body and environment. Local residents have voiced concerns that the level of electromagnetic waves might be high if THAAD’s X-band radar is in full operation.On Thursday morning, some 100 protesters demanding the suspension of the THAAD deployment staged a rally in an attempt to stop the environmental test. They accused the government’s planned examination of the site of being a way to facilitate and speed up the deployment process. Four more launchers, currently stored at a US base here, are awaiting deployment. Government officials and reporters sought to enter the THAAD site by using a military helicopter, as they were blocked by protesters who staged a rally in front of the only road to the site. However, the plan was aborted due to bad weather.A “small-scale” environmental impact assessment, required for a site smaller than 330,000 square meters, has been under way since December.In late July, the Defense Ministry said it would decide whether to roll out the four additional launchers required to complete one THAAD battery after the comprehensive environmental survey is conducted in accordance with a domestic law. It said the land size of the THAAD battery site is 700,000 square meters in total. By Kim Da-sol","govt postpones environmental survey ,thursday postponed its plan ,government on thursday postponed ,postpones environmental survey ,postpones environmental survey of","['south korean', 'US', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seongju', 'North g']",3,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.5235076  0.2508257  0.1486757],Kim Da-sol,Defense,8,2017,"korean government on thursday postponed ,thursday postponed its plan ,100 protesters demanding the suspension ,government on thursday postponed its ,on thursday postponed its plan","['south korean', 'US', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the US Missile Defense Agency', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Alaska', 'the Defense Ministry', 'US', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Kim Da - sol']",7,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.5235076  0.2508257  0.1486757]

She was sexually assaulted. In early 2016, the man once again took her to a motel room, this time injecting her with a shot that was “good for women on a diet,” and sexually assaulted her. She told the police she was unable to protest under the drug’s influence. The victim kept quiet, fearing what happened would shock her mother and trigger revenge from the man. In May she learned her friends had also been victims. One of the stepdaughter’s friends had taken the shot described to help shed weight when she had gone over to her house to hang out. She was allegedly taken to a motel room by the man and assaulted. Two other high school friends of the stepdaughter had received text messages from the man, saying, “You resemble my first crush,” “Let’s be in an intimate relationship,” several times.The students, fearing the man, had kept silent. It was only this May that they alerted their school teacher of what was happening. The man disappeared shortly after the police investigation began. He has been on the run for three months now. The victims are reporting distress due to fear of revenge from the man. The police‘s visit to the school also leaked information of what had happened to the school students, causing the victims significant psychological distress.

They have discussed the establishment of a 50-member committee and recently agreed to push to appoint former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik as the head of the committee and first lady Kim Jung-sook as its honorary head.On Monday Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon relayed the proposal to the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, which gave a positive response, the officials said.The prime minister, a former South Jeolla governor, has shown keen interest in the two nuns.Lee asked Kim Youn-joon, a priest of the cathedral on the island, to show a documentary about their life to government officials.After graduating from the nursing college of the University of Innsbruck, the two women came to the island in 1962 and 1966, separately, upon hearing that the colony was in need of nurses. They resided on the island for more than 40 years to work at the National Sorok Island Hospital before returning to their home country in 2005.Despite their long years of duty, the two, often called ""the Angels of Sorok Island,"" did not receive any remuneration for their service and only devoted themselves to caring for leprosy patients there.According to the officials who met them in Austria in June this year, the two are currently in a healthier condition than worried, though Marianne developed cancer a few years ago and Margaeta is suffering a mild case of dementia.The government presented them with medals in 1972, 1983 and 1996 for their contributions to the country and awarded them certificates of honorary South Korean citizenship in June this year.The Sorok colony was founded on the small island in 1916 during Japan's colonial rule of Korea , as they attempted to quarantine patients with leprosy. Infected people were rounded up and taken to the island for isolation and treatment. The South Korean government forced them to remain there until 1963, nearly two decades after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Hundreds of people who suffered from the disease still reside on the island even after having been cured.","austrian nuns for nobel ,nuns for nobel prize ,nuns for nobel ,recommend two austrian nuns ,nobel peace prize officials","[""South Korea 's"", 'austrian', 'Marianne Stoeger', 'Margareta Pissar', ""South Korea 's"", 'Sorok Island']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48145372  0.8345263

The leaflet campaign is one of the main sources of tension between the two Koreas.South Korea's unification ministry said that the government reviewed how to handle it as a follow-up to President Moon Jae-in's peace initiative unveiled in Berlin last month. ""Sending leaflets near the border could spark unnecessary military tensions, including a possible accidental conflict. It also poses a real threat to the safety of border-area residents,"" Baek Tai-hyun, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.But the spokesman added that the issue has complexity amid conflicting views that the leaflet campaign is within the realm of freedom of expression, while the move does little good in improving inter-Korean relations.""We believe that in handling the issue, various factors, including inter-Korean ties and public sentiments, should be taken into account,"" he added.President Moon Jae-in ordered government officials to find ways to stop the anti-North Korea propaganda leaflets from being sent, a presidential official said last week.The government under Moon's predecessor said that the government cannot curb the leaflet launch as it is a matter of freedom of speech but added the move should not pose serious threats to residents living near the border.In October 2014, the North fired machine guns at balloons launched by activists. Some bullets landed in the South's territory, but no one was hurt.The two Koreas agreed in June 2004 to end propaganda campaigns, including border broadcasts and sending leaflets, under the liberal government of late former President Roh Moo-hyun. But civic activists kept sending balloons carrying leaflets, inviting North Korea's backlash.At that time, all Seoul could do was to call on activists to stop their leaflet dispatches, because the government cannot ban such activities, though the move violated the inter-Korean agreement, according to officials.","korean defector activists move ,anti pyongyang propaganda leaflets ,north korean defector activists ,korean defector activists ,pyongyang propaganda leaflets","['South Korea', 'anti - pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Koreans']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.43771604  0.32516459

Police suspect that Samsung officials were dispatched to the management office and if it is found to be true, they could possibly face charges of embezzlement and violation of law on punishing tax criminals, they added.They said they plan to call in company officials for questioning once they finish analyzing the confiscated evidence.

Gathering here at an assistance center in Nowon, northeastern Seoul, were defectors from North Korea training for basic job skills to help them survive in the capitalistic world that is South Korea.  Senior North Korean defectors learn how to pack envelopes in plastic wrappings at a Korea Hana Foundation assistance center in Seoul. But chances for them to land a decent job, or even the menial, low-paying jobs that most defectors end up with, are not very high. About 40 percent of the defector population of 30,000 in South Korea are jobless, said Kim Hee-bong, manager of the Korea Hana Foundation’ defector self-reliance support team. Senior defectors are perhaps the least privileged group in the country’s fiercely competitive job market. On top of the many handicaps that usually comes with the tag of being a North Korean defector, such as language barrier, cultural differences, and social discrimination, older ones have age and health issues and tend to be slow learners.  “Most of them suffer from some form of illness -- it’s mainly due to malnutrition in the North, and disabilities they suffered while crossing the inter-Korean border,” said Kim. To alleviate the issue, state-run defector aid agencies such as Hanawon and Kim’s Hana Foundation are running facilities and programs to help them lead a financially independent life. The Nowon assistance center is one such facility.  Seo Yoo-jung, the chief manager of the center who is a defector herself, said defectors face hardships in adjusting to a capitalist economy. Seo supervised the first senior job training program at the center when it opened in July.  “In North Korea, we are told what to do -- work there doesn’t require as much creative thinking as it does here,” Seo said.  “The language is also different here, which is why defectors experience difficulties even while serving in restaurants. It’s challenging to communicate with customers here.” According to Seo, most defectors lack office skills, which forces them to take basic jobs in the service sector, such as restaurant servers. Also, they believe office work here is too rigorous and competitive by their standards.  A male defector in his 60s participating in the job program in Nowon was forced to accept the harsh reality, but stressed that being jobless was not what he aimed for. “The work culture in South Korea took a toll on me both physically and mentally,” a defector surnamed Han said. “But staying at home  was much worse.” To bring down the barrier, Hanawon has been providing funds to defectors willing to enter and complete its 500-hour job training program since 2005. Women, especially single mothers who risked their lives to bring their children to the South with them, are also suffering from the lack of jobs here. Government data shows that 70 percent of the defector population are women. “I came to South Korea eight years ago with my daughter and son,” said a female defector in her 40s, who requested anonymity. “Foreigners who work here have the freedom to visit their motherland, but we don’t. I find companionship at the center where I can talk with my fellow defectors from my home country,” she tearfully said. North Korean defectors earn an average of 1.5 million won  a month, which amounts to just about 67 percent of South Korea’s average monthly wage of 2.3 million won, according to data released by the National Assembly Budget Office in 2016. Financial hardships are among the biggest difficulties they face here. In a 2015 government survey of 12,000 defectors, 20.9 percent of the group had suicidal thoughts at least once after their arrival in South Korea, 6.8 percentage points higher than South Koreans. About 30 percent stated financial hardships as the main reason.

Police officer Kim Geun-suk, who arrived at the scene in his patrol car, concluded that it would be faster to transport the baby himself than wait for the ambulance.Around 7 p.m. on Friday, the tunnel was filled with back-to-back cars standing still. But the cars slowly moved to the side areas and made way for the siren-blasting police car to sprint forward along the centerline. The baby arrived safely at the hospital in 10 minutes.

The draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would also ban countries from giving any additional permits to North Korean laborers _ another source of money for Kim Jong Un‘s regime. And it would prohibit all new joint ventures with North Korean companies, and ban new foreign investment in existing joint ventures. Egypt, which holds the Security Council presidency, said a vote on the draft resolution has been scheduled at 3 p.m. EDT on Saturday.     The proposed new sanctions follow North Korea’s first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States on July 3 and July 27. The Security Council has already imposed six rounds of sanctions that have failed to halt North Korea‘s drive to improve its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities. The draft resolution condemns the launches ``in the strongest terms’‘ and reiterates previous calls for North Korea to suspend all ballistic missile launches and abandon its nuclear weapons and nuclear program ``in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.’‘ The United States spent weeks following the initial ICBM launch negotiating the text with China, North Korea’s neighbor and ally.  The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, called it the ``most impactful and expansive set of sanctions to date‘’ and said the resolution is expected to be approved unanimously. Agreement on the draft to be put to a vote followed US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson‘s comments Wednesday reassuring North Korea that Washington isn’t seeking regime change or an accelerated reunification of the Korean Peninsula -- comments welcomed by China‘s foreign minister.  Tillerson also said the US wants to talk eventually with North Korea, but doesn’t think discussions would be productive if the North comes with the intention of maintaining its nuclear weapons. North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it sees as a guarantee of its security. The draft resolution reiterates language in previous Security Council resolutions supporting a return to six-party talks with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, expressing the Security Council‘s commitment ``to a peaceful, diplomatic, and political solution to the situation,’‘ and reiterating the importance of maintaining peace and stability in northeast Asia. It also expresses regret at North Korea’s ``massive diversion of its scarce resources toward its development of nuclear weapons and a number of expensive ballistic missile programs‘’ noting UN findings that well over half the population lacks sufficient food and medical care and a quarter of the population suffers from chronic malnutrition.  While the draft resolution would impose biting economic sanctions, the US didn‘t get everything it wanted. In early July, US Ambassador Nikki Haley told the Security Council that if it was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions, and hold senior officials accountable. Oil was not included in the draft resolution and neither are new air restrictions. But the draft resolution would ban all exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. According to the diplomat, coal has been North Korea’s largest export, earning $1.2 billion last year which was then restricted by the Security Council to a maximum $400 million. This year, Pyongyang was estimated to earn $251 million from iron and iron ore exports, $113 million from lead and lead ore exports, and $295 million from seafood exports, the diplomat said. That total‘s over $1 billion. It’s unclear exactly how much money North Korea earns from sending workers overseas but in 2015 the UN special investigator on human rights in North Korea, Marzuki Darusman, estimated it was earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion annually.  Under the draft, countries would be unable to hire any new North Korean workers.  The proposed resolution would also add nine North Koreans, mainly officials or representatives of companies and banks, to the UN sanctions blacklist, banning their travel and freezing their assets. It would also impose an asset freeze on two companies and two banks. The diplomat called the Foreign Trade Bank ``a very critical clearing house for foreign exchange.‘’ The Mansudae Overseas Project Group of Companies, which was also added to the list, is described in the draft resolution as engaged in exporting workers for construction, including of monuments, in Africa and Southeast Asia.

Park Chan-ju, commanding general of the 2nd Operational Command, and his wife treated ""housekeeping"" soldiers like slaves.They were forced to do household chores under inhumane conditions, according to the Center for Military Human Rights Korea, which cited multiple tip-offs from former and current service members. A soldier was ordered to wear an electronic bracelet to vibrate whenever Park's family members call him inside the two-story official residence, the center said.A soldier even attempted suicide in 2015 due to stress from the extreme demands from Park and his wife. Allegations of their human rights violations go on.Park offered to be discharged earlier this week, saying he will take the responsibility for brewing public criticism. He did not confirm nor deny the allegations in a text message distributed to reporters, however.""Starting today, the Army is conducting an on-site probe into how the official residence soldier system is operated,"" the official said.

The North apparently points to North Korean female defectors who were arrested and repatriated to the country after fleeing.The report was submitted to the UN committee ahead of a country review session slated for early November.The North said that a majority of those women were found to illegally cross the border with China as they suffered from economic difficulties or were lured by human trafficking groups.""Therefore, they were not subjected to any legal punishment, and are now enjoying stabilized life thanks to the all-embracing, benevolent politics of the state,"" the report said.It said that 33 women were sentenced to punishment for grave crimes, such as drug trafficking and attempted murder, while staying abroad without valid travel permits in the cited period.North Korea's claim is not seen as true as Pyongyang is notorious for its widespread human rights violations. The North does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.The report said that a legal fund was set up and a bank opened under the Korean Bar Association to offer financial support to women who had been trafficked abroad or filed suits against alleged abductors before courts in foreign countries.The move may indicate that North Korea seeks to crack down on activities of brokers who help North Koreans escape the repressive regime.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is believed to have ordered tightened surveillance of his people since he assumed power in late 2011.Since the second half of 2015, North Korea is known to have bolstered border control and set up high-tension wires around the Tumen River, which flows between the North and China, to curb North Koreans' defections.","female defectors north korea ,repatriated female defectors north ,473 north korean women ,female defectors north ,north korean women returned","['North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.74082708  0.1616843

They sent a distress call to the nearby rescue team after they were stranded due to bad weather. The rescue team couldn't immediately dispatch a helicopter to the site because of strong wind blowing some 130 kph, according to the officials. They were only able to save the 44-year-old Lee on Monday. The climbers had apparently separated from each other to secure a safe place and make contact with the rescue squad.

The scholar, Kim Moon-gil, a Japanese language professor at Busan University of Foreign Studies, donated the clothes to the National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation in 2016, and the museum asked the National Archives in February this year to conduct preservation treatment on them before putting them on public display.In the course of the treatment, the National Archives traced where the clothes were made, and confirmed they were produced and distributed by Japan's army. That represents proof that Japan's government operated military brothels, Kim said.The National Archives said it has completed preservation treatment of the clothes for five months and returned them to the museum. The museum in the southern city of Busan plans to put the clothes on display on Liberation Day on Aug. 15.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.

The discovery came amid Japan's repeated sovereignty claims to South Korea's easternmost islets.The manuscript owned by a Japanese national is estimated to have been created between 1864 and 1889, Nam said. It used to belong to a library in Pyongyang, North Korea, and it is unknown how it was brought to Japan, Nam added. Inside the map remained the library's serial number and the date it was obtained -- Aug. 30, 1932.The discovery resulted from cooperation among Nam, Yukio Fujimoto, honorary professor at University of Toyama, and professor Kim Seong-su from Cheongju University in North Chungcheong Province. The image provided by Prof. Nam Kwon-hee shows the handwritten version of the Korean map Daedongyeojido created by Kim Jeong-ho. The National Diet Library of Japan is believed to possess one copy of the handwritten Daedongyeojido with Dokdo on it and the Research Institute for Korean Studies has another copy, the registered cultural property No. 638.The handwritten Daedongyeojido is an improvement of cartographer Kim's orginal woodprint version, which didn't include Dokdo. ""On a colored  map that Kim Jeong-ho completed in 1834, Dokdo was marked on the right side of Ulleungdo, but on Daedongyeojido created later than this didn't have Dokdo on it,"" Nam said. ""We think Kim added Dokdo to Daedongyeojido when producing the handwritten version.""The newly found map also contains an additional 2,000 pieces of geographical, architectural and historic data absent from the woodprint version.","19th century korean map ,japan 19th century korean ,century korean map ,daedongyeojido korean map made ,century korean map which","['korean', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Nam Kwon - hee', 'Kyungpook National University', 'Daedongyeojido', 'korean', 'k']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37126663  0.61510372

But the assessment result will not change the fact that the US anti-missile system will be stationed as agreed by South Korea and the US, the ministry official stressed.  “The government’s stance is that it will not withdraw its plan to deploy THAAD,” the official said, adding the assessment will be done “as soon as possible.”  The regular environmental impact assessment takes 10 to 15 months, the ministry said, as it requires an inspection of the site in more detailed 21 categories and the process of gathering opinions from the public. “The assessment period can be considerably shortened on the condition that various procedures smoothly proceed as a small-scale assessment was already done,” the official said.The Environment Ministry has conducted a small-scale test on part of the THAAD deployment site -- 328,779 square meters of land -- since December under the previous administration. The small-scale evaluation omits the process of consulting with the public and takes about six months.Seoul agreed to donate the land for the THAAD deployment in two stages: 328,779 square meters first and the remaining 370,000 square meters later, with a combined 700,000 square meters of land subject to the environmental assessment. The Moon administration earlier said that the previous government might have offered only a part of the site to the US Forces Korea to avoid going through the regular environmental impact assessment to speed up the deployment of THAAD. On a site smaller than 330,000 square meters, only a small-scale environmental test is required. President Moon Jae-in ordered a thorough environmental inspection of the deployment site in June after the Defense Ministry failed to inform him that four more launchers for the US anti-missile system had been brought into the country. The Defense Ministry said that it will allow the supply of fuel and extra construction to temporarily run the deployed launchers and facilities for soldiers stationed there. It also said it will take proper measures for residents in the neighborhood near the deployment site, promising to hold public hearings and an inspection of the safety of the launchers if residents want. The delay of the THAAD deployment will likely remain a thorny issue between South Korea and the US, amid continued tensions with North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The allies initially agreed to finish stationing the US missile shield in Korea by the end of this year. The US has underscored the role of THAAD to counter growing threats from North Korea. It has stepped up its pressure on North Korea, with the US Senate on Thursday passing sanctions on the reclusive regime. A local media outlet earlier reported that the US asked South Korea to finish deploying the anti-missile program by March at the latest during working-level consultations ahead of the Korea-US summit last month, but the presidential office denied the reports. Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Lu Kang said that China’s stance on the THAAD issue is consistent and clear, calling on South Korea and the US to stop the THAAD deployment. China has objected to its installation, saying that the missile defense system and its radar system could be used to spy into its territory and undermine regional security. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party and minor Bareun Party blasted the government’s decision, calling it “irresponsible.”  “The Defense Ministry stressing procedural legitimacy when our people’s lives are at stake just shows that its insensitivity to national security is out of control,” said Rep. Kim Young-woo of the minor conservative Bareun Party who chairs the defense committee in the National Assembly. According to a Gallup Korea survey of 1,003 Koreans released on June 16, 53 percent of the 1,003 respondents were in favor of the stationing of THAAD, while 32 percent were against it. Anti-THAAD activists and residents near the anti-missile battery deployment site strongly opposed the plan for the “regular” environmental test, saying the government should instead conduct a “strategic” assessment of the site. The strategic environmental assessment looks into whether the project itself is appropriate, which in this case could signal the possible retraction of the THAAD deployment. They have long protested the stationing of THAAD, citing worries over health and environmental risks from electromagnetic waves emitted by its AN/TPY-2 radar system, doubts over the effectiveness of the anti-missile system in protecting Koreans and Chinese economic retaliation.

A combination of photos carried by North Korea`s main newspaper Rodong Sinmun on July 28, 2017, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visiting the Fatherland Liberation War Martyrs Cemetery a day earlier to mark the 64th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice Agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.  The armistice anniversary passed without any provocative act despite speculation that the country may be preparing to launch another missile around Thursday following its test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4.Kim resumed his public appearances after 15 days by visiting the cemetery in Pyongyang, raising speculation that the repressive regime may delay its missile launch.The armistice was signed on July 27, 1953, leaving South and North Korea technically in a state of war. The North has designated the date as Victory Day to celebrate what it claims is its victory against the United States during the war.The North has claimed that it is developing nuclear weapons as a deterrent to what it called Washington's hostile policy toward it.The repressive regime's possible provocation could deal a blow to President Moon Jae-in's push for engagement with the North at a time when the US is trying to tighten sanctions on Pyongyang.Seoul had offered to hold inter-military talks Thursday to ease border tensions, and has proposed Red Cross talks on Tuesday to resume reunions of families torn apart by the war. But the North has kept mum toward the South's overture.","armistice anniversary north korea ,visits cemetery for war ,military thursday to mark ,heads on armistice anniversary ,cemetery to commemorate veterans","[""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'the Korean Central News Agency']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09654771  0.30875498

The meeting comes as the government and the ruling party push for a tax hike on “super large companies” and high income individuals in its drive to reduce economic polarization. The meeting took place in the gardens of the presidential office, with the president and the business leaders partaking in craft beer produced by a local small business.President Moon Jae-in enjoys a beer with Korea’s corporate tycoons in the gardens of the Blue House in Seoul, Thursday. From right: Moon, Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman Park Yong-maan, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Chung Eui-sun, Hanwha Group Vice Chairman Keum Choon-soo, Doosan Group Chairman Park Jeong-won and Presidential Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok. Moon and the business leaders then retreated into a meeting to discuss the new government’s policy direction, as well as outstanding economic issues. At the meeting, Moon elaborated on his vision of “income led growth” and his ideas for job creation. Job creation has been one of Moon’s key agendas since the election campaign, and he has since installed a monitor displaying labor market figures in Cheong Wa Dae. According to Cheong Wa Dae, the meeting lasted more than two hours, going far over the initially planned 50 minutes, with the president and attending businessmen freely exchanging views. The meeting called together the chiefs and vice chiefs of some of the largest conglomerates, and Ottogi, a South Korean food company. The business leaders present at Thursday’s meeting were vice chairmen Chung Eui-sun of Hyundai Motor, Koo Bon-joon of LG Group, Keum Choon-soo of Hanwha Group, Chung Yong-jin of Shinsegae Group, and chairmen Kwon Oh-joon of Posco, Park Jeong-won of Doosan Group, Sohn Kyung-shik of CJ Group and Ham Young-joon of Ottogi.  LG Group Vice Chairman Koo Bon-joon  and Posco Chairman Kwon Oh-joon  Ottogi Chairman Ham Young-joon and Shinsegae Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin At the meeting, the Hyundai Motor vice chairman also touched on China‘s economic reprisal over Seoul’s decision to deploy US missile defense system THAAD was cutting the company‘s sales in China. He added that the company would seek to cooperate with Korean startups.According to Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun, Doosan’s Park Jeong-won expressed concerns for difficulties arising from the Moon administration‘s nuclear free policy, which may put an end to Shin-Kori 5 and 6 reactors’ construction, but that the company will seek new revenue chanels overseas. Although Ottogi ranks far below the other groups represented at the event, the food maker’s chief was invited in consideration of its efforts for providing equal opportunity to its workers. Alongside its ramen business, the company gained fame in recent years for its charitable activities and for hiring almost all of its workers on regular contracts. Of the company’s employees, about 1.1 percent are on irregular contracts. Along with the business leaders, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Paik Un-gyu and Chairman of the Financial Services Commission Choi Jong-ku attended the meeting.  President Moon with a group of business leaders at Cheong Wa Dae Along with Moon administration’s top economic policy makers, Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission Kim Sang-jo, often referred to by the Korean media as the “chaebol sniper” was in attendance.

But in South Korea, people just see her as a “fat woman” unfit to be a fashion model. “In Korean society, there are categories for only ‘normal’ or ‘average’ people. The rest don’t belong anywhere, and fat people are just mocked. They consider being fat as lazy, disgusting and unhealthy,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “It is not true and it is none of others’ business,” said Kim, 31, who is a US size 14 and 165 centimeters tall. “It has been a long time since I’ve shopped in Korea because there are not many sizes here I can try on.” Kim, who debuted as a model in the US in 2010, now owns magazine 66110. It runs articles on fashion issues for plus-size women and sells clothes for them as part of efforts to fight against the country’s long-held beauty norm.“Being fat is not a problem just like being slim, having short or long hair isn’t a problem.”Women’s rights activists protest the lack of size-range and biased depiction of women in the Korean fashion industry in Myeong-dong, Seoul, Wednesday. On Wednesday, an association of six women’s rights groups criticized clothing companies for using mannequins idealizing too-thin figures and making only limited sizes in clothing, which they said solidifies an unrealistic beauty standard. According to the report by the Korea Women’s Environmental Network on 31 clothing companies, including FOREVER21, H&M;, Uniqulo and MIXXO, 74.2 percent of them failed to offer various sizes -- only retaining three sizes. Of those, 95.5 percent were local brands. Only 25 percent of the surveyed retailers had an XS size and 30.1 percent had an XL. In terms of sleeveless shirts, only 11 of 31 brands had an XL size and only seven brands had an XS. As for short skirts, out of 26 brands, six retailers had an XS size or smaller, and only two brands had an XL size and bigger, it said.  Women’s rights activists protest the lack of size-range and biased depiction of women in the Korean fashion industry in Myeong-dong, Seoul, Wednesday. They have called for varied body sizes of mannequins and clothing to be showcased by retailers, as well as an act demanding retailers to denote retouched images in their advertisements.A standard mannequin in South Korea is 175 to 180 centimeters tall, has a waist measurement of 24 inches and a hip measurement of 89 centimeters. But the average woman aged 20 to 24 in the country is 160 centimeters tall and has a waist size of 28 inches and hip size of 92.7 centimeters, according to the Korea Agency for Technology and Standards in 2015. Women’s rights activists protest the lack of size-range and biased depiction of women in the Korean fashion industry in Myeong-dong, Seoul, Wednesday. “It is common to see women who say they could not find items available in their sizes, especially feminine items like skirts,” Ko Kum-sook from KWEN said. “Limited sizes not only spread a distorted standard for beauty, but also make women think that it is their fault to be too heavy.”“Many women are constantly on a diet, suffering from mental distress and eating disorders,” she said. “More sizes mean women’s health rights better protected.”In a 2013 study by Samyook University in Seoul that surveyed 233 female university students only 11.5 percent said that they were satisfied with their bodies. On the other hand, 93.5 percent of 154 students who are in the normal range said that they were unhappy with their bodies.  “I used to think about losing weight all the time. When I saw women looking perfect in their clothes in advertising, I tried it on. But when I didn’t look like it, I got disappointed,” said Kim Ah-yeong, a women’s rights activist at Bulggot Femi Action.Both women and men cannot avoid facing lookism, but it places a heavier burden on women, she said. “Many men also take interest in taking care of their appearance, but doing that is almost a must for women. It seems like there are stereotypes for women’s looks, such as thin arms and legs, muscular thighs and big breasts.” Though beauty standards vary all over the world, many other countries also place an emphasis on being skinny. But it is especially pronounced here, a scholar said. “Limited options for sizes are linked to Korean society putting too much stress on having certain types of looks, which can be seen in many Koreans going under the knife,” said Seol Dong-hoon, sociology professor at Jeonbuk University. According to a survey on 459 men and women in their 20s by Univ 20 magazine and Banobagi Plastic Surgery in 2016, 46.4 percent of them said they had received plastic surgery. Of them, 44.5 percent said they had done so because they had been envious of others’ looks. In 2007, legislation was introduced in Korea to make it mandatory for clothing manufacturers to make various sizes including big ones, but failed to pass through the National Assembly. In 2015, France enforced a law prohibiting unhealthy models on its runways and requiring advertisers to indicate in text in cases where images of models were digitally retouched. The US proposed a similar bill this year.By Ock Hyun-ju","fat woman unfit ,fat woman unfit to ,as fat woman unfit ,feminists criticize lookism ,fashion model in korean","['the United States', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Gee - yang', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Kim']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68233782  0.16985084

Proportional representative Kim Hyun-a of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party submitted the bill to the National Assembly, after a citizen requested its enactment on a popular Korean TV program “Infinite Challenge,” citing physical difficulties she faced while parking in narrow parking spaces.  Parking space designated for the disabled The proposal aims to revise an existing law governing designation of parking spaces for the disabled. It would make pregnant women entitled to use them. The law, in effect since 2003, compels public parking lots to set aside space exclusively for the disabled. “A revision is needed to support women who decide to bear a baby in the era of low pregnancy rate,” Rep.

190,190,[Herald Interview] ‘China's defector deportations create new breed of separated families’,"China has recently been repatriating more North Koreans seeking to resettle in the South, giving birth to a new breed of separated families and depriving them of family rights, a UN rights envoy told The Korea Herald.

The practice...","China has recently been repatriating more North Koreans seeking to resettle in the South, giving birth to a new breed of separated families and depriving them of family rights, a UN rights envoy told The Korea Herald. Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN special rapporteur on North Korean human rights, said Beijing has been intensifying its crackdown on North Korean escapees, detaining and deporting many of them. The practice is not only fueling the risks of punishment after repatriation, but also generating a “second cycle of separation of families,” he said. “There is, in fact, the tendency to tighten control in the border areas, there is the tendency to crack down on those who finally cross the border and transfer them for detention and there’s the tendency to increase repatriations,” he said in an interview marking the end of his five-day trip here on Friday. His remarks coincide with a Radio Free Asia report Saturday that a group of five family members of a local Workers’ Party official had committed suicide after being apprehended in the southwestern city of Kunming by Chinese authorities, who were transporting them back to North Korea. “There’s a serious issue of the separation of families because sometimes people leave in groups from the North and the groups are split in China; some are fortunate enough to finally reach South Korea but others are detained and repatriated,” he said. “It’s like a second cycle of separation of families.”  Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN special rapporteur on North Korean human rights, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald at the UN Human Rights Office in Seoul on Friday. At a news conference Friday, Quintana also said he has spotted “inconsistencies” in the case of 12 North Korean restaurant workers in China who came to Seoul last year. Pyongyang argues they were kidnapped by agents from Seoul’s National Intelligence Service, demanding their return as a precondition for a new round of family reunions. While the 12 are “safe and living in principle under free conditions,” the envoy said he will continue to work to establish the facts so as to help eliminate hurdles for family reunions, which he called an urgent human rights matter. “My main message is that you need to be careful with your procedures,” the Argentine human rights lawyer said. “Second, which is important, I wanted to be sound to the North Korean claim because they responded to the South Korean proposal invoking the case, and also responded to me in my communication invoking the case again,” he noted, referring to his recent public appeal for a restart of family reunions. During his stay, he met with a defector who aspires to go back to the North after having struggled for years to adapt to the competitive South Korean society and to shake off authorities’ suspicions he may be a spy.The man is not alone in missing his communist homeland. Pyongyang also urges the return of Kim Ryon-hui, a defector who has been asking to return to the North since 2015, saying she is “being detained by force.” Last week, a young female defector known for her role on a South Korean reality TV show stirred furor after appearing in a North Korean propaganda video in which she said life in the South was “like living in hell.” Seoul has dismissed the defectors’ return requests in light of legal and administrative barriers and political and security risks. Quintana stressed the significance in taking greater heed of individual voices to better cater to the defectors’ needs, noting that just like the man, many of the escapees have left their families in the North and China. Without proper care, more people may emerge hoping to return, which would hardly improve their own human rights while egging on social cohesion here. “I really believe that we need to focus on individuals and their rights. This is a person who is supposed to be free here in the South, and you should respect his situation,” the rapporteur said. “In principle, I agree that he should be able to return, but then all other questions would arise including what the situation is like in the North, because he might even face reprisals if he goes back and he might be used by the media, so there are different implications.”  North Koreans work on farm fields along the Pyongyang-Wonsan highway on Thursday in Sangwon County, North Hwanghae Province. Quintana has a task he is eager and determined to tackle: visit North Korea and build a communication channel with authorities there. He has been working on it ever since who took up the job in March 2016 but Pyongyang remains unchanged in its opposition.“I believe that having dialogue is a starting point in trying to build trust and trying to seek the areas of common understanding,” he said. “In the end, I’d really like to help the people in North Korea and offer my services. ... So my objective is to try to have a relationship with the North Korean government and ultimately have a chance to visit the country, and at the same time I will continue to raise my voice on the human rights and the plight of North Koreans.” By Shin Hyon-hee  A video clip from a reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War is shown on a TV screen at the Red Cross headquarters in Seoul on Friday. Following are excerpts from the interview. –Ed. The Korea Herald: We’ve learned that China has recently been stepping up its crackdowns on North Koreans seeking to come to South Korea, currently detaining dozens of them. Are you aware of the tendency, and what do you make of it?Quintana: There is in fact the tendency to tighten control in the border areas, there is the tendency to crack down on those who finally cross the border and transfer them for detention and there’s the tendency to increase repatriations. So the situation has become really serious. It deserves more attention from the international community. I’ve raised these specific concerns with the diplomatic corps that I met here in South Korea because they also have a role to play. What I cannot tell is what other reasons are behind the increase. I’ve heard different speculations regarding the domestic dynamics in China and others. But it is important to address the other reasons, because if you understand the reasons, you might have different answers to address the problem. For the time being, I’m raising my voice and expressing my concern, and I’ve also had communication with the Chinese government already. These are things that I’m doing. During the conference, I commented about not only the plight of those trying to cross the border and being repatriated, but also that we need to understand that there’s a serious issue of the separation of families because sometimes people leave in groups from the North and the groups are split in China; some are fortunate enough to finally reach South Korea, but others are detained and repatriated. They all face the serious issue of separation of families, I’ve met them, and this is becoming a very serious problem, and we need to make it more visible -- it’s like a second cycle of separation of families. KH: You met a defector who wants to go back to North Korea. Do you think he should be repatriated from the perspective of human rights, despite legal and political constraints that make it difficult?Q: I met one man who came to the office to offer me his testimony about his situation. I explored the reasons why he wants to go back, and there’s a combination of factors. First, it has to do with the difficulties to integrate into South Korean society. Second, there’s an issue of being accused of spying activities by South Korean authorities while living here. He went through the whole process of verification when he arrived here at different government facilities where they checked if in fact he had any connection with DPRK  authorities and if he might have an intention of spying. Nothing came up, and he was released, and started to integrate. Then this accusation appeared again, and it was a wrong accusation and there was no evidence. So the bottom line is that if you put all the factors together, he wants to go back. And his son and wife remained in the North. Because of legal constraints and mechanisms, he’s facing obstacles, but he was very clear with regard to his willingness to return.At the same time, the majority of escapees leave their families in the North, and some of them leave their children in China. There’s an issue of family rights and it’s starting to be more visible with respect to the lives in South Korea. And it’s very complicated to address. But at least we need to start making it visible. KH: What can be done by South Korean authorities to address this problem? Q: This might not sound like something very substantive, but it is important to let their voices be heard. Because when you start to understand their problems, and once you understand the problems, you can think about solutions. With all the legislation against the possibility for these people to return, and with regard to the situation in North Korea, it’s difficult to bring solutions to these people. One of my intentions coming here on my second mission and among other elements I addressed is to try to talk to someone in that position; as the UN envoy to deliver messages to make the situation visible, though I don’t have specific solutions so far. I really believe that we need to focus on individuals and their rights. This is a person who is supposed to be free here in the South, and you should respect his situation. In principle, I agree that he should be able to return, but then all other questions would arise including what the situation is like in the North because he might even face reprisals if he goes back to the North, and he might be used by the media so there are different implications. There’s another complex issue coming from the division of Korea and it has to do with the Korean people. KH: From your statement on inconsistencies in the case of the 12 restaurant workers, I sense that there could be a source of controversy in terms of South Korean authorities’ operation in bringing high-profile defectors here. Do you have any advice with regard to this? Q: You’re getting my message. I wanted to make a clear point that I’ve found inconsistencies. I know that it isn’t quite specific, but I was trying to make that point. I’m not talking about the current situation, that’s another issue. They are safe and living in principle under free conditions. What I’m saying is that there are consistencies in the circumstances that they left. This is a group of 12 people. We shouldn’t be just talking about them as one decision, but 12 different tasks at the restaurant and different positions. So there are inconsistencies regarding the situations of each of them. I’m willing to continue addressing the issue with concerned authorities. My main message is that you need to be careful with your procedures, and that’s first. Second, which is important, I wanted to be sound to the North Korean claim because they responded to the South Korean proposal invoking the case, and responded to me in my communication invoking the case again. I came here to have and seek information so that I can say something, not just ignore . I wanted to have communication with the South Korean government, therefore I had to look into the issue and how I respond. KH: Do you know if any of the 12 regret their decision and want to go back?Q: If I knew, maybe I would decide to disclose the information. But to be honest, I don’t know. I have some information about what happened at the moment, but what is their feeling and what they want to do -- it’s a delicate situation. These are people who belong to families living in Pyongyang generally in good positions. There might be implications on my responsibilities to avoid any other negative implications. KH: The UN Commission of Inquiry was a milestone in raising international attention on North Korean human rights. What would be the next breakthrough that the UN and international community may be able to achieve? Do you possibly see a future where the Security Council discusses how to apply the notion of the responsibility to protect to the situation of North Korea and takes intervention measures?Q: Currently the dynamics in New York, among the three UN agencies -- which are the office of the secretary-general, the General Assembly and the Security Council -- are very political ones. The current dynamics are very complicated, with China, Russia and the new government in the US. So in such a time when there’s no flexibilities coming from different institutions and governments, it’s difficult to advocate for the use of the principle of responsibility to protect, and any kind of intervention. This is not a discussion the Security Council has been holding with regard to North Korea. The Security Council has been using and increasing the sanctions regime against North Korea, and there is a committee following up on the implementation by member states on the sanctions, so the sanctions regime is there. KH: What’s your goal as the special rapporteur? Q: What I’d really like is to visit North Korea, because I believe that having dialogue is a starting point in trying to build trust and trying to seek the areas of common understanding. These are very strong and useful elements to gradually improve human rights in a specific region or country. I’m talking from my experience as the special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar for six years. That’s something that I’d really like to achieve during my tenure. In the end, I’d really like to help the people in North Korea and offer my services. And it has to do with authorities at some point. So my objective is to try to have a relationship with the North Korean government and ultimately have a chance to visit the country, and at the same time I will continue to raise my voice on the human rights and the plight of North Koreans.","china defector deportations create ,repatriating more north koreans ,interview china defector deportations ,china defector deportations ,herald interview china defector","['China', 'North Koreans', 'UN', 'the Korea Herald', 'Tomas Ojea Quintana', 'UN', 'north korean', 'Beijing', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.85256732  0.69624215

Pyongyang's mouthpiece Korea Central News Agency broadcasts about North Koreans relaxing on a beach.There are no indications that the North's economy has suddenly improved since late 2011 when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power on the sudden death of his father and long-time leader Kim Jong-il, an official said.During late Kim's 17-year rule, the North's economy grew just 0.2 percent on average.""North Korea's economic structure is very fragile and is not really set up for high growth,"" the official spoke on the condition of anonymity.The BOK estimated North Korea's gross national income stood at 36.4 trillion won  in 2016. South Korea's per-capita GNI stood at 31.98 million won, which is 22.1 times larger than the North's 1.46 million won.Daniel Pinkston, a Korea expert at Troy University in Seoul, said there seems to be some improvement in North Korea's economy, though he said it is always hard to trust the figures.As North Korea does not release its official economic data, South Korea estimates North Korea's annual economic performance since 1991 based on information provided by South Korea's spy agency and other relevant organizations.Related to last year's growth, the central bank said North Korea's mining industry grew 8.4 percent, the highest since 1999 when it expanded 14.2 percent.North Korea's trade volume came to $6.55 billion in 2016, up 4.7 percent from a year earlier, the BOK said. The increase came despite tightened UN sanctions imposed on North Korea over its repeated nuclear tests and its long-range rocket launches.The sanctions call for, among other things, a ban on the country's exports of coal and other mineral resources to cut off North Korea's access to hard currency.Still, the provision will not apply if transactions are determined to be exclusively for livelihood purposes and unrelated to generating revenue for North Korea's nuclear or ballistic missile programs or other activities prohibited by previous UN resolutions.China accounts for nearly 90 percent of North Korea's foreign trade, and mineral resources are a key part of their bilateral trade.","economy grew percent last ,economy grew in 2016 ,drought last year growt ,korea economy grew percent ,last year the fastest","[""North Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'UN', 'Pyongyang']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60196495  0.52382803

Presidential spokesman Park Soo-hyun speaks during a press conference at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on July 20, 2017. The documents, dated from March 2013 to October 2016, were found in an office used by a secretary subordinate to the former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun told reporters.The release is the latest in a series of document discoveries that Cheong Wa Dae has recently made public ""in light of citizens' right to know.""""They hint that Cheong Wa Dae  apparently directly spearheaded the efforts to spread a specific ideology,"" Park said, pointing to the plans in the documents to foster conservative writers and offer financial support to rightwing civic groups.Among the documents was one on ""the direction for the exercise of the National Pension Service's voting rights with regards to Samsung's merger plan. The NPS, then a major shareholder of Samsung companies, is suspected of voting in favor of a merger between two Samsung affiliates, which in turn is widely believed to have helped strengthen the group's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong's control over the conglomerate.The Samsung heir, Lee, is currently standing trial on charges of offering bribes to the former leader and her friend Choi Soon-sil allegedly in exchange for the NPS' support for the merger scheme.The spokesman pointed out that another document dealt with how to respond in the case of foreign hedge funds' ""aggressive interference"" in the conglomerate's managerial rights.","more documents from corruption ,corruption tainted former govt ,documents from corruption tainted ,office finds more documents ,documents from corruption","['Cheong', 'Samsung']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65462643  0.06893888

As part of efforts to secure experienced workers in the sectors facing chronic labor shortages, the Justice Ministry has created the E-7-4 visa for those with proven skills. “The ministry believes that the system will greatly contribute to stable supply of skilled laborers for employers facing labor shortages,” an official from the Justice Ministry told The Korea Herald.Migrant workers pick tomatoes at a farm. According to the ministry, holders of an E-9 visa , an E-10 visa  and an H-2 visa  who have stayed here for four years are entitled to apply. Under the current work visas, foreign workers were required to return to their countries after a four-year and 10-month stay. Few workers, who met strict conditions, could switch their visas to E-7 visas to extend their stay here. “We diversified conditions foreign workers should meet to make it easier for employers to use skilled workers in the crucial manufacturing sectors,” the official said. According to Statistics Korea, there were 962,000 foreigners working in the country last year. Among them, the number of foreign workers on the H-2 visa was 254,950, while there were 279,187 on the E-9 visa and 15,312 on the E-10 visa as of the end of 2016, according to the ministry. Under the new visa scheme, workers, who score more than 50 points, can receive the visa on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers are given points in accordance with their work experience, income, age, Korean proficiency and level of education, among other things.Those holding the E-7-4 visa can extend it every two years upon a review, which will allow them to live here indefinitely once conditions are met. They can also bring their families to the country. As the cap has already been reached this year, the ministry will issue 300 additional visas for the remainder of the fiscal year as part of the pilot program. Next year’s quota for the E-7-4 visa will be set after consulting with relevant ministries at the end of this year, it said. South Korea has been relying on imported labor to fill jobs in the manufacturing, fishing and agricultural sectors, which are shunned by locals, especially the young, for low pay and poor working conditions. A researcher from the Korea Small Business Institute said that the latest measure will help small and medium-sized companies struggling to retain highly-skilled foreign workers. “I think the new visa policy is a win-win for both companies and foreign workers,” said Noh Mean-sun from the KSB. “SMEs can hire workers with skills and expertise and train them in the long term. For foreign workers, they will be motivated to accumulate skills to work longer and earn more money in the country.”Migrant workers were more cautious about the policy. “I welcome the establishment of the new visa, but it will be virtually very difficult for migrant workers to get the visa with all those conditions attached,” said Shekh al-Mamun, a Bangladeshi official from Korea’s first migrant workers’ union.“For example, not many migrant workers are able to make that much income and save that much money in bank accounts ”Activists have long called for the abolishment of the current EPS system, instead suggesting that the government issue a “Labor Permit System” that will allow foreign workers to freely change their workplaces without having to get approval from their employers and to extend their stay here.

The horn-rimmed glasses with an inbuilt camera on this website is identical to the one worn by a fan caught secretly filming at the female K-pop group GFriend’s fan event in April.Read: Hidden camera at Airbnb house in Japan catches Korean couple off guardRead: GFriend’s Yerin catches fan’s secret filmingThe latest addition to the list of eyebrow-raising hidden cameras is a water bottle-shaped device that can contain liquid inside to look exactly like an innocent water bottle. This product is up on the website at a price of 370,000 won . The bottle has an indent on the side for a detachable camera to lock in to. Covered with a believable sticker label, the bottle looks indistinguishable from other store-sold drinks. Once fully charged, the camera lasts from 15 hours to 10 days and records in full HD, according to the website. “Totally unrecognizable amongst soda bottles in convenience store fridges,” touts the website. “No one will suspect,” it reassures. The product comes with 10 extra label stickers and two extra unopened bottle caps. It can take heated liquid up to 60 degrees Celsius.A user wrote, “No one can tell when I’m drinking from the bottle and filming. It’s mindblowing. The lens is completely invisible and the resolution is high.”There is no specific law that restricts the sales of hidden cameras.

YonhapThe Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency is looking into the route Lim used to re-enter North Korea by analyzing data including her personal phone and financial transaction records, said police on Wednesday,Lim appeared in an online propaganda video released by North Korea’s state-run website Uriminzokkiri on Sunday. She said she had “returned on her own will” and was forced to slander the communist regime during her time in the South. In the clip, she was introduced as Jeon Hye-sung. “Lim Ji-hyun” is believed to be an alias given to her as part of Seoul’s defector protection program. “I thought I could eat well and make a lot of money in South Korea, but every day was like hell there,” Lim said in the video clip. She also urged other defectors in South Korea to return to the North.“Let’s return to our motherland and see our parents’ faces before we die,” she said. Lim was a TV personality in the South. She starred in reality show programs including “South Korean Men and North Korean Women” and “Moranbong Club.”The reality TV star defected to South Korea in January 2014 after spending three years in China. She left for China in April for unknown reasons and stated in the video clip she had crossed the North Korean border in June. Despite Lim’s claims that she volunteered to return to the North, her friends and acquaintances have raised doubts, saying all her belongings in her residence in Gangnam had remained after her departure. “Experts are carefully suggesting that Lim had become a target of the North Korean State Security Department,” Rep. Cheong Yang-seog, deputy floor leader of the conservative Bareun Party, said during a general meeting Tuesday. “If she went back voluntarily, she would have taken care of her assets here, but most of it seems untouched.”An unnamed source told Joongang Ilbo that Lim had not been classified as a “subject of concern” by Hanawon, meaning she was not experiencing major difficulties in adjusting to life in the South. Hanawon is a state-run agency in charge of offering settlement support to defectors. Another source close to Lim suggested she might have traveled to China to bring her family members in North Korea to the South. Lim said in Sunday’s broadcast that she is currently living with her parents in Anju, South Pyongan Province. Police reports also showed that Lim had a Chinese spouse whom she left in China when she defected. She reportedly frequently visited China to see her husband. The pair had no children together. It is not uncommon for defectors in the South to hire brokers to reunite them with their North Korean family members at the North Korea-China border and return to South Korea with them. It is, however, a risky move, as such areas are under heavy surveillance by North Korean agents. Lee So-yul, a fellow defector and online broadcaster, defended Lim after her denunciation by the South Korean government Tuesday, saying, “She probably had no choice in order to survive in the North.”Defector Lee then raised the possibility of torture and threats, saying Lim’s facial expression in the video was that of a person “begging to stay alive.”The number of North Korean defectors dropped 20.8 percent in the first half of 2017 on-year, data from South Korea’s Ministry of Unification has showed. It is believed that North Korean strong man Kim Jong-un has been toughening border controls and punishments for escape attempts since he rose to power in 2011.

Led by Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, who made sound city finance as his top priority, Incheon metropolitan government has carried out a 3-year debt resolution plan and is now seeing their efforts pay off. An official poster that promotes Incheon’s city slogan, “All Ways Incheon.” Incheon Metropolitan GovernmentThe city’s debt was estimated to be around 13 trillion won  in 2014, when Yoo took office, but that is now down to 11 trillion won this year. It is forecast to further scale down to 9 trillion won by the end of the year, according to the city officials. Accordingly, the city’s debt ratio fell from 39.9 percent in 2015 to 24.1 percent this June, allowing it to avoid Interior Ministry sanctions. According to the city, its financial burden stemmed mainly from big-scale projects such as the 2014 Asian Games. The city also repurchased municipal bonds worth 45.3 billion won in June for early redemption. “Incheon will make efforts to reduce an additional 280 billion won worth of debt by the end of the year,” Yoo said during a recent interview. The city government plans to evenly invest in the local social welfare, culture, education and environment sectors as soon as it achieves fiscal stability to promote the welfare of its citizens. Solving its landfill issues was another core project Yoo has pursued throughout his term. In 2015, the city obtained the license to own and manage a waste dump site spanning 15.8 square kilometers of land, shared with Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. The city is to earn waste commission fees worth 75 billion won per year. The municipal and provincial governments were experiencing difficulties finding an alternative dumping ground for a site which was originally scheduled to shut down in 2016 due to pollution and bad odors. The site, which opened in 1992, caters to the needs of around 25 million citizens in Incheon and adjacent areas, according to government data. Incheon City Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok talks of his achievements and goals three years into his term in an office interview. Incheon Metropolitan GovernmentDespite its global reputation as one of the best airline hubs, Incheon has been seeing sluggish developments in its land transportation. It is widely known that its commuters experience difficulties traveling from Incheon to another city. Yoo revealed his dedication to the construction of high-speed underground rail networks, including the Incheon-bound GTX that connects Songdo International Business District in Incheon with central Seoul. Suin Line, a subway line that connects Songdo Station to Incheon Station was also launched this month in an effort to grease its stiff inter-city transportation. The expansion of its transportation infrastructure is in line with the city’s goals to promote its tourist sites and boost its regional economy. The city is currently enhancing access to 168 nearby islands such as Yeongjongdo, which is expected to blossom into South Korea’s own Las Vegas with its proximity to Incheon airport. Its geographical advantage has successfully grabbed the attention of local and international resort and casino operators such as Paradise Group and Hong Kong’s Chow Tai Fook. “My wish is to open an era of ‘great Incheon’ where citizens of the city can experience joy through integration of citizens and local development,” Yoo said. “I also hope Incheon will be able to secure a power for sustainable development and morph into a city that can lead South Korea’s growth.” Yoo’s four-year term is slated to end next year.

The Korea Herald has interviewed nine former teachers from the Canadian British Columbia International School in eastern Seoul, which shut down in May after 14 teachers and the dean were deported, and other English immersion institutions currently under investigation. Two former employees from CBIS are taking legal action against the Korea Immigration Service and are fighting their deportation. An empty science room at now-disbanded Canadian British Columbia International School in eastern Seoul. According to their claim, the teachers were wrongly advised to apply for a visa type valid only for language instructors, when they were to teach regular school subjects such as math and science. The immigration service, which should have known this as it reviewed their employment contract, granted the applicants the wrong visa. E-2 visa holders are limited to teaching language conversation classes only. “The immigration office should nullify the departure order and one-year entry prohibition against our clients as they had rightly obtained the visa to work as teachers,” said Pete J. Rhee from Rhee’s Law Office who represents Robert Flower and Kristen Hendricks. Employment contracts which the two submitted to immigration for a visa, and which have been seen by The Korea Herald, clearly state details about their teaching duties, including the subjects. Alex Hebb, another former teacher at CBIS, had his E-2 visa extended by one year after submitting the updated work contract that included his teaching duties. He left South Korea in May, following a departure order. “It doesn’t make sense that Korean immigration would punish us so harshly. They had all of the information they needed and approved our E-2 visas,” said Hebb. “They suddenly decided that we shouldn’t be approved. There was no other way to communicate to us that we should switch visas,” he claimed. Seoul Immigration Office, a branch office in Seoul at the helm of the clampdown, refused to comment on these claims. It, however, said that the investigation into foreign residents teaching subjects other than their native language on E-2 visas is “still open and ongoing” in a written response. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official at Korea Immigration Service explained the review process of E-2 visa applications tends to be loose, as its applicants are thought to be highly educated and less likely to commit crimes. “The process is supposed to include a thorough review of applicants’ work contracts under which students will be taught,” the source said. The current visa dispute involves foreign education institutions operating in a legal gray area. For instance, the now-closed CBIS was an alternative school certified by the Canadian province of British Columbia, but not authorized as a school by the Korean education office. Since it was operating under a hagwon license, it was unable to sponsor E-7 visas for school teachers. There are scores of other global academies, registered as hagwon here but in reality operate as international schools. Laura Murray, who taught at one such institution in Seoul and is now facing deportation, said teachers are suffering from the errors made by their employers, education offices that allowed them to operate and immigration. “Although I understand this was practiced by other schools in the past and was viewed as falling under a legal gray area, the reality is it is illegal. The foreign teachers trusted our employers to do their jobs well and assumed everything was legal. “I blame the education office for issuing the hagwon license without a thorough review,” she said. No one is offering to take any responsibility for all the damage, from the cost of a flight back home to the impact that the deportation and the one-year re-entry ban would have on her relationship with her Korean boyfriend, she claimed. An anonymous teacher who taught at Canada Maple International School, which is certified by the Province of Manitoba in Canada to deliver the Manitoba curriculum, said it is in the best interest of future foreign teachers here to “know exactly what kind of visa they are getting and what they are allowed to teach under said visa” before accepting a job offer.“There are about 22 teachers at CMIS; about half of them are leaving the country. We were lied to at the beginning of our contracts. We were told that CMIS was an international school and that we were accredited as such. It wasn’t until later in my contract that I discovered that we are a hagwon and that some teachers here are working under the wrong visa. Because some of us teach core subjects such as science and history, an E-2 visa is inappropriate for our work,” the teacher said.By Bak Se-hwan","government body deported teachers ,dispute frustrates foreign teachers ,deportations of foreign teachers ,teachers south korean immigration ,frustrates foreign teachers south","['south korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'canadian', 'British Columbia International School', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.42452943 -0.0391296

The detector appeared to have a tiny camera lens pointing directly toward the bed. The couple talked about what would happen if the detector were actually a hidden camera. Things went downhill from there.A green light came on in the device, with what appeared to be a camera lens pointing toward the bed. “The night became a nightmare after we searched online and found an exact same-looking cameras up for sale on the internet,” the Korean man wrote online. Shocked, they disassembled the fire detector and found a micro-SD memory card inside. The card turned out to have recorded everything that had happened in the room. The couple disassembled the device and found a micro-SD card with footage of them inside the house after entering the room. The footage was recorded in one-minute intervals. “Fortunately we hadn’t done anything that night, but this was an Airbnb house we had previously rented on an earlier trip,” the distressed man said. The couple contacted the South Korean Embassy in Japan for help in reporting the case to police.“People from the embassy came to the police station to offer support. They drove us to different accommodations to stay at for the remainder of the trip,” the man wrote. The couple searched online and found similar-looking clandestine cameras openly for sale. Pinhole-sized camera A representative from Airbnb told The Korea Herald that “Airbnb has a zero-tolerance policy towards privacy infringements” and that “any relevant cases are dealt with utmost gravity.” The host of the home fitted with the alleged hidden camera was immediately banned from the Airbnb community and maximal support was given to the guests.By Lim Jeong-yeo","for bed korean couple ,bed korean couple found ,japan catches korean couple ,korean couple off guard ,catches korean couple off","['korean', 'Japan', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6565758   0.51468903

At the site stretching about 200,000 square meters located in Yanggu-gun, Gangwon Province, the Association of Korean Goral Conservation is trying to restore Korean gorals -- a goat-like animal native to Korea. There, the association is currently raising 26 gorals -- designated as a natural monument No. 217 and grade I endangered species by the government -- to later release them into the wild. Only hundreds of gorals are thought to be living in the wild nationwide. Gorals typically have brown fur with shades of gray and black. They have short, backward-facing horns. They are called “living fossil” and “animal of fantasy” as their legs are short -- relics of an ancient form. Gorals used to live across the Korean Peninsula from Mount Baekdu, which straddles the China-North Korea border, to Mount Jiri. But they are now in danger of extinction due to poaching and destruction of their natural habitat.“As I have observed for more than 10 years, a goral produces a single offspring at a time, defying our belief that gorals give birth to two to three offspring at once,” said Ahn Jae-yong, secretary-general of the association, underscoring the importance of goral conservation efforts.Photographed by Park Hyun-koo Written by Ock Hyun-ju","restore korean gorals goat ,endangered korean gorals roaming ,watch endangered korean gorals ,hour drive from seoul ,endangered gorals two hour","['Seoul', 'korean', 'Yanggu', 'Gangwon Province', 'the Association of Korean Goral Conservation', 'korean', 'Korea']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -1.04201746  0.54687303

However, these seats are usually occupied by the elderly.The debate has even reached online communities for expats here. A Facebook user speculated that the man who was attacked might have had a disability or injury, which would justify him occupying the seat.

It feels like summer comes right after winter now,” said a 32-year-old office worker Kim Jin-hee.  A child plays by a water fountain in Seoul. It’s only mid-June, but it has been a while since Kim started carrying a handy fan in her bag for the commute, she added. In fact, South Korea is experiencing an early arrival of sweltering summer heat right now, coupled with an extreme drought, which experts say are impacts of the climate change on the Korean Peninsula. The season’s first heat advisory was issued on June 16 for Seoul, with a midday high soaring to 33 degrees Celsius in the capital. Nearly a month before that, the southern city of Daegu has seen the nation’s first issuance of the heat advisory. Not surprisingly, air conditioners are becoming a must-have at home. And the sales of the appliance are not restricted to summer season. According to local retail giant Lotte Hi-mart, the sales of air conditioners from January to May have shot up by 110 percent over the same period last year. Most number of air conditioners were sold in April, followed by March and May, Lotte said. “We started receiving order reservations from January for those who want installation at home. If you order it now, it will take at least 3 weeks up to 2 months,” said Lotte Mart official.But while some industries are enjoying their heyday, health concerns are rising along with heat-related illnesses.As of this week, a total of 58 heat-related illnesses were reported across the country, according to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security.Separate figure by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that at least 2 in 10 patients suffering from heat-related illnesses developed symptoms while indoors, advising citizens to be careful regardless of where they are during the summer heat wave.Medical experts have long warned that rising global temperatures can impact public health because deadly heat can spread infectious diseases and even lead food shortages. “Most believe that heat-related illnesses occur from being directly in the sun. But the biggest cause is the temperature where one is,” said Park Hee-jin, a professor of family medicine at Severance Hospital.“Dehydration, dizziness and vomiting all occur as our body tries to adjust to the surrounding temperature. It is the most basic step to drink enough water to help the body adjust,” she said.To protect health of citizens outdoor, Seocho-gu district office installed some 50 parasol umbrellas by pedestrian crossings in Seoul so passersby can stop and wait in the shade, providing oases in the desert-like concrete streets. The district office said it planned to install 60 more by end of this month.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it activated the main water fountain in Gwanghwamun Square on April 14 this year, earlier than the normal beginning of operations in May. The capital’s public swimming pools by Han River are slated to open this weekend. Jejudo Island’s four beaches, including Hyeopjae Beach, will open this weekend as well, earlier than usual July opening. By Kim Da-sol","summer changes korean life ,koreans but climate change ,changes korean life closet ,summer changes korean ,korean life closet reorganization","['closet', 'South Koreans', 'South Korea ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50186008  0.47444838

227,227,Discrimination against people with HIV rampant: UN study,"Korean people with HIV still face rampant discrimination, over 30 years since the first case was discovered here, a study released Thursday by UNAIDS has found.According to initial findings from the People Living With HIV Stigma Index in South Korea, 37 percent of respondents reported suicidal thoughts, and a similar proportion had cut themselves off from family and friends.In addition, 71 percent of people with HIV ...","Korean people with HIV still face rampant discrimination, over 30 years since the first case was discovered here, a study released Thursday by UNAIDS has found.According to initial findings from the People Living With HIV Stigma Index in South Korea, 37 percent of respondents reported suicidal thoughts, and a similar proportion had cut themselves off from family and friends.In addition, 71 percent of people with HIV said they had been insulted or threatened because of their status. Although almost all respondents said they were receiving anti-retroviral treatment for HIV, 70 percent said they had still avoided going to a clinic when it was needed.The economic difficulties faced by respondents were also serious. Although most were college educated and around two-thirds were aged between 30 and 50, only 37 percent were employed full-time.Less than 1 in 10 full-time workers had told their employees they had HIV and more than half of respondents said they had quit school or work because of their HIV status.A separate report released by the National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday found 91 percent of people with HIV said they faced discrimination at work and 83 percent were discriminated against at school.Asked about sources of negative attitudes, the UNAIDS report found media to be no better than general internet comments, with both cited by three-quarters as a source of negative views toward people with HIV. Religious groups were cited by 64 percent.Citing a lack of funding and government support, the authors of the report conceded the limitations of the survey due to small sample size, noting particularly that women were not properly represented. Just one woman with HIV was surveyed, partly because only 7.6 percent of people with HIV are women and there is a lack of networks for them. Kwon Mi-ran, a consultant for Korean Network for People living with HIV/AIDS , which conducted the research with UNAIDS’ support, said more research was required into women with HIV, who faced some specific issues. “Women with HIV face serious stigma and the government’s policies have nothing that addresses women with HIV specifically,” she said. “There are no communities for women to share their experiences and support each other and they are isolated.” Kwon said it was more difficult for women to report sexual assault, partly because of the attitudes of people in the legal system toward people with HIV and partly because of a law that criminalizes acts that can spread the virus.Another growing form of discrimination against people with HIV was that nursing homes were refusing to accept them as an increasing number reached old age.“Antiretroviral treatment is widely available in South Korea, and so most people living with HIV can keep their health. But when they need long-term care because of old age or other HIV-related diseases, there is no place they can go,” said Seo Bo-kyung of KNP+.Only 27 percent said they were confident their medical records would be kept private and 17 percent said doctors had disclosed their HIV status to other people without permission.Despite UNAIDS and World Health Organization recommendations to avoid testing without informed consent, the majority of respondents found they had HIV after being tested without their knowledge. The NHRC report also found discrimination in health care, with 26 percent saying treatment had been refused, and a similar number saying their status was indicated on their bedside charts.“Health care settings should be stigma-free environments to ensure people living with HIV not only stay healthy, but their loved ones and community are also protected from HIV,” Steve Kraus, director of the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific, said in a news release accompanying the report. “It is imperative that we have protective laws and empowered communities.”The report recommends consideration of HIV as a disability to bring it under existing discrimination protections, and for a comprehensive discrimination law. It also calls for NGOs to work with the government.The respondents’ most favored policy is public education on HIV, but Seo Bo-kyung of KNP+ stressed that the quality of that education was important. “In many cases, HIV education is conveyed as a means to deliver homophobic messages and tends to describe people living with HIV as pathogens, and not as humans,” he said. “That is the reason that we emphasize a human rights-centered approach.”By Paul Kerry","korean people with hiv ,hiv rampant un study ,people with hiv rampant ,rampant discrimination over 30 ,hiv still face rampant","['korean', 'UNAIDS', 'the People live with HIV Stigma', 'South Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50380802  0.44303775

Only 50 people will pass this round. Following the exam, which will continue until Saturday, there will be no more opportunities to enter the legal profession through written tests that have nurtured more than 20,000 legal professionals -- lawyers, prosecutors and judges -- in South Korea over the past 54 years.A man looks at the timetable and instructions for the state-bar examination at Yonsei University in Seoul on Wednesday. “I feel sorry for myself as it is my last opportunity after all these years of studying,” Kwon Ho, 40, who has been preparing for the bar exam since 2000, told The Korea Herald during a lunch break on campus. Many of the test takers have prepared for the bar exam for years despite its scheduled phasing-out, refusing to be enrolled at costly law schools for three years to qualify as a legal professional. “The reason I chose to continue studying for the exam is it guarantees a fair opportunity for all. The test result is all it takes to be in the legal profession, whereas law schools require more than that,” said Park Seung-wook, 30, who has been preparing for the exam for six years. “Besides, I have no decent educational background nor family support to enroll in the school, anyway.” The bar exam was first introduced in 1963. In South Korea, the state-administered exam has long been a symbol of “fair competition” and a “rags-to-riches” story as a rare chance to climb up the social ladder for anyone regardless of their academic, family and regional backgrounds. Under the system, those who pass the traditional bar exam receive training at the Judicial Research and Training Institute before practicing law as lawyers, prosecutors and judges. “Law schools’ tens of millions of won in tuition fees hinder fair competition among candidates, making it virtually impossible for poor, ordinary citizens to seek legal careers,” said Lee Jong-bae, 39, a representative of bar exam takers.“Even after students graduate from law schools, the name values of their schools affect their future careers and those with powerful parents tend to get more advantages,” Lee claimed. Rep. Oh Sin-hwan of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party last year proposed a bill to maintain the bar exam. It is currently pending at the Assembly.But the prospects of the passage of the bill appear grim. The Constitutional Court ruled in September last year that the abolishment of the bar exam was constitutional. President Moon Jae-in -- who also become a human rights lawyer through the bar exam -- openly expressed his support for its abolishment.A US-style law school system was introduced in 2007 under the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun -- who himself was a human rights lawyer after passing the state bar exam -- to stem prevalent academic elitism in the legal circle. Though the exam was open to anyone regardless of academic background, the exam passers tended to be law students from a few prestigious schools, instigating the creation of school-based cartels. Under the system, 25 law schools were set up with an aim to draw aspiring legal professionals equipped with varying experience and backgrounds and increase the number of lawyers to improve the quality of legal services through competition. Only those attending the law schools are entitled to an attorney-qualifying exam at the end of their three years of study. But the law schools, which cost students on average of about 50 million won for a three-year course, have been accused of being too expensive and lacking transparency and fairness in their admission process.A student representative speaks at a press conference in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday, calling for the government not to abolish the state-run bar exam. Their opponents claim the law schools only benefit the privileged and discriminate against candidates by age, family and academic background when accepting students. Some of the lawmakers and high-profile figures were embroiled in controversies in the past for allegedly pulling strings to help their children secure entry into prestigious law schools. Lee Ho-young, spokesperson for Association of Law School Graduates, refuted the bar exam proponents’ claims that law schools are taking away opportunities from low-income households. “There are more chances for the less privileged to enter the legal sector,” he said. “It would be more costly to prepare for bar exams for years nowadays without financial support from family. The rags-to-riches story is possible at law schools, too. It is the only way to foster competent, experienced lawyers from various backgrounds.”The Education Ministry made it possible in January for the bottom half of the income bracket to have up to 70 percent of their tuition fees covered by scholarships to relieve the financial burden in attending law schools. “But we agree that law schools’ admission process should be reformed and measures should be enforced to get rid of irregularities in the process,” he added. As the controversy persists, bar-exam proponents argue the bar exam should be administered, too, while the law school system is in operation. “I am not saying that the law schools should be abolished. The bar exam should be in operation so that the two-way system can keep one another in balance through competition,” the bar exam takers’ representative Lee said.Rha Seung-chul, a lawyer and former head of Seoul Bar Association, said that there should be a separate exam to screen candidates. “For those who are unable to afford tuition fees at law schools, there should be a separate exam – not necessarily a bar exam – to grant those selected qualifications,” he said. But law school advocates point out it is inefficient and goes against its original purpose of establishing the law school system.By Ock Hyun-ju  and Bak Se-hwan","last state bar exam ,in seoul on wednesday ,exam fades into history ,seoul on wednesday morning ,bar exam fades into","['Yeonsei University', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.15938692  0.5058791

The Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of a Chinese woman who asked the court to cancel the Justice Ministry’s decision not to allow her to become a naturalized Korean citizen. The ruling came after the Justice Ministry disapproved the 47-year-old woman’s application for Korean citizenship last October, citing that she was responsible for the divorce.According to the Nationality Act, foreign residents who have lived in Korea for more than five years can apply for Korean citizenship. Migrant spouses who are unable to meet this condition for reasons they are not responsible for -- such as divorce due to domestic violence -- can still seek to be naturalized if approved by the Justice Ministry. “The plaintiff qualifies to be naturalized as a Korean citizen as she has lived here for more than five years from 2008 to October 2016,” the court said. The Chinese woman stayed in South Korea on a marriage-based F-2-1 visa since November 2008. She married a Korean man in September that year. Her husband subjected her to constant physical abuse, including burning her with a cigarette. She ran away from home and filed for divorce in July 2011, which was finalized in May 2012. She then applied for Korean nationality in 2014. The Justice Ministry turned down the application, saying she was responsible for the divorce because she fled from her home and husband. The ministry also cited that she was not able to make a living for herself here. The court ruled that the ministry “abused” its authority, acknowledging that she could not continue the marriage due to the violence from her husband. It also viewed that she is able to make a living in Korea, given she has paid for insurance coverage since May 2009.By Ock Hyun-ju","woman whose marriage ended ,woman application for korean ,citizenship court migrant woman ,migrant woman whose marriage ,marriage ended in divorce","['korean', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'chinese', 'the Justice Ministry ’s', 'korean', 'the Justice Ministry', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80842435 -0.25104037

She said she started having symptoms the next day. The new infection case comes about two weeks after the health authorities reported a 33-year-old woman as a confirmed Zika virus patient on June 2. She went on a trip to the Maldives.  The authorities said they are examining three others who traveled with the newly infected patient.","virus patient south korean ,virus found in woman ,another zika virus patient ,jeolla province on thursday ,zika virus patient south","['south korean', 'Zika', 'Thailand', 'South Korea', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4315587   0.50950247

There are signs that Koreans are beginning to take vegetarianism more seriously, as they are increasingly exposed to reports of the destructive impact that meat consumption can have on their health, on animals and on the planet. “When I was young, I wondered why human beings destroy the environment when trees, mountains and other animals do not and why human beings survive at the expense of animals’ lives and suffering,” a 26-year-old office worker Hong Seung-yon said. “I felt guilty and depressed every time I ate meat.” Hong became vegetarian in 1999. At first, she could not stop thinking about the taste of meat. She gradually converted herself to lifelong veganism -- a way of living that eliminates all forms of animal consumption. “In the first year of becoming vegetarian, I still ate chicken and fish. I then quit red meat four months later. After six months, I didn’t crave meat anymore.”Hong is one of a growing number of people pursuing a vegetarian lifestyle here.Although there is no official record available, the Korean Vegetarian Union estimates the number of vegetarians to be up to 1.5 million here, accounting for about 3 percent of the entire population. The number of vegetarian establishments hovers at around 350. To protect the environment and fight against factory farming, many of these individuals choose to go meat-free, ranging from vegans -- who do not eat eggs, dairy products or meat -- to ovo-lacto vegetarians, who do not eat meat, but consume eggs and dairy products.It is no secret that animals suffer in the industrial farming system, and livestock farming is considered a major factor in deforestation and carbon emissions. Others go vegetarian for health benefits or based on religious or personal beliefs.A 20-year-old student who wanted to be identified only as Diol said he refuses to eat meat because he knows what it is like to be discriminated against as a sexual minority. Going vegan is his way of standing in solidarity with another group of voiceless minorities -- animals.“There are things people cannot know or see unless they make an effort,” said Diol, who has been on a strict vegan diet for four years. “It is a privilege that the majority don’t have to care. So I started to care .”The beginning of the vegetarian movement goes back to early 2000s, vegan activists here said.“With the advent of the internet in the early 2000s, people started to share information about vegetarianism online. Foreign books on going meat-free began to be translated into Korean, too, at the time,” said Lee Won-bok, head of the Korea Vegetarian Union. Lee, who has been a vegan for 30 years ago, has founded the Vegetarian Union -- a platform to share tips on leading a vegan lifestyle -- with its number of members at around 25,000 now. “I can clearly see that Koreans are steadily taking interest in being vegetarian, especially those in their 20s and 30s,” he said. “Back in 2000, few people knew what being a vegetarian meant. Now, there is a more positive perception of vegetarianism. There are more restaurants, books and products catering to vegetarians, too.”But the growing awareness is also accompanied by persistent debate over the healthfulness of shunning meat, the “conventional” source of protein.Those against vegetarianism argue that meat is a natural source of iron, zinc and selenium, Vitamin A, B and D and the balanced diet is crucial for one’s body in carrying out metabolic functions.  Lee Do-kyung, a vegan chef, meanwhile, denies the claims, saying there are plenty of plant-based protein sources such as beans. Vegetarians instead point to studies that suggest consumption of meat – especially red meat – puts people at a higher risk of developing diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The World Health Organization classifies diets high in processed meat and red meat as carcinogenic and “probably carcinogenic,” respectively.Lee, who has cooked and developed vegan food for the past 20 years, also pointed out that Korean dishes were originally vegetarian-friendly.“With the nation’s long history of farming, Korean dishes are usually based on vegetables. It has been only a few decades since Koreans began to eat meat following the nation’s rapid economic development in the 1970s and 1980s,” he said.  “For Korean dishes, there is no need for meat. There is plenty of room to develop vegan Korean food,” he said. “Kimchi tastes even better without the usual fish sauce.”In a reflection of Koreans’ growing interest in the vegetarian diet, vegan cafes and restaurants are swarming with Korean customers. “When we opened the cafe in April last year, about 8 in 10 customers were foreigners. Now, I can see a lot more Korean customers than before,” said Kang So-yang, head of vegan cafe Dalnayang in northern Seoul. In the past, Kang had struggled to stick to her vegan lifestyle due to a lack of food joints for those on a strict vegan diet. She ended up opening her own. “I wanted to make it a place where like-mined people come together, eat good food and share their vegan values,” she said. “That’s the way the vegan movement can go on for long.”  Still, being a vegetarian here is not easy. Vegetarians struggle every day to find food options outside their homes and fight prejudice that they are undernourished or peculiar. “It is still difficult to find restaurants offering strict vegan dishes outside. Away from Seoul, there is even less infrastructure for vegetarians,” the office worker Hong said. “Koreans tend to hate me for behaving in a different way and scold me for pursuing an unhealthy diet. They ask me, ‘Would that be enough?’” “But now, I feel less tired and less sick. I cannot return to my old meaty diet,” she said. “I just hope society becomes more embracing of different lifestyles and choices.” By Ock Hyun-ju","vegetarianism more seriously ,meat free in south ,destructive impact that meat ,are vegetarian ,vegetarianism more seriously as","['South Korea', 'Koreans']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47851911  0.87893349

In 2019, the figure is expected to fall to 21.91 million. By 2021, the number will be down to 21.7 million.The number of pensioners, on the other hand, is forecast to increase from 4.78 million in 2018 to 6.07 million in 2021.NPS’ data is based upon the Statistics Korea’s projection on the economically active population here. The total number of Koreans aged 15-64 will start decreasing this year to account for just 47.0 percent of the total population by 2065. In 2015, it took up 73.4 percent. Decreased membership means a drop in the rate at which the fund’s revenues increase, according to the data. The rate is expected to stand at 3.45 percent in 2018 and to fall to 2.79 percent in 2021.“The projections reveal that amid a decrease in the number of the working population and low birth rate, the fund would run out much faster than  expected,” NPS’s public relations director Yoon Young-seok told The Korea Herald.The total fertility rate, or the number of children born per woman, remained at 1.25 last year, the lowest among the 35 member countries of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, according to the CIA’s World Factbook.The pension fund, managed by the NPS, meanwhile, is expected to grow in size from 600 trillion won at the end of 2017 to 789 trillion won in 2021, thanks to increased premiums to be collected as workers receive more salaries in line with the inflation rate.By Bak Se-hwan","pension scheme will peak ,will peak next year ,93 million next year ,to peak next year ,peak next year and",['National Pension Service'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5405978   0.08280513

Equipped with a Sony digital camera, the drone reportedly had more than 250 pictures, mostly of forest and villages. The pictures of Seongju were clear enough to make out two THAAD launchers and its radar installed, the official added.The incident could be a staged show with the deliberate intention to provoke the allies, rather than a real spy activity, the JCS official said, adding that the drone appears to be lacking the technology to transmit the imagery back to the North. “We are trying to figure out whether the North intended to provoke  as it did in 2014,” said the official, adding that the military is currently trying to find out whether there are additional drones sent from the North. North Korea has flown spy drones before. In 2014, one of them was found to have spied on the presidential residence of Cheong Wa Dae. At that time, the South Korean defense ministry concluded that the drone did not pose “a direct threat” to national security. Nevertheless, the military has ramped up vigilance against North Korean spying activities, establishing what they call an “integrated system” between the Army and the Air Force to detect and intercept the drones. But there are still challenges to exactly locate and intercept small-size drones with current surveillance and anti-missile capability, particularly in the border region where battle area is spread out across the Military Demarcation Line, the official added. “Given that the border region is so broad, it takes time to develop advanced radars and anti-air artilleries fit for the region,” said another JCS official. “We have forward-deployed some anti-missile assets. Although there is a challenge, we did our best.”The drone, discovered last week, is thought to have traveled more than 500 kilometers before crashing down on a mountain near Injae, Gangwon Provicne. The THAAD battery in Seongju is located about 270 kilometers from the crash site. The device is bigger than the one that the South has recovered in 2014, the JCS said. It also employs a twin engine, not a single engine used by the previous model, the military added.By Yeo Jun-suk","korean drone spied ,korean drone spied on ,korean drone was found ,purported north korean drone ,north korean drone","['north korean', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Seoul', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.48605201  0.48151231

According to a survey conducted on 1,004 adults by Gallup Korea, 34 percent of the respondents supported same-sex marriages, while 58 percent of them opposed it. Some 8 percent reserved their answers. The findings showed a huge generational gap on the issue: The older they were the more likely they were to hold a negative view.A majority of 20-something people, or 66 percent, were in favor of legalizing the same-sex union, while 52 percent of those in their 30s opposed it. The percentage of people holding a negative view stood at 54 percent for the 40-49 age group, 70 percent for the 50-59 group and 76 percent among those over 60. The proportion of Koreans in favor of same-sex marriage stood at 35 percent in 2014 and 17 percent in 2001, the pollster said. Nearly 6 in 10 people  responded that homosexuality was a type of love, while 35 percent disagreed. Some 28 percent said that sexual minorities were born that way, while 49 percent said that their sexual identities were affected by their upbringing or social environment.A majority of Koreans, whether or not they were positive toward homosexuality, advocated equal opportunities for sexual minorities.Ninety percent of those surveyed said sexual minorities should be given the same job opportunities and 81 percent said dismissal due to sexual orientation is wrong. The poll, conducted between May 30 and June 1, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. While homosexuality is not banned in South Korea, LGBT people -- lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender -- live largely on the fringes of society, as the majority of Koreans remain either indifferent to or intolerant of homosexuality.President Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer, also said that he is against the legalization of same-sex marriage on the presidential election campaign trail, though he also said he opposed any kind of discrimination against sexual minorities. Last month, the military court sentenced a gay soldier to six months in jail, suspended for a year, for having consensual sex with a same-sex soldier in a private place, on charges of violating the Military Criminal Act. The act outlaws sodomy or other “disgraceful acts” in the armed forces, regardless of whether there was mutual consent, and carries a jail term of up to two years.By Ock Hyun-ju","koreans oppose same sex ,in 10 koreans oppose ,10 koreans oppose same ,10 koreans oppose ,oppose same sex marriage","['South Koreans', 'Gallup Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51518077  0.3760874

The government must devise fundamental measures,” Rep. Lee Kai-ho, a member of President Moon Jae-in‘s de facto transition team, said during a briefing by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. The ministry said it would look further into the sudden outbreak of the H5N8 virus strain, believed to be less likely in the warm season so far, while continuing carry out culls to curb its spread.Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-woo holds a video conference from his office in Sejong, south of Seoul, on June 7, 2017, with provincial chiefs to discuss joint efforts to contain avian influenza. The bird flu alert was raised to the highest level after the virus was found to be of a highly pathogenic strain of H5N8 that has high death rates. All transportation of live poultry was halted for 24 hours on Wednesday, while small-scale farms with less than 100 livestock were recommended to carry out a cull. Approximately 176,100 chickens and ducks on 66 different farms had been slaughtered as of Wednesday, with the number expected to rise. The first report of the outbreak came Friday, from an owner of a small backyard chicken farm on the southern island of Jeju after his birds died from the disease. All domesticated birds living within 500 meters of the Jeju farm were culled within 24 hours of the first report, and shipments of poultry on and off the island were immediately halted. Amid the ongoing investigation, authorities suspect some infected farms of deliberately delaying reports of the disease and vowed an in-depth investigation into the matter. Min Yeon-tae, head of the Agriculture Ministry’s livestock policy bureau said in a press briefing Wednesday that this year’s sudden outbreak is believed to be largely due to a group of farmers’ efforts to conceal the outbreak. “The nature of these poultry farms are more like distributors, which is why we suspect the possibility of delayed reports out of fear of financial loss,” said Min. The ministry unveiled plans to strengthen punishments for farm owners who delay reports related to livestock diseases or deliberately ignore signs of an outbreak. The current law allows them to be sentenced to up to one year in jail or a fine of 10 million won , but the revised law aims to increase these maximums to 3 years in jail or a 30 million won fine. Concerns over a lack of relevant agricultural knowledge among small-scale farm owners have also been raised. Unauthorized “hobby farms” on 10-square-meters of land or less, which were not subject to government surveillance are now obligated to register with the government. A special quarantine unit will be formed to inspect the trade of poultry and sanitation of bird houses. Close watch over the illegal slaughtering of birds in traditional markets will be initiated and more hygienic packaging methods will be suggested to the vendors. According to government reports, outbreak is thought to have started in a group of birds at a farm in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, which were later shipped to areas including Paju, Gyeonggi Province, and Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province. The Agriculture Ministry suspects the signs showed up in early May based on a retrospective analysis. The outbreak this year follows one of the worst-ever bird flu outbreaks last year, which resulted in the demise of a fifth of the total poultry population here. President Moon Jae-in pledged not to repeat the sluggish reaction shown by the previous government by encouraging authorities to take strong preventive measures and instructing Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon to keep tabs on the issue.By Jung Min-kyung","highly pathogenic avian influenza ,korea on wednesday raising ,pathogenic avian influenza virus ,pathogenic avian influenza ,influenza virus is becoming","['South Korea', 'Lee Kai - ho', 'Moon Jae - in‘s de']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39482185  0.87322021

These everyday heroes, however, have long been among the groups most neglected by policymakers in South Korea. Career firefighters, despite facing life-threatening dangers in the line of duty, have suffered a chronic shortage of manpower, budget and, perhaps most importantly, a collective sense of being valued. But finally, a change may be coming. Firefighters try to put out a fire in a building in central Seoul. President Moon Jae-in, who during his election campaign vowed to empower and improve working conditions of them, is seeking to establish an independent agency for the national and provincial fire service. It is currently under the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. Simultaneously, the new administration is seeking to hire 1,500 new firefighters this year, along with policemen, teachers and social workers. “It is heartening,” a firefighter stationed in Seoul told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. “We’re hoping for a greater role and greater autonomy,” he added. Both plans require parliamentary approval, as they are included in the broader reorganization of the government and a project for 15,000 new jobs envisioned to be bankrolled by a supplementary budget. The public, as well as many parliamentarians, appear to be in support of better treatment, at least, of the country’s firefighters. A legislative bill, currently pending at the National Assembly, is also brightening the mood in firehouses. Billed by the ruling Democratic Party of Korea lawmakers as “a law that would wipe away the tears of firefighters,” the proposal intends to take in all firefighters as central government employees, such that any spending on them, including salaries and safety gear purchases, comes from central fiscal coffers, not local coffers that vary greatly. That firefighters are not hired by the state itself is linked to many difficulties they are facing now, according to Kong Ha-sung, professor of the Department of Fire Safety at Kyungil University.“Even if the Ministry  sets the guideline for new recruits, that doesn’t materialize in cash-short cities and provinces because it is ultimately the rural authorities that pay their salaries,” he explained. “Changing the employment status of firemen is not about their working conditions. It is about ensuring the country’s fire service is equal and  across the country,” he stressed. As of December last year, South Korea, a country of 51 million, had 43,510 firefighters. Of them just about 1 percent were employed by the central government. The data also reveals that South Korea has a far lower firefighter-to-citizen ratio than comparable countries: One full-time firefighter is in charge of the safety of some 1,200 citizens here, compared to 1,075 in the United States and 820 in Japan. The fatality rate, according to data from 2011, is much higher for South Korean firefighters as well, with 1.85 deaths per 10,000 on duty, while the figures for US and Japan stood at 1.01 and 0.7, respectively. In some areas where the rural government’s fiscal condition is in bad shape, firefighters are replacing worn-out fire-proof gloves and boots with privately purchased gear, an online post purportedly by a firefighter’s wife claimed in 2014. But alleviating the chronic manpower and budget shortages are only basic tasks. There is more that needs to be done to better protect them, critics have pointed out. The lack of medical support to address work-related injuries and symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder, is a crucial but still neglected issue, they said.According to a survey released by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, 43.2 percent of 8,256 firefighters stationed nationwide said they have sleep disorders. Some 25 percent complained of hearing difficulties, while 19.4 percent said they had experienced depression and anxiety disorders. Professor Kong also backed these findings. “Individual firefighters’ medical data and history are to be reported to superiors. That discourages many firefighters from seeking professional help ,” he stressed.By Bak Se-hwan","korea career firefighters despite ,most neglected by policymakers ,south korea career firefighters ,firefighters despite facing life ,korea career firefighters",['South Korea'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66730154  0.58579928

He was immediately taken to a hospital and a 119 rescue team performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but he was soon pronounced dead.Police found about 120 capsules of nitrous oxide, balloons and rubber tubes at the scene. Seventeen of the capsules had signs of being used.The National Forensic Service concluded that the cause of death could not be identified. But it said that there was a possibility that the man died from overuse of nitrous oxide. Balloons filled with nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, have grown more popular nationwide, especially in entertainment districts and college towns here, as they are sold at a relatively low price of around 5,000 won .Nitrous oxide can be used as an anesthetic in hospitals and in the production of whipped cream. When inhaled, it allows the user to feel euphoria for about 20 seconds and to become insensitive to pain. It may cause hysteria, damage to the brain and nerve cells, and even death in severe cases when large amounts are ingested. The incident in April was the first death in the country caused by laughing gas. “Although there are no accurate statistics, I’ve never seen this type of accident before,” a police official said.Currently, there are no regulations on nonmedical uses of happy balloons here, as they are not classified as drugs or a psychotomimetic agent. “We are reviewing the measures on nitrous oxide, as it is being used for other purposes than producing whipped cream,” said an official at the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.The US and UK strictly ban the use of nitrous oxide except for specific permitted purposes, such as for medical reasons, as many have died from inhaling the gas in the past 10 years.By Byun Hee-jin","man died from inhaling ,man dies after inhaling ,old man died from ,year old man died ,man died from","['South Koreans', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69576561  0.30344763

This provided photo, taken on Feb. 24, 2014, shows flowers placed in front of a photo of Hyunsoo O'Callaghan, a South Korean adoptee, in Seoul as people pay tribute to the boy who was killed by his American adoptive father. Hyunsoo O'Callaghan, born in South Korea in 2010, was killed by his adoptive father Brian O'Callaghan, in 2014, just four months after he was adopted, a National Security Agency worker.The statue depicting a boy holding a butterfly is a replica of the same sculpture installed in April this year at the Daniel School, a school and orphanage for children with disabilities, in southern Seoul. Thomas Park Clement, a sculptor and a Korean-American adoptee, and his wife Kim Won-sook made the matching sculptures.On the website, the US school said the two schools ""share a meaningful connection through their work of providing special education programming for children with disabilities. To mark this new partnership, both schools received a donation of matching sculptures"" from the couple.As a result of plea-bargaining over a trial process that had stretched for more than two years, O'Callaghan pled guilty to first-degree murder and child abuse for the death of his own son in exchange for having his first-degree murder dismissed. He is now serving a jail term of 12 years.","dedicate statue next week ,south korean boy murdered ,school premises on june ,korean boy murdered ,korean boy murdered by","['NEW YORK', 'US', 'south korean', 'american', 'the Linwood Center', 'Howard County', 'US', 'Maryland', 'Hyunsu', 'Butterfly']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45919862  0.52494448

According to the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, in one fourth of the 9,853 reported cases, victims died. Of the total, 2,467 were recognized by the Environment Ministry to have asbestos-related diseases. About 40 percent or 1,006 of the victims have died mostly due to lung-related diseases.Asbestos is defined as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization, as exposure to worn out asbestos materials can cause diseases such as lung cancers and mesothelioma. Asbestos was widely used in the 1970s here to build slate roofs, interior materials, soundproof walls and insulators at low costs.Despite the ban on its use for construction material, there are still a large number of buildings that contain asbestos in the country, posing health threats to citizens amid the frequent redevelopment and reconstruction of such buildings, the report said. Yonhap.Also, the total number of 5,615 victims, including infants, pregnant women and elderly, have filed damage reports to the government as of May for having suffered from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant.About 21 percent, or 1,195, of them have died since August 2011 when the government officially confirmed the link between the health damages of victims and the toxic substances widely used to sterilize humidifiers here until six years ago, the report said. A recent state-led survey estimated that at least 3.5 to 4 million Koreans had been exposed to the toxic humidifier disinfectant.The report also mentioned that 1,763 victims who live around 11 cement factories across the nation and reported their lung-related sickness since 2007 were turned out to having suffered either lung cancer, pneumoconiosis or ventilatory failure.Eight others who reported their difficulty of breathing to the National Institute of Environmental Research were residents living near a briquette manufacturer in southern city of Daegu, the report said. Choi Ye-yong, head of the ACCEH and publisher of the report said that large number of victims from toxic humidifier disinfectant as well as asbestos-related diseases are still suffering other long-term health illnesses and underlying diseases. “While the most common environmental diseases were both lung-related and closely linked to inhaling the polluted air, the government should come up with stronger measures to provide practical damage treatment, not only tallying up the damage figures,” Choi told The Korea Herald. An independent investigative body to manage the damage reports and provide medical treatment based on law should be established to control the number of victims suffering from disease caused by exposure to toxic chemical products or environmental factors, Choi added.","10 000 koreans suffered ,000 koreans suffered environmental ,10 000 south koreans ,almost 10 000 koreans ,diseases in 10 yrs","['South Koreans', 'the Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health', 'the Environment Ministry']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.61651433  0.61242104

Some of the birds died off suddenly, which caused quarantine officials to check the farm.The ministry is set to conduct a more comprehensive probe while culling all birds at the infected farm as well as restricting movement in the area to contain further outbreaks.Up till Sunday, poultry from Gunsan was sold to Busan, Jeju, Paju and Yangsan. The government is currently seeking to find out if birds originating from the city had been shipped to other regions as well.Park Bong-kyun, the quarantine chief of the ministry, later pinpointed the southern city of Jeongeup as the origin of the avian influenza's breakout. The virus is believed to have affected Gunsan when chickens sold to a Jeongeup farm were recalled after some of them died, the official said. Reports of dead chickens from Gunsan farm skyrocketed following the recall, he said.Another official from the ministry said it has confirmed the major destinations of the chickens sold from Gunsan, but will still take more time to locate all the buyers. South Korea's southern resort island of Jeju also said earlier in the day that it culled some 10,000 chickens and ducks amid concerns over the spread of avian influenza.Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo highlighted efforts to prevent further spread of the flu.""At this stage, the most important thing is to prevent the avian influenza from proliferation,"" Kim said in a meeting of officials in Jeju Island. He instructed officials to inform chicken farm owners of the importance of speedy reports of suspicious cases of the flu.","650 korean ogol chickens ,ogol chickens last month ,pathogenic avian flu confirmed ,tests on poultry farm ,farm with 000 birds","['SEOUL / JEJU island', ""South Korea 's"", 'Busan', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'Korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51572084  0.73568463

North Koreans rest at the Central Zoo in Pyongyang on April 16, 2017, in this photo released by Europe's news photo agency EPA.

When Kwon Ji-hyun, a 36-year-old working mom, decided to bear it and relocate to an unheard-of village in west Seoul four years ago, there was only one thing on her mind: a daycare center where her child can be in good hands.""I was at a loss for what to do when my mother said she had to move out of town. She was of great help in taking care of my son,"" she said, asking for an alias to be used.She couldn't find anyone to help her care for the baby who was just four years old at the time. All child care centers were booked up and she was so desperate.While searching the Internet for days, Kwon stumbled upon a child care center with one opening located in a village called Sungmisan. As soon as she heard that her baby was accepted, she didn't hesitate at all to move. South Korea`s first ""shared"" child care center The child care center might seem to be no different from others but it is the country's first ""shared"" child care facility where parents are actively engaging in caring for and educating their kids, not to mention its management.In 1994, a few young couples pooled their money and launched this child care center here in a bid to help each other in caring for babies and actively getting involved in ensuring transparency and getting more access to food, education and so on.In pursuit of alternative child care and more involvement in raising their kids, more young couples moved in, naturally turning the neighborhood into what is now commonly known as Sungmisan Village.Building on the initial child care infrastructure, Sungmisan residents -- estimated at around 1,000 in 2015 -- are now jointly running around 70 community activities ranging from a school, cafe, small theater, and food cooperative to small stores tailored to meet their own needs.Through such joint activities, many meet quite often to have drinks over their kids and daily life which brings them closer to the level of first-name friends. An annual festival, group learning classes, and info and news bulletin boards are also making their friendship and community more closely knit. Food cooperative  and community cafe ""Joining in activities at the child care center, I have made many friends, though most of them are older than me. We talk about kids, how to raise and educate them and sometimes share our views on our daily life and jobs,"" Kwon said.""We have gotten close enough to leave our children with those living next door in times of emergency, which you cannot begin to expect while living in a big city like Seoul,"" she added.Sungmisan Village, named after a small mountain in the region and located in Mapo-gu, west Seoul, has emerged as a rare but vibrant urban community steadily growing and getting attention from people fed up with typical life in a large city like Seoul.Seoul, home to around 10 million people, has turned into a megacity teeming with high-rise apartments and buildings over the past few decades.Long gone in the process are the close-knit communities and friendly neighbors, and even casual greetings with those living just next door have become few and far between. Bulletin boards in which villagers share community news Sungmisan has been attracting people especially nostalgic about the ""good old days"" where many things were shared among neighbors, including food and worries about their daily life, jobs and family issues. Such nostalgia and longing to return to those days was stirred recently by a popular cable TV drama ""Reply 1988,"" which featured the daily life of friendly neighbors in a cohesive village in the 1980s. Still, child care and education are the top reasons for many opting to settle in Sungmisan Village.Kong Byung-gak in his late 40s was one who came to the village for education. He sent his two children to an alternative school launched in the early 2000s here, which focuses less on textbooks and rote learning and more on hands-on and ecological experiences. ""It was like an escape from education that makes our kids unhappy. I couldn't have my kids get education solely focused on college entrances,"" Kong said.He now leads a de facto community operation council where major decisions in the village are discussed and made. He recently opened a beer shop that serves as a meeting place for the council and other neighbors. ""This is a place where people get together and chit-chat. Sometimes, a party is held on the spur of the moment. This is fun and we like this small happiness,"" he said. ""You can experience what was featured in such dramas as 'Reply 1988.'"" Sungmisan map There was a crisis that put the fate of the village in jeopardy.When the Seoul government pushed to build a new water distribution system in the Sungmisan region in the early 2000s, its residents staged a strong protest and campaign against it. The movement went on for about two years and the city project was withdrawn.The worst, however, could be yet to come. One of the potential threats is the steadily rising rent of buildings and houses in the region partly buoyed by brisk development and hot spots springing up in neighboring regions such as Mangwon, Hongdae and Seogyo.""Ironically, as we are getting more attention, the rent is rising due to hot spots springing up in nearby regions. This is forcing some of our landmark stores out of the market,"" Kong said.""People say that we can buy happiness with money, but that belief, I think, is destroying human relationships and making them unhappy. I think that enjoying happiness through relationships with people, albeit small, is genuine happiness,"" he noted.","year old working mom ,community in seoul moving ,in seoul moving into ,seoul moving into town ,old working mom decided","['Kwon Ji - hyun', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -1.28269958  0.56011826

The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules. Patrol aircraft from India, Germany and Japan were also searching the area, the Foreign Ministry said.  The Navy`s 4,400-ton destroyer Daejoyoung carrying the 24th batch of the 300-strong Cheonghae Unit departs its Fleet Command in Busan on May 2 for the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia for its mission. South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered related government agencies and the military to ""invest full efforts into the rescue operations, while putting the protection of lives first,"" the ministry said.  The fishing vessel that went out of contact was registered in Mongolia and owned by an ethnic Korean businessman living in South Africa. The vessel's captain, chief engineer and boatswain were South Korean nationals, the Foreign Ministry said.  Crews from South Korean fishing vessels and cargo ships have often been targets of Somali pirates.  Recent weeks have seen a resurgence of piracy off Somalia's coast after five years of inactivity. The piracy was once a serious threat to the global shipping industry but lessened in recent years after an international effort to patrol off the coast.  Some Somali fishermen, including former pirates, say foreign ships illegally fishing in local waters are forcing them to return to piracy to make money.  The 300-member Cheonghae Unit, led by a 4,400-ton destroyer, has been taking part in anti-piracy operations in the Horn of Africa since 2009.  In 2011, sailors and marines from the same unit raided a South Korean-operated cargo ship that had been hijacked by Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea, rescuing all 21 crew members and killing eight pirates and capturing five others. The five captured pirates were taken to South Korea and received long prison terms.","indonesians catching squid lost ,pirates presumably hijacked fishing ,koreans hijacked off somali ,18 indonesians catching squid ,hijacked fishing vessel officials","[""South Korea 's"", 'Somalia', 'South Koreans', 'Indonesians', 'Seoul', 'Foreign Ministry', ""South Korea 's""]",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29179269  0.29463506

It’s not because society has become more caring and does not produce them anymore. “It is more that a serial of murders are prevented from the beginning. A murderer would be caught before they killed again,” said Kwon Il-yong, the nation’s first criminal profiler who recently retired. But South Korea has in the past had some notorious serial killers. Kwon explained that these “monsters” were born from suppressed anger. “Everybody reacts differently in a situation. A monster is born when a person’s genetic factors meet with a bad environment,” Kwon said. “Serial killers have a skewed self-regard and sense of superiority as they take people’s lives.”The Korea Herald looked into some of the nation’s infamous serial killers. Kim Dae-doo  Kim Dae-doo can be described as the nation’s first known serial killer. For 55 days from August to October in 1975, Kim murdered 17 citizens including elders and an infant. He was Korea’s most prolific serial killer until Yoo Young-chul broke the record it in 2004. As an ex-convict, Kim came out of jail and tried to get a job but was “treated coldly.” His hostility toward society reached its peak and he killed random citizens, regardless of their gender and age. “Everyone, even my family, treated me coldly after I was released from jail. I wanted to earn money just like the others,” he had confessed. “I killed adults because they would remember my face and a child because the crying sound was annoying.”A laundryman reported him to the police after receiving Kim’s bloody jeans and upon his arrest, the then 26-year-old meekly admitted his crimes. During an on-the-spot inspection of the crime scene, he was seen smiling and chewing a gum. Before he was executed in December 1976, he is said to have repented for his sins. “I am regretful of my sins. I hope society changes to embrace ex-convicts.”Yoo Young-chulYoo Young-chul murdered 20 people across Seoul from 2003 to 2004 and said after being caught that he would have killed a hundred more if he had not been nabbed. His killing spree began when he broke into the house of a university professor to kill him and his wife in January 2003. Harboring enmity toward wealthy people, he planned his crime meticulously.After being rejected by an escort girl, his targets switched from rich senior citizens to prostitutes and women. His hatred against women began after he was divorced in 2002. In a media interview after he was caught, he said he hoped the case would serve as a lesson to women and rich people.“Women should not be sluts and the rich should know what they have done.”As the police investigation expanded into a series of murders Yoo committed against the elderly, with most of them bludgeoned to death with a self-made hammer, he changed his killing method. Yoo was merciless and vicious in his demeanor, dismembering and mutilating the bodies. He also confessed that he ate the organs of his victims. He received the death sentence in 2005 and is currently in jail. Korea has effectively abolished the death penalty as it has not proceeded with executions since 1997. During sentencing, Yoo said he felt sorry for his victims, but would kill a hundred more if he was released.While in jail he sent letters to a reporter who later published them. There, he confessed that the most fearsome moment was when his 4-year-old son made a phone call while he was mutilating a body.“The scariest moment was not when a decapitated head fell off from a hanger or when a headless body came running to me. It was when my son called to ask if I still have a cold,” it read. A movie, “The Chaser,” that reflected his story, was a box office hit in 2008. Jeong Nam-gyuWhile many criminals come from deprived backgrounds, Jeong Nam-gyu was an outcast for a different reason. Jeong had confessed that he was molested by a man when he was 10 and was ostracized for most of his teen years. From 2004 to April 2006, he killed 15 people and wounded 19. As if to take revenge, he first killed two elementary school boys after sexually assaulting them. Jeong had always hated rich men for having what he does not, he told the police then. His targets, however, were always those who were physically weaker than him -- minors and women. He meticulously planned a “perfect crime” to not leave traces behind. Police explained that Jeong had run 10 kilometers every two days to develop physical strength and avoid being chased. He mainly used a knife to kill people, but changed to blunt weapons out of fear that using a consistent method would help police catch him.In his first attempt to kill an adult man in a house in 2006, he was caught as the victim and his father fought back.During his trial, he testified that he was not sorry to the victims and that he was proud to have killed so many people. “I am unlucky to have been arrested. If I had not be caught, I would kill more,” he said. Jeong was sentenced to death in 2007 and hung himself in his cell two years later with a rope he made by tying plastic bags together. The Jijon clique There was a crime group that systematically murdered people as well.Kim Ki-hwan, 25 at the time, organized the group dubbed the “Jijon clique” in July, 1993. All in their 20s, they had hated the rich and decided to “act out.” Their first target was a 23-year-old factory worker, who they raped and killed in 1994. They also set up a makeshift jail and incineration facility in a basement of the leader’s house in South Jeolla Province.While it all started from their frustration against the rich and the economic polarization in society, their targeted victims were not always wealthy. One of the five people they killed was also one of their members, Song Bong-eun, who tried to secede from the group. In September, 1994, they kidnapped four people and killed three of them in the most brutal ways. One victim, after being tortured, escaped to report the gang to the police. The six members were finally caught and were executed in November the same year. In their testimony, one of the members revealed that they had practiced cannibalism, because they “gave up on being human.”By Jo He-rim","most notorious serial killers ,korea most notorious serial ,killers nowadays serial killers ,some notorious serial killer ,notorious serial killers nowadays","['Kwon Il - yong', 'South Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75359929  0.99333012

The Seoul-based Korean Sharing Movement submitted a request to the Unification Ministry early this month to make contact with North Korean officials to carry out preventive activities against malaria. The approval was made for the first time since Jan. 6, 2016, when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test which brought virtually all inter-Korean exchanges to a standstill. “The government’s position is that we will sternly respond to North Korea’s provocations, but the current severance of inter-Korean relations is undesirable in light of stability on the peninsula,” deputy ministry spokesperson Lee Eugene said at a news briefing. “In this regard, we plan to flexibly contemplate humanitarian aid and other private exchanges within the extent that does not undermine international sanctions.” South Korean individuals and entities are required to obtain the ministry’s approval to visit the North or communicate with its nationals. With many North Koreans exposed to malnutrition, infectious diseases and adverse living conditions, civic groups at home and abroad have been carrying out relief programs. But humanitarian relief has become a source of debate in line with Pyongyang’s unbridled military provocations, as critics say the communist state may siphon off any outside handouts for military and other unintended uses. The former Park Geun-hye administration also took flak for its about-face in its own principle that humanitarian assistance should carry on regardless of political ups and downs. Friday’s decision may signal a reinstatement of the government’s long-held humanitarian principles. Foreign Minister nominee Kang Kyung-wha, who served in various human rights-related posts at the UN, also said Thursday that humanitarian aid should be provided apart from political consideration, calling it a “universal value of mankind.”Last year, the government gave the green light only to Eugene Bell Foundation Korea, an international organization that specializes in providing tuberculosis medication to the impoverished country. The KSM said it will discuss the shipment of malaria prevention goods with its North Korean counterparts via fax and email. Together with Gyeonggi Province, the group has since 2008 been undertaking joint prevention projects with North Korean authorities, dishing out fumigator trucks, diagnostic kits, mosquito nets, drugs and other supplies. If the work proceeds smoothly, it plans to dispatch officials in mid-June to the North, including Rep. Won Hye-young of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea who co-heads the group, according to its Secretary-General Kang Young-sik. “Malaria prevention is a project that’s necessary for both Koreas, because disease and insect pests come and go across the border, so the work should be done in the North to ensure no one contracts malaria in the border areas in the South,” Kang told The Korea Herald. According to Gyeonggi Province, the number of malaria patients in border regions here sharply dropped from 1,616 in 2007 to 339 in 2013. Kang says the joint efforts played a “decisive role.” Since the program’s halt in 2013, the figures have surged again, reaching 458 in 2014, 545 in 2015 and 492 in 2016. “We’ve been unable to carry out the activity for the past four years, and if this vacuum continues for a few more years, the figures would skyrocket again in both the North and South,” Kang said, adding the goods should be shipped no later than May or June, given higher risks of malaria in summer.

It’s not because the society has become more caring and does not produce them anymore. “It is more that serial of murders are prevented from the beginning. A murderer would be caught before they killed again,” said Kwon Il-yong, the nation’s first criminal profiler who recently retired. But South Korea has in the past had some notorious serial killers. Kwon explained that these “monsters” are born from suppressed anger. “Everybody reacts differently in a situation. A monster is born when a person’s genetic factors meet with a bad environment,” Kwon said. “Serial killers have a skewed self-regard and sense of superiority as they take people’s lives.”The Korea Herald looked into some of the nation’s infamous serial killers who have once gripped the nation.Kim Dae-doo Kim Dae-dooKim Dae-doo can be described as the nation’s first known serial killer. For 55 days from August to October in 1975, Kim murdered 17 citizens including elders and an infant. He was Korea’s most prolific serial killer until Yoo Young-chul broke it in 2004. As an ex-convict, Kim came out of jail and tried to get a job but was “treated coldly.” His hostility toward society reached its peak and he killed random citizens, regardless of their genders and ages. “Everyone, even my family, treated me coldly after I was released from jail. I wanted to earn money just like the others,” he had confessed. “I killed adults because they would remember my face and a child because the crying sound was annoying.”A laundryman reported him to police after receiving Kim’s bloody jeans and upon his arrest, the then 26-year-old meekly admitted his crimes. During an on-the-spot inspection of the crime scene, he was seen smiling and chewing a gum. Before he was executed in December 1976, he is said to have repented for his sins. “I am regretful of my sins. I hope the society changes to embrace ex-convicts.”Yoo Young-chulYoo Young-chul murdered 20 people across Seoul from 2003 to 2004 and said after being caught that he would have killed a hundred more if he wasn’t. His killing spree began as he broke into the house of a university professor to kill him and his wife in January 2003. Harboring an enmity toward wealthy people, he planned his crime meticulously.After being rejected by an escort girl, his targets switched from rich senior citizens to prostitutes and women. His hatred against women began after he was divorced in 2002. In a media interview after he was caught, he said he hoped the case would serve as a lesson to women and rich people.“Women should not be sluts, and the rich should know what they have done.”As the police investigation expanded into a series of murders Yoo committed against the elderly, with most of them bludgeoned to death with a self-made hammer, he changed his killing method. Yoo was merciless and vicious in his demeanor, dismembering and mutilating the bodies. He also confessed that he ate the organs of his victims. He received the death sentence in 2005 and is currently in jail. Korea has effectively abolished death penalty as it has not proceeded with an actual execution since 1997. During sentencing, Yoo said he felt sorry for his victims, but would kill a hundred more if he was released.While in jail he sent letters to a reporter who later published them. There, he confessed that the most fearsome moment was when his 4-year-old son made a phone call while he was mutilating a body.“The scariest moment was not when a decapitated head fell off from a hanger or when a headless body came running to me. It was when my son called to ask if I still have cold,” it read. A movie, “The Chaser,” that reflected his story, was a box office hit in 2008. Jeong Nam-gyuJeong Nam-gyuWhile many criminals come from deprived backgrounds, Jeong Nam-gyu was an outcast for a different reason. Jeong had confessed that he was molested by a man when he was 10 and was ostracized for most of his teen years. From 2004 to April 2006, he killed 15 people and wounded 19. As if to take a grudge, he first killed two elementary school boys after sexually assaulting them. Jeong had always hated rich men for having what he does not, he told the police then. His targets, however, were always those who were physically weaker than him -- minors and women. He meticulously planned his crime for a “perfect crime” to not leave traces behind. Police explained that Jeong had run 10 kilometers every two days to develop physical strength and avoid being chased. He mainly used a knife to kill people, but changed to blunt weapons out of fear that using a consistent method would help police catch him.In his first attempt to kill an adult man in a house in 2006, he was caught as the victim and his father fought back.During his trial, he testified that he was not sorry to the victims, and that he was proud to have killed so many people. “I am unlucky to have been arrested. If I had not be caught, I would kill more,” he said. Jeong was sentenced to death in 2007 and hung himself in his cell two years later with a rope he made by tying plastic bags together. The Jijon clique The Jijon cliqueThere was a crime group that systematically murdered people as well.Kim Ki-hwan, 25 at the time, organized the group dubbed the “Jijon clique” in July, 1993. All in their 20s, they had hated the rich and decided to “act out.” Their first target was a 23-year-old factory worker, who they raped and killed in 1994. They also set up a makeshift jail and incineration facility in a basement of the leader’s house in South Jeolla Province.While it all started from their frustration against the rich and the economic polarization in society, their targeted victims were not always wealthy. One of the five people they killed was also one of their members, Song Bong-eun, who tried to secede from the group. In September, 1994, they kidnapped four people and killed three of them in the most brutal ways. One victim, after being tortured, escaped to report the gang to the police. The six members were finally caught and were executed in November the same year. In their testimony, one of the members revealed that they had practiced cannibalism, because they “gave up on being human.”By Jo He-rim","korea most notorious serial ,killers nowadays serial killers ,most notorious serial killers ,notorious serial killers nowadays ,notorious serial killers","['Kwon Il - yong', 'South Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77091366  0.39623865

Radio Free Asia made the report, citing a photo taken on Dec. 9 by DigitalGlobe, an American commercial space imagery vendor, and recently made public on Google Earth.  Vehicles pass through an inter-Korean immigration office in Paju, north of Seoul, on Feb. 11, 2016, returning from the North's Kaesong Industrial Complex after Seoul's decision to shut down it was annunced the previous day. In February last year, the South Korean government completely shut down the Kaesong Industrial Complex in response to the North's fourth nuclear and long-range missile tests. The North, in turn, responded to the punitive step with the deportation of all South Koreans there. Launched in 2004, the factory park is a combination of 124 South Korean companies and 54,000 North Korean workers.In the photo, an 11-meter white vehicle is being operated inside the complex and another similarly sized vehicle is outside the complex, the broadcaster said. The car in the question is similar to a 22- to 25-ton wing body truck, whose cargo box door is installed on one side, the broadcaster said. The period when the photo was taken coincides with a period when the North attempted to pilfer and sell some of the products, including electric rice cookers, from the complex to China, the broadcaster said. ""All the vehicles inside the complex belong to South Korea, and the North's use of the vehicles without a permit is a clear-cut violation of South Korean businesses' property rights, and should be immediately stopped,"" the broadcaster quoted an official at South Korea's Unification Ministry, which is in charge of inter-Korean affairs, as saying.","korean cars in kaesong ,south korean vehicles left ,used korean cars ,used korean cars in ,korean vehicles left in","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kaesong', 'US', 'Radio Free Asia', 'DigitalGlobe', 'american', 'inter - korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.68841934  0.39874786

The reform panel will also explore ways to restructure the military's top commanding structure, enhance the arms acquisition process, upgrade key weapons systems and boost the morale of the country's 625,000 troops.""All these  tasks are related to the budgetary issues,"" Park said, noting that the new government will seek to jack up defense spending.Moon has called for a phased increase of the country's defense budgets to around 3 percent of the gross domestic product, tallied at US$1.47 trillion, from 2.4 percent now.The spokesman also said that the defense reform will be carried out in a way that will ensure the ""balanced"" development of the Army, Navy and Air Force and promote seamless cooperation among all armed services.The defense briefing was part of a series of policy presentations to the advisory committee formed to make up for the lack of a transition period for Moon. The new president was sworn in earlier this month without any preparatory time due to the March 10 ouster of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye.A major issue at the defense briefing was whether the installation of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on the peninsula requires parliamentary approval although its key elements have already been delivered to the site.On his campaign trail, Moon repeatedly said that the THAAD deployment requires parliamentary ratification, noting that the former government failed to build public consensus on the crucial security decision.Those supportive of Moon's position have mentioned a constitutional clause stipulating that the legislature has the right to consent to any treaty involving an ""important financial obligation."" Seoul has provided land worth around 89 billion won  to host the US battery.However, the defense ministry has insisted that the deployment was not a matter for parliamentary consent as it is covered under the South Korea-US mutual defense treaty already approved by the National Assembly.At the briefing, the issues of retaking wartime operational control from Washington were also expected to be discussed.During the election campaign, Moon pledged to push for the transfer of wartime operational control within his five-year term that ends in 2022. In 2014, Seoul and Washington agreed to a ""conditions-based"" OPCON transfer in light of evolving North Korean threats, delaying the transition previously scheduled for December 2015. They did not set a specific date for the transfer, but observers presume it may come in the mid-2020s.Lee Su-hoon, the chief of the committee's subpanel on security, stressed that the nation has to be able to provide for its own defense -- an apparent allusion to the need for the OPCON transition.""We should strengthen our capabilities to respond to the North's nuclear and missile threats, and push for the OPCON transfer while ensuring a firm South Korea-US alliance,"" Lee said during his opening remarks.""It is time to ensure security not just in our words ... but real security capabilities that can ably safeguard the lives of our citizens and their properties ... The Moon government will, for sure, ensure security.""He also stressed the need to stamp out deep-rooted corruption in the defense industry and enhance the welfare and human rights conditions for military draftees.","thursday the ministry will ,deliver on president moon ,to deliver on president ,said thursday the ministry ,defense ministry will install","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37615845  0.52011704

""The decision to extradite Chung has been confirmed by the Danish Justice Ministry and we have begun discussing with our Danish counterparts over when to extradite her,"" the Ministry of Justice said in a statement. Refusing to return to South Korea, Chung, arrested by local authorities in northern Danish city of Aalborg in January, has been in custody at a detention center.According to Danish law, Chung will be extradited to South Korea within 30 days of the decision. Chung is likely to face a probe immediately after she arrives here over allegations she received undue academic and financial favors based on her mother Choi Soon-sil's ties with the former president.Park and Choi -- both in jail -- are standing trial over a string of corruption allegations, including that they took bribes from the country's largest business group Samsung and other conglomerates.","wednesday danish prosecutors confirmed ,on wednesday danish prosecutors ,wednesday danish prosecutors ,repatriation of choi daughter ,daughter south korea justice","[""South Korea 's"", 'Justice Ministry', 'Denmark', 'Park Geun', 'danish', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'South Korea', 'the High Court of Western Denmark']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36568218  0.19155064

Currently, the monthly salary for soldiers is 216,000 won  for a sergeant, 195,000 won for a corporal, 176,000 won for private first class, and 163,000 won for private second class.Under the plan, corporals' salary will increase to 259,000 won a month next year, for instance, according to the sources.The military estimates the additional amount of money needed to raise salaries for soldiers to be around 300 billion won next year and says it will be able to secure the amount if the defense budget rises from currently 2.4 percent of the GDP to 3 percent or more.In a survey recently conducted by the Ministry of Defense, about 78 percent of soldiers said their monthly wages are not enough to buy even daily items so their parents remit money to make up for the shortfall.Moon, during the presidential election, pledged to gradually raise the wages of soldiers to 700,000 won, which is 50 percent of the country's minimum wage, by 2020 while shortening the service period for conscripted soldiers to 18 months from the current 21.All able-bodied South Korean men are obliged to serve in the military.","to raise soldiers monthly ,raise soldiers monthly pay ,military will increase monthly ,raise soldiers monthly ,increase monthly wages for","['Moon Jae - in', 'the Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23008105 -0.0849531

To that end, the zoo will hold a seminar on the conservation of Amur leopards by inviting renowned zoologist Jo Cook, the head of the London-based Amur Leopard and Tiger Alliance on Friday, Seoul Zoo head Lee Ki-seop said. Cook is also the chief manager of a program to breed and manage Amur leopards at the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. ""We plan to intensively introduce our preparations, including a leopard pen, as Jo Cook's judgment is crucial in introducing Amur leopards,"" he said. While in Seoul, the ALTA leader is scheduled to discuss the zoo's introduction of Amur leopards from Russia or Europe after inspecting their breeding facilities, Lee said. According to the zoo, extinct Korean leopards are genetically identical to Amur leopards, which are currently found only in the Russian Far East and northeastern China. The Korean Peninsula was their major habitat in the past. Many Korean leopards were found on the peninsula even until the Joseon Dynasty . Their population rapidly declined due to indiscriminate poaching during the Japanese colonial rule . Moreover, their habitats were destroyed since the nation's liberation in 1945, and they have completely disappeared without a trace from the peninsula from the 1970s. ""Hence, the introduction of Amur leopards, if realized, virtually means the restoration of Korean leopards,"" Lee said. Seoul Zoo has been trying to introduce Amur leopards for years, and completed a pen satisfying international standards in May last year.At present, some 200 Amur leopards are reportedly living in zoos around the world, and only about 70 survive in the wild.","to restore korean leopards ,seoul zoo said thursday ,korean leopards seoul zoo ,restore korean leopards seoul ,on friday seoul zoo","['Seoul Zoo', 'amur', 'korean', 'japanese', 'amur', 'Jo Cook', 'London', 'Amur Leopard', 'Tiger Alliance', 'Seoul Zoo', 'Lee Ki - seop', 'Cook']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26184368  0.54013991

The first couple’s love story has captivated the people, although theirs was not an easy romance.President-elect Moon Jae-in and his wife Kim Jung-sook enter the National Assembly to attend the inauguration ceremony in Seoul on Wednesday. Moon, then a pro-democracy student activist, was detained several times for leading protests against the Park Chung-hee regime, and later was forcibly enlisted in the elite special forces by authorities.Kim was by Moon’s side when he sat for the bar exam while serving time in prison for protesting against the Chun Doo-hwan regime, became a human rights lawyer and embarked on a political career after the death in 2009 of his close ally, President Roh Moo-hyun. During this year’s short but intense 60-day presidential campaign, Kim was widely credited with having boosted support for Moon among undecided voters in Gwangju and the North and South Jeolla provinces, also known as Honam. There, she earned the nickname “jolly lady” for her likable and easy-to-talk-to personality. Perhaps thanks in party to her popularity, Moon scored a landslide victory with 61.6 percent and 62.3 percent of votes there, respectively, beating his rivals Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party and Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party.The Korea Herald had the opportunity to ask Kim about her role as a first lady. Her responses came several hours before the landslide win by her husband late Tuesday.South Korea's new first lady Kim Jung-sook  holds newly elected president Moon Jae-in's hand. KH: Since last fall, you have visited Gwangju every week, often staying overnight. Is there any particular reason you chose to concentrate on the region during the campaign? Kim: In the 18th presidential election in December 2012, nearly 92 percent of Gwangju residents voted for Moon . Their backing was truly overwhelming. However, despite their faith and earnest support,  lost the race. We had caused them great pain. After losing the election, I went to Gwangju and I couldn’t help but feel despair and grief in the city. I wanted to apologize as well as thank those who had trust in Moon. And, frankly, I wanted to receive some words of consolation from the citizens. The defeat was a huge letdown for us as well. So as not to disappoint them again, we gave all our body and soul until the very end to win the election this time.KH: Michelle Obama set a new standard as a first lady during her time in the White House. What do you think of your role compared to that of Mrs. Obama? Kim: I aim to be just myself, as I have always been. A first lady who can communicate with people, like anybody else, in what I call Kim Jung-sook-style. I am willing to contribute to building a society where no single person falls victim to injustice or discrimination, but where everyone can have a voice and be respected as much as any other. My husband once said he aims to be a president who can head to Gwanghwamun on his way home from work to have some soju with the people. Like him, I would like to go shopping for groceries at Namdaemun Market . Going around the country from corner to corner since the 2012 election, I have listened to the concerns and advice of local residents. I have and will always keep myself close to the ordinary citizens as first lady.KH: You are the wife of a politician, but also a mother of two. What would you say about the difficulties people have bringing up children here? Kim: I, too, have heard a lot about the concerns, and it’s really an unfortunate reality. It is every parent’s greatest pleasure to watch their children grow up. Moon has pledged to support parents in child care. That means it is the responsibility of the nation to ensure that the parents can take care of their children properly. One of the related pledges is the “10-to-4 policy,” a dual child care system for working parents. Within a maximum 24-month period, working parents with children aged below 8 can have flexible working hours between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. without reductions to their wages. Another pledge is expanding the number of state-run or public day care centers and kindergartens to account for 40 percent of all children enrolled in such facilities. I hope to make a family-friendly society with the belief that “one’s child is everyone’s child.”By Bak Se-hwan","korea new first lady ,new first lady kim ,college sweethearts at kyung ,his wife kim jung ,moon were college sweethearts","['Kim Jung - sook', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Jung - sook', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Joint Press Co']",3,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.74545372  0.65414906

Controversy has persisted over the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here, which China argues constitutes Seoul’s de facto participation in the US-led global missile defense program. South Korea has dismissed the view, as it has been developing its own missile defense system such as the Korea Air and Missile Defense pre-emptive strike scheme, which it said will be interoperable with -- but not part of -- the US’ systems.In his testimony to the US House Committee on Armed Service last Wednesday, however, US Pacific Command Commander Adm. Harry Harris said otherwise, signaling the ongoing THAAD stationing might be a part of US efforts to build a regional missile defense scheme. “USPACOM will continue working with Japan, the ROK, and Australia to improve our level of staff coordination and information sharing and the goal of creating a fully-integrated Ballistic Missile Defense architecture that must also address the increasing cruise missile threat,” he said. US Pacific Command Commander Adm. Harry Harris Jr. testifies on Capitol in Washington before a House Armed Services Committee hearing on North Korea on April 26. It was not the first time that top US officials laid out plans for a global and regional missile defense initiative, but it was rare for them to specify countries by name as partners. About two weeks before the allies announced the THAAD deployment on July 8 last year, US Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said that the US and its allies should build missile defense to fend off North Korea’s missile threat. During his confirmation hearing on the US Senate Committee on Armed Services in 2013, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, former commander of US Forces Korea, set out his plan to establish an integrated ballistic missile defense system with the deployment of an upper-tier platform such as THAAD, Aegis BMD and AN/TPY–2 radar.South Korea’s Defense Ministry, however, has reiterated its previous pledge not to join the US-led global missile defense program, highlighting that South Korea’s THAAD deployment and the US BMD initiative are “totally separate issues.” “Gen. Scaparrptti’s comment was a part of his explanation as a nominee for USFK Commander about what sort of weapon system will be needed to defend South Korea against North Korea’s ballistic missile threat. It is unrelated to integrated missile defense,” ministry spokesperson Moon Sang-gyun said Tuesday.Although the THAAD platform is not connected to South Korea’s Korea Air and Missile Defense, it is only a matter of time that both systems are integrated into the US-led efforts to create ballistic missile defense in the Asian-Pacific region, analysts noted. South Korea, Japan and the US have been able to share intelligence about North Korea’s missile threats since they inked a trilateral intelligence transfer arrangement in December 2014. Two years later, the two Asian countries agreed to share intelligence without having to use the US as an intermediary. “Now the US is describing THAAD as a part of the US missile defense system in the East Asia. Combined with their demand for payment for THAAD, the US appears to be increasing pressure on us,” said Rep. Kim Jong-dae, a lawmaker of the minor opposition Justice Party and a prominent military expert. By Yeo Jun-suk","donald trump wants seoul ,seoul to pay billion ,trump wants seoul ,us president donald trump ,trump wants seoul to","['US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Seoul', 'China']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.71526873  0.83073306

Moon of the Democratic Party of Korea garnered 38-42.4 percent of support, maintaining a considerable lead over his four other main rivals, according to three pollsters – Realmeter, Gallup Korea and Hankook Research. His lead over the runner-up was from 18 to 23.8 percentage points, respectively. From left to right: Presidential candidates Sim Sang-jeong, Ahn Cheol-soo, Hong Joon-pyo and Moon Jae-in pray during a ceremony to mark the 2,561st anniversary of birth of Buddha at Jogyesa Temple in central Seoul on Wednesday. The polls, conducted on Monday and Tuesday and released Wednesday, six days before the May 9 election, also showed centrist Ahn Cheol-soo and conservative Hong Joon-pyo in a tight race for the second spot, with the latter extending his strong upward momentum. In two of the surveys, Ahn of the People’s Party maintained a lead over Hong of the Liberty Korea Party by 20-16 or 19.7-16.2. In another, the two tied at 18.6 percent. Despite Moon’s huge lead of around 20 percentage points, political watchers remain cautious about predicting the winner. There are several variables that may drastically affect the shape of the race, they warned. “Many liberal voters seem to have made up their minds . On the contrary, a large chunk of centrists and conservatives have a floating mind as to who they should support,” said Park Sang-byung, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Other political watchers shared the view. While Moon’s support is stable, those of Ahn and Hong are fluctuating and are likely to do more so in the home stretch to the election day. Many right-leaning voters who previously supported Ahn seem to be moving over to Hong, they said. Professor Park warned that actual vote turnouts could be quite different from poll results at the present stage.Moa Online researcher Yoon Tae-gon also forecast that the gap between the front-runner and the runner-up usually narrows in the last stage of a race. “It is hard to predict whether the No. 1 position will eventually be replaced, but the ratings of the second- and third-placed contenders are unlikely to remain similar to the current stage.” Moon’s camp is on alert for a possible upset by conservatives, urging all liberal voters to consolidate behind him. Warning that conservative forces behind the corruption scandal of former President Park Geun-hye are seeking a return, he says more than 50 percent of voter support is needed for him to push for liberal reforms. Meanwhile, the nation’s election law bans publishing of any public opinion surveys that were conducted less than a week before the election. Advance voting will take place for two days from Thursday.

But in elections, the voices of the small, but growing group of multiethnic voters continue to be muted or ignored.  Multicultural families attend a program organized by the Seoul election commission about the coming Korean presidential election last month. The forthcoming presidential election is no exception.  Facing tight schedules to the May 9 snap vote, candidates have all staked out their election pledges, but few have provided a clear vision on how to make Korea a more open and inclusive society for immigrants. A look at the manifestos of five mainstream party-backed contenders, including front-runner Moon Jae-in, reveals their lack of concrete ideas on multiculturalism. All five promises increased support for multicultural families, but their focus is limited to such agendas like how to tackle domestic violence within multicultural families or reduce school dropout rates of multicultural students. The presidential aspirants’ lack of vision for multicultural society is, in a way, a reflection of the reality, experts say. Multicultural families -- there are 890,000 members of multicultural families, including 145,000 marriage migrants, 150,000 naturalized citizens and 560,000 who were born here, according to Statistics Korea -- remain “outsiders,” rarely voicing their opinions, they point out. What candidates say about multiculturalism  Moon Jae-in  of Democratic Party of Korea claps next to a Vietnamese immigrant  in an election campaign in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province on Monday. Front-runner Moon of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, who is bidding for the presidency for the second time, has actually proposed a reduced manifesto for multicultural families. In the manifesto booklet for this year’s election, he addresses the plans to reduce the number of student dropouts with one-on-one customized tutoring programs, establish a “comprehensive support system” for married immigrants and educate citizens to be more flexible towards different cultures. Still, he is the only candidate who has a special campaigning team targeting multicultural voters. Consisting of some 20 naturalized citizens from 10 countries including Russia and Nepal, the “Rainbow Campaign” team tours areas with high immigrant populations to enlist their support for Moon.The campaign team was established soon after 50 naturalized citizens from 16 countries declared their support for the candidate, in a rare press conference on April 22.   Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party promotes “Open Nationalism,” a perspective that he said encompasses “overseas Koreans and domestic multicultural families” into the concept of Korean nationals. Appearing on a local multicultural broadcasting system, “tvM,” he talked of the need for an assimilation policy, while also stressing the need to respect the different cultural backgrounds of the multicultural families. “To those coming to Korea to earn money, we also have a past in which our citizens went out to work in other countries. If I am elected, I will embrace citizens of multicultural families,” Hong said on tvM. Centrist Ahn Cheol-soo of People’s Party, who has given out a drastic reform plan to start elementary education a year earlier at six years old, says he will expand the national budget set aside to help multicultural children. “The dropout rate for multicultural students is rising every year but the related budget is always going down,” Ahn said. His election pledge includes a special afterschool program to help the students to adapt to the school environment.In his manifesto booklet, Ahn criticizes the Gender Equality and Family Ministry for only dealing with “multicultural families” and failing to specifically deal with the problems female immigrants face.“Foreign women take up 46 percent of the total foreigners staying in the country. Among them, 14 percent are women who have come to Korea marrying Korean men,” it reads.Of the top five candidates, the minor conservative candidate Yoo Seong-min appears to be the least interested in the issue.His election manifesto points at providing support for the married immigrant women who are exposed to domestic violence by increasing the number of shelters for them, among a few other things.    Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive minor Justice Party has some detailed election pledges covering “minorities” in the society when compared to others. With her manifesto stressing the idea of “respecting diverse lifestyles,” she says she will initiate “World Citizen Education” for all to foster respect for diverse families.  Why the lack of interest? Many people with multicultural backgrounds are shut out of national elections, as the country only grants suffrage to Korean nationals, not those with permanent staying permits. “Most of the immigrants and naturalized citizens are adjusting to the country, which makes it hard for them to out speak about their rights,” said Lim Won-sun, the chief of Korean Academy of Multicultural Family, told The Korea Herald. Zhao Hongyan, a Chinese mother living in Korea for 10 years now, holds no ballot to cast in the May 9 election, but she sincerely hopes that the next leader pays more attention to multicultural families. “I came to study here in Korea and was treated fine for five years before I got married to my Korean husband to earn the title of ‘married immigrant,’” Zhao . “The society seems to have prejudice against us. Even with my master’s degree, they would not take a second look at my resume.”She also criticized aspects of the “assimilation-focused” approach of the Korean government. “Difficulties and disputes occur in relationships because of the different cultural backgrounds, but all the culture classes teach Korean culture. They do not teach Korean spouses or others to respect my culture.”One the demands made by civic groups in the field is for the government to establish an “Immigration Services” bureau that devises and implements policies for supporting the multicultural families. “Each government body such as the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family does works of its own, and a lot of them overlaps. It is not very effective,” Lim said. By Jo He-rim","coming korean presidential election ,korean presidential election last ,presidential election last month ,the coming korean presidential ,korean presidential election","['south korean', 'Seoul', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.48958272  0.81629699

While 76.5 percent worry that their own jobs will be threatened, a bigger 83.4 percent projected that their children will face an even tougher job market. The center canvassed 1,041 men and women in age groups of their 20s to 50s from April 18 to 21.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government came under fire Monday for removing some of them recently, allegedly because they were not visually appealing to pedestrians who are not blind.Tactile paving is used for the visually impaired on sidewalks in Yongsan, Seoul. Exact data on how much tactile paving has been removed was not immediately available Monday, but last year, 500 meters of tactile paving was removed from a sidewalk between Sadang Station and Isu Station during a renovation project. More recently, 10 meters of tactile paving was removed near Hoehyeon Station. The removal of such paving from sidewalks is like “a road suddenly disappearing after a night’s sleep,” Hong-Seo-jun, a 37-year-old spokesperson for the Korea Blind Union, an association for the visually impaired in South Korea, told The Korea Herald. The group issued an official statement on April 14, denouncing Seoul’s decision to remove the paving. “The paving exists as a daily guide to protect us from injury and losing our way,” said Hong, who lost his sight when he was 2-years-old after suffering from a high fever. “The government manual on the matter is very vague -- it allows too many interpretations.”An official at the Seoul Metropolitan Government was quoted by local media as saying that the color -- a vivid yellow that tends to darken from age and dust -- could be “visually distracting.” According to the guidelines set by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, sidewalks or routes frequented by those with vision problems must have tactile paving for safety. However, under a manual written by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on sidewalk construction, it states “if there are no ‘risk factors’ on the sidewalk, then the installation of tactile paving is necessary to the point of helping visually impaired pedestrians decide their direction.”The clause does not provide specific taglines on what the risk factors are nor the exact length of the paving. “We didn’t completely remove the paving, but only the parts that were determined ‘unnecessary’ by the district offices,” said Seo Kwan-suk, a spokesperson for the city government.By Jung Min-kyung","busy streets of seoul ,visually impaired disappearing walking ,yellow patterns on sidewalks ,sidewalks but those bumps ,blind tactile paving is","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.42647025  0.66520447

From left are Sim Sang-jeung, Hong Joon-pyo, Yoo Seong-min, Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo. On Tuesday, Uriminzokkiri, a North Korean propaganda website targeting South Koreans, claimed the conservatives were scheming to extend their rule by backing Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People's Party over Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party. It called Ahn the ""lesser evil"" and dismissed the other contenders from the conservative camp as ""minnows"" neglected and cursed by the public.Ahn, who is in a duel with Moon ahead of the May 9 election, seized the opportunity to rally the conservative vote. On the stump in Daegu, a conservative stronghold, the former software mogul claimed the North Korean regime of Kim Jong-un was ""afraid"" he would take power because of his strong commitment to national defense.The following day, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the North's ruling Workers' Party, called on South Koreans to rise up against the conservatives to achieve independence, democracy and inter-Korean reunification. The conservative forces including supporters of ousted conservative leader Park Geun-hye cannot be allowed to take power again, it argued. Minju Joson, the organ of the North's cabinet, issued a similar commentary claiming South Koreans will never be able to leave the shadows of U.S. control if they let the conservatives rule.Inter-Korean relations deteriorated to their worst level in years under the successive administrations of former Presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park. Lee slapped comprehensive sanctions on the unruly regime following the North's deadly sinking of a South Korean warship and attack on a border island in 2010. Park shut down a joint industrial complex in the North's border city of Kaesong, which served as the last remaining symbol of cross-border reconciliation.South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which handles inter-Korean affairs, urged Pyongyang to stop intervening in the election, saying the communist nation has been trying to drive a wedge among voters.""It is nothing new that North Korea is trying to interfere in South Korean politics,"" Lee Duk-haeng, a ministry spokesman, said Wednesday. ""North Korea should stop its anachronistic behavior.""Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the private think tank Sejong Institute, noted that while Pyongyang's smear campaigns go back a while, the snap election on May 9 has become a new focus for the regime's propaganda machine.""When there is a presidential election, North Korea naturally criticizes conservative candidates in an attempt to get a figure who is friendly or relatively less hostile to the North elected,"" he said.But the regime will never openly support a candidate.""For North Korea, it goes against their logic and system of absolute power to encourage support for anyone other than Kim Jong-un,"" he said.Yoo Dong-ryul, head of the private far-right Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy, claimed in a press conference this week that the North has mobilized some 160 pro-North websites to intervene in the election.The communist state uses both offline and online channels to give orders to pro-North forces in South Korea to manipulate voter sentiment. It also posts on social networking services such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, he said.Cheong expressed doubt that it had its intended effect.""I can't say it has no effect, but I can say it's insignificant,"" he said.","conservatives in korean election ,organizations attacked conservative political ,presidential election this week ,south korea presidential election ,korean organizations attacked conservative","['North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.47411075  0.54603797

Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers. Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910-45.The girl statues have been erected in various cities around the world, including in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to honor the victims of the atrocity. They have become a source of diplomatic friction between Seoul and Tokyo, leading Japan to recall its ambassador to South Korea early this year.“If Japan aspires after political power, it should not evade the demand of the international community but keep pace with international trend for justice and peace,” KCNA quoted the commentary as saying.The paper noted Japan’s failed attempt to remove a girl statue installed in Glendale, California.“Under the present situation that girl statues for peace are erecting in all parts of the world, it is necessary for Japan to come to itself,” it said, according to KCNA. “Japan’s ambition to become political power while evading the past liquidation is no more than foolish act to become gentlemen before having a bath.”","sexual slavery for japanese ,slave statues north korea ,korea blasts japan for ,slavery for japanese troops ,north korea blasts japan","['North Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'North Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'the North ’s Korean Central News Agency', '“japan ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36576539 -0.04227171

They filed a petition with the court on the day, asking the court to rule on the legitimacy of the Park Geun-hye administration's alleged blacklisting of cultural figures deemed critical of the government. The former president was indicted Monday on a string of charges, including abuse of power and coercion for the alleged blacklisting from 2013 to 2016. Park's former chief of staff and ex-culture minister are also standing trial over their alleged involvement in the process. The civic group said the plaintiffs, who were all on the list, filed the case to confirm that such action goes against people's basic rights stipulated in the Constitution and to prevent similar cases from happening again.

The garrison around Noksapyeong Station has been suspected as the main source of contaminants such as petroleum and benzene that have polluted the neighborhood of Yongsan for decades.The revelation came after the Supreme Court ordered the South Korean government to disclose the results of a 2015 study on underground water contamination found within its proximity. The Environment Ministry conducted several site inspections on possibly polluted 12,000 square meters of land and 7 million liters of underground water around the army base from May 2015, but declined to release the outcome to the public, citing possible diplomatic friction with the US.Civic groups demand the government release information about the level of pollution at the US military base in central Seoul at press conference held near the camp last June. Lawyers for a Democratic Society, a group of activist attorneys, filed a petition with a local administrative court three months after the ministry’s announcement.An internal investigation revealed the average concentration of benzene in the groundwater was 162 times over the safety limit of 0.015 milligrams per liter. Among 14 monitoring wells of 15 to 20 centimeters in diameter, four contained benzene levels higher than the standard, showed the report. “We suspect the environment in the army base to be seriously polluted based on the US defense report acquired by a South Korean civic group,” said the Seoul Metropolitan Government. “We have strongly urged the Environment Ministry to take immediate measures on the matter.”The report written by the US Department of Defense revealed there were at least 84 environmental issues associated with the military base. Along with the recovery of the base, the government has requested specific details and measures on all contaminations, a US-Korea bilateral meeting, and renegotiation of the Status of Forces Agreement. The current agreement only emphasizes the US military’s legal responsibility for contamination within its camp, not adjoining areas. Efforts to recover the area were launched by the city government in 2001 and a total of 5.1 billion won  was invested in the project. Seoul government plans to invest an additional 540 million won this year and widen the parameters of its environmental monitoring.The Yongsan army base has been asked to remove all pollutants before its scheduled relocation to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, by the end of 2018.By Jung Min-kyung","high level of cancer ,cancer causing agent found ,seoul was 162 times ,cancer causing agent ,level of cancer causing","['US', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Noksapyeong Station', 'Yongsan', 'Suprem']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.71619755  0.60436022

About 12 percent had experienced psychiatric illnesses in the past year. The study noted that an increasing number of people are diagnosed with depression and the disease is more prevalent among women.About 5 percent of those surveyed had suffered from depression at least once. The proportion is higher among women at 6.9 percent compared to 3 percent for men. One in 10 female respondents had experienced postpartum depression, the study showed. As for schizophrenia, about 1.8 percent had the disorder at least once in their life and 0.5 percent within the past year.The survey also showed that 75 percent of those who had attempted suicide and 68 percent of those who had planned to do so had experienced a metal disorder. The survey results come after a recent shocking case involving a schizophrenic teenager kidnapping and killing an 8-year-old girl in Incheon. The incident shed light on the country’s failure to cope with the growing prevalence of mental disorders.Experts suggested the government should create an environment where patients of mental disorders can receive timely care and treatment, without fear of being sent to hospitals against their will.Professor Hong Jin-pyo of Samsung Medical Center, who participated in the survey, said “the overall prevalence rate of mental illnesses among Koreans is decreasing compared to previous years,” adding that a growing number of psychiatric treatments at clinics may help reduce the rate. “But compared to developed countries, South Korea still lacks governmental policies to raise awareness and provide treatment for mentally ill people,” Hong said. The government has been conducting a nationwide in-depth survey into the mental health of Koreans since 2001. The most recent survey, the fourth of its kind, was conducted from July to November 2016.By Kim Da-sol","koreans suffer mental illness ,koreans experience mental disorders ,in koreans suffer mental ,koreans suffer mental ,south koreans experience mental","['South Koreans', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47540927  0.27096802

Almost empty park around the N Seoul Tower on Mount Nam in Seoul, one of the top tourist spots in the South Korean capital, as the number of Chinese visitors to South Korea has decreased due to Beijing's economic retaliation over South Korea's planned installation of a US missile defense system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. ""Ordinary Chinese people hardly feel the burden from a subscription fee of 200 yuan  per year. , we have been able to watch programs from South Korea through the channels,"" the source was quoted as saying. ""We have had the South Korean channels closed for almost one month, but there are no signs of them coming back.""The Chinese measure has prompted residents to scurry to get satellite antennas installed, which enable them to watch South Korean programs, the report said. ""There is a growing number of people who sought to have those satellite antennas even though it costs them an installation fee of 700 yuan and is too much trouble to go through procedures,"" the source added. He also complained that the Chinese operators of the channels cut off the channels without giving notice.A Chinese source living in Weihai, in northeast China's Shandong Province, said two South Korean channels had been available until April 1, but all the channels were cut off starting the next day.For Chinese viewers, South Korean broadcasts offer interesting dramas and programs and news programs, which receive higher viewership due to objective reporting on the international situation as it is, the report said, citing the source.Other sources also told RFA that Chinese operators of cable TV channels have moved to regulate the installations of satellite antennas to receive South Korean broadcasts.China has strongly opposed the THAAD deployment, saying it could undermine its security interests and the strategic balance of the region, and has been escalating retaliatory measures against South Korea, such as blocking tourists from visiting the neighboring country.","china shuts out korean ,have closed cable tv ,china has shut out ,report china has shut ,chinese authorities have closed","['China', 'south korean', 'US', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'South Korea', 'Radio Free Asia', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'Yanji', 'Jilin Province']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66088206  0.77214068

Park, dismissed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, faces a probe on 13 criminal allegations, including graft and abuse of power. Upon arrival at the prosecution's office, Park said she will comply with the investigation with sincerity. The investigation was wrapped up around 9:20 p.m. after more than 12 hours of intense questioning, the longest-running interrogation they have done so far on the former president since she was put behind bars last month.The investigators are planning to conduct one more interrogation on Wednesday before leveling formal charges against the country's former leader.Though prosecutors said they cannot confirm if Wednesday's inquiry will be the last, legal experts say it is likely that they will indict Park before next Monday, when the official campaign period for the May 9 election begins.Park was named an accomplice in her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil's bribery allegations involving South Korea's largest business group Samsung. She is also suspected of colluding with her friend in pressing local conglomerates into donating tens of billions of won to two non-profit foundations allegedly controlled by Choi.Both Park and Choi have denied the allegations.","park investigation this week ,week south korean prosecutors ,election begins next week ,investigation into ousted president ,presidential election begins next","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.71622306  0.74727452

319,319,Regime change not US goal: Tillerson,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday ruled out a regime change as its North Korea policy goal, in an apparent message to Pyongyang following a summit with China and military strike in Syria. “In terms of North Korea, we have been very clear that our objective is a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,” he said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” “We have no objective to change the regime in North Korea -...","US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday ruled out a regime change as its North Korea policy goal, in an apparent message to Pyongyang following a summit with China and military strike in Syria. “In terms of North Korea, we have been very clear that our objective is a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,” he said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” “We have no objective to change the regime in North Korea -- that is not our objective. And so the whole reasons underlying the development of a nuclear program in North Korea are simply not credible.”US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson North Korea has been decrying South Korea-US joint military drills and efforts to intensify sanctions and pressure as a plot to topple its regime in line with what it calls a “hostile policy.” In recent years, the allies have been scaling up the exercises with the participation of top US strategic assets and special forces tasked with eliminating the North Korean leadership in an emergency. Then the US’ strike in Syria in the middle of a summit between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping last Thursday fueled speculation that could be a veiled warning to Pyongyang. On Sunday, the US Pacific Command ordered a strike group to return to waters off the Korean Peninsula, citing North Korea’s “reckless, irresponsible, and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.” The group, led by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, took part in a military drill here last week and was going to Australia from Singapore. “I think the message that any nation can take  is if you violate international norms, if you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken,” Tillerson said. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” called the diversion of the strike group a “prudent” move, saying Trump has asked for a “full range of options to remove” the North’s threats. “North Korea has been engaged in a pattern of provocative behavior. This is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear-capable regime,” McMaster said.US National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster Though they did not hold a joint news conference nor release a joint statement, Trump and Xi discussed a “full range of options” on North Korea during the summit, including through one-on-one talks, Tillerson said. With Beijing calling for dialogue to defuse tension, the secretary also signaled a halt in nuclear and missile tests as a possible step before a restart of talks, calling for a greater Chinese role in fostering the right conditions. “ have called on the government on China to take additional steps. We expect that they will. They have indicated that they will. And I think we need to allow them time to take actions,” he said. “So what we would hope is that with no further testing, obviously their program doesn’t progress. And that’s what we have asked for, is for them to cease all this testing before we can begin to think about having further talks with them.”In particular, his unprecedented reference to the regime change could be part of a joint action plan the sides may have agreed on, or the US’ efforts to encourage China to do more to change the Kim Jong-un regime’s thinking, a senior Seoul official said. “I have no information on the summit, but the remarks seemed to be a message intended to follow up on what’s agreed on during the meeting, and to strengthen China’s hand in setting it in motion,” the official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “To induce Pyongyang’s attitude toward denuclearization, I believe there will need to be assurances on regime security -- that we have no intention to overthrow the regime -- not by word but through some kind of mechanism.” In another development, Wu Dawei, special representative for Korean Peninsula affairs at Beijing’s Foreign Ministry, arrived in Seoul on Monday and met with his counterpart Kim Hong-kyun, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs at the Foreign Ministry here. They were expected to discuss the Trump-Xi summit and future steps, and explore the possibility for another major provocation ahead of key national holidays, including a party congress on Tuesday, the 105th birthday of late founding father Kim Il-sung on Saturday and the anniversary of the military’s establishment on April 25. Pyongyang has been carrying out a string of missile and engine tests in recent months, with satellite imagery suggesting preparations for a fresh nuclear experiment. Last week, it fired another ballistic missile into the East Sea, though it appears to have failed.“We’ve agreed to take additional strong action if the North conducts a new nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile test,” Kim Hong-kyun told reporters after the meeting, reaffirming their commitment to continue ramping up sanctions and pressure against the regime. Wu declined to comment on reporters’ questions. During his stay here until later this week, Wu is also likely to visit leading South Korean presidential candidates to discuss North Korea policy and China’s opposition to the ongoing deployment here of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system.By Shin Hyon-hee","sunday ruled out regime ,denuclearized korean peninsula he ,denuclearized korean peninsula ,is denuclearized korean peninsula ,on sunday ruled out","['US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Syria', 'North Korea', 'ABC ’s', 'North Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62039518  0.6140362

In three months this year, the country has seen 85 ultrafine dust advisories issued, more than double in the same period last year, which had 41. With ominously gray skies, low visibility and warnings about the health effects of airborne dust, South Koreans have become increasingly anxious.A high-rise building in downtown Seoul is shrouded in fine dust on April 3. This has given rise to a breed of citizens raging their own battles against air pollution -- checking air quality with personal devices, staying indoors where air purifiers are never off-duty and stocking up on masks in case they have to step outside. Lee Jung-mi, a mother of two daughters, is among them. She begins her day by checking the air outside with a dust-measuring device, uses two air purifiers at home and grows plants with proven air cleansing properties.“I purchased the particulate monitoring device to know the exact concentration level of harmful particles in the area I live,” said Lee. As a member of an online community of about 44,000, she also shares information and useful tips on fighting fine dust. Information shared there include do-it-yourself guides on how to improvise air cleaners with ordinary fans and ultrafine dust filters, or to build cut-and-fit window filters. Lee has followed many of the tips, but feels it’s not enough. “I do as much as I can at home, but when my kids are at school, there’s nothing I can do. Windows are open, even when the dust level is high, and there is no air purifier in the classroom. Not many teachers pay attention to air quality,” she said. Her online community on Korea’s largest web portal Naver has organized three street rallies so far to urge immediate action from authorities and raise public awareness. “We cannot trust the government on the fine dust issue anymore. We need to start acting on our own to return blue skies and clean air to our children,” read one post.  Mask-wearing protestors demand the Korean government to come up with measures to reduce air pollution in a rally held in central Seoul on April 2. Many believe that while South Korea has had its own air problem, the recent sharp deterioration is mainly due to China, the world’s biggest polluter. This belief has led to the first civil lawsuit filed by South Korean citizens against the governments of both Korea and China.Choi Yul, an environmental activist and president of the Korea Green Foundation, and attorney Ahn Kyung-jae filed the suit Wednesday with the Seoul Central District Court, seeking 3 million won  each in compensation. The data on how much of the airborne pollutants in Korea are from China is not seen as reliable.The Comprehensive Plan on Fine Particulate Matter compiled by several government bodies put the figure at 30-50 percent.Such figures are estimated based on data from Baengnyeongdo, a remote western island. However, a report from the Munhwa Ilbo uncovered that the decimal point on the Baengnyeongdo data had been put in the wrong place over the past two years, giving much lower readings than was the case. Officials say they used the correct data in their calculations, and had therefore not underestimated China's influence, but are coy about releasing the data.A study leaked from the Ministry of Environment estimated that 86 percent of ultrafine dust particles in Seoul and its surrounding cities on March 21, when the entire country was choked with high dust concentrations, was of Chinese origin. The ministry confirmed that figure, but has been reluctant to reveal more data on the China factor, claiming a significant portion of the pollutants originate here. While the central government has been moving slowly, some municipalities have taken action. Based on government data that outdated diesel cars are one of the main causes of air pollution here, the Seoul Metropolitan Government is moving to ban some 1.4 million diesel cars that were registered before 2005 from its roads. The city also plans to spend 264 billion won to replace those diesel-power vehicles with electric cars. “Tackling vehicle emissions is a priority if you are to tackle air pollution in your city,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, at an international conference on air pollution held in London in March. Seoul City is aiming to reduce its annual fine dust emissions to 1,071 tons by 2020, just over a quarter of the current 3,769 tons. Seoul’s fight against dust extends to deploying 75 dust-collecting trucks on the road, 30 of which have been newly purchased this year. “Seoul is in the process of switching its  cleaning method from water washing to dust absorbing,” said a city official in charge of environmental policy, adding that such a method will further enhance efficiency of city cleaning overall.According to the city, cleaning with a dust collector can vacuum up 98.2 percent of ultrafine particles and 98.3 percent of fine dust on the road, without having to use water at all. Meanwhile, Gyeonggi Province is experimenting with rain. While artificial rain technology is usually studied to fight drought, the provincial government is considering using it to wash away dust and clean the air. To reduce 6 percent of fine dust particles in the air, at least 2 millimeters of precipitation is required. To reduce it by 20 percent, 6 mm of rainfall is needed, a previous study showed. Gyeonggi Province plans to hold three rainmaking experiments this year, with a budget of approximately 25 million won  per instance. Incheon and western cities in Gyeonggi Province are the first to be hit by toxic air from China. “Korea cannot root out the fine dust problem if we do not do anything to air pollutants blowing from outside of the country,” said Nam Kyung-pil, Gyeonggi Province governor. “We will try a variety of high-tech measures to fight the fine dust,” Nam added.By Kim Da-sol","airborne dust south koreans ,downtown seoul is shrouded ,dust on april yon ,koreans have become increasingly ,dust south koreans","['South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.47731951  0.47974226

Prosecutor Han Woong-jae led the interrogation from 10 a.m. to 8:40 p.m. at a makeshift investigation room at Seoul Detention Center south of Seoul, where she has been jailed since Friday. The session took place inside the facility at Park’s request. It was the first questioing since she was detained Friday. Former President Park Geun-hye is taken to a detention house in Uiwang on Friday morning. Two of Park’s lawyers, Yoo Young-ha and Chae Myung-sung, were present. The investigation was not recorded by video.Outside the prison, some 50 supporters for Park rallied, calling for her immediate release. Some of them burst into tears and others shouting “Give me back our president,” waving the national and US flags. Park faces a total of 13 criminal charges, but Tuesday’s interrogation was said to have focused on Park’s alleged collusion with her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to coerce donations from local firms including Samsung Group. Choi and Samsung Group’s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong are also in custody at the same detention facility.Park is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won  from local firms, including Samsung Group, for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. An independent counsel team, which ended its 70-day probe into the scandal on Feb. 28, concluded that part of Samsung’s donations had been bribes made in return for political favors. Samsung’s Lee is standing trial for offering or promising to offer bribes to Park and Choi.If convicted of bribery, which carries the heaviest punishment among all the charges, Park could be sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of at least 10 years.Park has flatly denied all the charges, saying local firms voluntarily made donations for the foundations. But her denial is one of the reasons the prosecution saw the possibility of Park destroying evidence and sought an arrest warrant to detain her. It remains to be seen whether Park and Choi will sit down together to go through a cross interrogation. The prosecution ruled out the possibility during a briefing Monday. Choi also sternly denied her involvement in the bribery scheme during the first hearing on her bribery case Tuesday.“The independent counsel set me up in a bribery frame when I don’t know anything about Samsung Group’s managing structure,” Choi said during the hearing. “Park’s arrest results from my wrong judgment and behavior. I am also sorry to Samsung Group  out of good will.”The independent counsel suspects Park and Choi of sharing economic benefits. At the hearing, the prosecution revealed statements by staff members who had worked at a dress shop that manufactured some of Park’s clothing. According to their statements, Choi directly paid them in cash for Park’s clothing, rental fees for the shop and their salary until late last year. Park’s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against artists with liberal views.As Park lost her presidential immunity after being expelled from power on March 10, she was summoned for questioning on March 21 for the first time and was grilled at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office for some 11 hours. The arrest warrant for Park is valid until April 19. The prosecution is expected to file charges against her by mid-April to minimize the impact Park’s arrest will have on the May 9 presidential election.The prosecution is also speeding up a probe into Woo Byung-woo, the former presidential secretary for civil affairs, by summoning him for questioning scheduled for Thursday. He is suspected of assisting or condoning Choi’s meddling in state affairs.

Woo, 50, who served Park as a senior secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016, is being asked to present himself at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at 10 a.m. Thursday, according to an official from the prosecution’s special investigation unit.Woo Byung-woo, a key aide of ousted President Park Geun-hye The summoning signals the shifting focus of the investigation to Park’s former aide, who has remained largely unscathed so far despite having the nickname of “emperor” for his influence within the Park administration. Woo has been questioned twice since the scandal involving the former president broke out in late 2016 -- once by state prosecutors and then by an independent counsel.Special counsel Park Young-soo, whose 70-day investigation ended on Feb. 28, had seen Woo as a key figure in the corruption and influence-peddling scandal, suspecting that he may have abetted irregularities committed by Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Woo, however, has avoided legal action due to the special counsel’s limited investigation period, though a total of 30, including Choi, Samsung Group’s de-facto chief Lee Jae-yong and many of Park’s former aides, have been indicted. Key allegations against him include one that he used his influence to block a prosecutorial probe into failed rescue efforts during the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry. On Monday, prosecutors reportedly secured statements from a senior prosecutor at the Gwangju District Prosecutors’ Office who had led the investigation into the ferry tragedy, saying that Woo had interfered in the probe. Woo is denying the allegation, although he admits to making a phone call to the prosecutor “to check on the status of the investigation.” Former President Park’s inept response to the national tragedy was among the reasons behind the parliamentary vote to impeach her on Dec. 9. On March 10, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment, saying she had undermined democracy and the Constitution by allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs and using her presidential authority to aid Choi’s private interests.But it dismissed the charge regarding the ferry disaster, saying a lack of diligence was not grounds for impeachment.Park was taken into custody Friday, 21 days after she was removed from office.By Bak Se-hwan","korean prosecutors said tuesday ,thursday south korean prosecutors ,on thursday south korean ,prosecutors said tuesday ,summoned on thursday south","['south korean', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16651741  0.32644925

It said scientists developed the artificial skin by examining the skin of mammals.The skin was inspired by the so-called ""Piezo2"" protein that is found inside of Merkel cells on the top layer of the skin of animals, the ministry said. Scientists copied the physiological tactile sensing mechanism of the protein.""This capability enables voice identification, health monitoring, daily pressure measurements, and even measurements of a heavy weight beyond the capabilities of human skin,"" the researchers said in a paper.The new artificial ""ionic mechanotransducer skin"" has unprecedented sensitivity over a wide spectrum of pressures, which can lead to a breakthrough in the soft robotics sector, officials said. Soft robotics is a sub-field of robotics that deals with nonrigid robots constructed with soft and deformable materials like rubber and silicon. ""We expect this finding to be applied to various sectors including surgical soft robotics and a health care system that desperately needs tactile interfaces between humans, robots and the environment, as well as a variety of industrial sectors such as search and rescue,"" said Kim.The research was funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and their findings were published in the latest edition of the journal ""Advanced Materials.""","scientists develop artificial skin ,south korean scientists ,scientists develop artificial ,of south korean scientists ,korean scientists has developed","['south korean', 'Kim Do - hwan', 'Soongsil University', 'Jung Hee - tae', 'Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology', 'the Ministry of Scien']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44376314  0.6277923

The suspect, a high school dropout with records of mental illness, is currently in police custody. She allegedly met the victim at a park in Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, on Wednesday afternoon and killed her with an unidentified weapon after luring the victim into her home with a phone. The suspect in a kidnap and murder case of an 8-year-old child is seen at Yeonsu Police Station in Incheon, west of Seoul, Thursday. The victim’s body, stuffed into two large garbage bags, was found at around 10 p.m. Wednesday, atop the roof of a facility that houses a water tank, the police said. The two were neighbors who lived in the same apartment complex, but did not have prior contact. Police found what they believe to be the murder weapon and other evidence at the suspect’s home. Marks indicating strangling were found on the victim’s body. An autopsy is planned to determine the exact cause of the death.The suspect, when confronted Wednesday by investigators, had said she did not remember well, speaking incoherently about her actions. She confessed to the murder later on Thursday. Police suspect she had an accomplice, based on the assessment that the suspect would have found it difficult for the teenage girl to move the body to the top of the 4-5-meter building without help. Police are also checking on the mental status of the suspect, after she told investigators that she had received therapy for the past seven years.The teenager dropped out of high school last year after having difficulty adjusting to it. Her parents plan to appoint an attorney. Depending on whether she had the deliberate intention to kill the child, she could face a punishment of up to 15 years in prison.

But as they grow and more people have access to them, those unfamiliar with the concept are relying on them for studies and reports.The result is fake information jumping past the border of wiki sites and into mainstream media.  NamuwikiA casual internet search using Google Scholar yielded dozens of studies citing Namuwiki as a source for their papers. These are not just papers submitted by desperate college students scraping the internet for something to fill their word counts; they include academic journals published by legitimate organizations like the Institute for EU Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“It’s ironic because not even the heavy users themselves would think of it as an encyclopedia” said Park Byung-ho, a professor at KAIST’s graduate school of information and media management. “But the people who accessed the pages by searching the internet may think, ‘Well that’s pretty useful ’.” It’s not difficult to see a Korean youngster browsing through wiki pages, lost in a sea of information that is easy to access. Within a page is a word highlighted in blue -- indicating a direct link to another page -- and before you know it, you can spend hours browsing through various pages.“Mostly, it’s because it’s fun. When I’m by myself and have nothing to do, I can always access the Namuwiki and look at the pages,” said 30-year-old office worker Kim Han-ho.Most of the people adding information are people like Kim who, while well educated, are not professionals. Phrases like “It is a popular belief,” “Many believe,” “It is common sense to say,” are used to convey one’s personal belief.What is and is not edited out is decided by how popular it is, not by the accuracy of the information.“Many times, the users get embroiled in what is called ‘editing war,’ in which people erase the information they don’t like and fill the pages with their own opinions. Whoever is tenacious enough to keep on editing wins,” said Kim.Such case is not confined to Korean wiki pages. Even Wikipedia is often subject to “editing wars” when dealing with controversial topics. Wikipedia’s “history” page on US President Donald Trump shows that the entry has been repeatedly edited to add content favorable to, or against the controversy-ridden leader.Among the most glaring problems for wiki pages is that their convenience sometimes blinds the users from realizing how groundless the information they provide can be.In one of the most bizarre incidents, an unidentified user last year on Namuwiki posted a nonexistent concept called “Equalism” -- as opposed to the general concept of equality -- that supposedly was coined in 1996 as an idea to replace feminism. What started as an under-100 word page quickly grew as other users added details like actress Emma Watson allegedly mentioning it in a speech, “10 commandments of Equalism” and how it is referred to as “Equalitarianism” in the “Western academic circles.”The truth -- that “Equalism” did not in fact exist as a concept -- was revealed in January and the “Equalism” page was substituted with one explaining the incident involving the false claim. However, inaccurate information about the so-called “Equalism” concept had already spread to numerous Namuwiki pages on gender issues.How fast the information spread without the users realizing it was fake is an alarming sign of the potential danger of online wiki pages.Professor Park said such phenomenon is common when a new type of media or information is presented to the public. “Back when email was first introduced, there was widespread sentiment that any information that one got through email was legitimate. A few years back, Q&A; section on Naver or Daum were regarded as credible even though anyone could give an answer,” he said. “The public tends to overestimate  novel methods.”Many wiki pages do not have a person who can be held accountable for their content. Namuwiki itself claims to be run by a Paraguay-run company called umanle S.R.L., about which no information is provided on Namuwiki.The operators of Namuwiki could not be reached for comment for this article as the page provided no contact information.Park stressed that it is important for the general public to realize that the wiki pages are not a credible source of information and that they have always been intended as a “playground” for sharing tidbits about pop culture.“Namuwiki and its forerunners were never intended to replace the pre-existing encyclopedias. Rather it was a form of community that the users created to just enjoy, joke and have fun among themselves,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","popular korean wiki websites ,most popular korean wiki ,popular korean wiki ,korean wiki websites ,korean wiki websites and","['Korea', 'Namuwiki', 'korean', 'US']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67749619  0.98412305

This photo was captured from the North's Central TV Station. The report also pointed out that the North's daily food rations remained at 300-380 grams per person on average last year, just half of some 600 grams that the United Nations recommends as the minimal daily requirement, the broadcaster said. The report stressed the need for fresh assistance to the North, while reminding that North Korean residents suffer insufficiency in food, sanitation and drinking water because of recurring natural disasters like droughts and floods.Citing the UN relief agency, another US broadcaster, Voice of America, also said on the same day that some $114 million is required to provide assistance to the North this year.","million north korean people ,people undernourished in korea ,18 million north korean ,undernourished in korea nearly ,10 people undernourished in","['north korean', 'US', 'UN', 'North Korea', 'the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.77288753  0.30339962

Lotte has also become one of the main targets of China's retaliation, as it's staunchly opposed to the allies' move to beef up their capability to intercept North Korea's missiles.Military officials, however, dismissed concern about the possible vulnerability of the military's intranet, saying it's completely ""separated"" from the Internet server.They pointed out the government has already elevated the cyber terror alert level by one notch.

The survey was conducted on 3,667 adults in June-July last year. People hold a mass rally in downtown Seoul on March 11, a day after the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. The score for 2016 was down 1.47 points from 2006, but the score for 2026 was slightly higher at 3.91 points. A number close to zero means people have little trust in Korean society.The respondents rated South Korea’s social unity at 4.18 points out of 10.In the survey, the respondents evaluated South Korean society based on five categories -- trust, tolerance, dynamism, hope and cooperation -- for 2006, 2016 and 2026.Findings showed that the respondents rated the level of social tolerance at 3.79 points for 2016, dynamism at 4.03 points, hope at 3.76 points and cooperation at 3.85 points.Many Koreans seem to pin their hopes on the improvement of social conditions in the future, as each category for 2026 scored between 0.1 to 0.5 points higher than 2016. Some of the respondents said that South Korea should put more effort into fair distribution and social mobility to develop social unity.The report also said that “the government should try more measures to secure objective conditions for improving people’s participation in social activities, including more leisure time, in order to improve South Korea’s low level of social unity.”By Kim Da-sol","koreans frustration with society ,worse last year than ,society deepens south koreans ,june july last year ,frustration with society deepens","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66731435  0.66881227

Chinese police stand guard in front of a Lotte Department Store outlet in Shenyang, China, on March 4, due to rising anti-Korean sentiment among Chinese. According to the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education, at least four of seven Daegu high schools with plans for China-bound field trips this year have changed their destinations to Taiwan and Japan.The office said it sent a letter to Daegu schools last week, asking them to take sufficient protective measures for students ahead of their field trip to ""unstable"" areas. The office also recommended that overseas school field trips be canceled or postponed to ensure the safety of students.Likewise in Busan, four out of five middle and high schools have abandoned their plans to send students to China on field trips in the first half of this year.A Busan high school, for instance, changed the destination of its field trip to Japan after consultations with parents, while three other schools replaced China with Japan or Singapore as the destination.Another Busan high school said it will also consider changing the destination of its China-bound field trip.The Busan Metropolitan Office of Education asked its schools in January to refrain from overseas field trips except for special educational purposes.On Jeju Island, two elementary schools which sent pupils to China last year said they plan to visit somewhere else this year.In South Chungcheong Province, 20 primary and secondary schools planned on a field trip to China this semester but 14 of them have already decided to forgo such plans. The other six schools are also considering changing their destinations to other countries or domestic locations.Separately, the city of Nonsan, near Daejeon, has canceled its earlier plan to send about 1,600 high school students in its district to Shanghai in several groups in the first half.Officials of Nonsan City Hall said the destination for the overseas training program will be changed to Japan or other countries, due to anti-Korean sentiment in China.","korean schools cancel field ,high schools have canceled ,schools cancel field trips ,china in tourism fallout ,korean schools cancel","['south korean', 'China', 'anti - korean', 'Chinese', 'US', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'China', 'anti - korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27974567  0.70599073

353,353,Prosecutors to summon Park,"The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said Tuesday that it will summon former President Park Geun-hye as a suspect for in-person questioning, over a wide-ranging corruption scandal that led to her expulsion from office. “We will decide tomorrow when to summon her and notify her,” a source at the office said. The summons date is not negotiable, the official added. A flag of Prosecution Service (Yonhap)If ...","The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said Tuesday that it will summon former President Park Geun-hye as a suspect for in-person questioning, over a wide-ranging corruption scandal that led to her expulsion from office. “We will decide tomorrow when to summon her and notify her,” a source at the office said. The summons date is not negotiable, the official added. A flag of Prosecution Service If summoned, Park will face a grilling similar to her jailed confidante Choi Soon-sil who is at the center of the scandal.“The summoning by prosecutors will possibly take place at the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, part of their efforts to show courtesy to the former president,” said Nam Kyoung-kook, a law professor at University of Seoul Law School.Other observers said Park could be questioned on the seventh floor of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, where Choi had undergone questioning in October. Park’s legal team has yet to let out comments on the prosecution’s announcement. The prosecution’s move comes four days after the Constitutional Court unanimously voted to unseat Park over a scandal involving bribery, influence peddling and systematic leaks of government secrets. The decision stripped her of presidential immunity to criminal prosecution. Upon returning to her private residence in southern Seoul on Sunday, Park said through a spokesman that the truth would be revealed someday, which was largely taken as a continuation of her earlier stance to deny any wrongdoings and a hint at a legal fight against the charges raised against her. Special counsel Park Young-soo, who investigated Park’s scandal until Feb. 28, has booked Park as an accomplice in a bribery case involving Choi and Samsung Group. The state prosecutors have handed over all investigative records from the counsel to continue the probe. If the questioning session realizes, Park will become the fourth president of South Korea to be investigated by state prosecutors after retirement, following ex-presidents Roh Tae-woo, Chun Doo-hwan and now-deceased Roh Moo-hyun. The three were all openly summoned by the prosecution.The prosecution said it will confirm the way Park will be summoned and questioned after reviewing the past practices involving former presidents. Ex-President Roh Tae-woo was brought in to prosecutors’ office in November 1995 over allegations he created a slush fund worth hundreds of billions won. “I feel sorry that I caused a stir,” he told reporters as he stepped into the top prosecutors’ office.A month later, the prosecution summoned ex-state chief Chun Doon-hwan on charges of treason and munity after his crackdown on pro-democracy movement in southern city of Gwangju in May 1980 killed hundreds of the protestors. Chun refused summons by the prosecution and stayed at his hometown, which led the prosecution to detain him and investigate him behind bars. Roh and Chun later respectively received a 17-year prison term and life sentence on charges of mutiny and treason for their roles in the 1979 coup and the 1980 Gwangju Uprising. They were pardoned in December 1997.Former President Roh Moo-hyun, who committed suicide during a probe into bribery allegations involving his family members, appeared before the top prosecutors’ office in April 2009 after his presidential term ended. He said “I am ashamed” before entering the prosecutors’ office.

Seoul-based concert organizer JK & Company said that it was notified via email last week that the BSO decided to cancel its performances in Korea, without clarifying the reasons. The Harbin Symphony Orchestra will perform instead, the company added. The undated photo provided by JK & Company shows the Beijing Symphony Orchestra perform. The orchestra, founded in 1977, planned to hold a concert in Seoul and several other cities from Oct. 15 to 21 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. In 2007, it held a concert in Seoul's Sejong Center to mark the 15th anniversary.A diplomatic feud between the two nations over the US anti-missile system is taking a toll on Korea's industrial, tourism and cultural sectors.In recent months, Korean artists' concerts have been abruptly called off. China also urged its people not to visit Korea, sending shockwaves through the tourism industry. Chinese visitors make up almost half of Korea's inbound tourists. However, this is not the first time that China has apparently stopped its artists from performing in another country when diplomatic tensions were heightened. Amid territorial disputes with Japan over the Senkaku Islands, known as Diaoyudao in China, pianists Li Yundi and Lang Lang canceled their Japanese tours in 2012 and 2013, respectively. ""The impact of China's retaliatory measures against the THAAD deployment is bigger than expected,"" said an industry source, who asked not to be named, urging the government to come up with measures to cope with the matter.","beijing symphony cancels concerts ,cancels concerts in korea ,scrapped its planned concerts ,symphony cancels concerts in ,symphony cancels concerts","['Beijing', 'Symphony Orchestra', 'South Korea', 'China', 'US', 'korean', 'US', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'China']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52748269  0.41789338

""Pyongyang citizens are in a rage as the rumors of Kim's murder have reached them via North Korean officials working abroad,"" Kim Heung-kwang, head of the North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity in Seoul, said. Members of the youth committee of the United Malays National Organization , Malaysia's largest political party, hold a rally in front of the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 23, 2017. They protested against the North's insistence that the interim outcomes of the ongoing Malaysian police probe into the death of Kim Jong-nam, half brother to leader Kim Jong-un, were manipulated in a South Korea-Malaysia conspiracy against the North. The NKIS official elaborated on the response to the assassination based on a phone conversation with his North Korean acquaintance who made a business trip to Beijing earlier this week. Pyongyang residents in their 50s and 60s know well of Kim Jong-nam, who had been once considered the successor to power, although they do not know about current leader Kim Jong-un's real brother, Kim Jong-chol, the official said. ""They think the murder of the eldest grandson of North Korea founder Kim Il-sung and the eldest son of the late leader Kim Jong-il is a thing that cannot happen,"" he said. People thought that Jang Song-thaek deserved death for being a reactionary when he was executed by his own niece Kim Jong-un in 2013. ""But this time people are enraged by Kim Jong-un's murder of his own brother,"" he said. A North Korean defector, who once worked in the North Korean Cabinet, also said every citizen in Pyongyang learned about the assassination in less than 10 days after it took place.","pyongyang citizens furious about ,citizens furious about kim ,jong nam murder defector ,pyongyang citizens furious ,recent assassination of kim","['Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Malaysia', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'pyongyang', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Kim Heung - kwang']",3,"[ 0.          0.          4.         ... -0.52053005  0.2201978

VX is a chemical agent listed as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations and its use is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which the North is not a signatory.Eight North Koreans have been named as suspects, but the North has denied its involvement.""The specter of chemical weapons proliferation, of VX in the hands of terrorists, now looms ever larger,"" James Rubin, a former assistant secretary of state, said in an article in the Politico. ""The apparent shipment from North Korea to Malaysia of VX -- a lethal substance banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention -- is a brazen violation of international law despite the fact that North Korea is not a signatory to the convention,"" he said.Rubin also noted that China's suspension of coal imports from North Korea left Pyongyang without one of its biggest sources of hard currency while al-Qaida and other terrorist groups have worked hard to obtain weapons of mass destruction.""It was precisely this kind of frightening marriage of terrorism and WMD that the Bush administration considered a key justification for the war in Iraq. It would be reasonable to expect President Donald Trump and his team to be working overtime to prevent such a possibility. This is no partisan matter,"" he said.""While we may not have evidence of Pyongyang's intention to proliferate in the chemical weapons area, we do know they have transferred advanced missile technology and possibly the technology that allowed Syria to build a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by Israel several years ago,"" he said.Rubin said that though the North is the first foreign policy test the administration of President Donald Trump, there are no indications that Trump and his team understand the seriousness of the situation.""Every new administration has to deal with a foreign policy crisis of some type in its early days,"" he said. ""It's the proliferation risk from North Korea that should worry us.

The move followed the delivery of an official letter from South Korea's foreign ministry to municipalities asking for the relocation, Japan's public broadcaster NHK said Sunday.South Korea's foreign ministry said Thursday it sent the letter to the Busan regional government, the city's dong ward office and the Busan municipal assembly to resolve the diplomatic rift with Japan over the statue. The ministry said that the location of the statue is not desirable given the safety for overseas missions and international courtesy and manners.This file photo, taken on Feb. 3, 2017, shows a statue symbolizing victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery in front of the Japanese consulate general in the southeastern city of Busan. In December, civic groups installed the statue in front of the Japanese consulate in the nation's second-largest city. Japan demanded an immediate removal and recalled its ambassador to South Korea in protest last month. The envoy has yet to return to his post.South Korea and Japan reached a deal on Dec. 28, 2015, under which Tokyo apologized and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for the creation of a foundation aimed at supporting the victims, euphemistically called comfort women.Tokyo argues that installing such statues including the one in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul is against the spirit of the deal aimed at resolving the issue ""once and for all."" According to NHK, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said Friday the South Korean government has expressed there is no change to its position that it will steadily implement the agreement, adding that Japan will seek to have Seoul do so.Kishida's remarks are interpreted as Tokyo's stance that it will wait for South Korea to have the statue removed.""South Korea's move has yet to meet Japan's expectations over the implementation of the deal,"" an official at Japan's foreign ministry was quoted by NHK as saying, apparently stressing the importance that South Korea will manage to have the statue removed.Japan's wartime sexual slavery has been a major source of a diplomatic rift between Seoul and Tokyo. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into working at Japanese army brothels during World War II.","women statue relocation japan ,relocation japan will decide ,the relocation japan public ,statue relocation japan will ,statue relocation japan","['Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Busan', ""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'NHK', ""South Korea 's""]",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.71764868  0.17685801

During those meetings, Yun said he explained to them that then-Burma, now Myanmar, severed diplomatic relations with Pyongyang after the North carried out a deadly bombing attack in the Southeast Asian nation in 1983.Yun said China's recent decision to suspend coal imports from North Korea appears to be a message that not only underlines Beijing's willingness to sincerely carry out UN Security Council sanctions, but also demonstrates the change in China's perceptions of the North. Earlier in the day, Yun and the British foreign minister agreed to work closely together to cope with threats from the North based on the understanding that the North's nuclear and missile development constitutes a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions and a serious threat not only to the region, but also to the entire international community, his ministry said.Yun asked his British counterpart Boris Johnson for cooperation in strengthening sanctions and pressure on the North so as to make it realize that there is no other choice but to go nuclear-free.Johnson expressed concerns over the North's fast-evolving nuclear and missile capabilities and promised to closely work together with South Korea in faithfully implementing relevant UNSC sanctions. He also vowed to make efforts to induce tougher restrictions on Pyongyang from the EU, according to the ministry.","north korea apparent killing ,fm korea assassination likely ,korea apparent killing of ,korea assassination likely to ,korea apparent killing","['south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'Malaysia']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29035529  0.51546443

Chung Yoo-ra, 21, has been in the custody of Danish authorities since she was arrested in this northern city of Aalborg last month.She is under suspicions of receiving undue favors in admission to Seoul-based Ewha Womans University and other academic affairs based on her mother Choi Soon-sil's ties to the president. This file photo, taken from a clip on YouTube on Jan. 3, 2017, shows Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi Soon-sil at the center of a corruption scandal that has led to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's impeachment, holding an interview with Korean reporters at a court in the northern Danish city of Aalborg. The court has decided to further detain Chung until March 22 while the prosecution reviews whether to accept an extradition request made by South Korean authorities. It is the third time the court has ruled in favor of the prosecution's request for an extension since Chung was arrested. South Korean special prosecutors team, led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo, has asked Denmark to send Chung to Seoul for a questioning on a series of alleged wrongdoings in connection to the influence-peddling scandal.The Danish prosecution was expected to deliver a decision by Wednesday, but it said it needs more time to review the documents handed over from the South Korean investigation team. The 21-year-old has so far refused to voluntarily return home to face a probe.  Following the court's decision, she is likely to avoid the investigation's deadline of Tuesday. The team has asked Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend the period for a month, but it is unclear whether he will approve the request.Even if the Danish prosecution decides to repatriate Chung in the near future, she is expected to take the case to court.Chung's mother Choi, whose alleged wrongdoings led to President Park's impeachment late last year, is currently standing trial over allegations she meddled in state affairs and amassed profits using her ties to the president.The president is awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on her impeachment.Special prosecutors are also looking into whether South Korea's Samsung Group supported Chung's equestrian training in return for the government's backing of its controversial merger of two affiliates in 2015.The Seoul Central District Court on Friday issued a warrant to formally arrest Lee Jae-yong, the de facto head of the conglomerate, over suspicions on a string of charges, including bribery and embezzlement.","korean scandal danish court ,danish court on wednesday ,extends detention of daughter ,daughter of south korean ,of korean scandal danish","['danish', 'south korean', ""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'danish', 'Aalborg', 'Seoul', 'Ewha Womans University']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.27042675  0.09210292

The ATM maintenance firm inspected the machines the next day, learned the cash was gone and reported the crime to the police.The police tracked down the suspects after examining security camera videos taken at the scene and determining that employees doing ATM security or maintenance work were likely involved as the time taken to complete the heist was very short and the cash machines were undamaged.","theft police said tuesday ,stealing cash from atms ,atm theft police ,of atm theft police ,tuesday they have arrested","['Costco', 'Yongin', 'Seoul']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37159583 -0.24143718

This also makes sense, as it is presumed that those living in the capital are the most privileged and financially able to own mobile phones.As all the Pokestop locations are labeled in either English or Chinese, speculation is that these stops were likely registered by foreign tourists rather than North Koreans.

It’s the perfect recipe for a thrilling cloak-and-dagger spy novel. Except some _ or possibly even all _ of this tale could be true in the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the older half brother of reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. And just like similar intriguing cases from the past, the public is hanging on to every detail because there’s just something about murder by poison that captivates. “A gun announces its mischief; poison can sneak in with a sip of champagne,” said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University. “The question isn’t why we are fascinated with this latest story, it’s why wouldn’t we be?”Still, speculation that Kim Jong-nam was killed by two young female “agents” at the busy Kuala Lumpur airport last week left even the most seasoned toxicology sleuths shaking their heads. Add in that the portly sibling was apparently sprayed in the face with a substance so potent it killed him before he could reach the hospital, and you’ve got a scene straight out of a James Bond movie. Four people, including the two women _ one Indonesian and the other traveling on a Vietnamese passport _ have been detained. Conspiracy theories and speculation abound as police scramble to unravel what really happened to Kim Jong-nam, aged 45 or 46, the son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and a mistress. After falling out of favor with the family, the son lived for years in exile and was about to catch a flight to Macau when the attack took place. He sought help at the airport clinic after suddenly falling ill and died en route to the hospital. An autopsy has been performed, but the results have not been released.If a chemical agent really was to blame, finding it may be the hardest part of all. “The more unusual, the more potent, the more volatile a poison is, the less likely it is to be detected,” said Olif Drummer, a toxicologist at Australia’s Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine who has spent 40 years in the field.Experts routinely tasked with finding answers in poisoning cases say the events at Kuala Lumpur’s budget airline terminal are bizarre, but not impossible. They wonder: What substance could have been used to kill the victim so quickly without sickening the women who apparently deployed it, along with anyone else nearby? Difficult, they say, but doable. “It’s not an agent that could be cooked up in a hotel room. It’s going to take a lot of knowledge regarding the chemical in order to facilitate an attack like this,” said Bruce Goldberger, a leading toxicologist who heads the forensic medicine division at the University of Florida. He said a nerve gas or ricin, a deadly substance found in castor beans, could be possible. A strong opioid compound could also have been used, though that would likely have incapacitated the victim immediately. “It would have to be cleverly designed in order to be applied in this fashion without hurting anyone else,” Goldberger said.  History is filled with poisoners. From jilted lovers seeking revenge to greedy spouses looking to collect on life insurance policies. Arsenic, cyanide and strychnine are often the toxins of choice used in murders, but political hits are usually a much more complicated business. Take the Cold War case of Bulgarian defector and journalist Georgi Markov. He was jabbed in the leg with an umbrella in 1978 at a bus stop in London. He died three days later, and a pellet of highly toxic ricin was found under his skin _ shot there by a gun concealed inside the umbrella.  No one was ever arrested, but Bulgarian secret police were suspected with help from the Soviet KGB. The Kremlin has been implicated in a number of high-profile cases including Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy who fled to the United Kingdom and was lethally poisoned by radioactive polonium-210 in 2006. In a report published last year, a British judge wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the assassination carried out by the country’s security service. And just this month, another loud Putin critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza, fell into a coma and was diagnosed with “acute intoxication by an unidentified substance.” The Russian nearly died from a similar unexplained poisoning two years ago.  Though the dramatic cases linked to espionage tend to make headlines, many other killings are overlooked entirely.  “To me, murder by poison is the easiest thing to get away with,” said John Trestrail, a forensic toxicologist who has examined more than 1,000 poisoning crimes. “If all those people in the cemetery who have been poisoned could raise their hands, we’d probably be shocked.”While murder using toxins is far less common than stabbings and shootings, he said his research shows that poisoners often strike more than once. “These people get away with it time and time again until somebody says, ‘Well, hell, she’s had four husbands and they all died suddenly,”‘ Trestrail said. “Then the exhumations come and: Bingo!”","poison in korean airport ,airport attack is hardest ,female assassins crowded international ,paranoid dictator estranged brother ,assassins crowded international airport","['Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.74038708  0.33573362

Oriental Daily News, a Malaysia-based Chinese-language daily, reported that police were planning to perform a second autopsy but said it was scheduled to be conducted at 9 a.m. Saturday.The news reports came as Malaysian authorities failed to yield conclusive findings in the first autopsy on Wednesday, two days after Kim Jong-nam was killed. Malaysian police have not yet released an official postmortem report.Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who has a different mother from the current leader, was killed in an airport in Malaysia on Monday after being attacked by two women who are suspected to have used some sort of poison.It has yet to be confirmed whether North Korea was behind the latest killing, but Seoul's spy agency said Wednesday that Kim Jong-un issued a ""standing order"" to murder his sibling after he assumed power in late 2011.Kang Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, demanded that Malaysia immediately hand over the body, accusing Malaysia of trying to deceive the North while colluding with what he calls ""hostile forces"" trying to do Pyongyang harm.""We will categorically reject the result of the postmortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance,"" the ambassador said while reading a statement in front of the mortuary of Hospital Kuala Lumpur.   Malaysia's police chief, Inspector-General Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar, has dismissed North Korea's accusation that his government was purposely delaying the process to release Kim Jong-nam's remains, the Bernama reported.""While in Malaysia, everyone has to obey and follow our rules and regulations ... that includes North Korea,"" Khalid was quoted as saying, adding that the police must obtain a DNA sample from the Kim Jong-nam family in order to conclude the investigation. Meanwhile, AP and Reuters reported that Malaysian police arrested and identified a 46-year-old man possessing a North Korean passport in Kuala Lumpur on Friday night in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam.According to Reuters, the man's name is Ri Jong-chol, born in 1970.

Choi was staying in Germany to avoid public scrutiny after the scandal surfaced in late October. Earlier last month, former presidential aide Jeong Ho-seong admitted that President Park had used a phone under a borrowed name for security reasons and he personally had paid for it, during Park’s impeachment trial. “It is certain the material to prove it is in the presidential compound. If the search is blocked, it poses a great difficulty to the investigation to finding the truth about the corruption scandal,” the team said.The independent counsel filed a lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court on Friday after presidential aides denied the team’s entry into the presidential compound, citing security reasons. Two focal points are whether the counsel team has the legal mandate to file a suit against another government body to invalidate an administrative action and whether the search is in the national interest. Under Korean law, searching top security sites with state secrets requires approval from the person in charge of the location. But the law prohibits the person from stopping the search unless it undermines the national interest.The ruling is expected Thursday at the earliest, given the court-issued search warrant is valid until Feb. 28 and the deadline for the investigation also ends on the same day. If their request is dismissed, it is “impossible” to execute the search warrant on the presidential office, the counsel team had earlier said. The counsel team has been investigating Park’s involvement in extorting donations from local firms for the K-Sports and Mir foundations, creating a blacklist of left-wing cultural figures and Choi’s meddling in state affairs -- key reasons behind Park’s impeachment. The lawsuit increases pressure on the presidential office amid the continued deadlock between President Park and the counsel team over its plan to question Park face-to-face.  Park’s lawyers and the counsel team are allegedly in the process of discussing the timing and location for the questioning. Park earlier called off the planned interrogation, accusing the team of leaking information to the media. The counsel team appears to have made another last-ditch effort to prove Park’s involvement in the scandal by requesting an arrest warrant for Samsung Group’s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong for the second time a day earlier. Lee is suspected of offering donations to the K-Sports and Mir foundations, both allegedly under Choi’s control, in return for the Park administration’s backing of its merger of two affiliates.By Ock Hyun-ju","corruption scandal involving president ,park had 590 calls ,the spiraling corruption scandal ,spiraling corruption scandal ,spiraling corruption scandal the","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Germany', 'Park', 'Choi']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27291173  0.7574802

This file photo taken on June 20, 2016, shows a court hearing under way on Sorok Island in South Korea's southwest for the judges to hear the testimonies on the abuse against lepers that were carried out by the state, including castrations and forced abortions. It was the top court's first ruling after lepers began their legal fight against the government that has been denying compensations.South Korea began to carry out forced abortions and vasectomies on leprosy patients in the 1930s during Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45. The practice, based on the false belief that the disease was hereditary, is known to have lasted until the 1990s.    ""In order to carry out the operations there should have been a legal basis and prior informed consent from the plaintiffs,"" the court said. ""The state failed to meet such conditions in practicing its authority.""Even if the plaintiffs gave a prior consent, they were forced to make such a decision based on prejudice, discrimination and poor social, educational and economic conditions without being fully informed of whether the disease was hereditary or if it can be cured,"" it added. Five other similar cases filed by some 500 plaintiffs are pending in local courts.","compensate 19 leprosy patients ,abortions performed decades ,abortions performed decades ago ,19 leprosy patients for ,pay 30 million won","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Supreme Court']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60027999  0.22169627

Also, the sanctions have prevented one of the restaurants from selling kimchi through local shopping malls.This provided photo shows a North Korean restaurant in Cambodia that has closed. Cambodia hosts the biggest number of North Korean restaurants except for China. Ten restaurants from the North have opened since 2003, when Pyongyang Cold Noodle Restaurant was launched in Phnom Penh. Half of them, however, were closed as of the second half of last year.The noodle restaurant specializing in ""naengmyeon,"" or cold buckwheat noodles, has ceased to offer kimchi to two shopping malls operated by Japan's retail giant Aeon and a Hong Kong-Cambodia joint venture.A source said the two shopping malls have decided not to deal with North Korean-made foodstuff due to anti-North Korean sentiment, adding, ""the annual sales from the malls are not so big at about $20,000. But it goes to show that North Korea is feeling the pinch, even in such a traditional ally as Cambodia.""The Cambodian government expressed concern about the North's nuclear and missile tests and urged the North to stop raising tensions on the Korean Peninsula twice last year.Cambodia is seen as keeping its distance from the North. It rejected the North's invitation to Prime Minister Hun Sena to visit Pyongyang and a visit to the Southeast Asian nation by North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong and North Korean ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam in the first half of last year.","sanctions north korean restaurants ,restaurants in cambodia struggle ,korean restaurants in cambodia ,halting pyongyang nuclear ,korean restaurant after another","['north korean', 'Cambodia', 'south korean', 'UN', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.26971895  0.49907467

Kim, 72, was fired from the head of the powerful Ministry of State Security in mid-January after the probe found the agency had abused its authority, according to Seoul's unification ministry. He was also demoted to major general from full general, it said.North Korea's security ministry has powerful authority as it screens so-called reactionary elements in society, supervises political prisoners' camps and arrests those who attempt to flee the country.The ministry said Kim was removed over the suspicion that the intelligence agency committed wrongdoings, including human rights violations, abuse of power and corruption. Such actions could have fueled resentment among the populace that the regime wants to control.RFA then said that all North Koreans that were contacted said the level of corruption by state security officials were becoming serious, with more asking for bribes.The spike in officials extorting money is the result of shortfalls in rations distributed by the state that is making everyone's lives difficult.","most koreans unaware ,most koreans unaware of ,koreans unaware of sacking ,report most north koreans ,sacked us based media","['North Koreans', 'US', 'Japan', 'Asia Press', 'North Koreans', ""Kim Won - hong 's"", 'Radio Free Asia', 'RFA', 'Jiro Ishimaru', 'Osaka']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65502661  0.5699631

Pyongyang has long claimed that the late leader was born in Samjiyon, although he is known, in reality, to have been born in Russia's far eastern Khabarovsk. The area is also propagandized as the sacred origin of the Korean revolution initiated by North Korea founder Kim Il-sung.The North, which installed a statue of Kim Jong-il in the town in September last year, has been spurring the development of the region, including remodeling public buildings, and building a military stadium and factories, to follow the current leader Kim Jong-un's instructions.","to hold mass rally ,000 north koreans plan ,mass rally near mt ,china on the birthday ,hold mass rally near","['North Koreans', 'China', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim', 'US', 'Yanggang Province', 'the Radio Free Asia', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.55274427  0.33083278

The foreign minister responded that he takes the request ""gravely"" and reiterated the government's official stance, the ministry said, referring to Seoul's repeated reservations about the civic group-established bronze sculpture. Yun also vowed efforts to develop South Korea-Japan relations ""tirelessly,"" the ministry said. The request by the Korean diaspora in Japan came as bilateral relations became icy over the girl statue before Japan's consulate in Busan, which symbolizes Korean women sexually enslaved by the imperialist Japanese Army during Japan's colonial control of South Korea from 1910-45.It was the second such statue erected by South Korean civic activists in front of a Japanese diplomatic mission following the other one in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul.In December 2015, Seoul and Tokyo signed a landmark deal to end their decades-old diplomatic row over the wartime atrocity, but the fence-mending efforts hit a snag as the countries failed to reach an agreement on the fate of the statues. South Korea has long said the government has no authority to remove the statues set up by civic activists.In protest, Japan recalled its ambassador to Seoul in mid-January. Before his meeting with the foreign minister, O told reporters that he hopes for easing the ongoing diplomatic friction between the two neighbors by removing the girl statue in the southern port city of Busan. ""I would be happy if that happens,"" O told reporters when asked whether he wants the girl statue to be relocated.Asked whether the statue issue serves as a major factor in hurting Japan-South Korea relations, he said, ""I think so.""O's remarks are in line with what he said in his New Year address. He emphasized that all the Korean residents living in Japan ""share"" the hope that the statue will be removed. He and other representatives of Mindan were in Seoul to meet with Yun. The meeting was arranged at the union to deliver the ""voices"" of Koreans living in Japan.Mindan is a pro-Seoul organization which was established in 1946, a year after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, to protect the rights and interests of Koreans living in Japan.O said that the worsening ties between Japan and South Korea is making it hard for Korean compatriots to live in Japan and go about their business.In welcoming the Mindan chief ahead of the meeting, Yun promised to make necessary efforts to improve bilateral relations, while asking the union to continue to serve as a ""bridge"" between the two countries.","korea remove girl statue ,girl statue before japan ,seoul removal of girl ,japan request seoul removal ,south korea remove girl","['korean', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'the Korean Residents Union', 'Yun Byung -']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0895201   0.1227719

The inter-Korean industrial complex, which used to serve as one of the few symbols of reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas, was shut down in February after Pyongyang's nuclear test earlier that year.

""Most ethnic Chinese regret that they came to North Korea and wish to return to China,"" the source was quoted as saying.Chinese residents in the North are expected to prepare for a singing event aimed at pledging allegiance to the family. They are also required to make donations to the authorities on the birthdays of Kim's father and late former leader Kim Jong-il and his grandfather and the country's founder Kim Il-sung, which fall on Feb. 16 and April 15, respectively, according to the source. The two birthdays are two of the North's biggest holidays.About why they have to glorify the Kim's family, the source said whether the authorities will approve of exit visas for trips out of the country depends on how cooperative they were in civilian obligations. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un Another source in South Hamgyong Province revealed that Chinese residents have to learn various songs and dances in preparation for the holidays and lay baskets of flower in front of statues of the two former leaders on those days, a must for those who are kept under surveillance of the Ministry of State Security.The source blamed the Chinese government for not taking enough measures to protect its own people in the North, claiming officials from the ministry even tortured some Chinese residents who provided monetary donations for recovering flood-stricken areas in North Hamgyong Province to the authorities last year.As of 2000, about 6,000 ethnic Chinese are known to live in the North.","most ethnic chinese regret ,korea demands ethnic chinese ,demands ethnic chinese pledge ,ethnic chinese regret that ,ethnic chinese pledge allegiance","['north korean', 'Chinese', 'chinese', 'Kim Jong - un', 'US', 'North Hamgyong Province', 'the Radio Free Asia', 'chinese', 'Kim', 'North Koreans', 'chinese']",3,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.33142698  0.35122013

This image, taken from the website of Choson Exchange on Feb. 2, 2017, shows a bottle of mineral water with a QR code attached. It forecast that QR codes will likely be a part of the convenience that they offer for ordering and information amid the proliferation of smartphones and the existence of more retailers joining competition.Since 2007, Choson Exchange has supported entrepreneurs and business-minded individuals in North Korea through workshops, internships, mentorships and scholarships inside and outside of the North, the website said. Singapore has built diplomatic relations with both South and North Korea, and is one of the biggest trading partners for North Korea in Southeast Asia.","teaches north koreans all ,korean goods singapore ngo ,korean goods singapore ,north koreans all about ,teaches north koreans","['Pyongyang', 'Choson Exchange', 'singaporean', 'North Koreans']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55021638  0.36882415

While the liberal Moon Jae-in is holding onto his firm, but slightly weakened lead, the nation’s acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn appears to be the biggest beneficiary of Ban’s unexpected exit from contention Wednesday. Hwang Kyo-ahn In the latest poll, conducted after Ban’s surprise announcement and released Thursday by Realmeter, Hwang saw his support jump to 12.1 percent, placing himself second only to Moon. With a remarkable 7.5 percentage point rise in less than a week, the acting president rose to second place, formerly held by the UN top official. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. An Hee-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea also pulled off a surprise rise, garnering 11.1 percent support. He took the third place. Moon’s popularity fell slightly to 26.1 percent from 29.1 percent last week. Of the three, only An has formally announced his presidential bid. An Hee-jung Moon is thought to be gauging the best timing to announce his candidacy, but Hwang has not yet made clear whether he plans to run. Political pundits say he appears to be harboring presidential ambitions, making high-publicity moves as the acting president filling in for the impeached President Park Geun-hye. President Park, impeached by the National Assembly on Dec. 9, is suspended from duty, pending a final verdict from the Constitutional Court on her fate. If the top court finalizes her impeachment, an election to pick a successor must be held within 60 days.If Hwang decides to run in the election, he would have to resign from his prime ministerial position at least a month before the election to declare his run. Calls are rising inside the beleaguered ruling Saenuri Party to push for Hwang’s candidacy in the presidential race, as Hwang is seen as the party’s best shot at salvaging its election chances after President Park Geun-hye’s scandal-ridden demise.But his moves are difficult to predict, as he is currently representing the incumbent Park administration as the acting leader of the nation.Other conservative candidates include Reps. Yoo Seong-min and Nam Kyung-pil of the splinter Bareun Party, which broke from Saenuri last December after the faction clashed with the party’s leadership of Park loyalists. The approval rates of the two presidential hopefuls edged up after Ban’s dropout but are still weak, with Yoo’s standing at 4.3 percent and Nam’s, 2 percent, falling far behind Hwang and other liberal candidates. Since his return to South Korea on Jan. 12, the former career diplomat had not been affiliated with any political party, thereby letting loose of his supporters to drift to presidential candidates across the aisle.It is not so clear where the unclaimed votes from Ban’s withdrawal are heading, but some liberal candidates saw increases in their approval ratings as well. As voting results are often seen as to be swayed by regionalism in South Korea, many of Ban’s supporters were thought to have come from the Chungcheong Province from which he hailed. If following this regional tendency, these voters may gravitate toward the Chungcheong Province-based candidate An. Opinions are divided over whether Ban’s exit help Moon’s chances. A competitor from the same party, Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung predicted it may even harm his support.“Though Moon is currently the No. 1 candidate of the left wing, he will have to hit a ceiling ,” Lee said in a local radio broadcast on Thursday. “Moon is indeed in a dominant position now, but has some limits to expanding the range of his supporters.”Another liberal presidential candidate, the People’s Party’s Ahn Cheol-soo, may benefit from Ban leaving the race. “The election dynamics are changing and Ban’s dropout can be seen as an opportunity for Ahn, as Ban and Ahn had somewhat similar centrist stances in politics. He can differentiate himself from other candidates now,” Myongji University politics professor Kim Hyung-joon said. Ahn has been teetering to hold some 10 percent of approval rate in polls, with the latest figure standing at 9.3 percent in Wednesday’s Realmeter poll. Still, Moon is thought to be in high spirits after the exit of his main rival Ban from contention.By Jo He-rim","south korean presidential contest ,presidential contest are shifting ,korean presidential contest ,korean presidential contest are ,south korean presidential","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Ban ’s', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.98005772  0.60753

Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the Democratic Party, proposed in his speech at the National Assembly on Thursday a broad liberal coalition, suggesting the center-left People’s Party work with his own. “If the Democratic Party and People’s Party form a unified front, many political pundits say a liberal victory is a virtual certainty,” he said. People’s Party’s counterpart, Park Jie-won, flatly rejected the proposal, saying Moon’s lead would not last long. “I have said this before but am repeating it again. That will never happen,” he said. “Once President Park’s impeachment is confirmed, we will see Moon’s lead disappear.

He cited a Senate committee finding that the government has no policy condoning unlawful killings and that the anti-drug campaign was being carried out ""within legal processes.''Duterte, a former government prosecutor, has defended the crackdown and says he and his top police officials have authorized law enforcers to open fire only when threatened by suspects.Police say the deaths of at least 35 policemen and three soldiers prove that suspects have fought back during raids.Duterte took office in June, and since then more than 7,000 suspects have been killed, including many slain in clashes with police. That is an average of 34 a day, Amnesty International noted. The deaths have alarmed Western governments, including the United States and the European Union.The rights group said its investigation found in several cases that ""witnesses described alleged drug offenders yelling they would surrender, at times while on their knees or in another compliant position. They were still gunned down.''It said police officers often appear to have planted evidence and falsified incident reports.It cited a police officer involved in the crackdown in Manila as saying that police and hired killers profit from the killings, with some law enforcers getting paid by funeral parlors for each body brought in.The group said it interviewed two killers involved in the campaign who were paid 10,000 pesos  by a police officer for each execution they carried out, adding they gunned down three to four suspects a week.On Monday, National Police chief Director-General Ronald Dela Rosa indefinitely stopped all police anti-drug raids and disbanded police anti-narcotics units after the anti-drug crackdown was used as a cover by a group of rogue officers to kidnap and kill a South Korean man for money in a still-unraveling scandal.The widely publicized scandal prompted Dela Rosa to form a counterintelligence force to cleanse the 170,000-strong police force of criminals and corrupt officers. He has tried to resign twice but Duterte, who has pledged to defend police enforcing his crackdown, has ordered him to stay on.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court prohibited a group of police officers from entering a slum community to stop them from threatening villagers who have accused the officers of ruthlessly killing four residents in an anti-drug raid.","killings are extrajudicial manila ,group says philippine killings ,philippine killings are extrajudicial ,suspects under philippine president ,says philippine killings are","['MANILA', 'Philippines', 'AP', 'philippine', 'Rodrigo Duterte', 'Amnesty International', 'London', 'Duterte']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61731535  0.43155664

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres The North is referring to a group of 13 North Koreans who defected to South Korea en masse in April 2016. The 12 female workers and one male manager had worked at a restaurant in China before escaping the country.Pyongyang has claimed that Seoul's spy agency lured them, calling for an immediate repatriation, but South Korea said that they defected on their own free will.North Korea said that families of the adbuctees previously sent similar letters to former UN chief Ban Ki-moon and top UN officials on human rights, but they did not get any reply.""We cannot but express our disappointment at the fact that no action has been taken by the UN until now as we have entered 2017 without even a reply to our letters,"" the KCNA said.North Korea claimed that Seoul's abduction constitutes a ""crime against humanity"" as the move resulted in the separation of families against their will.""How to deal with this case will be a touchstone testing the true stand of the UN for the promotion and protection of human rights,"" the letter stressed.Seoul's unification ministry said in August that the restaurant workers have begun to settle down in the South after undergoing a months-long assimilation program. They were, in addition, questioned about the reason for their defection. North Korean workers toiling overseas are pressed to send hard currency to the regime which faces economic hardship under a set of UN sanctions.","north korean women abducted ,korean women abducted ,women abducted by korea ,repatriation of women abducted ,korean women abducted by","['North Korea', 'UN', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'UN', 'UN', 'Antonio Guterres', 'Seoul', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          1.          3.         ... -0.50235087  0.2258703

Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn As for the rationale for the early deployment, Hwang stressed Pyongyang's evolving nuclear and missile threats as being ""obvious and real.""""North Korea's nuclear and missile threats are no longer  potential,"" he said, underscoring that last year alone, the unruly regime conducted two nuclear tests in January and September.""Its nuclear and missile capabilities are developing at an unprecedented rate,"" he stressed.Hwang has been serving as the acting president since Dec. 9 after President Park Geun-hye was impeached by parliament over a corruption scandal.In his opening remarks, Hwang reiterated his vow to push for seamless policy coordination with the newly launched U.S.administration on a set of key issues, including the nuclear standoff with North Korea.During the New Year's meeting with local reporters, Hwang also reiterated that his government will establish a robust security posture based on its self-defense capabilities and the Seoul-Washington alliance to ward off Pyongyang's possible provocations."" will push in earnest for seamless policy coordination  for the development of the South Korea-US alliance, the handling of North Korea's nuclear issue and the development of economic and trade relations,"" Hwang said.Over the past month or so, Seoul has been trying to establish ties with the new government in Washington by sending security and diplomatic officials to the US for talks with Trump's high-level aides.The move came amid concerns about shifts in the bilateral alliance that have been spawned by a series of Trump's election-year remarks. His remarks highlighted general skepticism about America's security alliances with South Korea and other nations, and free trade deals.Hwang also renewed his pledge to apply ""across-the-board"" pressure to the recalcitrant regime in Pyongyang to induce its denuclearization."" will continue to induce North Korea's denuclearization through the framework of across-the-board sanctions on Pyongyang that has been established through cooperation between Seoul and Washington and with the international community,"" he said.","south korea acting president ,against south korean businesses ,acting president defends thaad ,korea acting president ,korea acting president and","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'US', 'China', 'south korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50927645  0.14635932

The South Korean foreign ministry in turn called on Japan to stop making such ""deplorable"" claims. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida According to Kyodo News, a Japanese government official also pointed out that making such political declarations on an Olympic website is in violation of the Olympic Charter, and said an official with the Olympic organizing committee didn't offer a clear answer on PyeongChang's next steps.The English site for PyeongChang 2018 introduces Dokdo and its neighboring Ulleung Island as ""Korea's Easternmost Islands"" under its ""Republic of Korea Culture"" section. The accompanying blurb says, ""Dokdo holds a special place in the hearts of Koreans as they hold pride in defending Korea's easternmost reached territory.""Lee Hee-beom, president of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics organizing committee, said Japan's latest claims were ""preposterous.""""Dokdo is South Korean territory,"" he said.

Diplomatic tensions flared up between the two neighbors over a girl statue installed by a civic group on Dec. 30 in front of Japan's consulate in South Korea's southern port city of Busan.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work at Japan's front-line brothels.Japan has demanded the statue be removed immediately. In protest, Tokyo recalled its ambassador to Seoul early last week.The ambassador hasn't yet returned. Worries are growing that the issue could develop into greater friction after Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that Dokdo is Japan's own territory. He made the remark in response to a question about a push by the local assembly of South Korea's Gyeonggi Province to install yet another girl statue on the islets. Tokyo has repeatedly laid claim to the islets, which lies closer to South Korea in the East Sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The islets have long been a source of tension between the neighbors. Currently, South Korea has kept a small police detachment on the islets since 1954 and has made it clear that Tokyo's claims over the territory are groundless.","japan wartime sexual slavery ,diplomatic friction over girl ,friction over girl statue ,girl statue symbolizing japan ,symbolizing japan wartime sexual","[""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Tokyo']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57045197 -0.28585613

The obesity rate has been rising faster among young children from low-income families.According to recent data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, some 3.4 percent of children under 6 from the poorest 25 percent of families were obese in 2015, above the overall average of 2.8 percent. The richest 25 percent of families reported a rate of 2.6 percent. Overall, child obesity has doubled in seven years from 1.4 percent in 2008.“Kids from low-wage families are more exposed to high-calorie food, such as processed foods, fast food, instant noodles and snacks, since they are cheaper and more convenient,” said Cho Eun-kyu from the National Health Insurance Service’s health care division. The link between obesity and income is found across age and gender, being the most palpable among the young and among girls. Morbid obesity is more strongly tied to financial status, the ministry data shows. That obesity tends to run in the family works to reinforce this correlation between income and weight, experts pointed out. Low-wage parents are more likely to be obese themselves, and create an environment where their children are more likely to get fat, they explained. Dr. Kim Dae-joong of Ajou University Medical Center pointed to a study which shows when both parents are obese, children are 2.8 times more likely to become obese than the average child from parents of average weight. “Studies have shown that family members’ eating habits and diet patterns do have significantly influence on children’s health status, often a deciding factor behind children’s obesity,” said Kim, who is also a policy director at Korean Society for the Study of Obesity. Pediatrician Kim Ki-yeong said children of parents who both work often feed themselves on their own. “They are most likely not under adult supervision to regularly exercise or receive timely medical checkups for their health status,” he said. Cho of the National Health Insurance Service pointed out the perils of unsupervised, unbalanced diet patterns in children, warning eating habits developed in early age tend to continue into adulthood. The medical cost of obesity treatment is another issue. Kim Sung-hyun , 15, is 165 centimeters tall but weighs 95 kilograms, 40 kilograms heavier than his average peers. He is suffering complications of obesity that include high blood pressure and diabetes and has numerous times been advised to lose weight. Yet, the teenager said he has never visited a doctor for medical assistance in weight loss or bariatric surgery. Currently, the national health insurance does not cover costs for obesity-related medical procedures or surgeries. Health experts stress that the government should devise a policy measure to help obese children from the low-income families.  Currently, three different ministries -- the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and Ministry of Education -- have mapped out three different obesity-control policies to run until 2020. “The government should integrate them and concentrate more on improving South Korean’s heath,” said Moon Chang-jin, head of NHIS’s obesity control division.According to a Health Ministry white paper on obesity earlier this month, the authorities will expand support for morbid obesity patients and those with obesity-related disorders and push to revise the national health insurance system to cover medical treatments for obesity patients.It added that they would continue to promote a healthy diet and recipes using less sugar as well as alternatives, expanding the scope of the processed food subject to mandatory nutrition labeling to cereals, cocoa products, salad dressings and sauces.By Kim Da-sol","childhood obesity is more ,south korea your baby ,why childhood obesity is ,obesity is more prevalent ,childhood obesity is",['South Korea'],3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79744595  0.37071803

Two of them, sitting at the back, passed out after drinking it while the one who was sitting in the passenger seat didn't drink it.Upon arriving at the market, the sober woman tried to wake them up, to no avail, and went to check out the market alone, thinking the two fell asleep due to tiredness. She went back to the taxi around an hour later to find out they were still sleeping. The three then returned to the hotel. The next day, the two reported to the local police that they were sexually assaulted by the taxi driver.On Saturday night, the police summoned Chan for investigation.They soon detained him as the suspect partially admitted to the assault in his testimony.

Their spouses, on the other hand, spend slightly less than an hour on housework. Based on an analysis of the amount of time spent by married men and women on housework in 2014, the report showed a persistent gender gap over the sharing of housework and overall gender inequality in patriarchal Korean society, said the SFWF.“Married women have endured inequality when it comes to using their time for housework,” said the report. “Among them, those who have kids and work jobs are in a difficult position because they have to engage in paid and unpaid work at the same time.”Korea is one of the countries that ranks lowest in gender equality. According to a 2016 report by the World Economic Forum, Korea’s gender equality ranked 116th out of 144 countries surveyed. Women were found to have less opportunities in education, health services and political participation.  They spend about 2 hours and 20 minutes preparing meals and cleaning houses, seven times more than the amount of time spent by men, the SWFW report said. Women also spend more time taking care of children and pets, maintaining cars and buying groceries. Meanwhile, the report noted that men spend slightly less than seven hours at work compared to about 5 1/2 hours for women. Women, however, get 10 minutes less sleep per night than their husbands and spend less time eating meals. After work and on weekends, men have more than four hours of leisure time per day, 49 minutes more than women. Both genders devoted most of their free time to watching TV, playing computer games or surfing the internet. The report also showed that the higher the couple’s combined income, the less time they spend on household chores. A couple with 1 million won  of monthly income spend about 6 hours and 40 minutes per day doing housework, while those who earn more than 7 million won spent about five hours. By Yeo Jun-suk","korean women spend more ,korean women spend on ,south korean women spend ,mothers spend around hours ,korean women spend","['south korean', 'the Seoul Foundation of Women and Family']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58954126  0.87439513

There was no move by Japanese planes to approach Dokdo in the East Sea, a defense ministry official said. The intrusions into the zone by the Japanese military appear to be part of Japan's stepped-up efforts to respond to frequent flights by the Chinese military over the sensitive maritime region, he said. Air defense zones of the three neighbors overlap in the area.On Monday, 10 Chinese military planes flew into the Korean Air Defense Identification Zone near Ieodo, prompting South Korea to scramble 10 fighters, including F-15Ks.Previously, Chinese planes crossed into the KADIZ 59 times in 2016 and 62 times in 2015, according to the ministry.The Chinese authorities said its planes were conducting military drills there but Seoul's defense ministry didn't rule out the possibility that the flights were part of China's efforts to show its opposition toward the planned deployment of an advanced US missile defense system to South Korea this year.Since Seoul and Washington agreed to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here to defend against growing missile threats from North Korea, China expressed strong opposition to the plan, claiming that the system could be used against it. Beijing in particular has raised objection to the THAAD's powerful X-band radar which it claims compromises its security interests.  In 2013, South Korea expanded its own KADIZ to cover Ieodo after China included it in its own air defense identification zone, which is designed to give a country more time to check unauthorized planes that may pose security problems.","thursday japanese military planes ,says japanese planes breached ,japanese planes breached kadiz ,said thursday japanese military ,officials said thursday japanese","['Defense', 'Han Min - koo', ""South Korea 's"", 'Air Defense Identification Zone', 'japanese', 'Ieodo']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14880976  0.38799226

The demotion of other military leaders, including former defense chief Hyon Young-chul, also followed. Ri and Hyon were executed later. The theft of a computer also hints at the leakage of military secrets. In fact, Japan's NHK obtained a some 12,000-page confidential document of the North Korean army in 2014, and released a special program in June last year, in which it reported Ri Young-ho was purged for moving a military unit without prior permission. The document is known to have been drawn up based on a hard disc that had been tampered with at a North Korean military unit.","korean army seriously degraded ,based anti pyongyang civic ,seoul based anti pyongyang ,army seriously degraded ,north korean army third","['north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'anti - pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Third Corps']",3,"[ 0.          1.          3.         ... -0.43143147  0.40407875

429,429,Pyongyang’s plutonium stockpile grows to 50 kg: Seoul,"North Korea has made significant progress on its nuclear capability with its plutonium stockpile reaching 50 kilograms, which is capable of making up to a dozen fission bombs, according to South Korea’s 2016 defense white paper released Wednesday, The Defense Ministry’s biennial report said the communist state has scaled up its “Strategic Rocket Force” in charge of nuclear and missile warfare to 10,000 and cyber...","North Korea has made significant progress on its nuclear capability with its plutonium stockpile reaching 50 kilograms, which is capable of making up to a dozen fission bombs, according to South Korea’s 2016 defense white paper released Wednesday, The Defense Ministry’s biennial report said the communist state has scaled up its “Strategic Rocket Force” in charge of nuclear and missile warfare to 10,000 and cyber personnel to 6,800 as part of efforts to boost its asymmetric warfare capability.  The report assessed that Pyongyang has secured some 50 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium, up from the 40 kilograms estimated in the 2014 edition of its white paper. The volume is sufficient to manufacture around 10 nuclear weapons, as one bomb generally requires 4 to 6 kilograms of the material.  “We have come up with this number based on when its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon began operation  how much plutonium it has obtained after using it for nuclear tests,” a Defense Ministry official said on the customary condition of anonymity.  The North has been ratcheting up its threats to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US mainland. On Sunday, Pyongyang vowed to fire the missile “anytime at anyplace,” and its leader Kim Jong-un said the regime has reached the final stage of its ICMB development.   Reflecting Seoul’s mounting concerns, the paper underscored Pyeongyang’s increasing missile threat, describing for the first time that the North is developing the ICBM and submarine-launched ballistic missile and that it has finished deployment of the Scud-ER missile with a range of 1,000 kilometers.  The 2016 report described in detail information about Pyeongyang’s various ICBMs, including the KN-08 and KN-14 with a range of up to 12,000 kilometers as well as the SLBM that the North test-fired last August. Pyeongyang has yet to test-fire the KN-08 and KN-14, which were revealed during a military parade in 2012. “We decided to classify the KN-08 and KN-14 as ICBMs because we want to track their development process,” the Defense Ministry official said. “It is part of our efforts to figure out the missiles’ capabilities and technological process.” The white paper also noted that Pyongyang has made “considerable” progress in producing highly enriched uranium, another type of fuel for nuclear bombs. But the report did not provide information about the specific amounts of weapon-grade HEU -- a material produced by a centrifuge plant usually run in a secretive environment.  Meanwhile, North Korea has increased its number of cyberwarfare troops to 6,800 from 6,000 in 2014, said the paper, reflecting mounting concerns over the growing threat of North Korea’s cyberattacks targeting South Korea’s defense system and socioeconomic infrastructure.  Last December, the military intranet run by Seoul’s Defense Ministry was hacked for the first time, resulting in a number of military secrets being leaked. The ministry suspected Pyeongyang was behind the attack because the code used in the attack was similar to that previously used by North Korean hackers. “Recently, the North Korea military has reshuffled its organization,” said the paper, adding that Pyongyang’s General Staff Department, equivalent to Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, has created a new organization dealing with intelligence operation and increased military personnel for the mission.Kim Jong-un The paper noted that Pyongyang has increased the number of standing troops to 1.28 million in 2016 from 1.2 million two years earlier, highlighting the regime’s efforts to enhance conventional military power despite its decreasing population and shrinking economy.  Specifically, the army boasted 1.1 million troops, 80,000 higher than two years earlier. Among them, 100,000 were assigned to “strategic forces” dedicated to nuclear and missile warfare. The air force shrank from 120,000 to 110,000. The navy remained unchanged at 60,000. North Korea’s army has increased the number of corps-level units to 17 from 15, and division-level units by one to 82, the paper said. The newly established units are dedicated to massive construction missions such as building highways and monuments idolizing Kim Jong-un, it added. “North Korea believes that it will need a more unified command and control system for construction missions glorifying Kim’s legacy,” said the official. “They think the military is more suitable for doing such missions than civilian organizations.” By Yeo Jun-suk","plutonium stockpile reaching 50 ,dozen fission bombs according ,dozen fission bombs ,to dozen fission bombs ,pyongyang plutonium stockpile grows","['North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Defense Ministry ’s']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32061353  0.76410341

They were indicted Tuesday and charged with participating in an international bribery scheme.Former UN chief Ban Ki-moonBan Ki-sang, the 69-year-old brother of the former UN chief, and his son, Ban Joo-hyun, 38, arranged to pay a $500,000 bribe upfront to the head of a Middle Eastern sovereign fund to buy the complex for $800 million, and another $2 million payment when the deal was closed, according to the indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court.He allegedly blew the $500,000 on luxuries, including expensive restaurants and hotels and a penthouse apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, according to the indictment. A fourth man, Sang Woo, 35, of Edgewater, New Jersey, was also charged, with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the anti-bribery law.Lawyers for the four couldn’t immediately be contacted for comment. Bahn and Woo were arrested and were scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday, authorities said. Ban and Harris remain at large, authorities said. Landmark 72The skyscraper complex, known as Landmark 72, consists of two 48-story residential towers and a 72-story office tower that was the tallest in the region in 2012, when it was completed. It was built for about $1 billion by Keangnam Enterprises Ltd, a South Korean firm where Ban was a senior executive.In early 2013, the company struggled to make debt payments that were coming due and was looking for an investor or buyer who could ease the cash crunch, according to court records.Ban convinced the firm to hire his son to find an investor. Bahn, who also went by “Dennis,” was working for a New York commercial real estate broker at the time and stood to make a commission of at least $5 million, prosecutors said.Instead, the father-and-son team devised a scheme to bribe the unidentified Middle Eastern official through Harris, who held himself out as an insider who could use his influence to get the sovereign fund to buy the complex. Harris told Bahn to use the word ""roses"" for the bribe payment.Believing the bribe scheme would eventually work, Bahn allegedly created phony e-mails and other records to make it appear the deal with the sovereign wealth fund was coming together. It was ultimately forced into receivership, the indictment said.","nephew charged in bribery ,bribery scheme the brother ,pay million in bribes ,charged in bribery scheme ,their middleman stole the","['United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Hanoi', 'Vietnam', 'US']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57340622  0.16410217

The two sides agreed to work closely together to get China to vigorously enforce sanctions, he said. ""National Security Advisor-designate Flynn expressed a strong willingness to strengthen the Korea-US alliance, comparing the alliance to a sticky rice cake,"" Kim said at a briefing to South Korean correspondents.National Security Adviser-designate Michael Flynn waits for an elevator at Trump Tower in New York It is the latest in a series of remarks that Flynn has made to dispel concerns about the fate of the alliance and underscore the point that the incoming administration of Donald Trump will do everything to move relations with South Korea forward. Trump's election had raised questions about the fate of the alliance, as he has expressed deeply negative views of US security commitments overseas, as well as a willingness to withdraw 28,500 American troops from the South unless Seoul pays more for them. Since his election, however, Trump has shown signs of retreat from his campaign rhetoric, making remarks reaffirming the alliance with South Korea and filling some key posts with Flynn and other people valuing the alliance. The sides also reaffirmed their plan to deploy the THAAD missile defense system in the South, Kim said. ""THAAD is a purely defensive weapon. Its deployment is part of our self-defense measures,"" Kim said. ""As this is an issue pertaining to our sovereignty, we won't care even if China opposes it. The two countries reached consensus on making sure to deploy it as agreed and we will go as planned."" Seoul and Washington decided in July to deploy a THAAD battery to defend against North Korean missiles. China has strongly called for scrapping the decision, seeing the system, especially its powerful ""X-band"" radar, as a threat to its nuclear deterrent and other security interests, despite repeated assurances from Washington that the system is designed only to defend against the North.","tuesday sticky rice cake ,korea likening the relationship ,cake incoming us national ,said tuesday sticky rice ,sticky rice cake incoming","['Incoming US National Security', 'Mike Flynn', 'US', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Kim Kwan - jin']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05445224  0.54380071

433,433, THAAD tension brews after China sends planes to Korea's air zone,"Tension between South Korea and China flared up Tuesday after Beijing‘s fighter jets entered South Korea’s air defense zone without prior notice, amid protests from China over a US anti-missile system set to be installed here. According to the Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, some 10 Chinese military planes -- including bombers -- flew into the Korean air defense identification zone near the southern island of Jeju...","Tension between South Korea and China flared up Tuesday after Beijing‘s fighter jets entered South Korea’s air defense zone without prior notice, amid protests from China over a US anti-missile system set to be installed here. According to the Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, some 10 Chinese military planes -- including bombers -- flew into the Korean air defense identification zone near the southern island of Jeju between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday. The aircrafts also entered an equivalent air defense zone near the Tsushima Strait of Japan. In response, the South Korea military sent out 10 fighter jets, including F-15Ks and KF-16s. They sent a warning signal to the Chinese planes who, the Korean military said, were in and out of the KADIZ until they exit the area without conflict.It was not the first time that Chinese aircrafts have entered the area since it was expanded in 2013. This latest action has, however, prompted fresh speculation over China’s motive in light of its clashes with Seoul over its decision to station the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here. “ gave us the answer that it was for training purposes,” said a JCS official on the customary condition of anonymity. “We believe they have a different purpose at different times. It needs further analysis to find out what they were getting at.” Beijing has adopted a series of retaliatory measures against Seoul since it reached an agreement with the US to deploy the THAAD battery here last July. Not only did China impose punitive trade measures against Korean companies, it has even banned Korean actors and actresses from appearing on its shows.During a meeting on Jan. 4 with lawmakers of Korea’s main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi condemned Seoul’s decision to deploy THAAD, saying the process should be “delayed and frozen” if South Korea wants to expand cooperation with Beijing.Air defense identification zones have been a friction point among Northeast Asian countries who have endured decadeslong territorial disputes. The conflicts have been further exacerbated by China, which has recently become assertive over its territorial claims, prompting protests from neighboring states.   Particularly, Beijing’s ADIZ in the East China Sea unveiled in 2013 drew protests from Korea, Japan and the US, as it includes spaces over the South Korea-controlled Ieodo, a submerged rock located around 150 kilometers southwest of Jeju, as well as a chain of islands controlled by Japan and claimed by China. The measure prompted Korea and Japan to declare their own ADIZs. Seoul, for its part, expanded its own KADIZ to cover Ieodo, on which it has scientific research facilities. Prior to the expansion, Korea’s ADIZ, demarcated by the US in 1951 during the Korean War, did not cover Ieodo. Since the ADIZs are not officially recognized airspace, military officials noted, states are not able to exercise sovereign rights to evict aircrafts flying over them. Instead, individual states can issue warnings to other nations who enter the area without prior notice. “Under the KADIZ, we are only allowed to detect and track unidentified aircrafts. We are not able to take forcible measures to evict those who intrude in the zone. It is different from what we can do in the airspace,” said the JCS official. According to the JCS, Chinese military planes intruded into the KADIZ on more than a dozen occasions last year. But the incident Monday was “unusual,” they said, because it involved more than 10 aircrafts. In 2015, there were only few aircrafts flying into the area. Mounting tensions over the air defense areas has spurred the call for building a proper communication channel between Korea, China and Japan -- such as to inform each other of their entry into the areas and to take preventive measures to prevent potential armed conflicts. Currently, the three countries are not obliged to notify each other of their entry into the ADIZs, the JCS said. South Korea often shares flight information with Japan when their aircrafts fly along the ADIZs under bilateral agreement. It has not yet to make such a pact with China.By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday after beijing fighter ,10 chinese military planes ,amid protests from china ,china flared up tuesday ,beijing fighter jets entered","['South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'US', 'the Korea ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Jeju']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28228059  0.64991617

For 2-year-olds, the average is 2.6 times a week and 47.6 minutes per session. The findings are based on a survey conducted between August and October last year on 1,241 parents with children aged 2 or 5. There were 537 of them with 2-year-olds and the remaining 704 had 5-year-olds.Multiple signs for hagwons, or cram schools, are seen in downtown Seoul Korean language, sports and arts were the most common subjects for private education for the children, followed by English. The report encompassed private academies, known as hagwon here, as well as private tutoring and home learning programs. In many cases, 5-year-olds attend normal kindergarten classes by day and go to a hagwon for after-school studies, the report found. The after-school sessions last as long as four hours, it added.  Nearly 70 percent of the surveyed parents with 2-year-olds said the level of their child’s education was adequate, with 27 percent saying it was not enough. As for those with 5-year-olds, 54.3 percent of the parents said their education level was adequate, while 40 percent said they needed more. “Children, especially at a younger age, should be able to build a healthy relationship with their parents during the critical early years, which would later help them to get along with their peers. Spending most of their time at a hagwon is a hurdle to the process,” Kim Eun-young, who headed the study, told The Korea Herald. She warned that excessive education at an early age could led to notable problems, such as depression and lack of concentration, or even the development of aggressive forms of behavior.  By Bak Se-hwan","year old korean kid ,korea receive private education ,50 minutes per session ,old korean kid receives ,korean kid receives private","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education', 'korean']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3211022   0.23637623
