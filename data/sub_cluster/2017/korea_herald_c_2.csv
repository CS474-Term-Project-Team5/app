And the North Korean leader is putting his money where his mouth is.On the outskirts of Pyongyang, surrounded by snow-covered farms and greenhouses, stands one of Kim's latest pet projects, the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory, which produces 4,200 tons of the iconic Korean pickled vegetable dish a year. The shiny new facility replaces an older factory and opened in June last year after getting Kim's final seal of approval, according to manager Paek Mi Hye. In this Dec. 20, 2017, photo, workers prepare kimchi on the production line at the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory on the outskirts of Pyongyang, North Korea. The factory is a showcase of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s efforts to boost the country’s domestic economy and produce more, and better, consumer products. The strategy, known as “byungjin,” is intended to simultaneously develop the national economy and North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. The factory is intended to showcase Kim's efforts to boost North Korea's domestic economy and produce more, and better, consumer products. His strategy, known as ""byungjin,"" aims to simultaneously develop the national economy and North Korea's nuclear weapons program.North Korea's repeated underground nuclear tests and launches of long-range missiles that could conceivably reach the U.S. mainland have brought more sanctions down on the North than ever before. But outside experts believe the country — while still struggling in many areas — is showing signs of modest economic growth and improved agricultural production. It could be just a year or two away from having an operational, nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.Applied science, according to the North's policymakers, is absolutely essential on all fronts.Kim has transformed the Pyongyang skyline with high-rise apartments to house his prized rocket scientists and nuclear engineers, and Paek repeatedly stressed while giving a tour of the facility to The Associated Press how even an ancient delicacy like kimchi can benefit from scientific innovation.Paek, who accompanied Kim on his ""on-the-spot guidance"" visits, said the factory has 150 workers but is for the most part automated.She said the primary objective of the factory is to operate in a ""scientific manner at every stage."" In kimchi-making, that means inspections all along the production line to ensure quality and hygiene. The factory boasts of a one-of-a-kind ""kimchi analyzer"" to maintain the proper levels of saltiness and lactic acid — its signature ingredient. In this Dec. 20, 2017, photo, manager Paek Mi Hye holds a package of kimchi produced at the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory on the outskirts of Pyongyang, North Korea.

Koreans North and South have been making kimchi for generations, often passing family recipes down from mother to daughter or mother-in-law to daughter-in-law.In 2015, UNESCO added kimchi to its ""intangible cultural heritage of humanity"" list, noting that the traditional sharing of know-how and materials to prepare large quantities of kimchi for the winter months ""boosts cooperation among families, villages and communities, contributing to social cohesion.""Paek acknowledged that some people might resist giving up the cherished tradition of communal kimchi-making. ""But they also recognize the quality and reliability of our factory-made product,"" she said.The factory produces eight kimchi products, from the very spicy staple ""tong kimchi,"" which has a red tint and is made of whole cabbages, to a milder variety designed for children. Its kimchi products are distributed to restaurants and grocery stores around Pyongyang.""This is the model,"" Paek said.

She is boycotting the trial, claiming the court is biased against her and she is a victim of political vendetta. Nevertheless, her trial continues and many expect a verdict in early 2018.Kim Jong-unKim Jong-un When Kim Jong-un took on the mantle of North Korea’s leadership in 2011, the world knew little about him, except that he appeared to be in his late 20s and seemed to lack the experience required for the job.Throughout 2017, however, this enigmatic man commanded the attention of the world like none other, shooting missiles, experimenting with nukes, and trading war threats with US President Donald Trump. In February, he allegedly sent assassins to kill his half brother Kim Jong-nam at a busy airport in Malaysia.The North’s decadeslong ambition of acquiring a military balance with the world’s greatest power had long been considered domestic propaganda, but it has become a more feasible scenario under Kim Jong-un’s reign.On Nov. 21, the regime claimed that it had completed its nuclear development and that it now has a nuclear-tipped intercontinental missile that could strike the US mainland. The US and South Korea refuted the claim, but acknowledged that the North is progressing faster than expected.Donald TrumpUS President Donald Trump US President Donald Trump has been turning up the heat on North Korea, one of the crucial policymaking areas of his controversial presidency.The North’s missile tests and other provocations triggered a slew of Trump’s trademark provocative remarks on the communist country and its leader Kim Jong-un.Trump warned Pyongyang that Washington would not tolerate what he called “nuclear blackmail.” In a recent statement, Trump pledged a campaign of “maximum” pressure against the Kim regime. Trump reiterated that the US’ goal is to denuclearize the North, saying that it could not allow Pyongyang to threaten the US or its allies with powerful weapons that could lead to a huge loss of life.He also said that the Asia-Pacific region is being held hostage by Kim’s “twisted fantasies.”Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in is striving to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula by maintaining close relations with Trump.Kang Kyung-whaMinister Kang Kyung-wha With her silvery hair, impeccable English and an even more impressive UN career, many Koreans were fascinated with Kang Kyung-wha when her nomination as foreign minister was announced.Her path to the top diplomat post, however, was a little bumpy. The parliament, controlled by opposition parties, rejected her over what they saw as “ethical lapses” in the past.President Moon Jae-in, only one month into the job at the time, risked a rift with the parliament to appoint her on June 17.As foreign minister, Kang has taken on the task of untangling a web of thorny diplomatic challenges facing South Korea, involving the US, China, Japan and North Korea.BTSBTS 2017 has been a notable year for BTS, the most successful K-pop group in history. The seven-piece group that debuted under Big Hit Entertainment in 2013 spent this year making history on charts, receiving awards, collaborating with EDM stars and appearing on US TV shows. The group became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards in November and the first to win a Billboard Music Award for top social artist in May. The group’s recent single “DNA” peaked at No. 67 on Billboard’s Hot 100, the highest record on the chart for a K-pop act.Park Sung-hyunPark Sung-hyun LPGA sensation Park Sung-hyun became only the second LPGA rookie ever to win the money title, the Rookie of the Year and the Player of the Year honors in one season, after Nancy Lopez. Park rose to No. 1 in the world rankings in November for a week. Before the US stint, Park dominated the Korea LPGA Tour by winning seven times and setting a single-season record with over $1.2 million in earnings.Kim Sang-joFTC Chairman Kim Sang-jo The Moon Jae-in government’s chaebol reform drive came amid intense public calls to eradicate backdoor deals between officials and conglomerates that were laid bare by the Park Geun-hye scandal. At the center of the chaebol crusade stands the chief of the nation’s antitrust watchdog, who was an activist for shareholders’ rights and an outspoken scholar, which earned him the nickname “chaebol sniper.”Since taking office in June, Fair Trade Commission Chairman Kim Sang-jo has made it clear that the regulator may have to step in if the chaebol fail to show willingness to reform their opaque governance structures blamed for keeping chaebol scions in power, even with relatively small shareholdings.Changes are slowly being made, with some conglomerates voluntarily cutting their cross-shareholding structures. But it remains unclear what actions will be taken next year or how harsh the response will be if their actions fail to satisfy the man leading the chaebol reform.","korea first female president sarcastically ,fantasies meanwhile south korean president ,scandal tainted president park geun ,south korean president moon jae ,korean president moon","['Moon Jae - inpresident Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hyeFormer', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park Geun - hye', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the Blue House', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Jong - unKim', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Malaysia', 'North ’s', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'US', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Donald', 'Donald Trump', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'North ’s', 'Trump ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Trump', 'Kim', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Kim', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Trump', 'Kang Kyung - whaMinister', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'UN', 'Koreans', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kang', 'South Korea', 'US', 'China', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'BTS', 'Big Hit Entertainment', 'EDM', 'US', 'the American Music Awards', 'Billboard ’s', 'Park Sung - hyunpark', 'Park Sung - hyun', 'LPGA', 'the Rookie of the Year', 'Nancy Lopez', 'US', 'Park', 'the Korea LPGA Tour', 'Kim Sang - joFTC', 'Kim Sang - jo', 'Fair Trade Commission', 'Kim Sang - jo']",2,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.78380108  0.79382956

5,5,Park administration kept parts of ‘comfort women’ agreement secret,"The Park Geun-hye administration kept parts of the 2015 Korea-Japan agreement on Japan’s wartime enslavement of Korean women in the dark, a South Korean task force confirmed Wednesday.

The administration also pushed the deal despite the pact falling short of fundamentally resolving related issues. A group of activists address the 2015 ""comfort women"" agreement outside the Central Government Complex in Seoul on Wednesday. “A victim-centered approach, which has become the norm when it comes to the human rights of women in times of war, was not sufficiently reflected and the deal was reached through give-and-take negotiations like an ordinary diplomatic agenda,” a Foreign Ministry task force review released Wednesday said.The report addresses the controversial agreement signed between the Park government and Tokyo in 2015, which pushed both nations to “finally and irreversibly” put the “comfort women” issue behind them. “Comfort women” is a euphemism for women who were forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese military during World War II.“The previous administration under former President Park Geun-hye used resolving the comfort women issue as a prerequisite to improving bilateral ties between South Korea and Japan, but its inflexible responses resulted in several burdens,” it added. A team of nine public officials and experts looked into the yearslong negotiations and related procedures in the run-up to the announcement of the accord on Dec. 28, 2015, in a series of 20 meetings held over five months. A comprehensive database of relevant documents were provided by the Foreign Ministry here. The report said that the decision-making power was excessively concentrated in Cheong Wa Dae at the time and the South Korean government was incapable of separating historical issues from security and economic issues, when dealing with the matter. It noted insufficient cooperation and communication between the presidential office and the Foreign Ministry. The task force also confirmed the speculation that the previous government compromised too much and that this was undisclosed to the public to avoid backlash. Among the talks kept in secret, Japan told Seoul to refrain from supporting relevant civic groups disagreeing with the deal and to stop using the phrase “sexual slavery.” It also requested detailed plans regarding “girl statues” installed in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. Japan has often expressed its displeasure over civic groups’ movement to build “girl statues” embodying comfort women across South Korea and in other countries. In response to Japan’s requests to remove the statues, the South Korean government said it had no authority to stop them but vowed to persuade the civic groups through consultation. The South Korean government also leaned toward Japan’s opinion on choosing a phrase to describe the victims and affirmed the official term as “comfort women.”“The undisclosed agreements did not directly block the South Korean government from relocating ‘girl statues’ nor using the expression ‘sexual slavery,’ but provided the Japanese government with an excuse to get involved in matters,” the report said. The task force also said that despite the agreement, the issue remains largely “unresolved,” as the victims have not yet embraced it as a form of apology. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Wednesday acknowledged a significant lack of communication with “comfort women” victims here, in reaching the agreement. The report also shed light on Japan’s reluctance in acknowledging “legal responsibility,” which the victims and civic groups here view as a sign that Japan is not ready to make a formal apology. Instead, Tokyo made a 1 billion yen  financial contribution to a victims’ trust fund created by the agreement as its reparations mechanism, the report noted, but refused to link the money to any legal responsibility.“Following the agreement, Japan has been saying that the fund is not linked to any legal responsibility,” it said.“Several victims and civic groups have said they cannot accept it, as it is not compensation. Thus, unless the issues surrounding ‘responsibility’ is completely resolved, the ‘comfort women’ issue remains fundamentally unresolved even if the victims received the money.”The report said the size of the fund was not set through an “objective standard of calculation” and the task force failed to find records showing that the South Korean government took the victims’ opinions into consideration during negotiations. It said that Japan is refusing to acknowledge formal legal responsibility for its actions because it believes the “comfort women” issue was already resolved through the deal. But acknowledgement of legal responsibility for its crime was one of the key demands of the victims. On the term “irreversible” in the agreement, the task force said South Korea initially used the word to make Japan’s apology more “official,” but it was later distorted in context when Tokyo used it to describe the “comfort women” issue, in subsequent talks. Although it did not make any policy recommendations, the task force advised the government to come up with long-term solutions in dealing with historical issues. “It is difficult to resolve a historical problem such as the comfort women issue through short-term diplomatic negotiations or political compromise. There should be longer-term efforts for the spread of values, awareness and education for future generations.”Kang said in Wednesday’s press briefing that the government will “faithfully” accept the task force results and carefully form a stance on the issue, with South Korea-Japan relations in mind. “Based on the findings, the government will gather opinions of the victims and others involved going forward with a focus to be placed on a victims-centered approach,” Kang said. “In addition, action will be taken carefully in consideration of any impact that it could have on the relations between South Korea and Japan.”President Moon Jae-in in May said he will revisit the deal, and the current administration said it would pursue a two-track approach of separating historical issues from diplomatic ties to Japan. Historians estimate up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery. There are currently 32 surviving “comfort women” victims in South Korea. By Jung Min-kyung","korean government from relocating girl ,in seoul on wednesday victim ,wartime enslavement of korean women ,seoul on wednesday victim centered ,address the 2015 comfort women","['Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'south korean', 'the Central Government Complex', 'Seoul', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Cheong', 'south korean', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Kang', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Jung Min - kyung']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2478608   0.00239367

YonhapThe idea of postponing joint drills that coincide with the games was first publicly raised by President Moon Jae-in during an interview with US broadcaster NBC on Dec. 19. The Winter Olympics will take place from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25 and the Paralympics from March 9 to March 18. Seoul and Washington are reportedly discussing possible options in changing the dates of the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises. Speaking to VOA, Burwell Bell, a retired US Army general who served as the USFK commander from 2006 to 2008, said that carrying out drills during the games is undesirable. Bell, however, stressed that the drills should be carried out immediately after the games, and that military readiness cannot be a tool in negotiating with North Korea. “Any notion by anyone that exercises should be postponed to achieve some kind of diplomatic engagement is wrong. I agree they could be postponed for  very short period of time so as to accommodate the conducts of the Olympics, but it is crucial that those exercises be conducted to their full range of requirements immediately following the Olympics,” Bell was quoted as saying by VOA. Should the allies compromise their military readiness to deal with Pyongyang, troops and citizens of the two countries would be put in danger, Bell said, adding that he would then advise the US to end the alliance. Bell also said that until China takes a more active role, war is the only option the US has in preventing North Korea from becoming capable of carrying out a pre-emptive nuclear strike. “Quite frankly, until China decides that is in their best interests for the North to give up their nuclear weapons, nothing we can do short of going to war will stop the North’s efforts to gain nuclear first strike capability. This is in China’s hands.”Similar views were echoed by Bell’s predecessors James Thurman and John Tilelli. Thurman, who held the post from 2011 to 2013, told VOA that he thinks that changing the dates of the drills should be considered. Thurman, however, warned that North Korea must not be allowed to take possible changes in the dates as signs that the allies are trying to appease the regime, saying that such measures have failed in the past. “I think the exercises are essential to maintaining the required readiness to defend the peninsula and to protect the South Korean people,” Thurman said. “If North Korea is interested in reducing tensions, they need to quit launching and testing ballistic missiles and denuclearize. The military drills are necessary to maintaining the readiness required by the alliance.”Tilelli, who led the USFK between 1996 and 1999, also said that there may be value in delaying the drills, but emphasized that joint drills are central to the allies’ military readiness.

And they just kept filling in the plot. The sheer scale of construction seemed to suggest it was done by the private sector rather than the state.” The Future Scientist Avenue in Pyongyang Yim, an assistant professor at Hongik University’s Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design, noted that sea changes have taken place in Pyongyang over the last five years under Kim Jong-un. The third-generation autocrat vowed to remake his country through a dual-track national development strategy known as the “Byungjin line,” pursuing nuclear and economic development simultaneously.As the international community piles sanctions on the North for its reckless military provocations, Pyongyang, time and time again, seems to defy expectations of being pressured to abandon its nuclear aspirations. By continuing the construction of towering buildings and new blocks, the regime legitimizes its ability to withstand external threats and consolidates its grip on power, analysts say.  Yim Dong-woo, assistant professor at Hongik University’s Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design Socialist city on the moveFor starters, Pyongyang is unlike any other city in the world. Built on the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War that reduced the city to rubble, Pyongyang was designed by architect Kim Jung-hee  who was commissioned by North Korean founder Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong-un. Having studied at Moscow Architectural Institute from 1947-53, Kim Jung-hee masterminded Pyongyang as a “socialist city” built on modernist urban planning principles, as previously theorized by visionary architect Le Corbusier.Unlike capitalist cities that prioritize economic efficiency, and consequently agglomerate, socialist cities place spatial equality above everything else and attempt to materialize equality in the built space. As an example, they are designed to provide equal distances between home and work through a concept called the “microdistrict” -- a self-sufficient neighborhood that incorporates residences, factories, shops, schools, day care centers, health care facilities, leisure spaces and more.According to Yim, who authored “Unprecedented Pyongyang” and “Pyongyang and After Pyongyang” as well as other papers on its urban planning, design and architecture, the showpiece capital can be analyzed through the prisms of productive space, ideological space and ecological space.North Korea’s accelerating marketization over the last two decades -- triggered by the breakdown of the rationing system following the “arduous march” of the 1990s -- has meant that construction is now largely driven by money. Vast networks of corrupt, kleptocratic relationships exist between bureaucrats and the nouveau rich known as “donju.”  Mansudae Apartment blocks in Pyongyang Yim’s research has focused on the potential transformation of Pyongyang and North Korean cities after the prospective fall of the regime. By studying the capitalist renewal of Eastern and Central European cities as well as Chinese cities, one can gauge the metamorphoses that North Korean cities might experience, he said. “The concept of microdistrict is interesting,” Yim continued, noting that although microdistricts do not seem to be built or used any longer in large quantities, they hold the key to unlocking North Korean neighborhoods’ potential for locally centered development. He is the co-founder and principal of architectural design and research firm Praud, and studied at Seoul National University and Harvard University. Yim’s work on Pyongyang has recently been displayed at the Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism at Dongdaemun Design Plaza.“I heard from a Japanese economist who has traveled to North Korea numerous times that various self-sufficient micro initiatives are happening across neighborhoods. As an example, women produce clothes within a cooperative and sell them to their neighbors for a profit.”Such a basic form of autarkic production and consumption may act as a seedbed of entrepreneurship once capitalism rushes in systematically, he conjectured, a view empirically substantiated by aggrandizing businesses in European cities transitioning from communism to capitalism. Yim also pointed to models of locally based sustainable production and consumption that have gained global traction, such as the sharing economy and urban farming. “The point of these initiatives is to make our society more wholesome and healthful,” he said.Providing spaces for consumption will be one of the most fundamental issues following a hypothetical unification, Yim asserted. A North Korean family plays music at home in Pyongyang. “Looking at the experiences of former communist Europe, we know that providing spaces for commerce is critical. The Eastern and Central Europeans, long starved of shopping, went ecstatic over buying after the Iron Curtain fell,” he said. Although one can’t predict how Pyongyang and other North Korean cities will change after unification, it is possible to illuminate the proper directions they should take to be economically vibrant and sustainable, he added. Yim suggested the underground and surrounding areas of Kim Il-sung Square to be developed as an integrated commercial space -- encompassing convention centers, hotels and other shopping and cultural amenities -- similar to Seoul’s Coex, or retail and cultural venues encircling Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.“The hammer and the sickle and communist propaganda posters are likely to be replaced by advertisements of Samsung, LG, Apple and Hallyu celebrities,” forecast the architect. “Another foreseeable change is the commodification and gentrification of waterfront areas, as they have latent property and aesthetic value. The Future Scientist Avenue on Taedong River across Yanggak Island is a recently developed, posh area, and has a lot of potential for commercialization.” North Koreans mourn the death of the late Kim Jong-il on the sixth anniversary of his death on Dec. 17 at the Kumsoonsan Palace of the Sun, one of many ideological sites in the revolutionary capital Pyongyang. Potemkin city Pyongyang, the showpiece capital of the country with an estimated population of over 25 million, is home to 3 million residents, some 500,000 of whom constitute the regime’s core. It has been cultivated over the years to flaunt the Kim dynasty’s insuperable ideology and the nation’s heroic struggle against its archenemies “American imperialists.”“Ideological architecture has existed eternally with mankind and operated actively on people’s ideological consciousness across generations,” wrote the late Kim Jong-il in “Theory on Architectural Art.” “Therefore, architecture is not limited to the question of technical engineering, but ultimately arrives at the question of ideology and thought.”In his “Architectural and Cultural Guide Pyongyang,” German architect Philipp Meuser described Pyongyang as “an experimental city under hermetic surveillance, where all lives are compartmentalized succinctly; an outdoor museum that most visibly preserves the socialist architectural style.”“Those who visit Pyongyang feel an eerie perfection in its cityscape compared to cities in democracies,” he added.Once spawned as a socialist city, Pyongyang, not immune from market forces, has metamorphosed over the years to become something of a jumbled metropolis. People walk before the statues of late North Korean leaders Kim Il-Sung  and Kim Jong-Il after laying flowers to mark the sixth anniversary of the death of the late Kim Jong-Il, at Mansu hill in Pyongyang on Dec. 17, 2017. The period of 1945-53 after the Japanese colonial rule and internecine war saw buildings constructed in a style that combined traditional and modern forms. The postwar period from 1953-60 was marked by flats in the modernist-socialist style, modeled after the townhouses and multistory row houses of Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Brigades of prefabricated apartments were hastily manufactured through the early 1970s, leading to the expression “Pyongyang speed,” as a housing unit was reputedly completed every 14 minutes.The period after the mid-1970s witnessed the construction of high-rise apartment blocks, accelerating into the 1980s and early 1990s with super high-rise blocks of 20- to 40-story buildings on Munsoo Street, Changgwang Street, Budnamu Street, Ansangtaek Street, Chollima Street, Gwangbok Street and Tongil Street. Unlike South Korean cities that are administratively organized into “dongs,” or districts, in North Korean cities streets dominate the landscape.Not much was built in the 1990s due to the country’s economic collapse. But since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011, he has invested much of his energy into pet projects in Pyongyang. Changjon Street and Ryomyong Street have been the centerpieces of his vertical ambition, housing 4,300 luxury residential units in 55- to 70-story buildings. He even instituted a state agency and research center commissioned with overseeing the nighttime lighting of iconic streets, buildings and monuments. “It seems that North Korean policymakers don’t understand where to invest money to grow the economy,” opined Seoul National University economics professor Kim Byung-yeon. “Kim Jong-un seems to think that making a country modern requires building modern apartments. But rather, super high-rise buildings are a symptom of North Korea’s economic malaise and inequality. Money gravitates toward construction because it can’t be invested elsewhere.”  The interior of a North Korean model house displayed at the Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism at Dongdaemun Design Plaza. The donju collude with power institutions and brokers to build apartments, bribing and giving them half of what’s to be constructed and selling the remainder on the market, notes Dong-a Ilbo journalist Joo Seong-ha, who escaped from North Korea in 1998. The price of the most sought-after apartment units in Pyongyang can fetch anywhere from $150,000 to $200,000, say defectors, and residents who occupy these luxury homes enjoy a lavish lifestyle.There are reportedly even sales of units before construction begins, a system likely copied from South Korea’s real estate industry. Speculative investment also exists, leading in some cases to real estate bubbles.Rich children of the People’s Republic, making up the “1 percent,” live in what has been dubbed “Pyonghattan” to describe the parallel universe of top-down privilege and wealth, according to a Washington Post article last year. It claimed the wealthy there wear Zara and H&M; clothes, drink cappuccinos, eat top-grade steak, go under the knife for cosmetic makeovers and run on treadmills at health clubs.It has become vogue among economic elites to refashion their home interiors in the style of posh residences in the South. Taking inspiration from South Korean interior magazines and TV dramas, some donju and high-ranking bureaucrats splurge up to $6,000 on furnishings, such as ritzy large-scale mirrors, bidet-added toilets and security camera-equipped automatic doors, reported Daily NK. Soldiers from units originally tasked with construction toil night and day to do the work.  A photo taken on November 15, 2017 shows a general view of a street in central Pyongyang. North Korea's sprint towards full-fledged nuclear statehood accelerated sharply in 2017, raising fears about a devastating atomic exchange to levels not seen since the Cold War. But underneath the glitz, homes are dilapidated, in short supply and poorly supplied with water, heating, sewage and electricity. Particularly in winter, those living in high-rise apartments, where central heating is a luxury, are known to move to relatives’ residences heated by coal or solar panels, or elsewhere through a broker. Because the elevators in many apartments don’t operate due to power shortages, the lower floors are more expensive, reporter Joo pointed out. “In contrast to South Korea where the upper floors are a symbol of status and wealth, in Pyongyang people try hard to ‘climb down’ to the lower floors, often paying lucrative sums,” he said. The reckless speed at which construction and demolition are carried out frequently leads to on-site deaths and shoddy structures, periodically resulting in the collapse of buildings. A building collapsed on Ryomyong Street in April last year, reportedly killing some 60 workers, and in May 2014, a 23-story apartment crumbled and killed an estimated 300 residents. Sustainable city Come unification and capitalism, how would Pyongyang change? Or how should it change to keep pace with the times? Once the restriction on freedom of movement and right to live in Pyongyang is lifted, people will flock toward the city in search of work and opportunities, according to Seoul National University professor Choi Mack-joong, who teaches urban planning at the Graduate School of Environmental Studies. Choi Mack-joong, professor at Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Environmental Studies Choi advised creating satellite cities around Pyongyang, or new towns inside the city, to accommodate newcomers. As most of the housing stock would be outdated and structurally unstable, large-scale reconstruction is inevitable, he added. “It’s vital to legally recognize their private residential ownership, which formally belongs to the state now. We should grant people the right to buy and sell homes in a market,” Choi said in an interview at his office. “That would vitalize a property market, creating market-based prices based on which people could establish their material basis of life. It would also reduce economic gaps between North and South Koreans.” One likely contentious issue from the process is vast economic inequality between the haves and have-nots, as amply evidenced in former communist Europe. But it is important to incentivize the elites toward unification by promising their continuing prosperity, the professor contended. Similar to the East Germans, “The single biggest concern for North Koreans will be how they can live stable, prosperous lives, as opposed to some lofty political ideology,” he said. “It is critical to spread the message that unification would lead to that.”  A street in Pyongyang Choi stressed that policies should protect Pyongyang’s urban characteristics and cultural and historical heritage. Similar to Eastern European cities, some of Pyongyang’s ideological space -- as sites of identity and character -- could be preserved rather than demolished, he advised. One illustrative case of a former communist structure being used into capitalism is the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest, Romania. Built by Romania’s last communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, a close ally to Kim Il-sung who bulldozed Bucharest in the image of Pyongyang, the palace is the world’s largest administrative building, housing the Romanian parliament, three museums and an international conference center. “For Pyongyang to become a city of life from a mythical, fossilized city, it’s important to create open channels of communications between citizens,” said professor Byeon Chang-heum of Sejong University’s Department of Public Administration. “Similar to the way Gwangju has been reborn as a city championing human rights, and Hiroshima as a city of peace, Pyongyang can be remade as a city of democracy, rising above layers of totalitarian oppression.” By Joel Lee","ecological space north korea accelerating ,space north korea accelerating marketization ,prefabricated apartments were hastily manufactured ,korea real estate industry speculative ,future scientist avenue on taedong","['Pyongyang', 'Yim Dong - woo', 'the Korea Herald', 'north korean', 'Pipa - dong', 'Triumph', 'Pyongyang', 'Hongik University ’s Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Yim Dong - woo', 'Hongik University ’s Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design socialist', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jung - hee', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Moscow Architectural Institute', 'Kim Jung - hee', 'Pyongyang', 'Le Corbusier', 'Yim', 'North Korea ’s', 'Mansudae Apartment', 'Pyongyang Yim ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Eastern', 'central european', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Praud', 'Seoul National University', 'Harvard University', 'Pyongyang', 'japanese', 'North Korea', 'european', 'Yim', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'eastern', 'Central Europeans', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Yim', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Samsung', 'LG', 'Apple', 'Hallyu', 'the Future Scientist Avenue', 'North Koreans', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Sun', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'american', 'Kim Jong - il', 'german', 'Philipp Meuser', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - Sung', 'Kim Jong - Il', 'Kim Jong - Il', 'Pyongyang', 'japanese', 'Hungary', 'East Germany', 'Czechoslovakia', 'pyongyang', 'Munsoo Street', 'Gwangbok Street', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Changjon Street', 'Ryomyong Street', 'north korean', 'Seoul National University', 'Kim Byung - yeon', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Dong - a', 'Ilbo', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea ’s', 'the People ’s Republic', 'Washington Post', 'Zara', 'H&M', 'south korean', 'Daily NK', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'Joo', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Ryomyong Street', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul National University', 'Choi Mack - joong', 'the Graduate School of Environmental Studies', 'Choi Mack - joong', 'Seoul National University ’s Graduate School of Environmental Studies Choi', 'Pyongyang', 'Choi', 'North and South Koreans', 'North Koreans', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'eastern european', 'Pyongyang', 'Bucharest', 'Romania', 'Romania', 'communist', 'Nicolae Ceausescu', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Bucharest', 'Pyongyang', 'romanian', 'Pyongyang', 'Byeon Chang - heum', 'Sejong University ’s Department of Public Administration', 'Hiroshima', 'Pyongyang', 'Joel Lee']",18,"[ 0.         11.         30.         ... -0.58895189  0.26413086

The Moon Jae-in administration has been struggling to reopen a solid inter-Korean dialogue channel in a bid to patch up ties that have been strained for nearly a decade.  President Moon Jae-in speaks at a special event in July, marking 200 days until the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. Viewing the Winter Games as an opportunity to ease tension, Seoul has been urging Pyongyang to participate in the Olympics in hopes of turning it into a “peace festival.” It has reiterated the doors for North Korea will be open “until the last minute.”Experts noted that inter-Korean sports exchanges in the past have set precedents for the creation of platforms to revive talks when political and military exchanges were at a standstill. Paik Hak-soon, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, chose “military drills” and “envoys” as keywords that could determine North Korea’s presence at the resort town of PyeongChang.If the South Korean government wants North Korea to come to PyeongChang, “the South Korea-US joint military exercise must be either halted or delayed during the Olympic Truce period,” Paik said in the think tank’s 2018 forecast. Annual joint military drills -- Key Resolve and Foal Eagle -- are expected to coincide with the Winter Olympics and Paralympics. North Korea views these exercises as rehearsals for invasion despite the allies’ reiteration that they are defensive in nature. In a recent interview with NBC, President Moon said he had suggested postponing the drills and the US is “currently reviewing” the possibility, but he also added it all “depends on how North Korea behaves.” “Also, it  must swiftly dispatch an envoy to the North in private to actively suggest and convince its participation in the Olympics,” added Paik, noting that PyeongChang may be the last chance for a while for Seoul to start talks with Pyongyang. But chances North Korea will participate in the upcoming Winter Games are looking slim, although it is also difficult to confirm its absence, according to Paik. North Korea has been maintaining an ambiguous stance toward Seoul’s offer. It missed an Oct. 30 deadline to confirm its pair figure skating spot at the Winter Games, without issuing a public statement. Current circumstances surrounding North Korea’s fast-developing nuclear weapons program are also expected to pose a major obstacle. On Friday, the UN Security Council slapped another round of fresh sanctions on the rogue nation to further curb its economic growth. The decision addresses North Korea’s recent launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov. 29, which experts say could put the US mainland within its target range. Although North Korea lambasted the UNSC’s move as “an act of war,” the Korea Institute for National Unification recently said North Korea may refrain from provocations around the Olympics period. “The atmosphere for dialogue over inter-Korean ties and North Korea’s nuclear weapons may start from May if the North suspends its nuclear and missile provocations during the Olympics, and Seoul and Washington’s military drills are delayed or scaled down,” the institute said.“Pyongyang may deliver a positive message at its annual New Year’s address because President Moon has sent a positive signal to the North with his proposal to delay the annual joint military exercise,” Cho Sung-ryul, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy, said.By Jung Min-kyung","delayed during the olympic truce ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympics questions ,annual joint military drills key ,pyeongchang winter olympics questions remain ,washington military drills are delayed","['PyeongChang', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Moon Jae -', 'Paralympic Winter Games', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'the Sejong Institute', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'PyeongChang', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Paik', 'Paralympics', 'North Korea', 'NBC', 'Moon', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Paik', 'PyeongChang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Paik', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'the UN Security Council', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'North Korea', 'UNSC', 'the Korea Institute for National Unification', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Moon', 'Cho Sung - ryul', 'the Institute for National Security Strategy', 'Jung Min - kyung']",10,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.26688579  0.25729439

The iconic Salvation Army red kettles appear at major thoroughfares and Christmas songs and decorations fill the streets. Christmas-theme merchandise, and advertisements for them, fill the shelves and the airwaves. The typical Christmas scene in downtown Seoul could be from any major metropolis around the world. And, just as it has in the West, the days when Christmas was a strictly religious festival are long gone. The fading of the religious tint from Christmas celebrations may be accelerated in Korea by the country’s irreligious population. South Korea, despite the countless neon crucifix-adorned churches, is one of the world’s least religious nations, with more than half saying that they are irreligious. Christians of various denominations number about 13.4 million, or about 27 percent of the South Korean population in 2015, according to Statistics Korea. While the religious meaning of Christmas may be fading here, the year-end celebrations continue to rage on despite Koreans’ perpetual lamentations over the “slow economy.”“The year end, in general, is usually quite busy but around Christmas you really should call and reserve a cab, particularly in popular areas like Hongdae,” Kim Dae-young, a 62 year old taxi driver, said. He added that although earnings are good during this time of the year, he doesn’t fully agree with the materialistic culture that seems to hold sway in Korea.“Young people enjoying themselves is good, but as a Catholic I think things these days are going a bit too far. It’s supposed to be about Jesus, but it seems to be all about drinking and dating.” Cashing in on the atmosphere, many restaurants often offer Christmas menus specifically arranged for couples. Despite prices that are often much higher than usual, trendier establishments require reservations, if not weeks in advance. As the Christmas season also overlaps with year-end parties -- both personal and work-related -- that many Koreans consider a must, December is the season many small businesses look forward to.“About an hour is the normal waiting time. It’s Christmas, nobody seems to want to leave, particularly since they are using company money,” Chang Sang-hyung, a staff at a popular watering hole in southern Seoul said. While such commercial and secular celebrations may set the tone of the Christmas season for the general public, some Christians taken an entirely different approach. Churches of various denominations hold charitable events such as fund raising campaigns around this time of the year, and hold special services. “On Christmas Eve, we gather at the church to attend service, and for a range of events like secret Santa and general celebrations,” Jang Ha-young, a 30-year old professional interpreter, said.“There is also a service on Christmas morning, and different churches engage in a diverse range of charitable events.”For others, Christmas is a holiday for the family, regardless of religion. “I will be going on a trip to Japan with the family this year,” Jun Min-suk, a 36-year old project manager visiting Korea for the holidays, said. He added that he thinks Christmas should be about family, and that while celebrating as couples, and with friends may be fun, the crowds and higher than usual prices put a damper on things. Still others try to take a step back from the “year-end atmosphere.”“ really doesn’t concern me. I am not a Christian, so I really don’t see why I should get involved in any way,” a 39-year old office worker, who identifies himself as an antitheist, said declining to be named. “I don’t know anyone who isn’t a Buddhist who acts any different on Buddha’s Birthday, and I don’t see why it should be different for Christmas.”By Choi He-suk","christmas scene in downtown seoul ,christmas was strictly religious festival ,visiting korea for the holidays ,iconic salvation army red kettles ,decorations fill the streets christmas","['South Korea', 'Salvation Army', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Statistics Korea', 'Koreans', 'Kim Dae - young', 'Korea', 'Catholic', 'Koreans', 'Chang Sang - hyung', 'Seoul', 'Christians', 'Santa', 'Jang ha - young', 'Japan', 'Jun Min - suk', 'Korea', 'Christian', 'Buddhist', 'Choi He - suk']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56883758  0.6675415

But it has been criticized in South Korea for lacking a consensus from the victims and Japan's recognition of its legal responsibility for their forced mobilization. President Moon Jae-in has pledged to revisit the deal, saying South Koreans can't accept it emotionally.The probe result may likely point out that the deal does not properly reflect the voice of the victims and its terms and wording are inappropriate.Based on the outcome, the Moon government is likely to announce its own decision on the agreement later, possibly after the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics set for February. The developments are likely to put Seoul and Tokyo on a tightrope, as Japan has repeatedly called for Seoul's compliance with the deal.

Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and her Japanese counterpart Taro Kono ""reaffirmed their common goal of peacefully resolving the North Korean nuclear issue"" during their talks in Japan earlier in the day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""They agreed to continue their diplomatic efforts to bring North Korea out to the negotiating table in addition to strong sanctions and pressure on North Korea,"" the statement also said.The agreement was reached before the bilateral relationship is likely to take a turn for the worse next week with Seoul's announcement of the result of its five-month probe into the neighbors' 2015 deal to end a long-running feud over Japan's history of mobilizing Korean women as sex workers during World War II. The investigation by a task force under Kang is expected to disapprove of the deal signed under the previous administration of impeached President Park Geun-hye as not reflective of the voice of Korean sex slavery victims in the announcement slated for Dec. 27. Ahead of the upcoming event, both ministers pledged to step up communications and further expand and deepen the bilateral relationship.""Kang stressed her government's sustained position that difficult issues between the countries will be managed in a stable manner and a forward-looking, mature partnership will be further sought after through frequent communications,"" according to the statement. Kono also pledged efforts to develop the bilateral relationship into a future-forward one despite current difficulties, it also said. During the meeting, Kang briefed Kono on the process of the task force probe and raised other historical issues that need to be resolved, according the ministry.Kang and Kono also tentatively agree to review Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's possible visit to South Korea during the latter's hosting of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics. Also discussed were ways to deepen bilateral cooperation and exchanges in the fields of economy, culture and human resources. Following the meeting, Kono told reporters that he told Kang, ""It is important to implement  faithfully."" Kang arrived in Japan on the day for a two-day visit, which includes her courtesy call on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday.It marks Kang's first trip to Japan since taking office in June and the first trip by a South Korean foreign minister to the neighboring country since June 2015. The meeting came after North Korea test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile in late November, claiming that it has completed its ""state nuclear force."" The growing security threat from North Korea is accelerating calls for ever-tighter joint efforts by Seoul and Tokyo to deter North Korean provocations while the bilateral relationship remains icy. The 2015 deal failed to settle the so-called comfort women issue with the Moon Jae-in government having said that the deal does not reflect public sentiment and that there appear to be procedural problems.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual servitude for front-line Japanese soldiers during World War II, while the Korean Peninsula was under Japanese colonial rule. They are euphemistically called comfort women. Arriving at Japan's Haneda Airport earlier in the day, Kang told reporters that she will tell Kono about the progress of the independent task force investigation and that the result may not necessarily correspond with the South Korean government's stance.Ahead of the foreign ministerial talks, Kono stressed to reporters that the government-to-government deal is irreversible, renewing a call on Seoul to abide by it.","korea and japan reaffirmed tuesday ,in curbing north korea nuclear ,seoul tokyo the top diplomats ,japan reaffirmed tuesday their close ,after north korea test fired","['SEOUL / TOKYO', 'South Korea', 'Japan', ""North Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'japanese', 'Taro Kono', 'north korean', 'Japan', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Kang', 'Park Geun', 'korean', 'Kono', 'Kang', 'Kono', 'Kang', 'Kono', 'japanese', ""Shinzo Abe 's"", 'South Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'Kono', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Kang', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'north korean', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Kang', 'Kono', 'south korean', 'Kono', 'Seoul']",9,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.44669399  0.43795305

But over the decades that followed, the two nations have strengthened their relations by leaps and bounds, becoming strategic partners and exploring new horizons for a shared sustainable future, Kazakhstan’s top envoy here highlighted last week while celebrating the silver jubilee of bilateral diplomatic relations.Similar to Korea that has achieved its “economic miracle on the Han River,” Kazakhstan is now universally recognized for its rapid growth and modernization since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kazakhstan has become a shining example of progress and globalization in Central Asia, a region long insulated from the world under the Iron Curtain, analysts say. There are currently more than 400 joint economic projects between Kazakh and Korean companies, trade turnover is expected to reach $1.2 billion this year and cumulative bilateral investments have reached $4 billion as of the first half of this year, according to Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Eleven presidential summits have been held since the two nations established their diplomatic relations in 1992. Kazakh Ambassador to Korea Dulat Bakishev  and Kim Chang-kyu, deputy minister and standing commissioner for the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, pose at a reception marking Kazakhstan’s National Day and silver jubilee of diplomatic relations with Korea in Seoul on Thursday “Kazakhstan and Korea are actively cooperating in the international arena promoting global peace, stability and security, including a world free of nuclear weapons,” said Kazakh Ambassador to Korea Dulat Bakishev at a reception in Seoul on Thursday. On Aug. 29 1991, Kazakhstan voluntarily renounced 1,400 nuclear warheads -- then the world’s fourth-largest atomic arsenal -- by closing down the Semipalatinsk test site, a primary experiment ground for the Soviet Union’s atomic arsenal. Kazakhstan has continuously urged the denuclearization of North Korea as an example of successful national development without nuclear weapons capability. “Both countries share common positions on major global issues and fruitfully interact with each another at the United Nations,” he added, noting Astana is a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council for 2017-18. “Under the leadership of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, my country has made significant structural and economic reforms, so that our people today enjoy the fruits of political stability, democracy and free market economy,” the envoy said. Astana has made substantial efforts to be integrated into the global economy in recent years, in large part through China’s “One Belt, One Road” global infrastructure and economic integration initiative. Over the past three years, the country has carried out large-scale infrastructure construction projects and created transport and logistics links to the world’s major markets, Bakishev said.  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev The construction of the nearly 3,000-kilometer Kazakhstan section of the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor has been completed, which will shorten the time needed to transport cargo from the port of Lianyungang in China to St. Petersburg in Russia to 10 days. Via this route, new opportunities for transporting goods between Kazakhstan and Korea using the seaports of Lianyungang, Busan and Incheon can be found, he pointed out. Furthermore, the 900-kilometer Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran railroad corridor has recently been constructed to connect Central Asian countries to the Persian Gulf and the port of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran. The Khorgos-Eastern Gate dry port in eastern Kazakhstan bordering China has been built as the country’s first land port and Central Asia’s largest logistics park.“These new routes have removed constraints on our infrastructures and shortened cargo transport time in all directions,” said the ambassador. “Kazakhstan today is an attractive destination for foreign investment, infrastructure development, logistics, transport and related services.”Kim Chang-kyu, deputy minister and standing commissioner for the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, congratulated Kazakhstan for its “remarkable feats” in achieving political stability, economic development and related international recognition over the last 26 years. “I express my sincere respect to the people of Kazakhstan for their remarkable achievements in pioneering their national destiny,” he said.  Kazakhstsan's capital Astana “Kazakhstan entered a period of economic and political crises following the independence in 1991, with severe shortages in foreign currency, skyrocketing prices of commodities, a lack of food and dilapidated production facilities. But Kazakhstan pressed on unwaveringly on the back of the government’s leadership and unified and tolerant spirit of people of diverse nationalities.”Over the last 25 years, exchanges have grown comprehensively between politicians, parliamentarians and legislators, as well as civilians and students of Kazakhstan and Korea, Kim noted. Some 60,000 people from either side visited the other country in the last year, supported by eight direct flights between Kazakhstan and Korea every week. Noting the administration of Korean President Moon Jae-in is invested in bolstering relations with Central Asian and Eurasian countries, Kim forecast bilateral ties will continue to grow in the future through complementary economic partnerships, especially after Seoul enters into a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union.

As the two countries celebrate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year, they can also cherish having transformed their tumultuous legacies under foreign occupations into independence and solid development, Georgian Ambassador to Korea Otar Berdzenishvili told The Korea Herald. Georgia and Korea officiated their diplomatic ties on Dec. 14, 1992. Next year, Georgia marks the centennial of its declaration as the first democratic republic as well as the 26th anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union. Georgian Ambassador to Korea Otar Berdzenishvili  and K-Water CEO Lee Hak-soo pose at a reception marking the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Georgia and Korea in Seoul on Dec. 8. While Korea has become the world’s 11th largest economy with a per capita income of $30,000, Georgia is, by many accounts, one of the most stable democracies and vibrant economies in the South Caucasus, with a strong bent for reform, according to analysts. The World Bank’s annual report, “Doing Business 2018,” placed Georgia at No. 9 of 190 countries surveyed, a drastic improvement from the 100th spot over the last decade. The report also placed Georgia second in the world in terms of protection of minority investors.“Over the last few years, our governments have stepped up our existing cooperation on bilateral and multilateral levels,” Berdzenishvili said in a speech at a reception marking the silver jubilee of diplomatic ties in Seoul on Dec. 8.“The construction of Nenskra hydro power plant by K-Water Company is the biggest Korean investment in the energy sector in the region,” he added, referring to the hydroelectric dam being built on the Nenskra River, Upper Svaneti, through a joint venture between the Georgian state-owned Partnership Fund and Korea Water Resources Corporation, also known as K-Water. The project’s construction started in September 2015, and is scheduled to be completed by 2020, when it will have capacity of 280 megawatts. Georgia hosted the inaugural Sustainable Development Goals 16 + Forum Annual Showcase in capital Tbilisi from Oct. 30-Nov. 2. Some 150 representatives from 25 countries, including Korea, participated in the event, and discussed policy and best practices for achieving the United Nations-led goals, with a specific focus on the 16th goal -- creating peaceful, just and inclusive societies. Nenskra Hydroelectric Project“Our bilateral cultural cooperation is thriving,” he underlined, mentioning the two recent separate translations of Georgian epic poem “The Knight in the Panther’s Skin” into Korean by Yonsei University professor Cho Ju-kwan and Korea University professor Hur Seung-chul. Since Tbilisi loosened visa rules for Korean citizens visiting Georgia, the number of Koreans traveling to the country has increased dramatically, said Berdzenishvili. The number of Georgian students studying at Korean universities has also risen sharply since the Korean government increased the breadth and scope of scholarships for Georgian students. The diplomat highlighted Georgia’s proud tradition of wine making, archaeologically validated to be the world’s oldest, dating back over 8,000 years. Traditional wine making in Georgia is done through a fermentation process in a Qvevri clay vessel dug deep underground. It was recognized as a World Intangible Heritage by UNESCO in 2013. “I came to understand why Georgia is often shortlisted as a must-visit country,” said Rep. Yoo Seung-hee, chairwoman of the Georgia-Korea Interparliamentary Friendship Group, referring to her visit there in August. “Georgia is establishing itself as a regional trade and logistics hub, with opportunities to become one of the most competitive platforms connecting Europe and Asia. Bridging East and West requires strong collaboration between nations, and I am confident that Korea has become part of this collaborative scheme.”Qvevri vessels are large earthenware used for the fermentation, storage and ageing of traditional Georgian wine. Analysts say Georgia’s geostrategic value is set to multiply with the launch of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway on Oct. 30 and the signing of the Lapis Lazuli Corridor Agreement with Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey on Nov. 15. Through these two routes, the trade of goods from China and Afghanistan through the South Caucasus all the way to Europe is expected to be streamlined with significant reductions in time. The government of Georgia has concentrated its efforts to make the country a regional business hub. It has called on Korean companies to plow capital into hydro energy, transport infrastructure, tourism, information and communication technology and e-government sectors.“Despite the challenges my country faces currently, particularly from the ongoing occupation of our regions Abkhazia and South Ossetia by the Russian Federation and its attempts to annex them, Georgia firmly stands on its path of joining the European Union and contributing to the Euro-Atlantic integration,” underscored the ambassador. “Our European dream has been supported by our people from the very first day of our independence. Having experienced difficulties in territorial and security issues, Georgia fully supports peace on the Korean Peninsula and strongly condemns North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations.” Nikoloz Apkhazava, the Georgian ambassador to Malaysia and former ambassador to Korea from 2012-17 In a separate event, Nikoloz Apkhazava, the Georgian ambassador to Malaysia and former ambassador to Korea from 2012-17, was awarded the Gwanghwa Medal -- the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit -- by the Korean government on Dec. 7. The medal is the Korean government’s highest national civilian honor granted exclusively to foreign politicians and diplomats for their “outstanding and meritorious” service in the promotion of friendly relations with the Republic of Korea. The ceremony took place at the Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur in the presence of Korean Ambassador to Malaysia Yu Hyun-seok.By Joel Lee","korean citizens visiting georgia the ,countries celebrate the 25th anniversary ,the diplomat highlighted georgia proud ,georgia korea interparliamentary friendship ,georgia hosted the inaugural sustainable","['Georgia', 'Korea', 'georgian', 'Georgian', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Georgia', 'Korea', 'Georgia', 'the Soviet Union', 'Georgian', 'Korea', 'K - Water', 'Lee Hak -', 'Georgia', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Georgia', 'the South Caucasus', 'the World Bank ’s', 'Georgia', 'Georgia', 'Berdzenishvili', 'Seoul', 'Nenskra', 'K - Water Company', 'korean', 'Upper Svaneti', 'georgian', 'Partnership Fund', 'Korea Water Resources Corporation', 'K - Water', 'Georgia', 'Tbilisi', 'Korea', 'the United Nations', 'georgian', 'the Panther ’s skin', 'Korean', 'Yonsei University', 'Cho Ju - kwan', 'Korea University', 'Hur Seung - chul', 'Tbilisi', 'korean', 'Georgia', 'Koreans', 'Berdzenishvili', 'georgian', 'korean', 'korean', 'georgian', 'Georgia', 'Georgia', 'Qvevri', 'World Intangible Heritage', 'UNESCO', 'Georgia', 'Yoo Seung - hee', 'the Georgia - Korea Interparliamentary Friendship Group', 'Georgia', 'Korea', 'georgian', 'Georgia', 'Afghanistan', 'Turkmenistan', 'Azerbaijan', 'Turkey', 'China', 'Afghanistan', 'Georgia', 'korean', 'Abkhazia', 'South Ossetia', 'the Russian Federation', 'Georgia', 'the European Union', 'european', 'Georgia', 'North Korea ’s', 'Nikoloz Apkhazava', 'georgian', 'Malaysia', 'Korea', 'Nikoloz Apkhazava', 'georgian', 'Malaysia', 'Korea', 'the order of Diplomatic Service', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Republic of Korea', 'the Korean Embassy', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'korean', 'Malaysia', 'Joel Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26368567  0.40309581

The memorial stone for the former British legation quarters was officially unveiled in a ceremony at Jeil Apartment complex in western Busan on Saturday.A number of British and South Korean dignitaries, including British Ambassador to South Korea Charles Hay, Park Geuk-je, chief of Busan Metropolitan City Seo-gu Office, and Kim Moon-ik, British honorary consul in Busan, attended the ceremony.The establishment of the memorial stone came after the British ambassador last year proposed locating the site of the former British legation quarters in Busan as part of efforts to reflect on bilateral relationship.After months of searches into government documents, the British honorary consulate has confirmed Jeil Apartment complex in Nambumin-dong of Busan's Seo-gu as the site of the British legation at the time of the Korean War.During the war, Britain relocated its legation from Seoul to Busan.The National Archives of Korea has discovered a document on the designation of a two-story wooden house in western Busan for use by the British legation in 1952.The former British legation in Busan provided services to British troops stationed in the port city and Korean refugees for three years before being moved back to Seoul later. The site was used by individuals for 40 years until 1995 when Jeil Apartment complex was built there.""The site of former British legation in Busan symbolizes Britain's efforts to take care of war refugees and maintain bilateral diplomatic relations,"" said honorary British consul Kim.Ambassador Hay also wished for sustained friendship between Busan citizens and Britain.","korean dignitaries including british ambassador ,korean war the memorial stone ,british soldiers and korean refugees ,south korean dignitaries including british ,korean refugees for three years","['Busan', 'british', 'south korean', 'british', 'korean', 'british', 'Jeil Apartment', 'Busan', 'british', 'south korean', 'british', 'South Korea', 'Charles Hay', 'Park Geuk - je', 'Busan Metropolitan City Seo - gu Office', 'Kim Moon - ik', 'british', 'Busan', 'british', 'british', 'Busan', 'british', 'Jeil Apartment', 'Busan', 'british', 'Britain', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'the National Archives of Korea', 'Busan', 'british', 'british', 'Busan', 'british', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Jeil Apartment', 'british', 'Busan', 'Britain', 'british', 'Kim', 'Hay', 'Busan', 'Britain']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47062293  0.28406775

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday told the UN Security Council that the ultimate goal of solving the Korean Peninsula crisis must be the ""complete, verifiable and irreversible abandonment of its nuclear weapons programs."" Earlier this week at a policy forum in Washington, Tillerson had underlined that the United States was seeking a diplomatic opening for negotiations with North Korea on ending its nuclear program and, for the first time, offered ""talks with no preconditions.""The White House had responded to Tillerson's remarks by insisting there had been no change in US policy, triggering a new round of reports of a rift between Trump and his chief diplomat.At the United Nations, Tillerson took a tough line.""North Korea must earn its way back to the table,"" he said. ""The pressure campaign must and will continue until denuclearization is achieved.""""We will, in the meantime, keep our channels of communication open.""Tillerson repeated that ""we do not seek, nor do we want, war with North Korea.""""The United States will use all necessary measures to defend itself against North Korean aggression, but our hope remains that diplomacy will produce a resolution,"" he said.According to a prepared version of his remarks, Tillerson had planned to repeat his offer of talks without preconditions, but the line was dropped from his speech. Asked about the change, Tillerson told reporters afterwards that the United States would not make any concessions of its own to secure talks, but that lines of communication would remain open if North Korea wanted to come forward.The North Koreans ""know where the door is. They know where to walk through that door when they want to talk,"" he said.North Korea's UN ambassador Ja Song-Nam made a rare appearance at the council meeting chaired by Japan, which announced new targeted sanctions on Chinese entities, among others.Ja took a swipe at the United States which he said was ""terrified by the incredible might of our republic"" and reaffirmed Pyongyang's view that nuclear weapons were needed for self-defense.North Korea is ""a responsible nuclear power and a peace-loving state"" that will strive to safeguard world peace, he said, making no mention of the US call for a pause in missile and nuclear tests.Singling out China, Pyongyang's sole ally, and Russia, Tillerson urged Beijing and Moscow to go beyond the current tough UN sanctions resolutions and impose unilateral measures.""Continuing to allow North Korean laborers to toil in slave-like conditions inside Russia in exchange for wages used to fund nuclear weapons programs calls into question Russia's dedication as a partner for peace,"" he said.Tillerson also dismissed concerns that UN sanctions are having an impact on North Korea's humanitarian crisis, saying Pyongyang ""hypocritically spends billions"" on military programs ""while its own people suffer great poverty.""The United States has called on China to cut off oil supplies to North Korea, a move that would deal a crippling blow to its economy.In Washington, Trump criticized Russia for doing too little to pressure Pyongyang. ""China is helping. Russia is not helping. We would like to have Russia's help,"" said Trump, who discussed the crisis by phone with President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.Russia's Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia shot back, saying North Korean workers were in Russia as part of a bilateral agreement ""which guarantees their rights"" -- and not subjected to slave-like conditions. Addressing Tillerson directly, the Russian ambassador said: ""We very much hope that the US will be able to help resolve the crisis on the Korean peninsula.""China's envoy expressed concern about a hardening of positions, saying the current crisis ""hardly makes one optimistic"".""The hope for peace is not totally obliterated,"" said Chinese Deputy Ambassador Wu Haitao. There is ""a possibility for negotiation and the option of use of force is unacceptable."" Pyongyang has carried out its sixth nuclear test and conducted a series of missile launches including its first tests of two intercontinental ballistic missiles  this year.Addressing the council, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged diplomatic engagement to avoid a ""level of danger that would be unpredictable in its trajectory and catastrophic in its consequences.""The UN's political affairs chief, Jeffrey Feltman, returned at the weekend from talks in Pyongyang -- the first visit to the North by a high-ranking UN official since 2011.While Feltman received no firm commitment on talks from North Korea, he said the visit was ""just the beginning"" of his push for ""talks about talks.""Since late 2016, the Security Council has slapped three rounds of sanctions aimed at choking off revenue to Pyongyang's weapons program, which the United Nations has described as the most dangerous security issue in the world today.China and Russia argue that sanctions alone will not compel North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to change course and want to step up diplomatic efforts to achieve a solution.","trump white house to toughen ,cessation of north korea threatening ,korea on ending its nuclear ,want war with north korea ,putin on thursday russia ambassador","['North Korea', 'US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Pyongyang', 'Tillerson', 'the UN Security Council', ""North Korea 's"", 'Donald Trump', 'White House', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'United Nations Security Council', 'UN', 'New York', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'the UN Security Council', 'Korean', 'Washington', 'Tillerson', 'the United States', 'North Korea', '""the White House', 'Tillerson', 'US', 'Trump', 'the United Nations', 'Tillerson', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'United States', 'north korean', 'Tillerson', 'Tillerson', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'the North Koreans', ""North Korea 's"", 'UN', 'Ja Song - Nam', 'Japan', 'chinese', 'the United States', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'US', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Russia', 'Tillerson', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'UN', 'north korean', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Tillerson', 'UN', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', '""the United States', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Trump', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Trump', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Russia', 'Vassily Nebenzia', 'north korean', 'Russia', 'russian', 'US', 'korean', 'Chinese', 'Wu Haitao', 'Pyongyang', 'UN', 'Antonio Guterres', 'UN', 'Jeffrey Feltman', 'Pyongyang', 'UN', 'North Korea', 'the Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations', 'China', 'Russia', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - Un']",0,"[ 0.          4.          8.         ... -0.73446083  1.03921294

A project led by the central government and Incheon Metropolitan City, the educational complex has the campuses of five universities ranking in the top 100 in the global university index.  National and local governments have invested about 1 trillion won  in the IGC, aiming to host 10 prestigious universities there. They envision the IGC, located in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, as a regional educational hub where about 10,000 students study at modern, state-of-the-art facilities. At the project’s launch in 2007, the State University of New York Korea became the first university to open a campus at IGC in 2012. George Mason University Korea opened two years later, followed by the University of Utah Asia Campus and Ghent University Global Campus in September that year. The IGC welcomed a new educational institute in September, the Fashion Institute of Technology, one of the top five colleges in the world specializing in fashion design and business management. Graduation assessment and overall educational management is done by the schools’ main campus in their respective home countries. This is designed to allow students to acquire degrees from renowned world universities while still studying inside South Korea at a much more affordable cost. Each class at the IGC universities is taught in English. Students come from both Korea and abroad and are exposed to a global learning atmosphere, presenting the opportunity for students to build networks of people with different cultural backgrounds while receiving a high-quality education.SUNY Korea, which produced the first graduates among the universities here in January this year, held its third graduation ceremony Thursday, and now has the largest number of graduates, with 108.The education offered at IGC helps students pursue their dream careers. The graduates have landed jobs at global companies including Korean Air, LG Electronics in Iran, Facebook Singapore and Genesem, a semiconductor company in Songdo International City.The first graduation ceremony will be held for George Mason University Korea on Saturday. The 12 students are already off to a good start, getting jobs at multinational corporations such as accountings firm KPMG. University President Angel Cabrera will deliver the graduation certificates. After the ceremony, a homecoming event will be held to invite all alumni of the university who reside and work in Korea. The University of Utah Asia Campus had its first graduation in the main campus in Utah in the United States in May. Fourteen of the 17 graduates attended, receiving bachelor’s and master’s degrees. To celebrate the next graduation event, which will be the first held at IGC, President David W. Pershing from the main campus will visit the country in March.

While President Donald Trump and his security aides have warned about the North’s relentless nuclear ambition and floated the idea of a preventive strike against it, the US top diplomat has offered a softer line and called for a diplomatic solution. Despite the skepticism that whether the secretary represents the administration's stance on foreign policy, regional stakeholders have showed cautious hopes on Tillerson’s new diplomatic overture of “unconditional talk” with North Korea amid the concern about Trump’s unpredictability and ineptness in foreign affairs.“South Korea and the US are on the same page to resolve North Korea’s nuclear issue peacefully,” said Unification Ministry spokesman Baek Tae-hyun on Wednesday. “If  serves that purpose, we are hoping that the talk will take place soon.” US State Secretary Rex Tillerson. YonhapSouth Korea’s presidential office Cheong Wa Dae showed a more measured tone, saying Tillerson’s remark is “reiteration” of US policy principle that North Korea must suspend nuclear provocations and return to the negotiating table. A day earlier in Washington, Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without preconditions, a proposal appeared to deviate from Washington’s previous stance that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear arsenal for any negotiations to take place.His comments drew a welcoming response from those countries close to North Korea -- China and Russia. The Chinese foreign ministry hoped there would now be “meaningful steps towards dialogue and contact” between the US and the North.Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, also welcomed the statement, saying the secretary’s remark has “impressed them far more than the confrontational rhetoric that they have heard up to now.“Often being described as “the worst secretary of state ever” by US media outlets, Tillerson has nevertheless thought to be among the few senior officials trying to make the case that a diplomatic solution is more effective than military options to resolve nuclear standoff with North Korea. Alongside his latest proposal of direct talks with North Korea, Tillerson has also sought to open lines of communication with Pyongyang in a bid to seek a possible way forward beyond decadeslong nuclear confrontation.But such ideas have been immediately dismissed by President Trump, who called it “a waste of time” and his National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, one of the most hardliner among the administration in his approach to North Korea’s nuclear threat.”I know there‘s some reporting yesterday about Secretary Tillerson said we’re open to initiating negotiations, but those negotiations are not -- or talks, you know -- would be, are not an end in and of themselves,” McMaster said Wednesday in remarks at the Jamestown Foundation. Since taking office In February as a State Secretary, Tillerson has been under criticism for not being committed enough to his job as he has yet to offer a clear vision of US foreign policy and fill top positions at the State Department.  Stephen Walt, Professor of International Affairs at Harvard University, said although Tillerson “may not be very good at his job,” some of the criticism could be unfair given his tough task as a top diplomat at the Trump administration.  “Tillerson is serving a president who is genuinely clueless about foreign policy yet seems to think he’s some sort of a strategic genius… Given the president he serves, how effective could Tillerson possibly be?” Walt wrote in his article in Foreign Affairs. By Yeo Jun-suk","korea while president donald trump ,korea alongside his latest proposal ,resolve nuclear standoff with north ,north korea while president donald ,top diplomat at the trump","['US', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'Donald Trump', 'North ’s', 'US', 'Tillerson ’s', 'North Korea', 'Trump ’s', 'Korea', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'Unification Ministry', 'Baek Tae - hyun', 'US', 'Rex Tillerson', 'YonhapSouth Korea ’s', 'Cheong', 'Tillerson ’s', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Tillerson', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'chinese', 'US', 'Dmitri Peskov', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'US', 'Tillerson', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Tillerson', 'Pyongyang', 'Trump', 'H.R.

Officials from South Korea's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae have said the two leaders will not issue a joint statement on the outcome of their upcoming talks, possibly reflecting grudges that still remain from the THAAD dispute.","trade fair in beijing hope ,president xi jinping later thursday ,scheduled to meet chinese president ,fair in beijing hope the ,south korean chinese trade fair","['BEIJING', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Chinese', 'Moon', 'south korean', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae -', 'south korean', 'Beijing', 'China', 'chinese', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Moon', 'China', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Group of 20', 'Germany', 'the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'Danang', 'Vietnam', ""South Korea 's"", 'Cheong', 'Dae']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36236644  0.54279947

The mayor became the first Korean politician to receive the prestigious honor given to political and cultural figures around the world, such as former President of Israel Shimon Peres and Karl Lagerfeld, creative director of fashion house Chanel.Since 1911, the Council of Paris has been awarding the medal to figures who have contributed to building cooperative relationship with Paris or advancing the development of art, culture, or sports. Seoul and Paris have been working closely especially in the environment sector, such as shaping policies for urban restoration and air quality improvement, the city government said. Earlier this year in March, Seoul, Paris and London jointly announced the creation of a system to grade vehicles based on their emissions in real-life conditions, after growing uncertainty about automakers efforts to skirt rules intended to limit pollutants. “Seoul and Paris share many things in common. Projects such as pedestrian-friendly roads and measures to fight climate change are what both of our cities eye on,” said Park as he received the medal.Since both cities have a lot to learn from each other, programs such as employee exchanges can accelerate the development of the two cities, Park said. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who received an honorary citizenship of Seoul in October, will visit Seoul in February to get an insight from Seoul’s urban restoration projects. In 2014, Paris announced an urban restoration plan called “Reinventer Paris ” to transform underutilized city spaces.Park arrived in Paris on Tuesday to attend the One Planet Summit, marking the second anniversary of the Paris Agreement.The summit is co-sponsored by the French government, the United Nations, and the World Bank. Park is attending as the district government representative and president of Local Governments of Sustainability, at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron.During the summit, Park emphasized the most important part of responding to climate change is citizen participation, giving the example of the city government’s “2022 Solarcity Plan” which the city government announced last month that it will inject 1.7 trillion won  to ensure one out of three households in the city are equipped with solar panels in five years. By Kim Da-sol","wednesday seoul mayor park won ,government said wednesday seoul mayor ,said wednesday seoul mayor park ,first korean politician to receive ,wednesday seoul mayor park","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Paris ’', 'Grand Vermeil', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Paris', 'Anne Hidalgo', 'Paris', 'korean', 'Israel', 'Shimon Peres', 'Karl Lagerfeld', 'Chanel', 'the Council of Paris', 'Paris', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'London', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'Park', 'Anne Hidalgo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'Paris', 'french', 'the United \xa0 Nations', 'the World Bank', 'local government of Sustainability', 'french', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Park', 'Kim Da - sol']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27751514  0.34215513

Despite Seoul’s repeated statements about improving bilateral relations, a full thaw in relations before Seoul’s decision to deploy a US anti-missile system appears some way off.  On Tuesday, Seoul’s presidential office revealed the results of Thursday’s summit meeting will be announced in separate statements to the press, recanting from the previous day’s briefing. On Monday, a high-level Cheong Wa Dae official had told media a joint press release was to be distributed after the summit meeting.According to a Cheong Wa Dae official, although the two sides will fine-tune the statement together, the press releases will be given separately, hinting at discord remaining in Seoul-Beijing relations.In an interview with China’s state-run CCTV on Monday, Moon himself said trust between the two nations has been damaged in recent years. “The top priority of my visit to China is placed on recovering mutual trust,” he said. “I think relations based on mutual trust are a very important starting point for advancing relations going forward.” President Moon on Chinese broadcast CCTVMoon also reiterated his position on the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, saying its placement in South Korea is unavoidable in light of the growing threat posed by North Korea, and that the system would not damage China’s security interests. “South Korea will pay extra attention to ensuring that THAAD does not go beyond the objective of defending against the North‘s nuclear and missile threats and hurt China’s security interests,” he said.“I can say that we have been assured by the United States on this matter.”In the interview, Moon also highlighted the importance of the role Beijing has in resolving North Korean nuclear and missile issues.“I think what is most needed is close cooperation between South Korea and China,” Moon said, going on to say the two countries could bring Pyongyang back to negotiations.Aside from trying to hammer out kinks in bilateral relations, Moon will dedicate a significant portion of his trip to business-related areas. On the first day of his trip, Moon will attend a roundtable discussion with South Korean and Chinese business leaders, and give a speech at a business forum. Before the summit meeting on Thursday, the South Korean leader will attend a trade event, and wrap up his stay in China on Saturday with a visit to Hyundai Motor’s plant in Chongqing, southwest China. On Friday, Moon will meet with Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People‘s Congress Zhang Dejiang and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, after giving a speech at Peking University. Moon will then move on to Chongqing where he will visit the site of the provisional government of Korea during the Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula and meet with Chen Min’er, secretary of the Communist Party of China for the city.By Choi He-suk","results of thursday summit meeting ,on tuesday seoul presidential office ,in beijing wednesday on four ,off on tuesday seoul presidential ,his third summit meeting","['Moon Jae - in', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Cheong', 'Seoul', 'China', 'CCTV', 'Moon', 'China', 'Moon', 'chinese', 'cctvmoon', 'the US', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'North‘s', 'China', 'the United States', 'Moon', 'Beijing', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Moon', 'Pyongyang', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'China', 'Hyundai Motor ’s', 'Chongqing', 'China', 'Moon', 'the Standing Committee of the National People‘s', 'Zhang Dejiang', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'Peking University', 'Moon', 'Chongqing', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Chen Min’er', 'the Communist Party of China', 'Choi He - suk']",16,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.67180198  0.35675162

""I plan to explore such ways to extend humanitarian assistance to the North."" This photo, taken Dec. 12, 2017, shows Kim Hong-gul, new chief of the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, speaking to reporters. Kim is the third son of late former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his role in bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula with the so-called Sunshine Policy of engaging with North Korea.The former president held the two Koreas' first summit with his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang in June 2000. His successor Roh Moo-hyun held a summit with the then-leader of the North in October 2007. The summits produced key declarations on reconciliation and peace.Kim, who was named to lead the group in November, expressed the hope that his agency could play a role in easing strained inter-Korean ties.""We are exploring ways to revive communication channels , hoping that an outcome may come in one or two months,"" he said. ""We are seeking to contact North Korea over humanitarian aid.""North Korea has kept mum on Seoul's offer for dialogue and rejected civic groups' offers of humanitarian assistance in protest against South Korea's support of international sanctions.""North Korea is shunning South Korea's proposal, but  would not be able to ignore his father's 'dying wishes' of supporting the spirit of the summit declarations,"" Kim added.Tensions on the divided peninsula remain high, with North Korea's ceaseless nuclear and missile development.

YonhapThe KNA Human Rights Forum and Korean Parliamentary League on International Parliamentarians’ Coalition for Asian Human Rights presented the Human Rights Activist award to Thae, the former deputy chief at the North Korean Embassy in London, in recognition of his works to report on the horrendous human rights conditions in North Korea.“What the Kim Jong-un regime is truly afraid of is the growing interest toward South Korean culture among its people, and how its public sentiment is changing to be more independent from its authorities,” he said, while explaining how the South’s movies and drama series are popular among the people there.“It is time for the South Korean government to send TV set-top boxes to the North.” The former Pyongyang ambassador defected to South Korea last year with his wife and two sons and is now a consultant at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul. Thae referred to the North Korean defector who ran across the demarcation line in the truce village of Panmunjeom last month, and said that the strong desire manifested by the soldier reflects on the similar strong will of the North Koreans for reunification.Giving the example of how Germany reunited with the hands of its own people breaking the Berlin Wall by themselves, he said the South Korean government should also persuade the neighboring country China to allow North Koreans to come freely to the South.“It would be like how Germany persuaded Hungary to open borders to Austria, and millions of North Koreans would cross the Amnokgang and Dumangang Rivers to the South and the Military Demarcation Line will soon collapse, within a couple of days,” he said.“When the minds meet with the South and the North for reunification in such ways, nothing can stop that movement -- and that is the kind of ‘peaceful’ reunification we all wish.”Thae also pointed to how research on human rights of North Koreans is relatively behind that of policy research on reunification and called for more support on the topic. The head of the KNA Human Rights Forum, Rep.

Music performances were provided by Songpa-gu Boys and Girls Choir. “Despite the tumultuous international relations surrounding the Korean Peninsula, with a growing possibility of conflict between the US and China, the relationship between Korea and America should be strengthened,” said KAFS President Han Chul-soo, former general and deputy commander in chief of the ROK-US Combined Forces Command. “Based on the alliance, Korea has deterred war on the peninsula, maintained peace for the last seven decades, enrooted democracy and become one of the world’s top 11 economic powerhouses.”Members of the Korea America Friendship Society post at the annual year-end reception at Millennium Seoul Hilton on Dec. 5. Seoul, Washington and their international allies and partners should enhance cooperation to counter the escalating threats from the North, Han stressed. He added that the security-based bilateral alliance has evolved into a comprehensive one, including an advanced economic partnership. Mark Knapper, charge d’affaires ad interim the US Embassy in Seoul, said 2017 was a busy year culminating in the state visit of US President Donald Trump to Korea, preceded by Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence who came to Korea. “We see these visits as really critical for helping strengthen our bilateral relationship as we face critical issues not just here on the peninsula but around the world,” Knapper said. “We see our alliance bound by not only our shared sacrifice in the battlefield, but also as a friendship that is strengthened every day through our economic, cultural and many other ties.”General Kim Byeong-joo, deputy commander of the ROK-US Combined Forces Command, underscored that the alliance is not only signed on paper but forged in blood in the battlefield. “The KAFS has served as a reliable supporter of our alliance for the past 27 years,” he said, adding the organization has helped deepen friendship through seminars, ceremonies and cultural activities for veterans and soldiers.

In celebration of the rotational presidency of the Visegrad Group -- also known as the V4, an alliance of four Central European states the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia -- the Hungarian Embassy held the concert “European Quartet One Melody” at the JCC Art Center in Seoul on Wednesday. The Central European Jazz Connection, an internationally acclaimed quartet comprised of musicians from the four countries, played harmonized melodies. Hungarian trumpeter and flugelhorn player Fekete Kovacs Kornel, Slovakian guitarist Matus Jakabcic, Polish pianist Kuba Stankiewicz and Czech bassist Tomas Baros played their tunes as they have done in major cities around the world. The V4 group -- named after the historical Hungarian town, Visegrad, north of Budapest on the Danube -- was established in February, 1991, among the erstwhile Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, with their collective aim of joining the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Since Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, the group became an association of the four nations. In 2014, Korea and V4 launched their “V4+ROK” cooperation mechanism -- part of the “V4+” channels between the nations and their major partners around the world -- encompassing political dialogue, social exchange, tourism, science and technology and innovation.

According to sources in Washington, the request was recently delivered to the South Korean government in the form of an “agrement,” a formal request sent to the receiving state from the sending state before dispatching a diplomatic representative. The decision was made after an extensive vetting process, it added. Victor Cha The overall process is expected to move swiftly in a bid to fill the post which has been left vacant since US President Donald Trump took office in January. The nominee’s appointment will be subjected to a US Senate confirmation hearing soon, which may allow Cha to take office before the PyeongChang Olympics here in February. If named, Cha will succeed Mark Lippert, who served in Seoul under the Obama administration. “We are working closely  to enable  to take office early,” an official at South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said. “We cannot confirm whether the agreement has been sent and any relevant procedures at this stage.”Cha is a former director for Asian affairs on the White House National Security Council and served as deputy head of the US delegation in multilateral talks with North Korea over its nuclear program during the administration of President George W. Bush. He now serves the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.If Cha is appointed, he is slated to become the second Korean-American to take the post after Ambassador Sung Kim. He has been widely seen as a strong candidate since August. The news of Cha’s nomination comes amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula following North Korea’s missile launch on Nov. 29. The rogue nation claimed it was a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile while experts said it could put the US mainland within its target range. It also comes mere days ahead of President Moon Jae-in’s scheduled summit with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. Cha is a supporter of a policy of “hawkish engagement” against North Korea, also referred to as “containment-plus-engagement.” It calls for strong US engagement in North Korean issues and negotiation which can benefit both sides, but also justifies a more aggressive approach if the other side breaks their terms. Cha has highlighted China’s relationship with the North as a core factor that could influence Pyongyang’s fast-developing weapons program. In an opinion piece published in the Washington Post last July, Cha said China must play a key role in the international community’s approach toward North Korea.“We should tell China that it has to pay to play. The basic trade would be Chinese disbursements to Pyongyang, as well as security assurances, in return for constraints on North Korea’s program. China would be paying not just for North Korean coal, but for North Korean compliance,” it said.He is also against a “freeze-for-freeze” offer proposed by China which asks the US to halt its regular military exercises, in return for a North Korean nuclear freeze.At a conference held earlier this year in Seoul, Cha said the Donald Trump administration must not rely solely on sanctions and diplomatic isolation in dealing with the North, noting that Pyongyang’s nuclear program is no longer “small.”“With regard to diplomacy, no US policy should be composed of only sanctions, military exercises and diplomatic isolation,” he said. “The portfolio of pressure and diplomacy in the administration of the past 25 years has been ineffective.” By Jung Min-kyung","office before the pyeongchang olympics ,president donald trump took office ,us senate confirmation hearing soon ,trump took office in january ,korean nuclear freeze at conference","['Donald Trump', 'White House', 'Washington', 'Victor Cha', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Washington', 'south korean', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'US Senate', 'Cha', 'Cha', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'South Korea ’s', 'Foreign Ministry', 'asian', 'the White House National Security Council', 'US', 'North Korea', 'George W.

At weekends, I get too tired, sleep or do work I couldn’t get done during the week,” Park Geun-young, 35, told The Korea Herald. “I feel like I have no life here.”A group calling for the revision of labor laws for fairer working conditions holds a rally outside the National Assembly on Nov. 15. A picket reads “over-work death out,” referring to deaths allegedly caused by the physical strain brought on by excessive work. Yonhap“I am stressed about the social atmosphere that pushes me to compare myself to others and compete for better pay, a better house and better education for my children all the time,” said the office worker. “All I want is to be happy and enjoy the moment without having to care about what others think.”For Park, who lived in Australia for two years, the remaining option is to leave the country and find hope elsewhere. “I know that life abroad wouldn’t be perfect, but at least, I think my work-life balance will be improved and I could enjoy the present more,” she said. She is not alone in feeling disenchanted about life in South Korea and seeking to escape from it.“We constantly receive inquiries from Koreans seeking to move to other countries for job opportunities and education for children,” said an official from a privately-run Boram Emigration Corporation. According to a survey on 3,710 Korean adults conducted by a job portal site Incruit from Nov. 28 to Dec. 5, 62.7 percent of the respondents agreed that South Korea is a “Hell Joseon.”“Hell Joseon” is a term coined in 2015, which harks back to the five-century-long, feudal Joseon dynasty’s class system and lampoons a growing inequality between the haves and not-haves in Korean society.The survey showed that some 54 percent of them had considered moving abroad. Their favored destination was Canada at 25.2 percent, followed by New Zealand at 21.2 percent, Singapore at 8.6 percent and Australia at 8.1 percent. More than half of them, 56 percent, said that they were willing to give up their Korean nationality if they succeeded in settling in another country.A desire to leave Korea seems to be more prevalent among the young generation who struggle to find a job amid the high unemployment rate. The youth unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 29 was 8.6 percent in October, hitting an all-time low. After they land a job, many struggle to find a balance between family and work in the country, where people on average work 2,069 hours per year as of 2016, the second longest among member counties of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. In a 2015 poll by a market research firm by Macromill Embrain on 1,000 adults, 57.9 percent said that they would not want to be born again in South Korea. In a survey that allowed multiple-choice answers, 76.6 percent of the respondents said that they wanted to live in a country where they can be more relaxed, 62.9 percent said they wanted to live in a country with a solid welfare system and 61.7 percent said they wanted to get out of the fierce competition in society.  Canada Carrer Immigration Fair But the reason they want to leave Korea is not just about the fierce competition. It is more about frustration and helplessness stemming from a social structure which seems to benefit only those who are privileged, said a 30-year-old student. “I think that the competition in Korean society is not something I can get over through efforts,” said the student, who only wanted to be identified by his surname Jung. “For someone like me without a good educational background and wealthy parents, there are only limited opportunities to enter the system.”A series of irregularities in society laid bare by a corruption scandal that removed former President Park Geun-hye from power in March and sent many of high-profile government officials and business tycoons to jail further eroded hope for the future, he said. “I cannot put my children through such an unfair system and I want them to live in a less competitive society,” Jung said. Kim Bong-moon, 31, who quit a job as a journalist, studied IT through a masters’ program at a university in New Zealand and moved to the country last year, said that he has no regrets about leaving Korea. “On the surface, my life in Korea was not bad and I was confident that I could do well in the competition,” said Kim, who now works as an engineer. “But by living that way, I realized that there would be nothing left for me. It was not a sustainable way of living.”“One of the major difference between life in Korea and life in New Zealand is that I don’t have to lock myself in a cycle  and can be on equal footing with everyone,” he said. “And people are more accepting of differences.”But he warned about fantasizing about moving outside of Korea. “Moving abroad doesn’t guarantee one’s happiness or solve all the problems from Korea.” Lee Byung-hoon, a sociology professor at Chung-Ang University, said that the ‘Hell Joseon’ phenomenon is a reflection of South Koreans of all ages struggling to survive amid a lack of jobs and unstable livelihoods. “By objective yardsticks, South Korea is better off than many other countries. But South Koreans feel discontent because of an inequality of opportunity. They feel like the playing field is uneven in the first place and their efforts will not pay off,” he said.“Such a problem has been developing for a long time, so it won’t change overnight,” he said. “The government should work to improve protection for the marginalized and improve the fairness of society through policies.”","pop music cutting edge smartphones ,koreans seeking to move to ,south korea dazzles the world ,business tycoons to jail further ,koreans of all ages struggling","['South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Park Geun - young', 'the Korea Herald', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Australia', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Boram Emigration Corporation', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Canada', 'New Zealand', 'Singapore', 'Australia', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Macromill Embrain', 'South Korea', 'Canada', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Jung', 'Park Geun', 'Jung', 'Kim Bong - moon', 'New Zealand', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'New Zealand', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Lee Byung - hoon', 'Chung - Ang University', 'South Koreans', 'South Korea', 'South Koreans']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46589604  0.87286657

But if it does happen, it could be interpreted as a positive sign for North Korea’s participation in the PyeongChang Olympics,” another government source said, adding that there was a possibility of a lower level official of the IOC making the trip instead of Bach. In September, North Korea’s pairs figure skating duo Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik qualified for the Winter Games. But the country did not confirm by the Oct. 30 deadline whether it would send its figure skating pairs team to PyeongChang. As long as the North is willing to participate, the doors are still open. The IOC said it is considering granting wild card entries to select North Korean athletes, and offered to cover all their expenses. Bach has repeatedly stated that the IOC has invited North Korea to the PyeongChang Games. The South Korean government is also making efforts for the North’s participation, hoping it would help alleviate tension on the Korean Peninsula. President Moon Jae-in and Seoul’s top officials have said they were willing to wait until the last minute for North Korea to make a decision to take part in the winter games. The South’s Unification Ministry said on Friday it will continue to support North Korea’s participation in the PyeongChang Games to make it a “Peace Olympics.” “We will continue communicating through various channels such as the PyeongChang Olympic Organizing Committee and the International Sports Federation ,” said the ministry’s vice spokesperson Lee Eugene. Some North Korea watchers are hopeful the North may accept the visit, considering that Jeffrey Feltman, the United Nations’ undersecretary general for political affairs, visited Pyongyang after last week’s long-range missile test.

As ASEAN generally suffers from a shortage and dilapidation of infrastructure, Korea’s expertise in industrial and infrastructural development comes in handy, particularly in the frontier fields of smart transportation, renewable energy and information and communication technology, industry experts said at the fifth ASEAN Connectivity Forum on Wednesday.The event was jointly organized by the ASEAN-Korea Center and Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and invited many high-level government officials, financial institution and corporate executives, scholars and journalists from ASEAN and Korea. Participants pose for a picture at the fifth ASEAN Connectivity Forum on Wednesday. Experts from multilateral development banks offered comprehensive overviews of financing and procurement through the public-private partnership arrangement; ASEAN government representatives presented the latest information on key connectivity-related projects; and Korean investors and ASEAN company representatives engaged in one-on-one business meetings. “Recently, we have seen positive signs that global private capital is increasingly invested in developing countries’ infrastructure projects,” said Bambang Brodjonegoro, Indonesian minister of national development planning. “Multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, Asian Infrastructure Development Bank and Asian Development Bank, as well as government agencies of developing countries have assisted the PPP framework in most ASEAN countries, to attract more private sector and foreign investments in infrastructure projects.”ASEAN needs $3.3 billion of investment in its transportation, water, energy and ICT infrastructures through 2030, the second-largest demand in the world after the Middle East, according to a report by McKinsey and Co. The region’s combined population of 670 million people and combined gross domestic product of $2.6 trillion present gigantic commercial opportunities, experts say. “Korean President Moon Jae-in’s vision for a ‘future Korea-ASEAN community’ comprises people-to-people exchanges, security cooperation and economic collaboration, a goal ASEAN and Korea can pursue together,” said Yoon Soon-gu, Korea’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs. Seoul will provide an additional $100 million to its Global Infrastructure Fund for increased investment in ASEAN by 2022, he added.ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary General Kim Young-sun speaks at the 5th ASEAN Connectivity Forum on Nov. 29 Son Byeong-suk, Korea’s vice minister of land, infrastructure and transport, said the forum will help formulate different models of strategic collaboration between the two regions’ governments and companies, financial institutions and technical centers.“I firmly believe that combining ASEAN’s boundless growth potential and the people’s passion for national development on one hand, with Korea’s experience, technology and financing on the other hand, would contribute greatly to both their economic growth,” said Son. ASEAN is Korea’s second-largest trade partner and top investment destination, and the two sides are working to reach $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. Since the entry into force of the ASEAN-Korea Trade in Goods Agreement in June 2007, bilateral trade in goods has grown by 9.2 percent annually, reaching $125 billion last year and making Korea ASEAN’s fifth-largest trade partner.“The Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity 2025 targets five strategic areas of sustainable infrastructure, digital innovation, seamless logistics, regulatory excellence and people mobility,” said Ambassador Elizabeth P. Buensuceso, chair of the Committee of Permanent Representatives to ASEAN and ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee. “By 2025, we should like to have increased infrastructure investments, higher infrastructural productivity and more application of smart city models throughout ASEAN.” By Joel Lee","vision for future korea asean ,for future korea asean community ,for asean connectivity 2025 blueprints ,smart city models throughout asean ,for increased investment in asean","['ASEAN', 'Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'korean', 'ASEAN', 'Bambang Brodjonegoro', 'indonesian', 'the World Bank', 'Asian Infrastructure Development Bank', 'Asian Development Bank', 'ASEAN', 'ICT', 'McKinsey and Co.', 'korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'Yoon Soon - gu', 'Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Global Infrastructure Fund', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'Kim Young', 'Son Byeong - suk', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Elizabeth P.

Living in a three-bedroom apartment in Pyongyang, he attended Taekwondo classes, visited parks and took ferry rides. Lee Sung-ju poses before an interview with The Korea Herald But his comfortable life was shattered with the death of the North’s founding father Kim Il-sung in 1994. Lee’s father -- who had been working as an official of the guard unit for Kim Il-sung -- fell out of favor with the new regime led by Kim’s son, Kim Jong-il. And then, he was caught complaining “there is no future” in the Stalinist regime. The cost for his slip of the tongue was much harsher than one can imagine. Lee’s family was forced to flee the prosperous capital and move to the northern city of Gyeongseong. Telling him to look for food, his parents left him and never returned. He was 12. “When I was young, my dream was to become a military officer to protect our motherland from US bastards,” Lee, 30, said in an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. “But the dream was changed into having a solid three meals every day.” Left with no choice but to fend for himself, Lee picked pockets and stole food from merchants. He banded together with six other boys to form a street gang which was more like a group of beggars. They are called “kkotjebi,” which means flowering swallows in Korean. To avoid being caught, they would move from one town to another every few months. Almost every time, they clashed with other gangs who were already there. It was often a life-and-death struggle, involving rocks and iron rods. In one such fight, a member of Lee’s gang received a blow to the head and died. Then his closest friend Young-bum was killed by a farm guard for trying to steal potatoes. He dug a grave and buried them by himself. Lee and Young-bum were 13. “I had seven friends and Young-bum was the closest one. We were more like brothers. Before Young-bum died, he told me not to tell his parents he died. He asked me to tell them that he just left the gang. I cried my eyes out,” he said. His life on the street went on for more than three years until he reunited with his grandfather. It turned out that his grandfather had never given up searching for Lee, coming to a train station every Sunday in the hopes of finding him. One day, a mysterious man approached Lee with an important message. The stranger was a broker who helped North Koreans escape from the country. The man was sent by Lee’s father, who had defected to South Korea via China in 1998. With the broker’s help, Lee crossed the Tumen River and came to China. With a fake passport, he boarded a plane to South Korea. A week after escaping the North, he was reunited with his father in November 2002 at the age of 16. The last time Lee contacted his remaining family in North Korea was 2005. He then heard his grandparents were doing fine in Pyongyang, so were his aunts and uncles. His mother is still missing despite years of searching. “Not all defectors’ family members face purges. It depends on how they treat it,” Lee said, responding to the question whether he is worried about the safety of his family in the North. “It’s OK. My father and I are documented as dead in North Korea.” Finding a new hope in the South Lee Sung-ju poses before an interview with The Korea Herald His new life in South Korea was never easy. He started going to middle school and made friends there, although he was three years older than his classmates. But the most challenging part was to establish a new identity. Caught between his childhood memories in the North and his new life in the South, Lee had felt as if he was a stranger -- neither North Korean nor South Korean. To pull himself together, he gave himself a mission: Rescue those facing the same fate as his in the North and bring them to the South safely. Now, the 30-year-old Lee works as an activist for Citizen’s Alliance for North Korea Human Rights. “Later on, I realized that I am both North Korean and South Korean. So I am Korean. That was the new identity I found. It gives me the dream that I have to pursue: reunification of the two Koreas. That is the only way to bring me home.” Lee has been focusing on young North Korean girls in China who suffer sexual assault and physical abuse after being married off to Chinese men for money. Without no official status in China, those women have no idea what awaits them until they arrive. Having undergone horrendous abuses, some of them are sold off to another man again. In the worst case, their organs are removed for sale on the black market, he said. Lee recalled a young woman who fled from her abusive husband with a 28-day-old baby. Despite the warning against the risk involving the escape, she said she would rather die with her baby than stay in China. When Lee met them in South Korea, the baby’s bellybutton was barely cut from umbilical cord. “She was married to three different Chinese men beaten by the husband each time. Coming to South Korea via third countries from China is a very dangerous route. I told her it’s is so risky and the kid could die. She replied, ‘if the baby could die, it would have been dead already. We will leave anyway.’” According to Lee, those defecting to South Korea come mostly from China. Most of them have lived there for about five years and experienced human rights abuses. Of the 70 women his organization rescued this year, 90 percent of them fell into this category, he said. Bringing them to South Korea, too, is an arduous endeavor requiring an enormous amount of money and a complicated process. Crossing the Tumen River alone costs up to 20 million won  to bribe North Korean border guards. The prices have risen lately due to the toughened border security, he said. Regarding the reasons for fleeing from North Korea, most of them are still leaving the communist regime to survive, but indications emerge that an increasing number of North Koreans chose to defect for better education and an open society. “There is a defector who left North Korea who wanted to become a judge after graduating from a prestigious law school in Seoul. He was denied such opportunity in the North because his aunt defected to South Korea. But I think it’s still a rare case. Most of them left for survival.” Millennials are key to change in the North For Lee, those defectors residing in South Korea can play a significant role in bringing forward the reunification of the two Koreas. The way they can contribute to the endeavor is through the money they send to their families in the North. Although there is no official data on the remittance available due to the South Korean government’s ban on money wires to the North, the amount of remittance hovers around 30 billion won per year, Lee said. According to statistics from the Ministry of Unification, a total of 30,490 North Koreans have resettled in the South as of March 2017. The annual average of remittance stood at 1.64 million won, according to a poll released by local daily Chosun Ilbo in January 2016.Such an amount of money can help create “middle-class” merchants in North Korea, which is key to transforming the communist country into the market economy. “Money sent to North Korea can become bidding money for commercial interactions,” said Lee. “Middle-class merchants felt they were blocked from such opportunities… they were caught between corrupt officials and big-shot merchants.” When North Korea’s founding father Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il were in power, speaking out against the totalitarian regime was unthinkable. Those born in this era wouldn’t dare to topple their “dear leaders” -- an outcome of the decadeslong brainwashing program. But the young North Koreans -- particularly those born in the 1980s and ‘90s who constitute roughly 25 percent of the population of nearly 25 million people -- are more individualistic than their parents. Instead of expecting the state to bail them out, they navigate for their own survival in a capitalist fashion, Lee said. “Young North Koreans don’t have any fantasies about the era ruled by the Kim families. Of course, they also praise the regime and worship Kim Jong-un in public, but what they really focus on is how to make money.” “Admittedly, those who rule North Korea right now are mostly born during the era when the North Korean economy is better than that of the South. So it’s almost impossible to see a collapse from within. But, 20 years from now, I think there will be a big change.” By Yeo Jun-suk","dead in north korea finding ,brothers before young bum died ,three bedroom apartment in pyongyang ,aunt defected to south korea ,abusive husband with 28 day","['North Korea', 'Lee Sung - ju', 'Pyongyang', 'Taekwondo', 'Lee Sung - ju', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Lee', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Kim ’s', 'Kim Jong - il', 'stalinist', 'Lee', 'Gyeongseong', 'US', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Korean', 'Lee ’s', 'Lee', 'Young', 'Young', 'Young', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Lee', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Lee', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee', 'North Korea', 'Lee Sung - ju', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Korea', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Lee', 'Citizen ’s Alliance for North Korea Human Rights', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'korean', 'Koreas', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'China', 'chinese', 'China', 'Lee', 'China', 'Lee', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Lee', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Koreas', 'south korean', 'Lee', 'the Ministry of Unification', 'North Koreans', 'Chosun Ilbo', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Lee', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - il', 'North Koreans', 'Lee', 'North Koreans', 'Kim', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",11,"[ 0.          5.          2.         ... -0.69364083  0.16456622

But Pyongyang has since remained mum on the matter and made no attempts to communicate so far, said NBC sports, citing the International Skating Union. It also added that by ISU rules, the spot initially occupied by the North Korean skaters will eventually be offered to Japan, a top contender who has not already qualified. “It is up to the North Korean Olympic Committee to decide whether they will participate or not,” Ryom and Kim’s coach, Kim Hyon-son, said after the Berlin competition, according to the New York Times.Despite North Korea’s lack of response, it still has a chance to compete in the Winter Games as the International Olympic Committee has hinted it may grant special wild card slots to North Korean athletes. IOC President Thomas Bach said and offered to provide support if necessary.The committee said in September it could cover the costs of their athletics equipment if the North asked for support. Seoul has repeatedly urged its neighbor to participate in the upcoming Winter Games to turn the event into a “peace festival.” President Moon Jae-in and South Korea’s top officials reiterated that the doors for North Korea will remain open until the last minute. Many saw North Korea’s nearly 70-day hiatus in military provocations as a sign of willingness to talk, but the rogue nation shattered expectations by launching a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday. It is capable of reaching the US mainland, experts in both South Korea and the US said. The latest missile liftoff sparked concerns here on the possibility of hosting the games amid mounting tensions on the Korean Peninsula. “As the PyeongChang Winter Olympics and the South Korea-US military exercise happen to coincide with each other, how to resolve this situation is an important task,” Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said at a Seoul forum on Thursday, referring to a joint military exercise between South Korea and the US that usually takes place in March and April. A senior Cheong Wa Dae official told reporters Friday that despite the North’s latest missile launch, its presence at the Olympics is expected alleviate ongoing tensions on the peninsula. Whether the military drill will be delayed or scrapped remains undecided, he said.The IOC is considering inviting North Korea’s IOC member to its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to address its stance toward the upcoming games. Last month, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution upholding peaceful and safe passage for all participating nations during the Olympic period. It was submitted by the South Korean government in September in a bid to halt all conflicts during the athletic events. North Korea in November also skipped the final competition of the ISU World Cup Short Track in Seoul, which was considered as a last chance to qualify for the Olympic Games. North Korea only competed at the first two events of the four short track World Cups and the Olympic quotas were filled based on the top three winners who participated in all four rounds. The organizing committee for PyeongChang told Yonhap News Agency on Friday it is taking a “wait-and-see approach” on North Korea’s participation. The Olympic participation is apparently a sensitive issue in Pyongyang as well, an official there said.

The Korean government constructed five large oil storage tanks for national energy security amid an oil crisis in the 1970s. The place was abandoned after its operation was halted in 2000. The sixth tank was built last year as part of the depot’s renewal. Mapo Cultural Depot Park. Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentMaking use of this site was one of the first projects Mayor Park Won-soon initiated after he took office. Park’s main question was how to maximize the potential of the old 11,510-square-meter space. “Through six rounds of public hearings and contests in which citizens, students and city construction experts participated, a public consensus was constructed that the site should be renewed into an eco-friendly culture complex,” said Choi Hyoun-sil, director of the parks development division under the city government. A detailed blue print was unveiled earlier this year, which focused on transforming the site into a place for cultural events, performing arts and exhibitions. “By taking into account the fact that the area around the storage was the city’s garbage dump and that it is close to major performance venues such as the Sangam World Cup Stadium and the Digital Media Center, the city government decided that it would be appropriate to build a culture park on the site,” said Heo Seo-goo, architect and CEO of Wondoshi Architects Group, which designed the culture park. Mapo Cultural Depot Park. Seoul Metropolitan Government“Although the surrounding area had seen a rapid pace of makeovers for the past 10 years or so, the oil storage site had remained a remnant of the industrial age,” Heo said.Instead of demolishing the former oil storage facility, the city government decided to keep the 15-meter tank walls and retain the natural topography of the area as much as possible. The facility was 10 times larger than Seoul Plaza.Heo highlighted how the storage tanks have been revamped. “These tanks were empty and still are empty, although they have been transformed into exhibition halls and concert halls. The unique beauty of these massive oil tanks will provide joy and fun to citizens,” he said.Following its grand opening in September, over a thousand people have visited Mapo Cultural Depot Park, which has walking trails and eateries. Out of the original five tanks, tank one has become a multipurpose pavilion made of glass. A design festival was recently held there. Tank two serves as an outdoor amphitheater with a wall of cascading green vines and concrete stones scattered around that can be used as seats or tables. Tanks three, four and five are spaces for exhibitions and cultural events. Tank six -- the largest -- serves as an information center. It also houses a cafe on the bottom floor.Mapo Cultural Depot Park represents a new model for public development through renewal, Seoul City said.“Without wide public discussion such as contests, civic forums and expert workshops, it would have been impossible to come up with the best idea -- to have the old oil reserve reborn into a place for every citizen,” said Lee Je-won, director of urban planning at Seoul City. “We are committed to making this place a new landmark of Seoul.”By Kim Da-sol","government constructed five large oil ,constructed five large oil storage ,five large oil storage tanks ,the old oil reserve reborn ,seoul the former oil storage","['Mapo Oil Depot', 'Maebongsan', 'Seoul', 'Mapo Cultural Depot Park', 'korean', 'Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentMaking', 'Park Won - soon', 'Park ’s', 'Choi Hyoun - sil', 'the Digital Media Center', 'Heo Seo - goo', 'Wondoshi Architects Group', 'Seoul Metropolitan', 'Mapo Cultural Depot Park', 'Mapo Cultural Depot Park', 'Seoul City', 'Lee Je - won', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63222432 -0.02645187

Anyone from the neighboring country who fits the required criteria will be eligible for a 15-day stay in South Korea without a visa, starting Dec. 1 through the end of March next year, the ministry said in a statement. The no-visa applicant must be a Chinese citizen with records of arrival and departure in and from Korea with a legal visa issued by the Korean authorities in the last five years. The applicant also needs to have an entry ticket to the Olympic Games, purchased through designated Chinese travel agencies, among other requirements.  The applicant's request will be denied if he or she is either convicted of a crime in violation of Korean laws, or holds an extradition record or a history of illegal stay, the ministry said. The move comes amid signs of a diplomatic thaw between Seoul and Beijing over a prolonged trade spat stemming from Korea's deployment of the THAAD advanced US missile defense system. Beijing had banned its travel agencies from selling group tours to its citizens in protest of the deployment, dealing a blow to tourism-related industries in Korea. But following the summit earlier this month between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, Korea seems to be getting back on track with its Chinese tourist tallies. The justice ministry also said it will temporarily allow individual Chinese tourists to land here by ship next year, on top of groups from cruise ships already being permitted into the nation. Additionally, the ministry said the length of stay for cruises entering ports near PyeongChang during the games will be extended to five days from the current three days.","korea without visa starting dec ,pyeongchang winter olympic games anyone ,month between south korean president ,next year pyeongchang winter olympic ,south korea without visa starting","[""South Korea 's"", 'Chinese', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'korean', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Korea', 'thaad', 'US', 'Beijing', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'PyeongChang']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66623873  0.69742775

Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon ""What's most important is to host the PyeongChang Olympics in a stable atmosphere,"" he said.The allies have not announced the start date for the major exercises, named Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, but they usually kick off the war games in late February or early March.The North has long described the drills as a rehearsal for invasion and used them as an excuse for provocations.Defense sources said earlier that South Korea may request that the US postpone the training to avoid an overlap with Olympic events.The minister was doubtful about the secretive communist nation's claim that it has completed the nuclear weapons development.Emboldened by the successful launch of what it claims to be a new intercontinental ballistic missile Wednesday, the North announced that it has completed the establishment of the country's ""nuclear force.""Cho said the government's view is that it might be a ""hasty"" declaration.""Until recently, there were indications that North Korea has faced limits in connection with atmospheric re-entry technology, guiding and sending  to an intended point, and blowing up  at a timing it wants,"" he added.","war games in late february ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympic games ,winter olympic games and annual ,annual south korea us war ,pyeongchang winter olympic games","[""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Cho Myoung - gyon', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'Paralympics', 'Cho Myoung - gyon', 'Key Resolve', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea']",15,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.37691709  0.46009821

The Olympics Information Call Center will join hands with Korea Tourism Organization‘s calling number ’1330‘ and provide assistance in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese, starting from late November to March 2018. It is said that 19 to 23 call center operators will be on stand-by to help those in need of assistance related to the Olympics. With just 70 days left ahead of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics, Gangwon Province vowed to push ahead to alleviate the accommodation problem. Gov. Choi Moon-soon’s first priority is to actualize policies regarding accommodation prices‘ stabilization by expanding the number of bookable rooms in the region that are reasonably priced. In order to expand the number of bookable facilities available to Olympic Games’ visitors, the number of rooms bookable at good quality facilities, such as large-scale hotels and resorts, will be promoted first such that general visitors can make reservations early on. It is currently estimated that there are 44 large-scale facilities and 15,322 rooms that are a 1-hour journey the Olympic Games events, but most run on a ‘members-only’ policy. Visitors can only reserve a room at these places 30 days prior to their intended stay.  Gangwon Gov. Choi Moon-soon  speaks at a press meeting on Monday.Recent negotiating talks between Gangwon Province and hotels and resorts have successfully ended in mutual agreement to provide 4,904 bookable rooms in 17 facilities, starting from December. Furthermore, Gangwon Province plans on future negotiating talks with 27 facilities under Daemyung and Hanhwa Resort to vitalize both early reservations for the 10,418 rooms and the overall region during the Winter Olympics. Because most large-scale hotels are located in a nearby city of PyeongChang, a free shuttle bus will be provided for visitors‘ convenience in going back-and-forth from the Olympics events to the hotels and resorts. To observe an increase in early reservations for hotel accommodations, Gangwon Province and Booking.com plan on holding a joint press conference, explaining the details regarding activating the reservation system. Moreover, to stabilize prices in accommodation during the Winter Olympics, Gangwon Province plans on encouraging hotels to participate in rational pricing policies by providing firm guidance and inspection on price information. In efforts to prohibit any facilities from overcharging visitors, a call center for those wanting to make a report regarding accommodation, prices such as overcharging practices, will be in place. Visitors can call the following numbers: 1330, 033-249-3186, 033-660-3023, 033-330-2303. Follow-up investigations will be strictly enforced. Those found to be guilty of overcharging practices will be excluded from any support the Gangwon Province provides during the Winter Olympics. Also, a full-on tax report investigation will be conducted on those businesses. A special safety inspection on all 1,404 facilities in PyeongChang and nearby cities will be routinely carried through in order to eradicate any unreasonable pricing in business operations, starting from December to the end of PyeongChang Olympics. On top of issuing facilities’ owners reasonable room pricing information, the policies will help accommodations avoid any empty rooms during the Olympics and provide visitors with accurate, reasonable room pricing and transportation. Gov. Choi also predicted that with the opening of high-speed KTX train service, which connects the gateway city of Incheon to Gangwon Province via Seoul within an hour, will result in an increase in room prices in Seoul if the cost of a room in PyeongChang remains high. Most importantly, Gov. Choi also vowed to make Gangwon Province a year-round tourist spot.

He is scheduled to hold meetings with Yun and Sen. Ed Markey  and deliver a speech at a forum in Washington. He will then fly to New York to discuss North Korean humanitarian aid issues with the United Nations Population Fund and the UN Children's Fund.Lee is set to arrive in the US Tuesday for a four-day visit to Washington and New York, which will include meetings with Yun, other government officials and experts. ""It is my first trip to the US since taking office ,"" Lee told Yonhap News Agency before boarding a flight to the US. ""I plan to meet and discuss matters with Special Representative Joseph Yun and officials from the National Security Council, the State Department and the United Nations' Secretariat.""""As I have met up with all the top negotiators for member countries of the six-party talks , I will discuss, based on the previous meetings, what to do next and what to make of today's situation.""","nuclear standoff with north korea ,washington seoul two senior south ,top nuclear envoy told reporters ,york to discuss north korean ,yun washington top nuclear envoy","['WASHINGTON', 'south korean', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'Chun Hae - sing', 'Lee Do - hoon', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee Do - hoon', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Defense', 'Jim Mattis', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Joseph Yun', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Chun', 'US', 'Ed Markey', 'Washington', 'New York', 'north korean', 'the United Nations Population Fund', ""the UN Children 's Fund"", 'Lee', 'US', 'Washington', 'New York', 'US', 'Lee', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'US', 'Joseph Yun', 'the National Security Council', 'the State Department', ""the United Nations ' Secretariat""]",13,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.53018814  0.59541631

Field grasped why Thae, acclimated to Britain’s liberal democratic society, risked the lives of himself and his family to flee to the South, forsaking their diplomatic privileges. “What the story shows is that Thae lived in London and saw his children grow up in a liberal and democratic society, and how much they benefitted from it. It must have impacted him during his time as North Korean diplomat,” Field said in an interview at the British Embassy in Seoul on Friday. “The message to be taken from this is that keeping any lines of communication and diplomacy is critical to gradually changing the system. You never know just the impact it will have down the road. More often than not the oppressive regimes collapse not because they are overthrown, but because of their internal inconsistencies.”UK Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field speaks to The Korea Herald at the British Embassy in Seoul on Friday. The more lines of communication there are between the world and the government in Pyongyang, the higher the chance of reconfiguring future generations’ thinking, Field said. “That’s how diplomacy works. It’s frustrating and takes a long time. But you have to be patient,” he said. “The British and Korean peoples should be confident and proud of our values: individual freedom, the rule of law, democracy and human rights. We should be confident in slowly, steadfastly and painstakingly spreading these values around the world.”He added that he strongly believed there were elites ensconced in Pyongyang’s upper echelons who may staunchly back the regime on their countenance, but harbor doubts about their future and switch sides when push comes to shove. Thae, meanwhile, has acted as a born-again preacher of democracy and freedom, exposing North Korea’s state-sponsored crimes, corruption and injustice and imploring its downfall through speaking tours in South Korea and around the world. The former diplomat said he did not fear his death should North Korean assassins try to kill him. Thae and his family live under the protection of security personnel. Thae Yong-ho, former deputy chief of the North Korean Embassy in London, defected to South Korea in the summer of 2016. He has since been a fierce critic of the North Korean regime, exposing critical information to the outside world. During a tour of the United States from Oct. 30 through Nov. 6, Thae met with high-ranking US government officials, politicians, think tank academics and journalists, and asserted that a “Pyongyang Spring” is possible by relentlessly implanting outside information and “soft power” contents into the North. “The North Korean regime cannot stop its people from watching South Korean movies and dramas even by threatening to punish them, or actually executing them,” he told local media after returning from his US tour. “South Korean soap operas and K-pop music have long infiltrated the country. The regime is hell-bent on reversing the tide, but unable to stop it.” What leader Kim Jong-un fears the most is information that exposes the contradictions of the mythical, insuperable nation he and his predecessors have contrived, thereby triggering the downtrodden people to rise up in arms against the elites, Thae said. He added the probability of a revolution was gradually increasing. Change in the North is “100 percent possible given a continuation of soft power infiltration.”In particular, Thae stressed the importance of “tailor-made content,” explaining basic concepts of democracy, freedom and human rights and designed to sow doubts in North Korean minds and make them question their lot. “The ultimate objective of pressure should be regime change or transformation of the regime,” he underscored. “We must have conviction that the regime will either change or capitulate. Time is on our side.”Thae Yong-ho, former chief of mission at the North Korean embassy in the United Kingdom, testifies during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, November 1, 2017 in Washington, DC. Field, on his second official visit to Korea as state minister since assuming the post on June 13, met with Korean Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam and other officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the international sanctions placed on North Korea for its unrelenting nuclear and missile development, Field, citing British diplomatic sources at the UK Embassy in Pyongyang, said, “It’s very clear that the sanctions posed by the international community are beginning to have an impact on North Korean lives.”The UK government has suspended its aid program for North Korea, announced the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on Friday. The British Foreign Ministry said in a recent report that Pyongyang had received about 240,000 pounds  of official development assistance from London from last April through March this year, while advancing its nuclear and missile arsenal. The money purportedly went to five projects covering English education; the teaching of British values and norms to North Korean officials; the improvement of access to rehabilitative services for people outside Pyongyang; the repair of mobile waterworks in Kangwon Province; and the provision of relief in post-disaster emergency situations. On defense cooperation with South Korea, Field said, “Cybersecurity and cyber-defense in both military and civilian sectors will continue to grow from strength to strength in the years to come.”North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspects a tractor factory in November. Field served on the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee from September 2010 through March 2015, and from 2015 through 2017 served as the Conservative Party’s Vice Chairman of International Affairs, a role that involved extensive diplomatic contact and work with senior figures in sister parties around the world. He was first elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for the Cities of London and Westminster in 2001, and worked as a corporate lawyer prior to entering politics. On Britain exiting the European Union, Field said both sides were working hard to reach an agreement by the European Council meeting on Dec. 14-15 on three main issues: the rights of EU nationals in the UK and British nationals in the EU; Northern Ireland’s border with Ireland; and the financial settlement referred to as the “divorce bill.” That would pave the way for the two sides to move onto discussions about the terms of trade and transition period. “Though there will be a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the issues over the next few months, businesses will continue to trade regardless of whether there is an FTA  or not,” the politician said. “I don’t believe in zero-sum games, I don’t think it’s the way diplomacy should operate either.”By Joel Lee","korean embassy in london defected ,his us tour south korean ,london defected to south korea ,tour south korean soap operas ,us tour south korean soap","['the north Korean Embassy', 'London', 'South Korea', 'UK', 'Seoul', 'Thae', 'Britain', 'Thae', 'London', 'north korean', 'field', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Field', 'british', 'korean', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'the north Korean Embassy', 'London', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'the United States', 'US', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'US', 'south korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Thae', 'Thae', 'north korean', 'time', 'Yong - ho', 'north korean', 'the United Kingdom', 'House Foreign Affairs Committee', 'Capitol Hill', 'Washington ,', 'DC', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'North Korea', 'Field', 'british', 'the UK Embassy', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'UK', 'North Korea', 'the Foreign and Commonwealth Office', 'the british Foreign Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'London', 'english', 'british', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Kangwon Province', 'South Korea', 'Field', 'korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Conservative Party ’s', 'International Affairs', 'the Cities of London', 'Britain', 'the European Union', 'Field', 'the European Council', 'EU', 'UK', 'british', 'EU', 'Northern Ireland ’s', 'Ireland', 'FTA', 'Joel Lee']",10,"[ 0.          8.          5.         ... -0.62842065  0.16483845

The PyeongChang Olympics runs from Feb. 9-25 in several cities in Gangwon Province, but ticket sales have been lagging partly due to difficulties in booking affordable accommodations near the sports venues.With rooms in brand hotels and resorts already booked by the organizing committee, individual visitors have found it hard to reserve decent places in Pyeongchang, Gangneung and other cities. PyeongChang will host some skiing and sliding events, while Gangneung, some 20 kilometers east of PyeongChang, will host all ice events. Jeongseon, about 20 kilometers south of PyeongChang, will be home to alpine skiing.The average prices for cheap accommodations go over 500,000 won  per night, more than triple the peak season prices, with a pension with a spacious room asking for 1.8 million won per night.Some business owners even refuse to take reservations from individual travelers, while others ask for more than is shown on the official booking system. In response to rising complaints, the provincial government released a set of measures to increase the number of rooms available during the sports events and encourage local business owners to offer rooms at reasonable prices. ""Excessive room rates would only hurt local tourism,"" a provincial government official in charge of accommodation policy said. ""Business owners will have to set up reasonable rates soon if they do not want to leave their rooms empty during the Olympic period.""The provincial government also plans to operate a call center to link foreigners to local business owners in the run up to the games.As a high speed train linking between Seoul and Gangneung is set to operate starting from Dec. 22, industry officials expect some travelers may opt for hotels in the capital city and use the train that takes less than two hours to get to major venues.

Recently, some of these spaces were unveiled to the public for the first time under a special one-month tour program. Although city-run tours of the “ghost station” in Sinseol-dong and the air-raid shelter underneath Gyeonghuigung Palace are to end this weekend, one underneath Yeouido, turned into a museum, will remain open for visitors. Ghost station A pair of purple doors hides a secret platform that has been sealed off to the public for over four decades underneath Sinseol-dong Station. One floor below the busy Sinseol-dong station, this ghost station has been regularly awaken by passing trains, though, as those finishing the day’s work run on its rails in the darkness on their way to the garage. The platform was constructed in 1974, but the route plan changed and it has never been used by passengers. On the wall at one end of the platform hangs a sign “11-3 Sinseol-dong,” so dusty and worn that it is hard to make out, reflecting the time passed since it was put up. Sinseol-dong station’s secret platform did not arouse much public interest until location scouts for film and music videos became interested in its unique atmosphere and setting. The Korean film “Cold Eyes” and music videos by some of K-pop’s most popular groups, such as EXO and Twice, were shot here prompting viewers to call the hidden platform “ghost station.” The “ghost station” under the Sinseol-dong subway station During the tour program that runs through Nov. 26, the dark tunnel was opened to the public for the first time in 44 years. Registrations for the tour program quickly filled up in October. A Seoul City official said no decision had been made on its future use, including whether or not to hold the tours again next year. Secret presidential hideout In the financial district of Yeouido, a secret bunker is hidden below the Yeouido Bus Transfer Center, and is now being used as a public museum. Nothing was known about the underground shelter before it was discovered in 2005, when the city was constructing the bus transfer center there. The 871-square-meter area was flooded when it was first found and it had sofa sets, a toilet and a shower booth inside. The city looked into aerial photographs of the surface area taken in the past and finally concluded that the bunker was likely to have been constructed in 1977. They also believe it was created as a secret hideout for the dictator at the time, Park Chung-hee, as it is located right below where the stage was placed for the Armed Forces Day event in 1977. The interior of a secret underground bunker in Yeouido The city gathered ideas from citizens and turned the area into an art exhibition space, but left everything where they found it, except for installing safety and air conditioning facilities. A box that was found full of keys is displayed there along with modern art pieces now. The Seoul Museum of Art, which launched on Oct. 19, is open from Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and entrance is free. Air-raid shelter underneath palace Just below the historic Gyeonghuigung in Jongno is a secret air-raid shelter that is sealed off from the outside world by a thick, blueish iron gate.This door, which stands out in the grassy surroundings, leads to a hidden space that dates back to South Korea’s Japanese colonial period from 1910-1945. Located below what used to be the site of the king and queen’s bedroom, the underground shelter is thought to have been built in 1944 as an annex to the communication base station at that time. It appears to have been protecting the network facilities against possible air-raids during the warring period. Its outer concrete wall appears to be about 3 meters thick and the ceiling, 8.5 meters thick. The gate of an air-raid shelter on the compound of Gyeonghuigung Palace The site is left in its original state with its old, cracked walls and holes. It was discovered in the 1980s during excavation which was part of preparations for the restoration of Gyeonghuigung. The two-story area is divided into 10 rooms and a hallway, with the rooms ceilings open as to provide a view inside of the rooms on the second floor. On the attic-like second floor is a gate reduced to rubble, which is assumed to have connected the shelter with the palace. Seoul City has installed special sound effects of the emergency siren and one resembling an air raid, to re-enact how it might have felt to use the shelter, and to add to the eerie and cold atmosphere. The shelter is now managed by Seoul Museum of History. During the tour program, 960 citizens visited. Previously the area was opened only for educational purposes for middle and high school students from 2014 to 2016.

Seoul City further hopes to change the remaining 3,000 buses from 2026. An electric bus model with a 300-kilometer range was recently produced, enabling the plan. Previous models, able to run between 100 to 200 kilometers with a single charge, were difficult to utilize for long-distance routes. City officials are worried that some bus operators might disagree with the new plan. It is to offer a subsidy of 250 million won  to the operators for buying a single electric bus, which costs around 500 million won. The operators would have to cover for the remaining 200 million won for each bus. Previously, with the CNG bus which costs around 200 million won, the government and the operators shared the burden equally, paying 100 million won each. Operators have to pay an extra 100 million won with the new change. “There is a supplementary burden for the operators. Electric buses, however, do not charge fuel,” a city official said. “Local buses are one of the main reasons for the fine dust in the city. This is a policy to ameliorate the atmosphere and make Seoul better.”By Im Eun-byel","more buses by 2025 seoul ,40 electric buses will replace ,030 more buses by 2025 ,to replace 030 more buses ,more buses by 2025","['Seoul City', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul', 'Eun']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23752142  0.19542383

Latvia waded through devastating foreign reigns, but preserved its indigenous spirit, culture and language, a historical path that has similarly molded the modern Korean psyche. Akin to South Korea perennially under the menace of its bellicose northern neighbor, Latvia has had to confront increasingly assertive Russia on its eastern flank.But these adversities have strengthened their national characters: Korea achieved its rapid postwar development as one of the “Four Asian Tigers,” while Latvia has steadily punched above its weight by adroitly aligning with European institutions and its Baltic neighbors to engage with far-flung economic powerhouses around the world. The freedom-loving northern European country commemorates the 100th anniversary of the declaration of independence next year, when Korea will host its first-ever PyeongChang Olympic Games. Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis will visit Korea on a maiden state visit to mark the occasion.Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars  and his spouse Rina  greet Georgian Ambassador to Korea Otar Berdzenishvili  at the National Day reception in Seoul on Friday, which celebrated Latvia’s 99th anniversary of state proclamation on Nov. 18, 1918. Latvia and Korea’s growing partnership and friendship were on full display at the National Day reception in Seoul on Friday, which celebrated Latvia’s 99th anniversary of state proclamation on Nov. 18, 1918 from the Russian Empire.“I would like to underline the continuing strong ties between Latvia and Korea since we established our diplomatic relations 26 years ago,” said Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars in a speech. “We have been blessed with all our Korean partners’ friendship and eagerness.”Vaivars, who previously served in Japan, is the first resident Latvian ambassador to Korea. The embassy opened in September 2015 and moved to Hannam-dong in March. The Korean Embassy was inaugurated in Latvian capital Riga in 2013.“Despite our geographical distance, Korea and Latvia share many similarities in history,” said Yoon Soon-gu, Korean deputy minister for political affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Both our countries endured and overcame hardships throughout our histories, fought for national independence and successfully developed democratic and prosperous nations.” Korea and Latvia became full-fledged members of the United Nations on Dec. 17, 1991, and have been contributing to world peace and security as well as universal human rights and development, he added. Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars In late October last year, Ojars Eriks Kalnins, chairman of the Latvia Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, made an official visit to Korea marking the 25th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations. Rep. Shim Jae-kwon, chairman of the Korean National Assembly’s Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, reciprocated by visiting Riga during Patriots’ Week, a time of remembrance and celebration in Latvia. Latvia is a member of the European Union and eurozone, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, among other multilateral institutions. It joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in July last year, a membership poised to curb corruption and inequality and be a catalyst for domestic structural reforms targeting international trade and investment, innovation, education, health and labor.Latvia is a Baltic tourism jewel with pristine nature, architectural splendor and an abundance of cultural heritage. The country has made efforts to spotlight its tourism abroad by cooperating with Baltic neighbors Estonia and Lithuania and presenting themselves as an integrated region for travel and business. The three nations are part of the Schengen Area: a zone comprising 26 European states that have abolished passport and border control at their mutual borders to encourage unrestricted travel. No visas are required to travel across the three countries for Koreans. The three states all use the euro currency. Incheon Seo-gu Girls and Boys Choir performs at the Latvian National Day reception on Friday. Riga -- the European Cultural Capital in 2014 -- is the largest city in the Baltic States and home to one-third of Latvia’s 2 million people. The Latvian capital is strewn with Art Nouveau and other architectures dating back to the Middle Ages, earning it the nickname “Pearl of the Baltic Sea.” Riga’s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 for its ample stock of buildings constructed between the 16th and 19th centuries. The city offers myriad festivals and art performances throughout the year, including choral, opera and ballet performances and art exhibitions. Major events for next year are the Lattelcom Riga Marathon in May, Riga Opera Festival in June, Riga City Festival in August and Staro Riga light festival in November. In an interview with The Korea Herald in June, Vaivars said exchanges through tourism would spark mutual interest and eventually lead to greater economic cooperation, highlighting Latvia’s strengths in the wood and timber, furniture and interior design, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, cosmetics and fashion industries. Korea is Latvia’s second-largest export market in Asia after China.The embassy recently produced a Baltic travel map with information on popular and hidden spots in Korean, as around 10,000 Koreans visit Latvia annually, with the number rising.

Wellingtonians have told me they want their mayor and council to be innovative, decisive and have new ideas. I’m going to work hard with a united team of councilors and council officers to deliver on that.”Lester was elected to office last year, and worked as the city of Wellington’s deputy mayor from 2013-2016 and councilor for the Northern Ward from 2010. He was a businessman working in property and asset management prior to entering politics. Seoul and Wellington became friendship cities last year. The 38-year-old mayor presented capital Wellington as a city of creative lifestyles, art and culture and distinct Kiwi architecture at the reception. His policies have focused on vitalizing the economy, making housing affordable, improving the city’s transport, replacing outdated bylaws and prioritizing arts funding. Lester led a delegation of Wellington businesses, academics and artists to Korea to further strengthen people-to-people links between Wellington and Korea. He met leaders in startups and small and medium-sized enterprises, film, education, digital governance and other areas during his visit. “One of the core initiatives of the Kiwi Chamber is our ‘Inspire with Innovation’ series, which focuses on mutually beneficial collaboration in innovation between Korea and New Zealand,” said Garrett. “We are very fortunate to have Ambassador Fearnley and Mayor Lester with us this evening to understand how innovation impacts both business relationships and creative cities.” Korean goods exports to New Zealand stood at $1.4 billion in June, with strong growths in vehicles, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances as well as iron and steel sectors. Korea is New Zealand’s seventh-largest importing country. New Zealand’s exports to Korea have also increased with strong gains in the food and beverage sector, which rose nearly 30 percent from the beginning of last year to June this year to $455 million. Other industries that have benefited from the free trade agreement include meat, dairy products, fruit, vegetables, wine and beer. The two economies have gained from science and innovation partnerships in information and communication, digital, bio and health technologies. In particular, collaborations in 4-D technology, health and agricultural robotics and Antarctic research have been cemented.

It is hosted by Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Iranian Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization. The opening ceremony will take place Thursday at 4 p.m. and visitors should RSVP by emailing culture@mofa.go.kr or calling  2100-8335. “Iran has always been an art and cultural matrix of the world and contributed to the richness of world’s arts and cultures. The list continues and includes imaginative Iranian poetry written by brilliant minds, such as Grand Hafiz, Rumi, Saadi and Khayyam,” Iranian Ambassador to Korea Hassan Taherian told The Korea Herald, pointing to exquisitely spun Persian rugs, enameled pots and metalwork of dazzling colors, dainty miniature paintings and hypnotic architecture. Traditional Iranian pottery “Cultural exchanges between Iran and Korea date back to the seventh century along the ancient Silk Road, but the formal diplomatic relationship between the two countries was established in 1962. We believe that cultural exchanges between the two countries could further strengthen our existing friendly relationship and bring out new ideas of cooperation in unexplored areas.”Iranian handicrafts include weaving, metalwork, woodwork, stonework, glasswork, furniture, enamel work and engravings, pottery, ceramics, tiles and mosaic, which embody the skills and cultural and religious symbols of premodern civilizations. Handicrafts exports make up a large part of Iran’s non-oil exports, earning over $250 million from March through June . The province of Isfahan, 340 kilometers south of the capital Tehran, is the center of the nation’s handicrafts industry, and was named a World Crafts City in September 2015 by UNESCO’s World Crafts Council. Nearly 200 handicrafts out of the country’s 300 types originate from Isfahan, according to Iran’s Financial Tribune. The government estimated that the revenue from the industry will reach $1 billion through 2022, with Isfahan at the center of global trade that is increasingly taking place online. Online shops selling handicrafts have increased hundredfold to 200 over the last five years, and efforts are underway to create links with international sites such as Amazon and eBay, according to Iran’s Cultural and Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization.By Joel Lee","country handicraft treasures from thursday ,seoul marking the 2017 iran ,handicraft treasures from thursday ,ceremony will take place thursday ,2017 iran korea cultural exchange","['the Iranian Embassy', 'the Korea Foundation Gallery', 'Seoul', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'the Iranian Cultural Heritage', 'rsvp', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'Grand Hafiz', 'Rumi', 'Saadi', 'Khayyam', 'iranian', 'Korea Hassan Taherian', 'the Korea Herald', 'persian', 'iranian', 'Iran', 'Korea', 'Iran', 'Isfahan', 'Tehran', 'UNESCO ’s World Crafts Council', 'Isfahan', 'Iran ’s Financial Tribune', 'Amazon', 'eBay', 'Iran ’s Cultural and Heritage , Handicrafts and Tourism Organization', 'Joel Lee']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40099043  0.40573809

Cmdr. Gregory Keeley made the argument in a recent contribution to The Hill, saying there is a history of successful naval blockades that forced the adversary into submission.""The Trump administration seemingly has only two potential responses, both of them bad,"" he wrote. ""Option one is direct kinetic military action to halt Kim's development of nuclear capabilities. The second is to learn to live with a nuclear-armed despotic regime.""A third option -- a naval blockade in the East Sea and the Yellow Sea -- would stop North Korea from obtaining raw materials and equipment for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. ""Like sanctions, blockades are designed to slowly choke the recalcitrant nation to submission,"" he pointed out. ""Unlike sanctions, a blockade provides the capability to monitor, intercept and enforce restrictions on what can go in and out of the target nation while providing a powerful psychological and diplomatic instrument.""Such action would require participation from US allies in the region, including Japan and Australia. Other nations, such as Singapore, South Korea, India and Taiwan, as well as NATO forces, could also play a role, Keeley said.A successful US naval blockade helped stop the Soviet Union from building missile bases in Cuba in 1962. The British Navy also cut off supplies to the First French Empire and ultimately won the Napoleonic Wars, he noted.","dismantle north korea nuclear weapons ,to dismantle north korea nuclear ,dismantle north korea nuclear ,sea would stop north korea ,option to dismantle north korea","['WASHINGTON', ""North Korea 's"", 'US Navy', 'Gregory Keeley', 'Hill', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Singapore', 'South Korea', 'India', 'Taiwan', 'NATO', 'Keeley', 'US', 'the Soviet Union', 'Cuba', 'the British Navy']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60343325  0.04545518

I want to meet with my North Korean counterpart and others to discuss issues, including reunions of separated families,” Park, 78, said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency on Thursday. Park Kyung-seo, president of the Korean Red Cross The human rights expert took office on Aug. 18. At an inauguration ceremony, he voiced hope to have talks with the head of North Korea‘s Red Cross as soon as possible.But inter-Korean relations have been long strained amid the North’s nuclear and missile threats. It has kept quiet toward Seoul‘s July offer to hold Red Cross talks to resume suspended reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.The issue of dispersed families is the most urgent humanitarian matter for the two Koreas, which still remain technically at war as the three-year conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.About 55 percent of an estimated 131,260 South Koreans on the waiting list for reunion have already died. Data showed that 62 percent of South Koreans hoping for the reunions are aged over 80.The last reunion event was held in October 2015.Pyongyang has posed conditions that could politicize the issue.In exchange for the reunions, it is demanding Seoul return 12 female North Korean workers who worked at a restaurant in China and defected to South Korea en masse last year.“The resumption of family reunions is urgent, but it is also a sensitive issue,” Park said. “This issue involves the North Korean counterpart. I plan to handle it with a sense of duty and in a calm manner.”Park said that he prefers a two-track approach of providing humanitarian aid to North Korea -- first via international organizations and then through direct cooperative projects.The Korean Red Cross has assisted the impoverished country through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, an international humanitarian network.In 2015, the agency contributed 378 million won  to the IFRC’s pilot project for community-based development in the North. In 2016 and 2017, it offered a combined 330 million won to help the North cope with floods that hit its northeastern areas last year.Park said that his agency set aside 400 million won to support the IFRC‘s project for this year, but it has yet to provide it amid tensions over North Korea’s sixth nuclear test.“When situations get better, I plan to send the money,” he added.Park expressed a desire to promote cooperation between the two Koreas‘ Red Cross societies.“I believe that the two Koreas’ Red Cross should jointly push for cooperative programs based on humanitarianism in a bid to bring genuine peace to the Korean Peninsula,” he said.Park cited the feeble health care sector in North Korea as a potential area for cooperation, given that North Korean children are suffering from malnutrition.“I would like to focus on improving North Koreans‘ health and its health care system. That would be commensurate with the spirit of the Red Cross,” he said.“I hope to let North Koreans share our know-how about running a blood bank and help them advance their health care system. In the long term, I want to push for community-based sustainable development programs for North Korea.”Park attended the general assembly of the IFRC in Turkey in early November. North Korea’s Red Cross also sent its delegation including vice chief Paek Yong-ho to the meeting.Park and Paek encountered each other at a lunch meeting among chiefs from the Red Cross in East Asia on the sidelines of the IFRC gathering, but there was no official meeting between them.Paek told his Asian counterparts that North Korea is still struggling to fight damage from last year‘s floods, according to Park.Park said that he hopes to further improve fairness and transparency in the operation of the Korean Red Cross.“I wish to nurture the Korean Red Cross as an agency shared by all South Koreans. By strengthening fairness and transparency in running the agency, I would like to develop it into something like peers in advanced nations,” Park stressed.","koreans hoping for the reunions ,on improving north koreans health ,to resume reunions of war ,reunions it is demanding seoul ,new president of the korean","['South Korea ’s', 'Red Cross', 'Park Kyung - seo', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Park Kyung - seo', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'North Korea‘s Red Cross', 'inter - korean', 'North ’s', 'Red Cross', 'Koreas', 'South Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'the International Federation of Red Cross', 'Red Crescent Societies', 'Park', 'ifrc‘s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Red Cross', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'the Red Cross', 'North Koreans', 'North Korea', 'Turkey', 'North Korea ’s', 'Red Cross', 'Paek Yong - ho', 'the Red Cross', 'asian', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Park', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'the korean Red Cross', 'all South Koreans']",10,"[ 0.          4.          1.         ... -0.65754521  0.30614159

Seoul Public Bike, or “Ttareungyi” in Korean from the sound of a bike bell ringing, was launched in September 2015 to allow anyone to rent a bike from 878 rental stands across the city. Presently, there are 11,600 bikes in the system. The city government plans to expand that to 20,000 bikes and 1,290 docking stations by year’s end. This will give Seoul the second most public bikes after Velib in Paris, which had 23,600 as of 2016. Bicycles are seen that belong to Seoul's bike-sharing system, Ttareungyi. YonhapSeoul is well connected by bus and subway, and rental bicycles are particularly popular at places like bus interchanges and subway stations for use for the last-mile commute.From its launch through October this year, people used Seoul Public Bike over 5 million times, city government data shows. It also shows that the bikes have proved especially popular near Yeouido Park and Ttukseom Hangang Park, as well as in university areas like Hongik University Station. The number of users rose more than sevenfold to 231,000, with nearly 50 percent of the registered riders in their 20s. How to useTo rent, one has to purchase a pass through the service’s official webpage  or via a mobile app. One can then book the bike online or through the app, pick it up from a rental station, ride and leave it at a different station. The website is available in English, Japanese and Mandarin, in addition to Korean. Ttareungyi docking stations are located 500 meters to 1 kilometer from each other to make renting and returning easy and convenient. Users are advised to bring their own helmets. For one-time use, the rental price is 1,000 won. Regular users can purchase a 30-day voucher at 5,000 won for one-hour use or 7,000 won for two hours at a time, while a 180-day voucher is 15,000 won for one hour or 20,000 won for two hours. In an odd wrinkle, a user can return the bike to any station within the one- or two-hour limit, and rent it again to restart the clock throughout the day.According to Rep. Kang Suk-ho of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, the prices are set below operations and maintenance costs. The more popular the service becomes, the greater loss Seoul would suffer, Kang said. According to Seoul officials, as of the end of August, voucher sales amounted to 1.7 billion won , but expenses spent on the system’s operations and maintenance totaled 4.1 billion won. The city explained that a large part of the money was spent on relocating bicycles and repairing and removing faulty or damaged ones. So far, there have been no reports of vandalism. Safety issues While bike-sharing seems to be off to a good start, the biggest concern is the safety of users and availability of bike paths.To create more bike paths, the city government said the additional bicycle roads will be built across 84 kilometers by 2020 with a focus on safety over quantitative expansion. City data showed that the city spends about 4.9 billion won each year for maintenance and repair of bike roads.The Seoul city government said it would also form three Ttareungyi special zones in Seoul. The special zones will allow citizens to commute to work and school and go shopping via the public bikes. The goal is to work in connection with urban development projects to build various infrastructure, such as bike paths and rental spots at the planning stage to form residential districts optimized for public bike usage.As of December last year, about 27 accidents been reported with Ttareungyi bikes on the road. Most were reportedly caused due to the inexperienced bikers.“The maximum speed for Ttareungyi is about 20 kilometers per hour,” said a Seoul City official, adding there’s less likelihood for riders to be involved in accidents in such situations.

Rep. Choo Mi-ae , leader of the ruling Democratic Party, poses for a photo during a meeting with Korean Americans in New York on Nov. 16. ""If  puts too much pressure on a small area without looking at the overall picture, the timing is inappropriate because South Korea is currently in a very difficult situation,"" Choo said.""The threat of North Korea's nuclear weapons program is expected to rise next year and we are in an extremely difficult situation because of China's trade retaliation over THAAD,"" she said. It was a reference to China's apparent suspension of business with South Korea over the latter's hosting of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense , a US missile defense system. Beijing argues THAAD is a threat to its own security.Choo noted that South Korea will have to buy large amounts of weapons from the US to counter the North Korean nuclear threat, which will help reduce the trade deficit.The party leader arrived in Washington earlier this week for meetings with US officials, lawmakers and scholars, as well as to attend various events.Later Thursday, she traveled to New York and held a meeting with Korean-Americans living there, stressing that South Korea will remain a US ally no matter how strong China becomes in the future.""There are people who predict that when China becomes a tiger, South Korea will dump the United Steates and take China's side,"" Rep. Choo Mi-ae said during a meeting with Korean-Americans in New York. "" won't hold hands with anyone that has a different system from or runs counter to democracy.""Choo also said House Speaker Paul Ryan also told her that he doesn't think South Korea will be pulled to China and that he firmly believes that the South is an ally that shares democratic values.","widened the us trade deficit ,president donald trump insistence ,seoul to amend their bilateral ,washington south korea ruling party ,choo also said house speaker","['NEW YORK', 'WASHINGTON', ""South Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'Seoul', 'the Democratic Party', 'the Korea Caucus', 'Congress', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'KORUS', 'Donald Trump', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Democratic Party', 'Korean Americans', 'New York', 'South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'China', 'thaad', 'China', 'South Korea', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'US', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'US', 'New York', 'Korean', 'South Korea', 'US', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'the United Steates', 'China', 'Choo Mi -', 'Korean - Americans', 'New York', 'House', 'Paul Ryan', 'South Korea', 'China']",16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.50675917  0.63787907

The two also said Pyongyang needs to show a “clearer sign” of willingness to talk.  From left: Lee Do-hoon, South Korea`s special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs and his US counterpart Joseph Yun Lee Do-hoon, South Korea’s special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, held a meeting with his US counterpart Joseph Yun to discuss security issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula and ongoing threats from the North’s fast-growing weapons program. The meeting was held on Jeju Island. “There is no doubt that both of the presidents want to find a peaceful way in regard to North Korea’s nuclear issue. So we discussed them and agreed the pressure campaign has to be a core element,” Yun told reporters after the meeting. Yun’s visit follows the end of US President Donald Trump’s 12-day tour of Asian nations earlier this week, which included a summit with President Moon Jae-in here. Yun also mentioned the international community’s implementation of sanctions and pressure on the North as a crucial step toward denuclearization. “We have been engaged with countries like China, Russia, as well as Japan and the EU, aimed at getting pressure on North Korea to have a meaningful and credible dialogue with us so that they can take steps towards the denuclearization,” he said. “We very much agree on that, and again today we reaffirmed that goal.”The meeting also came amid nearly two months without Pyongyang’s provocations, with a missile launch on Sept. 15 being the most recent. Yun told the Council on Foreign Relations on Oct. 30 that if North Korea stopped nuclear and missile testing for about 60 days, it would be a signal the US should resume direct talks with Pyongyang.But the two nuclear envoys stated Pyongyang’s current intention is too ambiguous to interpret the pause in provocations as a positive sign for talks. “I hope that they will stop forever. But we had no communication from them so I don’t know whether to interpret it positively or not. We have no signal from them,” Yun said.In line with Yun’s remarks, Lee said the “60-day clock” had not started yet on Pyongyang’s lack of explanation of the hiatus.Yun said Tuesday that he did not know why the North had halted its provocations, but urged the North to refrain from provocations “for a period of time,” adding that it would be a “good start.” Although the US has hinted at willingness to establish more direct lines of communication with the North, it has also cited denuclearization as an essential precondition for dialogue. North Korea has displayed its defiance of such requests through statements and military provocations. The latest message came Friday through its official mouthpiece in a commentary titled, “ Should Abandon Stupid Ambition.”“The conclusion that our army and people have reached via the history of North Korea-US confrontations is there is no way other than standing against the repressive US imperialists only with a nuclear deterrent of justice,” said Rodong Sinmun, a daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party. “We’ve already made clear that we would never take even one step back from a road to beefing up national nuclear power unless the US hostile policy against us comes to an end.”North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho had previously stated the major goal of its weapons program was to achieve a “balance of power” with the US. On the weapons program, top officials in both South Korea and the US, including Seoul’s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, have acknowledged that it has reached a stage of “near-completion,” but South Korea’s spy agency claimed it still has a large obstacle to overcome. “ the North had recently carried out a few missile engine tests, but it is still not at a stage where it can complete its ICBM development,” an unnamed parliamentary source told Yonhap News Agency on Friday, referring to the North’s lack of atmospheric re-entry technology. An NIS official made the reports during a session of the National Assembly‘s Intelligence Committee on Thursday, the source said. Securing such ability will allow Pyongyang to build a missile that can withstand the heat-intensive process of re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere. It is widely believed that Pyongyang has been grappling to secure the technology, despite its claimed success through previous liftoffs of its Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missiles. However, this does not indicate that North Korea is ready to abandon its decadeslong nuclear ambition, as reports on testing of relevant key technologies continue to surface.The North is on an “aggressive schedule” to build and deploy its first operational ballistic missile submarine, a recent analysis by 38 North said, pointing to busy movements of parts and components detected near its key shipyard. Citing military sources, Japan’s Asahi Shimbun daily reported on Nov. 12 that Pyongyang has conducted a series of combustion experiments for a new solid-fueled missile engine. It may have been for an upgraded version of its ground-to-ground medium-to-long-range Pukguksong-2 ballistic missile or new submarine-launched ballistic missiles.By Jung Min-kyung","bring north korea to dialogue ,on friday upheld bilateral cooperation ,top nuclear envoys of south ,north korea to dialogue ,two nuclear envoys stated pyongyang","['South Korea', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee Do - hoon', 'US', 'Joseph Yun Lee Do - hoon', 'South Korea ’s', 'US', 'Joseph Yun', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'asian', 'Moon Jae - in', 'China', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'EU', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Yun', 'the Council on Foreign Relations', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Yun', 'Lee', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'North Korea', 'abandon Stupid Ambition', 'North Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', '’ve', 'US', 'korean', 'Ri Yong - ho', 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'NIS', 'the National Assembly‘s Intelligence Committee', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'North', 'Japan', 'Asahi Shimbun', 'Pyongyang', 'Jung Min - kyung']",0,"[ 0.          0.          8.         ... -0.55770671  1.01198196

North Korea's top envoy to Beijing Ji Jae-ryong saw him off.Details about his itinerary have not been unveiled, but diplomatic sources said that he may make a four-day visit to the North, during which he could meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Seoul's unification ministry said that China's special envoys dispatched to the North after the party congresses in 2007 and 2012 met with former North Korean ruler Kim Jong-il and the current leader, respectively. China's foreign ministry said that the two sides will exchange views on issues of mutual interest at the party and country level, and that Song will report on the outcome of China's party congress.It is customary for China and North Korea to send a delegation to each other for briefings on the results of important party events.But Song's trip comes on the heels of Trump's 12-day tour of Asia. Trump has called on China to do more to rein in the wayward regime.Experts say that the issue of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is likely to be discussed at a time when Pyongyang has suspended its provocative acts for more than 60 days.Joseph Yun, the top US nuclear envoy, reportedly said at a recent meeting that if North Korea halts nuclear and missile testing for about 60 days, that would be the signal Washington needs to resume direct dialogue with Pyongyang.Yun was in South Korea's southern Jeju Island to have talks over North Korea's nuclear issue with his South Korean counterpart Lee Do-hoon.The US envoy said he hope that Song's trip would help ""forward"" the goal of its denuclearization.Lee also added that it could have ""a very significant meaning considering the current situation.""Yun said in Seoul on Tuesday that he does not know the reason for North Korea's halting of provocations, but he called on the North to stay that course ""for a period of time.""Meanwhile, North Korea's main newspaper said Friday that the country will not put issues directly linked to its core interests and its people's security on the negotiation table.""The United States should abandon its hostile policy toward North Korea. If Washington does not give it up, we will not budge by an inch from the path to strengthening our nuclear force,"" said the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.","beijing last thursday chinese delegation ,friday left for north korea ,trump held summit in beijing ,summit in beijing last thursday ,in beijing last thursday chinese","['BEIJING', 'SEOUL', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Tao', 'the Central Committee of', 'the Communist Party', 'Xi', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Beijing', ""North Korea 's"", 'Beijing', 'Ji Jae - ryong', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'China', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'China', 'Song', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Song', 'Trump', 'China', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'Joseph Yun', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Yun', ""South Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Lee Do - hoon', 'US', 'Song', 'Lee', 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", '""The United States', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'the Rodong Sinmun', ""Workers ' Party of Korea""]",0,"[ 0.          2.          3.         ... -0.74116933  0.78679514

She began a six-day trip on the day for talks with top US officials, scholars and lawmakers over security and trade. ""Washington has reportedly called for a wider opening of the Korean market for US agricultural products, and I express my concerns,"" Choo was quoted as saying.  Choo Mi-ae , the leader of South Korea`s ruling Democratic Party, shakes hands with White House chief economic director Gary Cohn before their talks in Washington on Nov. 14, 2017.

Washington blames it for America's growing deficit in goods trade with Korea despite its surplus in the services sector.During the meeting with Cohn, Choo also put a positive spin on Trump's visit to Seoul last week, during which the Republican president reaffirmed America's security commitment and excoriated North Korea for its nuclear adventurism and brutal dictatorship.""Thanks to President Trump's two-day visit to Seoul, his image has improved a lot,"" Choo said.

This file photo taken July 18, 2007 shows the production of bottled water at a factory near Mount Kumgang in North Korea.

It plans to use them for religious rites to mark the lunar national foundation day later this month.The bottled water, which arrived in the South last month, is awaiting customs clearance at a port in Incheon, west of Seoul.It is rare for Seoul to allow North Korean products to make their way to the South since it slapped sanctions on the North on May 24, 2010. The unilateral sanctions banning inter-Korean exchanges were designed to punish North Korea for the torpedoing of a South Korean warship in March 2010.The government dismissed the view that its latest approval indicates Seoul's softening of sanctions.""The government does not seek to ease its unilateral sanctions.

It came two days after the South Korean president held a bilateral summit with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Danang, Vietnam, where they were attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. South Korean President Moon Jae-in  and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang shake hands before the start of their bilateral talks, held on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum in Manila, the Philippines on Nov. 13, 2017. Seoul-Beijing relations have been at their lowest ebb due to China's protest against the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.For months, China enforced what many believed to be de facto economic retaliation against South Korea that included a ban on large group tours to South Korea and a range of non-tariff import barriers that effectively prevented shipments of many South Korean products, such as cosmetics.The two countries agreed to normalize their ties in a joint statement issued by their foreign ministries on Oct. 31.Li said the Seoul-Beijing relations were already facing ""active"" or positive changes.""I wish we will quickly put the China-Korea relations on the normal track through the joint efforts of the two countries,"" he said through his interpreter, according to Cheong Wa Dae pool reports.""I feel South Korea-China relations are now at a new starting line,"" Moon told Li, according to Cheong Wa Dae pool reports. ""I believe we have created a chance to quickly normalize the countries' relationship through my talks with President Xi Jinping.""The South Korean president expressed hope his talks with Li will further speed up the normalization of their ties.The South Korean president called for immediate measures to remove China's apparent economic retaliation, which he said included anti-dumping tariffs imposed on South Korean goods and the exclusion of South Korean batteries produced in China for electric vehicles from China's government subsidies, according to Moon's chief press secretary Yoon Young-chan.He also proposed resuming high-level economic dialogue to discuss detailed measures to repair the countries' ties, as well as their trade and economic relations.""I wish my talks with you prime minister today will be a valuable chance to discuss specific ways to expand our cooperation on issues of mutual interest and also normalize the countries' practical cooperation in areas such as economy, trade and cultural, personnel exchanges that had been partially reduced over the past year,"" Moon said.The Chinese prime minister said the countries' relations will continue to improve, though it may take time.""Prime Minister Lee said the countries will inevitably face sensitive issues as the China-South Korea relations develop, but that the development of practical cooperation between China and South Korea is very bright,"" Yoon told a press briefing.""I am confident about the China-South Korea relations because their  structures are strongly complementary,"" Li was quoted as saying, adding a ""new horizon"" will open for the countries' bilateral relationship.","south korean president expressed hope ,ebb due to china protest ,korean president called for immediate ,korean president held bilateral summit ,korean president expressed hope his","['MANILA', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'US', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'Li', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'Manila', 'Philippines', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Danang', 'Vietnam', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'Manila', 'Philippines', 'Seoul', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Moon', 'Li', 'Xi Jinping', 'south korean', 'Li', 'south korean', 'China', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'China', 'China', 'Moon', 'Yoon Young - chan', 'Moon', 'chinese', 'Lee', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Yoon', 'the China', 'South Korea', 'Li']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84658265  0.23034196

The country at the foot of Africa has been relatively unexplored by Korean visitors over the years, despite offering wide-ranging attractions from natural adventure to cultural heritage.“We are now one of the most sought-after destinations in the world offering a variety of unforgettable experiences in leisure, ecotourism, cultural tourism and business,” South African Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam said at a gathering with Korean tour operators in Seoul on Nov. 7. Quoting the late President Nelson Mandela’s speech at the maiden international tourism conference Indaba in 1995, she said, “Our natural beauty only offers a fitting setting for our country’s most valuable asset -- our people. Ours is a nation of warm and generous people. Our various cultures and heritages, once exploited to divide our people, have turned into a source of strength and richness in every sphere of life.” Bam encouraged people to attend the Inbada conference, one of the largest tourism promotion events in Africa that takes place May 8-10 next year.  South African Embassy First Secretary Raymond Manzini, Deputy Head of Mission Ismail Esau, Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam and South African Airways General Manager Hans Kim Tourism is one of six selected drivers of the South African economy, alongside manufacturing, mining, finance, communications and retail. The country received nearly 19,000 Korean tourists last year, a 40 percent on-year increase.“There are seven reasons why South Africa is the most beautiful tourism destination in the world,” said the embassy’s Deputy Head of Mission Ismail Esau, referring to the country’s topographical and biological diversity, sundry coastlines, exotic landscapes, action-packed outdoor activities, ethno-cultural diversity, vibrant cities and towns and well-connected infrastructure. South Africa is one of the world’s 17 countries classified as “mega-diverse” in terms of terrain, vegetation and wildlife. It has 2,800 kilometers of coastlines flanked by two different ocean currents, including nearly 50 blue-flag beaches, marinas and coastal sanctuaries. Various sharks, whales and dolphins can be seen near the coast where divers can get up close to them. There are world-class golf courses, walking trails, suburban jungles and serpentine rivers well suited for outdoor activities. Thrill-seekers can see in person the “big five” of African animals: elephants, rhinos, buffalos, leopards and lions.Johannesburg, Durban, Bloemfontein and Nelspruit are internationally renowned travel destinations, said Esau, also recommending smaller sites and towns like Hermanus, Pilgrim’s Rest, Sutherland, Jeffreys Bay, George, Clarens, Oudtshoorn and Dullstroom. South African Airways -- a member of the Star Alliance -- offers flights to Johannesburg from Incheon via a layover in Hong Kong, which together takes some 17 hours of flying time.

The convenience of online purchases and home delivery, however, has its downsides. All the delivery boxes, wrapping and padding meant to protect what’s nestled inside are waste, once delivered, and a burden on our environment. According to Korea Waste Association, most of plastic bags are single-use, while packing tape is made of polyvinyl chloride, which takes a century to decompose. Cardboard boxes are another problem. Many believe that cardboard boxes are OK because they can be recycled, but officials say at least 10 percent of such boxes are dumped as trash and even those collected for reuse have a not-so-long life span after recycling. “Unfortunately, cardboard can’t be recycled indefinitely, because every time it’s remade, the fibers shorten. After five to seven recycling loops, the fibers become too short to be made into cardboard,” said Kim Dong-hyuk from Korea Recycle Association.The growing waste from parcel packaging is a problem in many other countries where online shopping is popular. China is grappling with mountains of packaging waste, while shipping boxes and packaging materials accounted for 30 percent, or 75 million tons, of total solid waste generated in US in 2015. Around the world, over 16.9 billion meters of box tape were used for parcel service in 2016, according to industry data, equivalent to the length it would take to wrap around the Earth about 425 times. Over 8.2 billion plastic bags and 3.1 billion packing strings were used in the same year. As parcel packaging becomes a growing environmental headache, some companies have begun to seek out green alternatives. Innisfree, a local cosmetics brand, has been using recycled cardboard boxes and biodegradable foam made of corn since 2012. Though costs went up, the company said it has decided to stick to eco-friendly options to provide consumers the value of going green. “We wanted to convey the message that our company values naturalism and cares about environmental issues and waste problems. Delivery is a small part of our business, but it may be the most effective way to portray our value,” said Seo Sung-hyuk, a manager at Innisfree’s E-commerce team. Boxes for some of the cosmetic products are made of recycled citrus peels and green tea leaves, he added. Some consumers are going package-free on their own. “After I saw a box of toothpaste that I ordered online arrived packed with several layers of plastic bags and air caps, I always leave a note  that I do not need extra wrapping when the product is not something fragile,” wrote a member of an online moms’ community. Going package-free and promoting zero-waste shopping has been a trend around the globe in recent years, although it hasn’t arrived here yet.In a typical package-free grocery store in Europe, customers are required to bring their own containers to buy food and ingredients in bulk, from cooking oil and vinegar to grains. Ko Su-ra, 33, shops at local organic stores and expressed hopes for more package-free shopping options here. “It’s such a great idea. You can just go and shop at those stores, instead of telling the industry what they should do ,” Ko said.“We want to see the world become sustainable, clean and thriving for future generations to enjoy.”","online shopping is popular china ,internet in 2016 over billion ,trillion won quadrupling from trillion ,that ordered online arrived packed ,korea recycle association the growing","['South Korea', 'the Korea Integrated Logistics Association', 'Korea Ratings', 'Korea Waste Association', 'Kim Dong - hyuk', 'Korea Recycle Association', 'China', 'US', 'Seo Sung - hyuk', 'Innisfree ’s e - commerce', 'Ko Su - ra', 'Ko']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64426541  0.49903706

But two countries handling the North Korean crisis -- South Korea and the US -- are employing ill-advised strategies: One is too timid, only repeating unrealistic pacifist messages, while the other is inconsistent, often making empty threats, said Seoul’s former point man on the North.Chun Young-woo speaks during an interview at his office in Seoul In a recent interview with The Korea Herald, Chun Young-woo, former national security adviser for conservative President Lee Myung-bak, called President Moon Jae-in’s repeated pleas for the North to return to dialogue an outright “illusion.” “Resuming dialogue without changing North Korea’s strategic calculus is much more dangerous than not engaging in dialogue at all,” said Chun, who also served as Seoul’s top envoy to six-nation talks for the North’s denuclearization between 2006 and 2008 under the liberal Roh Moo-hyun. “If North Korea returns to the negotiation table without being pressured sufficiently, it would make things more difficult to achieve the goal of the  denuclearization.” “Illusion and wishful thinking should never constitute the basis of sound policy.”Chun asserted that now is the time for South Korea to work in tandem with other nations to maximize pressure on the North until it realizes the need to abandon its nuclear program. If Seoul does not do so, it will lose its “voting right” on North Korean matters in the post-crisis period, he warned. According to Chun, what Moon and his policy advisers have said and done give the impression that South Korea is not on the same page as the US and other nations in the global campaign to raise pressure on North Korea to an unbearable level. To a certain extent, the Moon administration is the reason behind the sense that South Korea is being sidelined in global efforts to resolve the North Korean crisis -- referred to by South Korean media as “Korea Passing.” Among other missteps is President Moon’s public declaration that South Korea will never allow a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, says Chun. However right it may sound to South Koreans worried about the possibility of war in their country, it again gives the impression that Seoul is not willing to take a more decisive role in resolving the nuclear standoff, Chun added. “If you really want to avoid a war, you shouldn’t talk about it in a public setting,” said Chun. “The more you talk about such ideas publicly, the more likely North Korea is to view that you are weak and to act without worrying about consequences,” he said. How much say South Korea has in matters regarding the Korean Peninsula in the future will depend on how much it contributes to resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis, he went on. “The more we contribute to the desired outcome, the bigger say we will have.” The strategic blunders are not limited to South Korea. The US, too, is not free from such criticism, he said, calling US President Donald Trump’s harsh warnings against the North “empty threats” that its leader Kim Jong-un could take as bluffs. Although he showed some restraint during his visit to South Korea last week, Trump had previously used bombastic and aggressive language against North Korea, threatening to “totally destroy” the country if the security of the US and its allies is put at risk. Ironically, such remarks could be interpreted by North Korea as a signal that Washington would not pursue a pre-emptive strike unless the North crosses a red line, such as firing a missile toward the US mainland and within a distance where the US can shoot it down, Chun said. “Kim Jong-un cares about how big a stick the US carries and whether it would use it. If the US really wants to do something, it never should have said it out loud. It’s an illusion that a public threat can make North Korea feel intimidated.” Without a credible plan and readiness posture, any hints of military options are likely reduced to empty threats -- and that is why the Trump administration’s remarks about military actions and increased dispatch of strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula may do little to change Kim’s calculus, Chun said. The conundrum facing the US was exemplified by its Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ visit to the inter-Korean border in late October. Despite the expectation that the US would demonstrate the strongest-ever resolve against the North, Mattis said Washington was “not seeking a war.” “Mattis’ remark is like an honest description of the US’ policy options and the hard reality facing them. … So I don’t think such a confession would change anything with the North.” Chun said. “North Korea is likely to think that the US is begging for talks.” Those strategic mistakes are based on the misplaced belief that Kim, the third generation of the ruling Kim family, is too inexperienced to navigate a military standoff with the US and achieve the goal of fielding nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, Chun said. Under Kim’s five-year tenure, North Korea conducted successful ICBM and nuclear tests using what appeared to be hydrogen bombs. Many analysts and military officials suspect it will be able to launch reliable ICBMs toward the US by early next year. In the meantime, North Korea’s economy has made remarkable growth. The once-impoverished country grew at its fastest pace in 17 years in 2016, according to South Korea’s central bank, despite international sanctions.“He managed to make significant progress in developing intercontinental ballistic missiles while preventing a total collapse of North Korea’s economy. As far as the outcome is concerned, it is something that an average leader would never have achieved.” “Kim Jong-un is not worried about whether the US will take a military option anymore. His only concern is how tough economic sanctions will get. What the US has done so far is to get rid of incentives for North Korea to stop provocations.”","korea threatening to totally destroy ,donald trump harsh warnings against ,aggressive language against north korea ,president donald trump harsh warnings ,language against north korea threatening","['North Korea', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Chun Young - woo', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Chun Young - woo', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea ’s', 'Chun', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Chun', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'Chun', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Donald Trump ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Korea', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'US', 'US', 'Chun', 'Kim Jong - un', 'US', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Trump', 'Kim ’s', 'Chun', 'US', 'Defense', 'Jim Mattis', 'inter - korean', 'US', 'Washington', 'US', 'Chun', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'US', 'US', 'Chun', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'icbm', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'US', 'US', 'North Korea']",2,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.59520078  0.53678095

Ra, 36, has been indicted on suspicion of smoking an e-cigarette on the plane that left San Francisco at 4:50 a.m. on Feb. 22 this year and was scheduled to land at Incheon at 5:10 p.m. the same day, according to the ruling.He was caught smoking an e-cigarette in his seat at around 1:10 p.m. before being arrested by police upon arrival in Incheon.The aviation security law bans an airline passenger from causing disturbances or puffing cigarettes to ensure the safety of the plane and its other passengers.The court imposed a lighter penalty on the musician as his in-flight smoking took place before March 21, when a revised aviation security law, which calls for stronger punishment of people causing disturbances and smoking in flight, went into force.The revised law stipulates that anyone smoking in a plane could face a penalty of 10 million won if a plane is in flight and 5 million won if it is parked.Even though e-cigarettes involve no combustion, they are classified as general tobacco under related laws and are subjected to the no smoking ban on a flight just like general cigarettes.Amid the popularity of e-cigarette use, the number of cases of people caught smoking in airplanes showed a marked increase in the 2012-2016 period. The number of such cases, which stood at nine and 14, respectively, in 2012 and 2013, soared to 90 in 2014 and 333 in 2015 before hitting a record high of 360 last year.Kim Ban-jang and Windy City, a five-member reggae band formed in 2005, has released two regular albums and single albums.","reggae band has been fined ,korea longest running roots reggae ,reggae band million won for ,band million won for violating ,roots reggae band million won","['south korean', 'Korean Air Lines', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Ra Guk - san', 'Kim Ban - jang', 'Windy City', ""South Korea 's"", 'San Francisco', 'Incheon', 'Incheon', 'Kim Ban - jang', 'Windy City']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07965086  0.44150829

Trade ministers and delegates from the remaining members of the Trans Pacific Partnership  attend the TPP Ministerial Meeting ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  leaders summet in the central Vietnamese city of Danang on November 9, 2017. Canada had held out to maintain environmental and labour protections linked to freer markets in the deal.Those elements were thrown into jeopardy by America's sudden withdrawal from the deal earlier this year, which forced the remaining countries to reconsider the merits of a pact suddenly shorn of access to the world's largest economy.Canada had dug in over those progressive clauses. But they are much less attractive to countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Chile and Peru now that the carrot of access to the huge US market has been pulled.Upended consensusTrump's election has upended years of American-led moves to open up global trade.The US president is among leaders attending the APEC summit in Danang and on Friday he ladled out more of his trademark 'America First' rhetoric.In a strident address he said his country will ""no longer tolerate"" unfair trade, closed markets and intellectual property theft.""We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of any more,"" he added, taking a swipe at multilateral trade deals.Shortly after, China's leader Xi Jinping offered a starkly different vision, casting his country as the new global leader for free trade.Beijing is not included in the TPP, a deal initially driven through by the former US administration as a counterweight to surging Chinese power in Asia.China has since sought to fill the free trade gap left by the United States, even if much of its own market remains protected.Japan, the world's third largest economy, has been particularly active in pushing for a swift consensus on TPP, fearful that delays could lead to the collapse of the pact after years of negotiations and hand more regional influence to China.On Saturday, Trump and Xi will join leaders from across the Asia-Pacific region for closed door summit talks, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Japan's Shinzo Abe and Canada's Justin Trudeau.The original TPP deal was once described by the US as a ""gold standard"" for all free trade agreements because it went far beyond just cutting tariffs. It included removing a slew of non-tariff restrictions and required members to comply with a high level of regulatory standards in areas like labour law, environmental protection, intellectual property and government procurement.Without the US, TPP-11 only represents 13.5 percent of the global economy but the remaining countries are scrambling to avoid the deal's collapse, especially given the increasingly protectionist winds sweeping through the United States and Europe.","to china on saturday trump ,alone under president donald trump ,china on saturday trump ,china on saturday trump and ,president donald trump america first","['the United States', 'Donald Trump', 'the Trans Pacific Partnership', 'APEC', 'vietnamese', 'Danang', 'Francois - Philippe Champagne', 'Canada', 'the Trans Pacific Partnership', 'the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'vietnamese', 'Danang', 'Canada', 'America', 'Canada', 'Vietnam', 'Malaysia', 'Chile', 'Peru', 'US', 'American', 'US', 'APEC', 'Danang', 'the United States', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing', 'TPP', 'US', 'chinese', 'China', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'TPP', 'China', 'Trump', 'Xi', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Canada', 'Justin Trudeau', 'TPP', 'US', 'US', 'the United States']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81620932  0.35425833

Moon began his eight-day tour of Southeast Asia on Wednesday with a state visit to Indonesia. In addition to holding one-on-one and expanded summit talks, Moon met with Indonesia-based Koreans, and with the two countries’ business leaders. South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in  and Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo partake in a summit in Jakarta on Thursday. From Jakarta, Moon is to travel to Danang, Vietnam for a two-day trip to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The president will then go on to the Philippines to attend the East Asia Summit, and the summit of Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus Three on Monday and Tuesday.Seoul is working with Vietnam and China on arranging summit meetings on the sidelines of the two multinational events. Since before taking office, Moon has said that he would expand the country’s diplomatic relations, placing particular emphasis on Southeast Asia. True to his word, he sent special envoys to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations after taking office, becoming the first Korean president to do so. Moon highlighted his vision at the first stop in Indonesia, telling Indonesia-based Koreans he has stressed the need to “expand Korea’s diplomatic horizons.”South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in  and his wife Kim Jung-sook  are greeted by Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo  and his wife Iriana Widodo  in Jakarta on Thursday. “We must expand our vision beyond the four major nations  in order to capitalize on  geographical advantage as a country that connects the continent to the oceans,” Moon said at Wednesday’s event. Moon’s economy adviser Kim Hyun-chul on Thursday added further details to Moon’s vision, saying the administration plans to expand trade with ASEAN to $200 billion by 2021.The plans are thought to be aimed at reducing South Korea’s reliance on China for its trade. Annual trade volume with China, South Korea’s largest trading partner, currently stands at about $210 billion. Speaking to media in Jakarta, Kim said that Moon’s ASEAN-related plans can be summarized as “‘3P -- People, Prosperity, Peace.”South Korea's President Moon Jae-in According to Kim, the “people” element of the strategy aims to improve exchange in a range of fields including government, business and culture. “The plan is to seek a win-win of shared prosperity. Korea will utilize ASEAN’s labor force and provide resource and technologies to create a synergy effect,” Kim said regarding the “prosperity” element of the plans. Regarding the element of peace, Kim said that Moon hopes to aide ASEAN nations maintain peace, and capitalize in on the countries’ diplomatic relations with North Korea to engage Pyongyang in dialogue. All 10 ASEAN members -- Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines -- have diplomatic relations with North Korea.

The wild animal cafes place racoons, meerkats and other wild creatures in their facilities as a tool to attract customers. According to the report by animal welfare group Aware, there are more than 35 such cafes in Korea where wild animals are offered as companions to the customers. Racoon was the most common species on display, as it was found in 29 out of the 35 cafes. Other wildlife species include meerkat, wallaby, desert fox and ferret. A racoon at a wild animal cafe in Seoul appears stressed from exposure to customers trying to pet and hug them. Through on-site investigations in nine wild animal cafes in Seoul, Aware found that animals were mostly stressed from all-day-long exposure to customers trying to pet and hug them, often displaying signs of lethargy and sickness. Moreover, different species of wild animals were often kept in the same place with other domestic and wild animals, sometimes giving rise to hostile interactions among them. Hygiene in these cafes were also poorly taken care of. Excrement from the animals was improperly handled, with potty pads left in open areas in the cafe, giving rise to the risk of infections. Only one out of the nine cafes investigated, had a sink where customers could wash their hands before and after touching the animals.Aware seeks to use the result of this investigation to inform authorities to come up with legal measures to block these animal cafes from placing wild animals in poor conditions. A racoon is surrounded by customers trying to pet and hug them at a wild animal cafe in Seoul.","wild animal cafes in seoul ,the 35 cafes other wildlife ,wild animal cafe in seoul ,other wildlife species include meerkat ,monday the wild animal cafes","['Korea', 'Aware', 'Korea', 'Racoon', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Aware', 'Aware', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24777138  0.8746295

Wearing bomber-style jackets, visiting commanders have often gazed through binoculars toward the barren strip of the northern land. There, they could visualize what it would be like if another war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula -- for which there is the existence of 28,500 US soldiers in the South. After a weekslong guessing game and a last-minute surprise ruined by heavy fog, US President Donald Trump did not travel to the DMZ on Wednesday as he wrapped up his two-day state visit to South Korea.Having scrapped the plan early in the morning, he spoke at the National Assembly, in “a direct message” to the “cruel dictatorship” of North Korea that the US will maintain “peace through strength” and will not allow the rogue regime to threaten it or its allies with nuclear weapons. Shot by Yeo Jun-suk / Edited by Lim Jeong-yeoDays before Trump’s now aborted plan for a DMZ visit, The Korea Herald traveled to the Joint Security Area within the border zone where soldiers of the two sides face one another only meters apart surrounded by networks of bunkers, military posts and landmines. The journey to the DMZ took about 75 minutes by car from Yongsan-gu in downtown Seoul. It started out right next to the US Yongsan garrison and Hyatt Hotel Seoul, from which Trump’s own trip via helicopter must have started. By helicopter, the travel time would have been a lot shorter. It was this close proximity to the thriving metropolis of Seoul that makes the DMZ feel like a surreal world. Our trip was hampered by little traffic until our vehicle was halted for inspection at the Unification Bridge, an entrance to the “civilian controlled area.” Outside visitors are prohibited from proceeding without getting permission in advance. From there, past several security checkpoints, military posts and historical sites, we arrived at the main gate of Camp Bonifas, home to the United Nations Command Security Battalion of Joint Security Area. Under the slogan of “In Front of Them All,” the UNCSB-JSA is the most forward-deployed unit in charge of keeping security in the JSA -- the only portion of the DMZ where the two Koreas’ soldiers can watch each other’s every move and a must-see spot for foreign dignitaries, such as US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. South Korea`s army soldier stands at a conference room inside JSA. Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald.While the South Korean military police stood in “a modified Taekwondo position” behind the blue conference room, a North Korean soldier in a brown uniform looked across the border from the Panmon Hall inside the zone of North Korea. “When Mattis was here to hold a press conference, there were quite a number of North Korean soldiers walking around over there. There was even a group of Russian tourists,” said a UNC official, who accompanied the visitors. Behind the thick curtain of Panmon Hall, however, North Korean soldiers can peek into the South Korean portion with binoculars. There is also rumored to be a recording device designed to film visitors’ activities. That is why the South Korean military police constantly reminds visitors not to point at anything toward North Korea -- or make any gesture that might be construed as provocative to those standing at the opposite side. At the center of the JSA lies a cement-looking plank on the ground that serves as an official boundary between the two Koreas. Located across the border line were several blue conference rooms designed for inter-Korean talks and family reunions. A North Korea soldier stands at Panmon Hall. Park Hyun-koo“Now, you are inside North Korea territory. Try not to be dragged to the North Korean side,” The Korea Herald’s photojournalist quipped inside the conference room, where tourists can travel freely. A large dark wooden table with a United Nations flag sat on the line between the two Koreas. In 1997, North Korean soldiers tried to drag a South Korean MP out of the conference room. He fought them off, but now two soldiers must stand watch in the conference room, with one holding the belt of the other to make sure nobody is dragged over to the other side.After spending about half an hour taking pictures and filming the area, The Korea Herald and other media outlets then returned to South Korea‘s Freedom House -- opposite the North’s Panmon hall -- and headed to check out military checkpoints spread across the JSA. The journey began from checkpoint 3, an observation desk where visitors can catch a glimpse of North Korea’s village Kijong-dong. Once designed to symbolize the prosperity of the North, the village has been nicknamed “propaganda village” by the South.North Korean village across the DMZ. Park Hyun-kooInside the village dotted with empty houses without glass and shells, there was a 160-meter flagpole bearing the North Korean flag. North Korea’s propaganda song reverberating in the air. The sound, however, was too weak to make out the lyrics. “Kijong-dong village is a propaganda village consisting of empty buildings,” a South Korean Army corporal serving at the JSA said during his briefing to visitors. “If you look close, you can see the light between empty spaces inside the building.” Against the backdrop of verdant green forest interspersed with sandy fields, there was a now-defunct checkpoint 4. It is located on the “Bridge of No Return” where the two Koreas exchanged prisoners after the Korean War. The last exchange took place in 1968. Just a few steps away from the observation deck lies a tree stump. It was a remnants of the tree cut down during the Operation of Paul Bunyan, a show of force operation in response to the brutal death of two US soldiers by North Korean soldier’s axes in 1976. The visitors could have landed at the checkpoint 4 until 2016 when South Korea found out North Korea had planted mines inside the DMZ. In August 2015, two South Korean soldiers on a regular patrol lost a leg when one of them stood on a landmine planted by infiltrators from the North. That is why the trip to the DMZ would have been a prime opportunity for Trump to understand the volatility in the region and the potential costs of his warlike rhetoric with North Korea leader Kim Jong-un, according to the US lawmakers visiting the DMZ. “A trip to the DMZ helps embed the understanding that that is not the case. You attack North Korea, there are huge consequences for South Korea and a huge loss of life.” Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said in his interview with US media Politico. “When the president talks about his various ways of threatening the North and uses terms like ‘fire and fury’ ... it conveys an impression that the president believes we have a military route to being able to destroy North Korea with no consequences,” Merkley was quoted as saying.

But there were no threats of “totally destroying” North Korea with “fire and fury” during his first day in South Korea -- nor did the president use the derogatory nickname “Little Rocket Man” to mock North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In fact, he made no reference to the North Korean leader throughout his joint press conference with President Moon Jae-in in Seoul. In a notable shift in tone, Trump painted an optimistic view of resolving North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, suggesting he has seen a “a lot of progress” on the standoff and it would be “worked out ultimately.” US President Donald Trump. Yonhap“I do see certain movement ... and let’s see what happens,” Trump said during a news conference alongside President Moon. “I believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing not only for North Korea, but for humanity all around the world.”“Imagine the amazing possibilities of the Korean Peninsula liberated from the threat of nuclear war -- where all Koreans could enjoy the blessing of liberty and prosperity you have achieved right here in South Korea,” he added. Trump even signaled his willingness to negotiate with North Korea over its nuclear program, urging Pyongyang to “come to the table” to “make a deal” and highlighting the move would benefit both North Korea and the world.When asked about whether he would pursue direct talk with North Korea, Trump, however, declined to comment. Before making his trip to South Korea, he told Full Measure TV show he is open to sitting down one-on-one with any dictators including Kim Jong-un. Regarding the possible use of military force against North Korea, Trump said “we hope to God we never have to use” them, while reiterating that US is prepared to use the military force if necessary and aircraft carriers a nuclear submarine are heading toward the region.“We have sent three of the largest aircraft carriers in the world and a nuclear submarine also positioned. We have many things happening that we hope, in fact, I’ll go further, we hope to God, we never have to use.” He demonstrated an optimistic tone before holding a summit with Moon.

This file photo taken July 4, 2017, shows the lobby of the headquarters of Hyundai Asan Corp. in Seoul. In July 2008, Seoul suspended the Kumgang tour project after a South Korean woman was killed by a North Korean soldier at the mountain resort. The program was launched in 1998 under a previous liberal government.If Hyundai Asan had received approval to hold the event, it would have marked the first visit by South Koreans to the North under the Moon Jae-in administration.Pyongyang also rejected the company's previous request to hold a memorial service in the North to mark the anniversary of the death of its former chairman Chung Mong-hun. The operator of the suspended tour program had held a memorial service for Chung in North Korea every year since his death in August 2003, but did not seek approval for the visit last year due to tensions on the Korean Peninsula.","now suspended inter korean tour ,seoul suspended the kumgang tour ,july 2008 seoul suspended the ,suspended inter korean tour ,suspended inter korean tour program","['North Korea', ""Hyundai Asan Corp.

This will be their third bilateral summit. The first was held in June in Washington and the second on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Germany in July. On a tight schedule, about 24 hours spread from Tuesday to Wednesday, Trump’s state visit will follow a tight itinerary with two summit meetings -- a one-on-one and another expanded -- and a welcome gala packed into the first day. On the following day, Trump will address the National Assembly and pay respects at the National Cemetery in Seoul before flying to China.  With sensitive issues outstanding, Cheong Wa Dae is taking extra precautions to make the visit go without a hitch. Cheong Wa Dae officials on Monday rehearsed for events scheduled to be held at the presidential office, while Moon focused on preparing for the meeting and an upcoming tour of Southeast Asian nations. Cheong Wa Dae also issued a statement Sunday asking for the public’s cooperation. “Welcoming a guest is our tradition that has been passed down through generations,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun said Sunday. Saying that the visit would be an opportunity to “confirm that Korea and the US are steadfast allies,” Park called on the public to give the US president a “warm welcome.” “The government will do its best to obtain results that will raise the people’s lives and safety, and the Korean Peninsula’s peace and prosperity another step.”Park’s statement is said to reflect concerns about the planned demonstrations against the US leader. A coalition of some 220 nongovernmental organizations have banded together in protesting Trump’s visit, designating Tuesday “No Trump Day.” Regardless of opposition from some quarters, Trump’s visit comes at a critical time, and marks the first state visit by a US leader since President George H.W. Bush in 1992. Although on a short stay -- the shortest among South Korea, China and Japan -- Trump will be afforded the highest honors, following the protocols of a state visit. Visits by foreign leaders are divided into a number of categories, including state, official and working visits, with each following different protocols. A state visit is initiated upon a formal invitation by the head of state, with the host country covering the costs of the visit. Unlike other forms of visits, the visiting foreign leader is greeted by a delegation of high-level officials upon arrival, and a 21-gun salute is fired in honor of the visitor. Trump will be greeted by Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha and Cho Yoon-je, the recently appointed ambassador to the US.Trump will kick off the visit at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, then hold the summit meetings, followed by a gala dinner at Cheong Wa Dae. The event will be attended by key officials from the two sides including National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Se-kyun, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon and 20 government and military officials. Along with political and government officials, a number of members of the corporate community, culture figures and Korean and US citizens who have contributed to bilateral relations will also be invited. US officials attending the event will include chief of staff John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Ahead of Trump’s arrival, local police have gone into emergency mode, with an anti-terrorism stance being raised in some areas of Seoul. Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency will be put on the highest alert for the duration of Trump’s stay, while the agencies of Incheon and Gyeonggi Province will go into emergency operations. Cheong Wa Dae will limit access to the road running in front of the presidential office from the early hours of Tuesday, while public access to the National Assembly will be restricted Wednesday. Security measures around the National Assembly will also see thousands of officers deployed to the area.

The 846-kilometer project -- part and parcel of the Trans-Asian Railway Network, also known as the “Iron Silk Road” -- is expected to halve the time it takes to move goods from China to Turkey. It is a crucial part of the OBOR initiative designed to integrate Asian and European economies and reshape the order of global trade. The BTK line will initially carry 1 million passengers and 5 million tons of cargo a year, and increase cargo to 50 million tons when a parallel track finishes construction in the near future.“The BTK line will make the region an important center on the new Silk Road, which begins from Russia’s Far East and ends in Western Europe,” said the diplomatic mission in a press release. “Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan will benefit from a more efficient transit route and other users will profit from a shorter and safer transit route. Via the route, goods will reach Europe from South Korea, China and India within 15 to 20 days.” A map shows the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Turkey, prime ministers of Georgia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and other high-level officials participated in the commencement ceremony at the Port of Baku on Oct. 30 to dispatch an inaugural freight train on the corridor. Seventy-nine kilometers of the railway passes through Turkey, 246 kilometers through Georgia and 504 kilometers through Azerbaijan. The scheme has been completely financed by Azerbaijan and Turkey.Analysts say the project’s key objective is to improve economic relations between the three countries and attract foreign direct investment across Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, some pundits speculate the project will further marginalize Armenia in the geopolitically volatile region of the South Caucasus.

We stood and fought together in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq,” the ROK-US Friendship Association United said in a press statement.“The people of the Republic of Korea will never forget the noble sacrifices of US soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who shed blood to defend our country from North Korea’s invasion during the 1950-53 Korean War. Thanks to our alliance, we have successfully deterred North Korea’s aggression and maintained peace on the peninsula for the past 64 years, becoming an economic powerhouse.” Together with the international community, Washington and Seoul should exert joint pressure on Pyongyang to deter and force the regime to abandon its nuclear and missile program, the association added. Trump will arrive in Seoul on a second stop of his tour of five Asian nations, where North Korea’s denuclearization and bilateral trade with Korea are expected to top his agenda. Trump has criticized the bilateral Korea-US free trade agreement, which entered into force on 2012, as a “job-killing trade deal” and “one-way street” for increasing the US’ trade deficit.Trump initially threatened to back out of the agreement, but has since agreed with Seoul to renegotiate it. South Korea’s top trade negotiator Kim Hyun-chong has stated the two governments have begun renegotiating on the accord, but also that the deal being scrapped cannot be ruled out. “Korea-US FTA should be mutually beneficial to both countries’ national interests on the basis of reciprocity and play a key role in supporting our alliance,” the group of organizations said. It also stressed that wartime operational control must be transferred to Korea only after a firm self-defense posture is established. The association is comprised of the Korea America Friendship Society, Korean-American Association, Korea America Good Neighbor Society, Council on Korean-US Security Studies, Association of Korean-USA Friendship Alliance, Korea Corporate Members of the Association of United States Army and UN Korean War Allies Association.

The speech was delivered in front of 2 million people at Ramna Race Course in Dhaka, and called on the Bengali people of modern-day Bangladesh to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilization by erstwhile West Pakistan. Bangladesh became an internationally recognized sovereign state in 1972 after a bitter war with Pakistan, which sought to control its eastern territory after the two geographically separated nations broke away from India in 1947 and formed the Pakistani Federation.

It later expanded to incorporate Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Its economy is the sixth-largest in the world with a combined gross domestic product of $2.6 trillion last year and 670 million people. Long Dimanche, Cambodian ambassador to Korea and chair of the ASEAN Committee in Seoul ASEAN and Korea established their sectoral dialogue partnership in 1989. Their relationship was elevated to a full dialogue partnership in 1991 and strategic partnership in 2010. Since the entry into force of the ASEAN-Korea Trade in Goods Agreement in June 2007, bilateral trade in goods has grown by 9.2 percent annually, reaching $125 billion last year, and making Korea ASEAN’s fifth-largest trade partner. The ASEAN-Korea Trade in Services Agreement entered into effect in May 2009, covering business, telecommunications, construction, distribution, education, environmental conservation, public health, recreation, tourism and transport. The ASEAN-Korea Investment Agreement became effective as of June 2009.The administration of Korean President Moon Jae-in sent as its first envoy to ASEAN Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon in June as a sign of its commitment to the dynamically growing region, with the two sides expected to reach $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. Pointing to ASEAN’s young and abundant labor force -- third-largest in the world after China and India -- the envoy highlighted that its integrated economy is reaping population dividends and over 60 percent of growth since 1990 has come from productivity gains in manufacturing, retail, telecommunications and logistics, among others. The ambassador also pointed out that Japanese firms have increasingly traded with and invested in ASEAN following rising labor costs, anti-Japanese sentiments and growing investment risks in China in part fueled by Beijing’s economic retaliation over territorial disputes in and around the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands and Japan’s detention of a Chinese fishing trawler captain in 2010. Beijing halted shipments of rare earth minerals -- key elements used in the production of solar cells, cellphones, computer chips, hybrid cars, wind turbines, guided missiles and more -- to Japan for a period starting in 2010. Long Dimanche, Cambodian ambassador to Korea and chair of the ASEAN Committee in Seoul “These factors have contributed to the strategic shift of Japanese investments toward other low-cost manufacturing destinations in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as other manufacturing hubs in emerging markets India, Brazil and Mexico,” noted the diplomat. Korea has faced similar backlash from China this year after it began deploying the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province.Dimanche highlighted that ASEAN is looked upon as one of the most successful models of regional integration -- despite wide differences in the political system, economic development, culture, history and religion -- and playing a key role in shaping regional and global agenda for peace and prosperity. The ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint for 2025 provides broad directions and strategies for greater integration encompassing political-security, economic and socio-cultural communities. The envoy shed light on the Greater Mekong Subregion, an international territory around the Mekong River basin covering 2.6 million square kilometers and home to over 326 million people. The GMS Economic Cooperation Program started in 1992 involving six countries sharing the river -- Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and China with its Yunnan Province -- for spurring the region’s economic development. With the help of the Asian Development Bank and other development partners, the scheme has implemented infrastructure projects for regional roads, airports, railways, hydropower dams, tourism and disease prevention centers, as well as agriculture, environmental protection, public health, telecommunications and information technology. ASEAN Ambassadors and Speak of the National Assembly Chung Se-kyun  at a reception celebrating the 50th anniversary of ASEAN at Lotte Hotel on Thursday “Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the GMS program continues its long-term development for an integrated, harmonious and prosperous subregion in line with the Hanoi Action Plan 2018-2022 and GMS Regional Investment Framework 2022, consisting of 222 investment and technical assistance projects with a combined value of $64 billion,” the ambassador said. “The potential benefits from this cooperation are huge. However, possible problems emanating from different levels of development and relative lack of political stability in some countries may slow down the progress and hinder full benefits.” The GMS explores synergies with the ASEAN Economic Community, ASEAN Plus Three as well as other regional initiatives, such as the China-led One Belt One Road initiative, he added. ASEAN and Korea maintain close political cooperation through the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Plus Three, East Asia Summit, ASEAN-ROK Summit and Ministerial Meetings. The two sides are also members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, East Asia-Latin America Cooperation and the Asia-Europe Meeting.The ASEAN Committee in Seoul was established in 1990 and is tasked with bolstering two-way ties through sharing of information, advancing ASEAN’s interests here and facilitating consultation with the Korean government. The committee often works with the ASEAN-Korea Center, which was established in 2009 as an intergovernmental organization dedicated to shoring up bilateral trade and investment, cultural and academic exchanges and tourism.This year has been designated the ASEAN-Korea Cultural Exchange Year, with a long list of programs and events set for both sides. Korea instituted the ASEAN Culture House in Busan on Sept. 1 as a platform for educating the public on ASEAN’s diverse and unique cultures.

J. Herbert Nelson II, who is stated clerk of the denomination's General Assembly and leader of the 16-member delegation, made the remark during a news conference in Seoul, saying that as a US citizen, he apologizes for the mass killings.The US Presbyterian Church has been a vocal supporter of the victims of the massacre at the village of Nogun-ri in central South Korea. In September, the denomination sent letters to US President Donald Trump and the Congress, calling for an acknowledgment of responsibility and an offer of compensation to victims. The Rev. J. Herbert Nelson II, leader of the US Presbyterian Church delegation, speaks during a news conference in Seoul on Nov. 6, 2017. The Nogun-ri killings became widely known after a Pulitzer Prize-winning report from the Associated Press in 1999 that quoted US veterans as saying that commanders ordered them to shoot refugees seeking shelter under a railroad bridge.The official death toll was 150, though some say the number of deaths could have been as many as 300. Then-US President Bill Clinton expressed regret, but stopped short of offering an official apology. US officials claimed that an investigation has found that no official order was given to fire on the civilians.Last week, the Presbyterian Church delegation paid a visit to the Nogun-ri site and met with victims.The delegation has been on a trip aimed at promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula and the eventual reunification of the two Koreas. The trip also included a visit to the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas last week.The delegation also includes the Rev. Jose Luis Casal, director of Presbyterian World Mission; the Rev. Robina Winbush, assistant stated clerk and director of the Office of the General Assembly's ecumenical relations; and the Rev. Mienda Uriarte, coordinator of World Mission's Asia-Pacific office.On Tuesday, the delegation plans to visit the National Assembly for a meeting with Speaker Chung Se-kyun.","presbyterian church delegation pledged monday ,church delegation pledged monday ,civilian massacre by american troops ,civilians last week the presbyterian ,church delegation pledged monday to","['US Presbyterian Church', 'US', 'american', 'J.

A joint team of government and the May 18 Memorial Foundation announced the project late last month, and it will start as early as this week. The Ministry of Justice said it completed all necessary procedures, including verifying the expertise of the team and safety checks, and will fully support the project going forward.  Dozens of missing victims are believed to have been secretly buried during the bloody crackdown 37 years ago, when thousands of Gwangju citizens rose up against the military junta led by Gen. Chun Doo-hwan, who seized power in a coup. The junta sent tank-led paratroopers to ruthlessly quell the nine-day revolt. More than 200 people were killed and 1,800 wounded, official data show, while many believe the death toll was much higher. The excavation site, now covered in asphalt, is where the Gwangju Prison had been located. The team plans to bring in a ground-penetrating radar that can reach as much as 10 meters deep. Calls for a fresh investigation into the massacre have been strong, but moves were tepid under the two previous conservative governments. President Moon Jae-in, who took office in May, has promised to get to the truth and has ordered a special probe into the case. The excavation team chose the old prison site based on the testimony from a then major in an airborne brigade in charge of the crackdown. He confessed to burying some 12 bodies in the farm that was at the facility. A couple of people who were inmates at the time also told the foundation they witnessed bodies being disposed there.Any remains they find at the site will be analyzed for DNA comparison with the samples collected from 295 families of the missing, the foundation said.","fresh investigation into the massacre ,may 18 memorial foundation announced ,buried during the bloody crackdown ,friday it officially approved plan ,team chose the old prison","['Memorial Foundation', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Moon Jae - in']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77039886  0.52837151

South Korean President Moon Jae-in  presides over a National Security Council meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on May 14, 2017. President Moon Jae-in has consistently stressed the need to put maximum pressure on Pyongyang, so the reclusive regime has no choice but to come to the dialogue table and discuss giving up its nuclear ambitions peacefully.Pyongyang has staged 10 missile tests since the Moon Jae-in administration took office in May. Its latest provocations included its sixth and most powerful nuclear test so far, staged Sept. 3.The latest NSC meeting also discussed ways to prevent South Korean ships from entering North Korean waters, Cheong Wa Dae said.The move came after a South Korean fishing boat, the 391 Hungjin, was returned to the country, reportedly after entering North Korean waters at will and being seized by North Korean troops. The incident raised alarms here as the local maritime police remained unaware of the seizure until the North announced its plan to return the ship.","press release south korean president ,discussed unilateral sanctions our government ,latest nsc meeting also discussed ,north korean troops the incident ,south korean president moon jae","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'the UN Security Council', 'the National Security Council', 'NSC', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'National Security Council', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'NSC', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'the 391 Hungjin', 'north korean', 'north korean']",3,"[ 0.          3.          2.         ... -0.647829    0.79381227

Trade will also be high on their agenda as the countries recently launched a formal discussion on modifying their bilateral free trade agreement.In addition, pending issues of their defense alliance may be discussed, such as the two countries' sharing of costs for US Forces Korea and Seoul's move to retake the wartime operational control of its forces from Washington. This file photo, taken Sept. 22, 2017, shows South Korean President Moon Jae-in  and U.S. President Donald Trump holding talks in a bilateral summit on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Concerns are growing here that the tricky issues of the trade pact and military costs have the potential to rattle bilateral ties down the road should they fail to meet in the middle.The renegotiation of the Korea-US FTA has fueled fears over the possible termination of the pact, which surely would cause serious damage to their alliance.The Trump administration demanded negotiations to address its growing trade deficit with South Korea in products. Seoul agreed to start the process last month, shortly after the US president was said to have instructed his officials to prepare for a withdrawal from the Korea-US FTA.Later, South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong noted his country may be forced to give up the FTA altogether should the US continue to make unfair and unreasonable demands.""We entered into negotiations... taking all possibilities into consideration, including the case of the negotiations falling apart,"" he told a parliamentary audit.South Korea earlier cited its own growing trade deficit with the US in the service sector, along with various reports, including those from US think tanks, that the US' increased trade deficit with South Korea may have been caused by its own problems, rather than the Korea-US FTA.The upcoming defense talks on how to share the burden of maintaining US troops in South Korea is another issue that could cause the alliance to quickly turn sour, according to officials here.Washington has long demanded Seoul shoulder a greater portion of the cost, including cash payments, and the demand is expected to get only stronger under the new US president's America First policy.Seoul, on the other hand, insists it is already paying more than enough, also citing the fact that it continues to provide vast amounts of land for US military bases here free of charge.President Moon has also personally noted his country just spent $11 billion to expand and renovate the US military base in Pyeongtaek, 40 kilometers south of Seoul.The US president is set to visit the Pyeongtaek base when he arrives here on a state visit next week.Cheong Wa Dae officials expressed hope Trump's trip to the US military base will make him realize how much South Korea was doing for its ally.Despite many such pending issues, North Korea and its evolving nuclear and missile threats will likely continue to sit high on the agenda of the upcoming summit.In their previous meetings, the two leaders stressed the need to put more and more pressure on Pyongyang, so the reclusive regime would stop its provocations and start discussing peace.In their last summit, held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, they agreed to build their joint deterrence against North Korean threats to an ""overwhelming"" level that they said would put the ""strongest pressure and sanctions"" on North Korea.The agreement followed North Korea's latest and most powerful nuclear test so far, staged Sept. 3.""The two leaders shared a view on the need for the strongest pressure and sanctions against North Korea to deter North Korea's provocative activities and make it start taking steps toward denuclearization,"" Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun said earlier of the outcome of the latest South Korea-US summit, held Sept. 22.Moon and his US counterpart are widely expected to again stress the need for the North to refrain from any provocations when they meet here next week.","to hold summit next tuesday ,latest south korea us summit ,2017 shows south korean president ,summit next tuesday on wide ,hold summit next tuesday","['South Korea', 'the United States', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Donald Trump', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', ""North Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'US', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'U.S.', 'Donald Trump', 'the U.N.

Shia and Sunni Muslims pray side by side inside mosques, a rare scene in the Islamic world where intra-religious tensions have remained toxic over centuries. That the Muslims -- regardless of their denomination and background -- practice their faith in harmony, is a demonstrable evidence of Azerbaijan’s religious tolerance and moderation, according to the country’s top envoy to Korea. Ambassador Ramzi Teymurov stressed that religion being liberal in a world of connectivity and coalescence is more consonant with global trends, such as secularism, scientific progress and democracy.Azerbaijan is a country strategically straddling Europe and Asia in the South Caucasus. It is a predominantly Muslim society, with nearly 98 percent of people practicing Islam. Shia believers account for roughly 60 percent of Muslims, the remainder being Sunni adherents, according to Teymurov. Heydar Mosque in Baku Heydar Mosque in Baku “We have always been known as a nation of tolerance,” the envoy told The Korea Herald at the recently reopened embassy in Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, in Seoul last week. “We never had radical confrontation between Shias and Sunnis throughout history. Our government fully subsidizes all religious institutions and their places of worship regardless of faith.” Although Azerbaijan has had contentious, at times inimical, relations with neighboring Armenia, which currently occupies 20 percent of Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized territory, the country has been embracing of Armenian religious institutions, Teymurov pointed out. He cited the example of the Saint Gregory the Illuminator Church, commonly known as the Armenian Church of Baku: the only Armenian monument in the Azeri capital that survived the Soviet Union’s anti-religious atheist campaign, the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict as well as the expulsion of some Baku Armenians.Azerbaijan is a constitutionally secular state. The supreme law codifies that religion acts separately from the government, and all religions are equal before the law. Education is also secular. The ambassador warned against what he sees as “incorrect understanding of Islam” -- that it is violent, dangerous and fundamentalist. “Islam by nature is liberal,” he said. “Some radical groups have been promoting a brand of Islam that is ultraconservative and extremist, but that is not true Islam. If you read carefully what the Quran says and what its philosophy teaches, Islam is a religion of peace. It never instructs people to kill anyone in its name, or instigate terrorist activities.”Religious practice is a private realm between God and the believer, and the third party has no right to interfere in the relationship, he added. Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku Azerbaijan's capital Baku Pointing to negative portrayals of Islam by Western politicians and media outlets, which zoom in on violence and terrorism, the diplomat said such a narrow perspective only amplifies misperceptions. He also said journalists have a critical role to play in articulating public opinions, as Korea increasingly becomes a multicultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. The envoy urged media professionals to turn their attention to Islam’s rich culture, heritage and scholarship and shed light on them. “Religious architecture and artefacts can be great sources of national promotion,” Teymurov said, pointing to Orthodox, Albanian and Catholic churches, various mosques and synagogues, as well as ancient fire temples and contemporary edifices inspired by Zoroastrianism and its fire worship in Azerbaijan.As an example, he mentioned the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, an exotic, amorphous building designed by late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid  -- the architect of Seoul’s landmark Dongdaemun Design Plaza -- named after the country’s late president from 1993 to 2003. Being at the crossroads of the East and West, Azerbaijan also has numerous architectures embodying Soviet, Russian and European styles in an eclectic harmony, he said. “Over the past 2 years, the number of tourists from worldwide visiting our country has increased substantially, and particularly those from the Middle East doubled to half a million last year,” said the envoy. “As we are trying to be a hub of tourism and international convention, we have hosted many cultural and sports events, including the 4th World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue in Baku, Eurovision Song Contest in Baku in 2012, Baku 2015 European Games, 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games and 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix Formula One motor race.”By Joel Lee Provoslav Church in Baku Provoslav Church in Baku","religion being liberal in world ,azerbaijani ambassador to korea ramzi ,islam is religion of peace ,armenians azerbaijan is constitutionally secular ,in azerbaijan mosques synagogues churches","['Korea', 'Ramzi Teymurov', 'Taza', 'Pir Mosque', 'Baku', 'Azerbaijan', 'Shia', 'sunni Muslims', 'islamic', 'Muslims', 'Azerbaijan', 'Korea', 'Ramzi Teymurov', 'Azerbaijan', 'muslim', 'Islam', 'Shia', 'Muslims', 'sunni', 'Teymurov', 'Heydar Mosque', 'Baku', 'the Korea Herald', 'Hannam - dong', 'Yongsan District', 'Seoul', 'Sunnis', 'Azerbaijan', 'Armenia', 'Azerbaijan', 'armenian', 'Teymurov', 'the Armenian Church', 'armenian', 'azeri', 'the Soviet Union ’s', 'Baku Armenians', 'Azerbaijan', 'Islam', 'Islam', 'Islam', 'Islam', 'Quran', 'Islam', 'Heydar Aliyev Center', ""Baku Azerbaijan 's"", 'Baku', 'Islam', 'western', 'Korea', 'Islam ’s', 'Teymurov', 'Orthodox', 'albanian', 'catholic', 'Zoroastrianism', 'Azerbaijan', 'the Heydar Aliyev Center', 'Baku', 'iraqi', 'Zaha Hadid', 'Seoul', 'West', 'Azerbaijan', 'Soviet', 'russian', 'european', 'Baku', 'Baku', 'Joel Lee Provoslav Church', 'Baku Provoslav Church', 'Baku']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.02575624  0.59598064

Yonhap“The government expresses our regret over the International Advisory Committee’s advice and UNESCO Director-General ’s decision,” the ministry said in a statement, while stressing that it is opposed to any moves aiming to undermine the historical truth. The Ministry of Gender Equality here echoed the statement. The statement came mere hours after the South Korean Culture Ministry delivered the result of a recent meeting of the International Advisory Committee, UNESCO’s de facto group in charge of reviewing the policy for the Memory of the World Program, in Paris. An official proposal was drawn and submitted in May 2016 by 15 civic groups from eight countries, including South Korea and China, for the listing of nearly 2,700 documents including court records and materials handed by the victims. The documents are valued here as an indispensable resource on the tragic history that continues to haunt relations with Japan.Upon hearing the news, a South Korean civic group said Tuesday that the goal of the proposal was not to blame Japan for its wartime atrocities, but to preserve a historical record of women’s rights and how the victims overcame the pain of their past.UNESCO instead recommended the nomination of “Joseon Tongsinsa” from 1607-1811, which refers to the series of diplomatic records of Korean envoys to Japan. The goodwill missions are a symbol of peace between the two neighboring nations. Signs of postponement had been looming as Japan’s NHK reported Friday that the IAC saw the need for further dialogue among “relevant nations” before registering the documents in the program. Japan had been campaigning against the civic groups’ wishes, saying that it goes against the resolution reached between Seoul and Tokyo in 2015. The controversial deal, which received widespread public disapproval here, proposes a compensation of 1 billion yen  to South Korean victims coupled with a government apology to “finally and irreversibly” resolve the bilateral tension surrounding the comfort women issue. But the Foreign Ministry here has expressed its support for the civic group-backed movement, saying that it coincides with the government’s basic stance that historical lessons should be learned from the comfort women issue. It also disagreed that such efforts are a violation of the bilateral agreement between South Korea and Japan which states both countries should refrain from criticizing each other in the international community. In 2016, Japan withheld its annual funding for the heritage body after the UNESCO program decided to include documents about the 1937 Nanjing Massacre with Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga calling the decision “problematic.” It triggered an angry reaction from China by questioning the authenticity of the relevant documents.Japan currently provides about 9.7 percent of the UNESCO budget, which makes it the second-largest donor of the UN agency after the US at 22 percent. It is forecast to take the lead as the US announced its withdrawal from the agency by the end of 2018. South Korea and Japan have experienced decadeslong conflict over the issue of comfort women in both diplomatic and historical terms. Historians believe more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were taken to work as sex slaves for the Japanese military during the colonial era. Out of 239 comfort women survivors registered in the government database, only 35 remain alive as September 2017. Meanwhile, the Moon Jae-in administration launched a public-private task in July to review the 2015 bilateral settlement with a more “victim-oriented” approach.

Packed with lectures and panel discussions on the issue of human ageing, a perennial question for scientists and a common social problem in many developed countries, the event is part of the annual Nobel Week Dialogue organized by Nobel Media and Nobel Center Foundation. The main one-day program is slated for Dec. 9 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The Seoul forum is being held in partnership with Korean Academy of Science and Technology. “Nobel Prize Dialogue is one of the pillars of our global outreach and aims to stimulate interest in science, literature and peace in line with Alfred Nobel’s vision and legacy for the greatest benefit of mankind,” said Mattias Fyrenius, CEO of Nobel Media. The five Nobel laureates in Seoul to offer their insights are Ada Yonath, Nobel laureate in chemistry, Finn Kydland in economics, Richard Roberts in physiology, Serge Haroche in physics and Robert Huber in chemistry. Lee Myung-chul, president of the KAST, said the forum “will encourage scholars to exchange their thoughts on global issues affecting all humanity and states and inspire Koreans about the future and innovation.“Monday’s forum is expected to raise issues of how AI can help optimize geriatrics as well as ways to slow the ageing process. Scientists and panels cover questions such as: “How can AI help improve the lives of older people?“ and ”What role will the medical and food industries play in the ageing society?“The forum will also cover topics including the health care industry and new generations under the theme of ""Science and Technology in Health Care"" and ""Next Revolution for Better Living"" until Nov. 1.

In front of the National Assembly building in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Saturday, some 10,000 people – mostly young – held their “Candle Party” to celebrate the new era ushered in by peaceful candlelit protests last year. Organized 100 percent by individual volunteers, the event was notably more upbeat than the other, larger event held at Gwanghwamun Square, the main venue of last year’s movement, by left-wing civic groups and labor unions. ""Candle Party"" at Yeouido “We came here to have fun and celebrate the first anniversary of the candlelight movement,” Lee Ki-hwa, who helped organize the event in Yeouido told The Korea Herald. “We planned the event here because it is lawmakers who should listen to our demands.” Yeouido is where the National Assembly is located. “But I think our hope to eradicate deep-rooted evil in society would be the same here or there,” he said in reference to those who gathered at Gwanghwamun Square. One year on, participants at both locations have the same stated goal – eradicating deep-rooted evil that they think has made society unfair, unjust and unsafe. And they believe candles should continue to be lit to have their voices heard by the parliament and government. Getting rid of deep-rooted ills begins with investigating Park’s predecessor Lee Myung-bak, who is suspected of creating a slush fund, using the nation’s spy agency to intervene in 2012 election and clamp down on liberals, they said. But some protesters held a separate event in Yeouido because they opposed the idea of marching toward the presidential office, following the main event in the evening at Gwanghwamun Square. They believe the civic groups demand “too much” from the Moon Jae-in administration that only took office in May.“President Moon is doing well now. But the organizations are bombarding him with too many demands. We should not be impatient and support him to achieve what he intended to do step by step,” Jeon Young-ok, 58, while marching toward the headquarters of the main opposition Korea Liberty Party. The anniversary event at Gwanghwamun, which drew some 60,000 participants, was hosted by left-wing civic groups, student groups and labor unions. They are among some 1,500 civic organizations that were behind the 23 anti-Park rallies that took place from October till this year.  Anniversary event at Gwanghwamun The groups said they would march toward the presidential office as a warning to the Moon Jae-in administration not to forget about his unfulfilled tasks. In the face of strong resistance and criticism from some supporters of President Moon, they withdrew the plan. Only the nation’s second-biggest umbrella trade union went ahead with the march.“I think the meaning of candles was distorted by groups of left-wing civic groups. I think the candles were purely the power of the people. I feel like they are using the candle-holding citizens to serve their own interests,” Jeon said. At recent candlelit rallies at Gwanghwamun Square, there have been several voices raised by different civic groups. Some called on the government to get rid of irregular jobs, others opposed the deployment of anti-US missile system or US President Donald Trump’s upcoming two-day visit here. But after they helped unseat Park, many citizens, who resonated with the calls to remove the corruption-ridden leader from power, appear to feel uncomfortable with the groups who they see as “using candlelight force to suit their own agendas.”Unlike the rally at Gwanghwamun Square, participants at the Yeouido rally focused on demanding a thorough probe into ousted Park’s predecessor Lee Myung-bak and criticizing the opposition Liberty Korea Party for not cooperating with the Moon administration for reform plans. But many saw the divide itself is not a bad thing. It is a display of diversity and a result of maturing democracy in the country, they said. “I think that those who were once unified started to grow apart. But on the other hand, I think that is a desirable thing in a democratic country,” said Lee Song-ho, 42. Those who gathered at the Gwanghwamun rally also welcomed the different opinions. “I am positive that diverse voices start to come out. And Gwanghwamun is a symbolic place for the diverse voices to be heard. I don’t see  as a rift,” Choi Mi-young, 38, said.

The other system of political imprisonment is operated by the Ministry of State Security. The committee said it identified through the satellite imagery tell-tale characteristics of prison camps, such as security enclosures with gated high walls and barbed wire fences, guard towers, dormitories, and workshops or mines located within or adjacent to the prisons.""The practices documented in 'Parallel Gulag' reveal yet another layer of North Korea's brutal system in blatant contradiction to international laws, including treaties that North Korea has ratified,"" said David Hawk, the author of the report and a human rights specialist.Michael Kirby, who chaired the UN Commission of Inquiry on human rights violations in North Korea, said the report updates the record and ""shows that North Korea's system of political oppression remains in place as an affront to the conscience of humanity.""""These revelations suggest the imposition of degrees of suffering even more pervasive than the UN COI described in 2014,"" he wrote in his foreword.The COI accused North Korea of ""systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations.""

The Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentTentatively named Seoul Children Hospital’s Samsung Development Center, the hospital project was initiated by the city government in 2013 in partnership with Samsung Group and non-profit organization Community Chest of Korea. Seoul City injected 11.8 billion won  to build the center, while Samsung chipped in 20 billion won. Developmental disorders refer to psychiatric conditions originated in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. Disorder comprises language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders, while in broader definitions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  is also included. In Korea, developmental disorder is not covered by the national health insurance system. Data show that Korea’s number of developmental disorder patients is on the rise, although the overall number of disabled children has been dropping since 2011. Each year, approximately 7,000 people are newly diagnosed with the condition. In the past four years, those suffering with an intellectual disability went up by 8.9 percent to 195,000 patients, while those with autistic disorder increased by 27.8 percent to 23,000. About six in 10 patients with autism here are teenagers or younger. Spanning 11,950 square meters of space across five floors in Seocho-gu, southern Seoul, the facility comprises doctor’s offices, 30 rehabilitation treatment and activity program rooms, a family counseling room, an auditorium, a gym and other facilities. “We hope the establishment of the facility to strengthen national research and treatment on developmental disorder and also to serve as a momentum to create a better public healthcare service,” said Yoon Ju-hwa, head of Samsung’s society volunteer division. Officials said the center will also provide counseling and psychological treatment for patients’ families. Surveys showed that psychological disorders of the caregivers of children with developmental disorders such as autism and intellectual disabilities were marked with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Many of the Korean parents of children with developmental disorders have demanded the government take more responsibility for affected children, when the President Moon Jae-in rolled out a state program in June to increase the number of support centers and hospitals dedicated to dementia patients. By Kim Da-sol","samsung chipped in 20 billion ,seoul children hospital samsung development ,hold its official opening friday ,korea first and only hospital ,in 10 patients with autism","['South Korea ’s', 'Seoul Children Hospital ’s Samsung Development Center', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Children Hospital ’s Samsung Development Center', 'Samsung Group', 'Community Chest', 'Korea', 'Seoul City', 'Samsung', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Yoon Ju - hwa', 'Samsung ’s', 'korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10829508  0.50985253

But public services for animal welfare have been at a very low standard,” said the city government. Officials cited the 2016 Seoul Survey that showed 93 percent of Seoul citizens supported the establishment of a city-run animal welfare center, while 9 in 10 of those who do not own pets also supported its establishment. The center will also conduct emergency rescues of abandoned animals on the street, with help of other animal rights groups. Rescued animals will go through medical examinations for infectious diseases and receive the corresponding treatment. The center’s adoption program offers counseling and education for wannabe pet owners. Those who are interested can visit the center or its website at cafe.naver.com/seoulanimalcare.The center opens from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on Tuesdays.“Seoul City will continue to make efforts to spread a culture for animal companions and humans to co-exist in our society, while promoting correct ‘petiquette’ -- the proper way to control and handle a pet -- to pet owners,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. By Kim Da-sol","million pet owners in korea ,pet owners said seoul mayor ,care center will open saturday ,seoul animal care centerthe first ,tuesdays seoul city will continue","['Seoul Animal Care Center', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul Animal', 'CenterThe', 'Konkuk University and', 'Seoul National University', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Seoul', '“seoul city', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Kim Da - sol']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61650127  0.5719046

The report also said Poland's debt relief was linked to the North's provision of $1.5 million in cash to purchase a ship to a North Korea-Poland joint venture shipping firm established in 1967.Under the debt write-off deal, the North was also required to foot the bill of $200,000 to repair the Polish Embassy in Pyongyang. The repair project was based on an agreement between representatives from the two countries' foreign ministries and the North was obligated to transfer the money to the embassy's account.In case the obligations are fulfilled, the agreement says, Poland will write off 61 percent of the North's debt that corresponds to around $2.61 million.North Korea currently owes debts to Sweden, Switzerland and Finland.

Despite South Korean organizers’ determination to make the Winter Games a big hit, much of the event’s success may depend on the host country’s enigmatic neighbor, North Korea.  North Korean figure skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik compete during the pairs free program at the Figure Skating-ISU Challenger Series on Sept. 29 in Oberstdorf, Germany. Taking place just a scant 80 kilometers away from the heavily fortified border with the communist regime, the PyeongChang Games have made some athletes wonder about their safety, amid all the news about the North’s unpredictable young dictator Kim Jong-un and his dangerous pursuit of nuclear weapons. Officials in Seoul, however, rule out such concerns. Contrary to that, they pin high hopes on Kim’s interest in sports and that the North may send a delegation here. “There have been some positive signs from the North ,” South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said Monday while visiting Greece for the torch lighting event, although he refused to disclose details. International Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas Bach also said that he is trying “through various channels to have North Korea participate” in the games. He added that the IOC is studying “technical measures” to provide the North with an opportunity to take part in PyeongChang. The IOC said earlier that it would consider wild-card entries for North Korean athletes, on top of special provision of aid such as equipment, travel and accommodation. Positive or ambiguous signs Last month, North Korea secured its presence at the Winter Olympics set to run from Feb. 9-25 in the South’s sleepy resort town, with figure skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik grabbing one of the last Olympic spots in a competition in Germany. On Oct. 13, the North submitted a document to the International Paralympic Committee, conveying its wish to participate in the upcoming winter’s multisport event for disabled athletes. The 2018 PyeongChang Paralympics are scheduled to take place from March 9-18. But other than the two developments, the reclusive nation has been dealing with the situation with ambiguous responses. On the application for the Paralympic Games, South Korea’s Minister of Culture Sports and Tourism Do Jong-hwan recently said the North has “not followed up with any official moves” to enter the competition. An unnamed official with the IPC told Yonhap News Agency that he echoed Do’s view and said the North’s Paralympic committee sent the document via email on May 9. Asked about the PyeongChang Olympics, Chang Ung, a North Korean delegate to the IOC, said, “I am quite sure that politics is one thing and Olympics is another thing,” adding that he did not see any “big problem.” ‘Waiting until the last minute’ Some of the most animated moments of inter-Korean relations were highlighted through gleaming sweat and joint teamwork in sports in the past. It would be the “cherry on top” of the South Korean government’s agenda to make the event serve its goal as the “Peace Olympics,” if the North decides to join the first Winter Games here.In July, President Moon Jae-in stressed that South Korea would keep the door open to the North “until the very last minute,” a month following his proposal to form a South-North unified team.To lure North Korea to compete at the Winter Games, the government is preparing a United Nations resolution that will allow all conflicts surrounding North Korea to temporarily freeze from Feb. 9-25, during the Olympics and the ensuing Paralympics. It is scheduled to be voted on around November, the Foreign Ministry here said. However, experts here are expressing skepticism over Seoul’s interpretation of several of the North’s sports-related moves as “signs of willingness.”“North Korea may be simply weighing the current situation or trying to give its athletes chances ,” said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, while mentioning that the diplomatic circle here believes the North will maintain an obscure stance to the end. “The current regime headed by its leader Kim Jong-un believes sports is very important in terms of economics and leisure, so it would be misleading to connect the North’s sports-related moves to PyeongChang,” he said.  South Korean former soccer player Park Ji-Sung  receives flame from former torch bearer Greek cross-country skier Apostolos Angelis  during the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame in Ancient Olympia, southwestern Greece, on Tuesday. Another expert also said Seoul should be cautious and watchful of North Korea’s true motives behind its every move. “North Korea has shown signs with the construction of Marikryong Ski Resort, but  has more to do with Kim Jong-un’s goal of showcasing to his people and the global community that he could handle North Korea’s economy and future,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. In 2013, North Korea opened Masikryong Ski Resort in a province that shares a border with the South. In a telephone interview with Voice of America at the time, Chang Ung linked the ski resort to the PyeongChang Olympics. “Such infrastructures designed and built at the time embody Kim’s experience in Europe,” added Go. Above all, it would be difficult for the North to join the games as it refuses to discard its decadeslong nuclear ambition, both experts noted. North Korea’s sixth and largest nuclear test in September triggered the United Nations Security Council to impose strict sanctions on the rogue regime. It also sparked security concerns among participating nations due to the escalating military tension on the Korean Peninsula.

The idea might have looked brilliant to the operator of Incheon Airport, the country’s main gateway, looking to add a unique, new feature to its soon-to-be completed passenger terminal. However, doctors and medical professionals seem to think otherwise. Transfer terminal in Incheon International Airport. According to data from Incheon International Airport Corp. released by Rep. Kang Hoon-sik of the Democratic Party of Korea, the airport’s project to set up a 240-square-meter cosmetic surgery center on the third floor of its new terminal slated to open in January has hit a wall, as no doctor has come forward to open a clinic there. A public notice of the bid to run the clinic was put up on Sept. 13. “The airport operator, blinded by the pursuit of profits, overlooked some very important medical questions. It needs to rethink the project from square one,” Rep. Kang said. According to the airport’s operator, the plan aimed to attract more foreign patients to the country as well as to the airport, as South Korea has emerged as a medical tourism destination. The number of foreign patients that visited South Korea was 364,000 last year, jumping 22.7 percent over the previous year, data showed. The most sought-after medical services among Chinese and Japanese patients were plastic surgery and dermatological treatments.The airport’s plan was to allow transit passengers to receive those popular medical treatments between flights in Incheon. But the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons sent an official request to reconsider the plan, saying the plan lacks understanding of medical treatments and could lead to legal problems. “What if patients cannot get on their scheduled flight due to some unexpected medical problems that occur after the surgeries or treatments?” the association posed. “Even the simplest double-eyelid surgery could be affected due to differences in air pressure, and side effects could occur if immunity is lowered due to fatigue from long flights.” The Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons echoed the view, adding that the project may not be lucrative even if realized. Nearly 70 percent of medical tourists visiting South Korea are from Asian countries -- including China -- who often do not need to transfer flights. “One must reconsider using medical services and treatment as a means to increase the number of airport users,” added the society.

President Moon Jae-in  speaks during a Cabinet meeting held at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Oct. 24, 2017. The remarks came four days after the public debate commission recommended the government resume the construction of the two new nuclear reactors -- Shin Kori-5 and Shin Kori-6.The construction of the two reactors was halted in July. The president had earlier pledged to scrap them entirely as part of his new energy policy, which seeks to build a nuclear energy-free nation.Moon has said his goal of building such a nation would take decades, as he planned only to stop building new nuclear plants and shut down those that run out their operational life cycles.Still, the commission's recommendation to finish building the two new reactors forced him to retreat from his earlier pledge to scrap them, apparently opening the president to attacks from the opposition parties, who already outnumber his ruling Democratic Party.The president insisted the debate left no winners or losers, but only a social consensus that he earlier said would help further develop the country's deliberative democracy.""The government must sincerely accept the people's wish and fully reflect the commission's recommendation while discussing its follow-up measures,"" he said, according to Cheong Wa Dae pool reports.""Also, you must always keep in mind while discussing follow-up measures that the debate was not to decide a winner and loser or right and wrong but to promote unity and coexistence.""","building the two new reactors ,tuesday that his government will ,two new reactors forced him ,president said in cabinet meeting ,nuclear reactors noting the debate","['Moon Jae - in', 'Cheong', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul', 'Kori-5', 'Shin Kori-6.The', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37196949  0.74924648

At a time when nation-states are mired in ideological infighting and hegemonic rivalries, Tehran and Seoul -- by relying on civic passion, corporate investment and public goods -- can together contribute to international peace, prosperity and sustainable development, Najafi said during his visit to Korea last week.“The world is moving in a direction where cities and regions will increasingly play greater roles, replacing the functions of nation-states,” the mayor told The Korea Herald in an exclusive interview at Conrad Seoul on Friday. “The changes will not be speedy, but steady and piecemeal. But I am confident that cities will be the ones making long-term strategic decisions and luring investments toward sustainable development, not only on the national scale, but global scale.”Tehran Mayor Mohammad-Ali Najafi, one of Iran’s staunch advocates of global engagement and domestic reform, says the Iranian capital presents untested opportunities to Korean investors. Najafi came to Korea last week to participate in the third meeting of the Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and Seoul Metropolitan Government. Following the third meeting, he took part in the Seoul Mayors’ Forum on Climate Change, organized by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, Seoul Metropolitan Government and Global Covenant of Mayors.Stressing that today’s world faces many grave challenges, most fundamentally climate change, the mayor said he critically addressed issues of curbing global warming and promoting inclusive growth, aimed at empowering all people economically, at the two forums from Wednesday through Friday. He reiterated his point that cities and mayors are poised to play an ever-larger constructive role in mitigating these manmade predicaments, a view passionately echoed by leading urban scholars.The scholar-turned-politician assumed office on Aug. 27 in the government of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. He has a track record of reformist views urging Iran’s engagement with the world at large, even as the Middle East powerhouse remains deeply divided over its relationship with the United States, which has threatened to annul the 2015 Iran nuclear deal under President Donald Trump, to the detriment of outside investors.The multilateral accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was reached in Vienna in July 2015 between Iran and the “P5+1” governments of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, United States and Germany, as well as the European Union, to eliminate Iran’s stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, scrap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 percent and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its gas centrifuges for 13 years. A handout picture provided by the office of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on October 13, 2017 shows him speaking on Iranian state TV Broadcast in reaction to a speech by US President. US President Donald Trump's speech in which he outlined an aggressive new strategy against Iran shows that he is ""more than ever against the Iranian people"", President Hassan Rouhani said. Against this backdrop, Najafi stated, “There will be major changes under my mayorship.” The 65-year-old native of Tehran added his city now has a reformist administration, marking a sea change after 14 years of the previous administration, and that he maintains “a very close relationship and coordinated policy responses” with President Rouhani, also a reformist with moderate centrist views who has sought to integrate Iran into the global economy. Rouhani won re-election on May 19 on promises of enhancing civil rights and restoring the economy and relations with Western nations. “Since taking my office in August, I have been a member of the cabinet as well and participate in important government meetings,” Najafi stressed. “This means that there is close policy coordination between the national and municipal governments and any differences are resolved through rational discussions. The people of Tehran expect fundamental changes in the city’s governance and ways of life.”Tehran, with a population of 15 million in its metropolitan area, suffers from air pollution, lack of infrastructure and overreliance on cars that run on gasoline engines. Najafi said his key vision for Tehran is to bolster exchanges and contacts with leading cities of the world in finance, entrepreneurship, manufacturing and renewable energy, so that the underinvested capital can lure large-scale investments and professionals for industrial diversification in a post-oil economy. Over 100 large-scale projects are being planned for foreign investors, he highlighted, encouraging Korean companies to plow capital into knowledge-based industries, as well as construction, industrial and car manufacturing, electric battery production, air pollution control and waste recycling into energy and fertilizer. In this photo released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks at a meeting in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017. Khamenei on Wednesday urged Europe to do more to back the 2015 nuclear deal after President Donald Trump refused to re-certify the pact and European companies have rushed into the Iranian markets since the landmark accord. Of particular importance, constructing and expanding the Tehran Metro subway hold much potential, he said, citing the need for expertise in mechanical components, electronic equipment and software. The government of Tehran offers municipal guarantees for returns to investment, just as the central government provides sovereign guarantees to investors. Iran has secured a line of credit of 8 billion euros  from the Korea Eximbank since August, the country’s biggest loan since the nuclear deal that will finance Korean firms’ projects in Iran. “Over the last four years since the launch of the Rouhani administration in August 2013, many effective programs and initiatives for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises have materialized,” explained Najafi, adding he, too, pays keen attention to the issue. “Knowledge-based SMEs have expanded as a result in Tehran. My administration has identified zones for attracting knowledge-intensive companies, modeling ‘Station F’ in France,” he added, referring to the world’s biggest startup incubator in Paris. Refashioned from an old train station, the venture ecosystem covering 34,000 square meters has capacity for more than 3,000 startups, eight event spaces, 30 shower stalls, 60 meeting rooms and 100 shared apartments for entrepreneurs.Najafi underlined that Tehran -- the main industries of which include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics, electrical equipment, textiles, sugar, cement and chemical products, alongside government jobs, labor-intensive services and management of oil refineries -- aims to replicate France’s experience to nurture and protect the growth of its SMEs. Provisions of facilities, reductions in payments of expenses, local tax deductions and other related incentives are offered. Tehran Mayor Mohammad-Ali Najafi, one of Iran’s staunch advocates of global engagement and domestic reform, says the Iranian capital presents untested opportunities to Korean investors. Prior to his current position, Najafi was the minister of higher education from 1981-84, minister of education from 1989-97 and vice president of Iran Head of Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization from 2013-14. He was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he obtained his master’s degree in mathematics, but couldn’t complete his doctorate due to the 1979 Iranian revolution. Upon returning to Iran, he taught mathematics at Sharif University of Technology as a professor from 1979-81. One of Najafi’s priorities is increasing the transparency of municipal administration. “We encourage people to take part in various activities and management of the city, as well as voicing their opinions on its budget and expenses. We will try to put forward a more balanced and fair budget for the overall benefit of our citizens,” the mayor said. On the question of an ideological split in Iran, intensified by saber-rattling rhetoric from Washington, he said conservatives and reformists have no differing views over the basics of the 1979 revolution -- where the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown and replaced by an Islamic Republic -- or the principles of the Islamic Republic. Differences lie in the level of international engagement and the state’s reach over civil society, according to Najafi. “We reformists strive to develop comprehensive, far-arching relations with the international community, while removing limits on the civil society and various cultural practices. This is absent among the conservatives,” the mayor said. “We believe the key to shared growth and peace is by keeping the door open to all parties of the world.” By Joel Lee","global scale tehran mayor ,investors he highlighted encouraging korean ,aggressive new strategy against iran ,champion mayors for inclusive growth ,but global scale tehran mayor","['Iran', 'Tehran', 'Mohammad - Ali Najafi', 'Tehran', 'Seoul', 'Najafi', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Mohammad - Ali Najafi', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'korean', 'Najafi', 'Korea', 'the Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives', 'Global Covenant of Mayors', 'iranian', 'Hassan Rouhani', 'Iran', 'the United States', 'Iran', 'Donald Trump', 'Vienna', 'Iran', 'China', 'France', 'Russia', 'the United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Germany', 'the European Union', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'Hassan Rouhani', 'iranian', 'US', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'Hassan Rouhani', 'Najafi', 'Tehran', 'Rouhani', 'Iran', 'western', 'Najafi', 'Tehran', 'Najafi', 'Tehran', 'korean', 'iranian', 'Supreme', 'Ayatollah Ali Khamenei', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'Khamenei', 'Donald Trump', 'european', 'iranian', 'Tehran', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'the Korea Eximbank', 'korean', 'Iran', 'Rouhani', 'Najafi', 'knowledge', 'Tehran', 'France', 'Paris', 'Najafi', 'Tehran', 'France', 'Tehran', 'Mohammad - Ali Najafi', 'Iran', 'iranian', 'korean', 'Najafi', 'Iran Head of Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization', 'the Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'iranian', 'Iran', 'Sharif University of Technology', 'Najafi ’s', 'Iran', 'Washington', 'the Islamic Republic', 'Najafi', 'Joel Lee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59687513  1.05872118

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and her counterpart Kang Kyung-wha, and Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne and her counterpart Song Young-moo, held their third biannual dialogue in Seoul on Oct. 13, designed to discuss mutual interests and challenges in the regional and global arenas and bolster their policy coordination. In a joint statement, the four ministers affirmed the strength of the two nations’ “partnership in the face of existing security threats and new and evolving regional and global challenges.” They expressed their unconditional disavowal of North Korea’s escalating nuclear and missile brinksmanship, urging the communist nation to return to dialogue for a “complete, verifiable and irreversible” denuclearization.According to Australian Ambassador to Korea James Choi, the event was a “highly symbolic” representation of the two governments’ close engagement and dialogue at the highest strategic level, where they enmesh foreign and defense policies together and coordinate their policy regimes. Australian Ambassador to Korea James Choi speaks to The Korea Herald at the Australian Embassy in Seoul on Oct. 20 about the recent 2+2 meeting between the foreign and defense ministers of the two countries. Canberra has the ministerial-level 2+2 meetings with the United States, the United Kingdom, Korea, Japan, Germany and Indonesia, and a “3+3” meeting with Singapore involving foreign, defense and trade ministers. Seoul has the meeting with the US and Australia, and has launched a vice-ministerial dialogue with India in March. The Australia-Korea 2+2 meeting -- slated to be held in Australia for the fourth time in 2019 -- builds on their annual deputy minister-level strategic dialogue. “Minister Bishop and Minister Payne mentioned in the post-meeting press conference that Australia stands side by side with South Korea in condemning and confronting the threats we both face from North Korea’s nuclear and missile development program,” Choi told The Korea Herald at the embassy last week, adding Pyongyang’s nuclear ambition poses a “grave threat” to regional and global security.“My foreign minister made clear that we stand together with the international community in fully implementing all sanctions resolutions by the United Nations Security Council. We are putting up a peaceful pressure campaign with Seoul, Washington and all major partners around the world, so that Pyongyang would give up its nuclear and missile provocations and return to the negotiable table.”Canberra has implemented all North Korea-related UNSC sanctions, most recently resolutions 2371 and 2375 on Aug. 5 and Sept. 11, respectively, which restrict the purchase of North Korea’s main export items -- coal, iron, lead and seafood -- and cut off over 55 percent of refined petroleum products flowing into the cash-strapped nation. In addition, Australia has adopted autonomous sanctions, listing all individuals and entities subject to sanctions and blocking their finance and trade links, a move beyond what the UNSC requested, Choi stressed. Following the event, North Korea issued a statement against Australia for strengthening its relationships with South Korea and the US, to which the Malcolm Turnbull government retorted that the nation will “not be cowed” by the rogue regime.  Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo observe a silent tribute to soldiers who paid their ultimate sacrifice during the 1950-53 Korean War, where 17,000 Australian troops fought and 170 died, at the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul on Oct. 13. “Should Australia continue to follow the US in imposing military, economic and diplomatic pressure upon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  despite our repeated warnings, they will not be able to avoid a disaster,” the North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency reported on Oct. 14. Bishop riposted, “North Korea’s threats only strengthen our resolve to find a peaceful solution to the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula caused entirely by North Korea’s illegal, threatening and provocative behavior.” The four ministers also visited the War Memorial of Korea and the Demilitarized Zone dividing the Korean Peninsula on Oct. 13, paying tribute to all soldiers and people who died during the 1950-1953 Korean War. Some 17,000 Australian troops fought in the fratricidal war launched by Pyongyang in 1950 as part of the United Nations multinational force, and 340 of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. The bilateral defense cooperation has evolved over the years to deal with both traditional and nontraditional challenges, including arms control, nuclear counterproliferation and nonproliferation, cybersecurity and transnational law enforcement, border security, crisis management, curbing climate change, counterterrorism, counterpiracy in seas, ensuring the freedom of navigation in international waters, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. “I don’t think you can separate regional challenges from global challenges,” remarked the envoy, noting the rules-based global order that has underpinned its growth and stability are being challenged and eroded today. “In terms of regional security’s perspective, we are facing much more uncertain dynamics,” he added, referring to maritime disputes in, and the militarization of, the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca and the Indian Ocean, through which vital energy and goods are transported. “Therefore increasing our strategic and defense cooperation is vital, especially given that we share so many similarities, such as respect for democracy, human rights, the rule of law and the international law, as freely trading nations. There’s much more we can do to underpin these rules. Defense cooperation is a vital link that ensures we continue to prop up and uphold these rules of the international order.” Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo speak during a press conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Seoul on Oct. 13 Korea has been an interoperable bilateral defense partner of Australia, particularly since a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation was signed in 2011. The blueprint commits to more joint exercises, training and staff exchanges in both directions. Australia and Korea share a strong commitment to supporting and developing the East Asia Summit, an annual forum bringing together leaders of 18 countries of the East Asian, Southeast Asian and South Asian regions, plus the US and Russia, for enhancing strategic cooperation, building mutual confidence and reducing regional tensions, said the ambassador.The two countries also share similar interests through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum for 21 Pacific-Rim member economies, designed to foster free trade throughout the Asia-Pacific region; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus; and MIKTA, an informal alliance of middle powers Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Australia, led by their Foreign Ministers working to enhance global governance. Turning his attention on MIKTA, Choi said, “As a loose group of like-minded countries of similar sizes, which are powers in their own respective regions, we can shape the international agenda by speaking together with one collective voice on key issues. MIKTA amplifies the voice of our countries and make other countries take notice.”Acknowledging the global geopolitical landscape, where genuine worldwide cooperation on many critical issues remains difficult, Choi said in place of the unwieldy multilateralism, “minilateralism” -- involving smaller groupings of like-minded nations, the prime example of which is MIKTA -- will rise in importance in the future. “The challenges of multilateralism, as evident in the United Nations, is palpable. Coordinating among all UN member states with conflicts of interest is unwieldy and difficult. But minilateralism like MIKTA can act much quicker and nimbler, especially among those that already share common interests.”The 10th MIKTA Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New York on Sept. 22, 2017 Pointing to the “Indo-Pacific” region, a term describing the evolving global economic order surrounding the Indian Ocean’s tropical waters, the western and central Pacific Ocean and the Southeast Asian seas, the diplomat said the Australian Foreign Ministry has moved away from using the term “Asia-Pacific” for “Indo-Pacific” over the last six to seven years. “The broad strategic trend is clear. The economic and strategic weight is continuing to shift westward toward India and ASEAN countries,” he said. He underscored that on top of Australia’s historic security alliance with the US, the country will enhance its engagement with growing China, ASEAN and India. Choi also conceded that countries like Australia and Korea face similar challenges in simultaneously dealing with superpowers China and US, both on the levels of security and commerce. “We are clear-eyed about our values and relationships with the US, while at the same time how to develop relations with China,” he said. “We want China to play a more constructive role in global affairs. China’s rapid economic and military development comes with corresponding responsibilities. China can support multilateral institutions to underpin the rules of international territorial sovereignty and trade. This is important for building confidence between all countries of the globe.”By Joel Lee","australia top envoy to korea ,third biannual dialogue in seoul ,australia korea meeting slated to ,the australia korea meeting slated ,australia korea meeting slated","['Australia', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'australian', 'Julie Bishop', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'australian', 'Defense', 'Marise Payne', 'Song Young', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'australian', 'Korea', 'James Choi', 'australian', 'Korea', 'James Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Australian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Canberra', 'the United States', 'the United Kingdom', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Germany', 'Indonesia', 'Singapore', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Australia', 'India', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'Bishop', 'Payne', 'Australia', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'UNSC', 'North Korea ’s', 'Australia', 'UNSC', 'Choi', 'North Korea', 'Australia', 'South Korea', 'US', 'australian', 'Defense', 'Marise Payne', 'australian', 'Julie Bishop', 'korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'korean', 'Song Young', 'australian', 'Seoul', 'Australia', 'US', 'the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea', 'North ’s', 'Korea Central News Agency', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'australian', 'Pyongyang', 'United Nations', 'australian', 'Defense', 'Marise Payne', 'australian', 'Julie Bishop', 'korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'korean', 'Song Young', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'southeast asian', 'south asian', 'US', 'Russia', 'the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers ’ Meeting Plus', 'Mexico', 'Indonesia', 'Korea', 'Turkey', 'Australia', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'the United Nations', 'UN', 'New York', 'southeast asian', 'the Australian Foreign Ministry', 'India', 'ASEAN', 'Australia', 'US', 'China', 'ASEAN', 'India', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'China', 'US', 'US', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Joel Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.39758617  0.45978624

Seoul Metropolitan Government.Spanning 160,000 square meters of space across six basement floors, the Yeongdong-daero transit terminal is to be the single largest multifunctional underground complex to be built in the country, the city government said. “A global consortium led by French architect Dominique Perrault has been selected for the complex’s design,” the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced Monday. Perrault is an architect known here for his work at Ewha Womans University -- the Ewha Campus Complex building. Perrault’s “Light Walk” project was selected for its “compatibility to nearby districts and ability to digest massive traffic,” city officials explained. Construction is to begin in 2019 and end in 2023. Located between Samsung Station on Subway Line No. 2 and Bongeunsa Station on Line No. 9, the underground complex is envisioned to be a multifunctional, cultural and retail space while serving as a major transport hub in the southern part of the capital. On the upper two levels of the complex, there will be an exhibition hall, a museum, a library and a shopping mall. The levels from the third underground floor down will be used as bus, subway, train transit and transfer centers and parking lots for tour buses. An artist’s rending of the mammoth underground facility to be built in Gangnam. Seoul Metropolitan Government.The complex will connect Subway Lines No. 2 and 9 with a direct transfer passageway, and offer a junction of five train lines including the high-speed KTX and bus stops. The city expects at least 600,000 transit passengers will visit the underground terminal every day, nearly double the number at Seoul Station. Over 180,000 people are expected to take buses here, following the 2023 opening of a bus-only lane in the area.Yeongdong-daero’s 480-meter sector of road will go underground and the surface area will be created into a 30,000-square-meter public plaza, which is double the size of Seoul Square in front of the City Hall building in Jung-gu.

We will continue to make every effort to ensure that our cities and societies are more inclusive and sustainable for current and future generations,” the agenda read.The agenda was written based on the mayors’ agreement on working together to create more inclusive cities through four policy domains, which include education, labor markets, housing and urban environment and infrastructure and public services.The Paris Action Plan for Inclusive Growth in Cities, which was drafted in November last year, urged cities to promote policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises and expand opportunities for entrepreneurship.The inclusive development conference will also see two sideline discussions on topics such as gentrification, social enterprises, public procurement for inclusive development and women‘s and children’s issues.Since March 2016, more than 50 mayors from around the world have joined forces to address rising inequalities in various sectors through the OECD Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth initiative.By Kim Da-sol","conference for mayors seoul mayor ,development conference for mayors seoul ,conference for mayors seoul ,for mayors seoul mayor park ,will also have seoul mayor","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy Christiana Figueres', 'the OECD Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Angel Gurria', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Seoul Implementation Agenda for Inclusive Growth in Cities', 'the Sustainable Development Goals', 'the OECD Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63725448  0.57283723

Concrete manufacturing and construction work contributed to 22 percent.By Kim Da-sol","south korea will require diesel ,2021 south korea will require ,environment ministry said wednesday yonhapaccording ,korea will require diesel vehicles ,receive mandatory nitrogen oxide examinations","['South Korea', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'South Korea', 'London', 'Emissions Analytics', 'diesel', 'South Korea', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Kim Da - sol']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29780275  0.47358653

Three former presidents -- two conservative and one liberal: Park Geun-hye, Lee and the late Roh Moo-hyun -- are concurrently under the microscope of state prosecutors as the liberal Moon Jae-in administration is pushing for a campaign to eradicate deep-rooted evils in society. Moon Moo-il speaks during a meetnig with reporters Tuesday. “If there is evidence, it would be difficult for us  to ignore. We don’t put any restrictions on the subjects of investigations,” Prosecutor-General Moon Moo-il said during a meeting with reporters, when asked whether former President Lee could be subject to investigation. The top prosecutor said that he would assign more prosecutors to teams looking into cases linked to past administrations, ranging from a blacklist of liberal artists to alleged election manipulation by the nation’s spy agency. The prosecution is looking into allegations that the National Intelligence Service, under the Lee administration between 2009 and 2013, implemented a blacklist of cultural figures critical of the administration and operated an online smear campaign to sway the 2012 presidential election in favor of then-conservative candidate Park. Ongoing prosecutorial investigations into these cases have yet to reach Lee, despite suspicion that the former conservative leader may have been the one behind the illicit activities. As for former President Park Geun-hye, who called her trial “political revenge in the name of the rule of law,” the top prosecutor said that “Park’s case got here due to  violations of the Constitution.” The prosecution indicted Park on charges of bribery and abuse of power in connection with the corruption scandal that led to her ouster in March. With her trial underway, the court decided to extend her detention by another six months Friday. Park expressed regret over the decision and her lawyers quit en masse in protest, taking issue with the fairness of the court Monday. The late liberal President Roh’s family members are also facing possible investigation, as the conservative Liberty Korea Party has filed a complaint against them over suspected corruption. The case was closed with his suicide in 2009. The prosecution has not yet decided whether to reopen the case. Moon Moo-il also talked about ongoing efforts to make the prosecution politically neutral and its investigation process transparent in the face of criticism that the prosecution is politicized and holds too much power with its exclusive authority to indict. “We are pushing to leave all decision-making records online during my tenure,” he said. “There should be no shame whenever anyone reviews cases ” The chief prosecutor supported the ideas of creating an independent investigative body to look into corruption by high-ranking public servants -- including prosecutors -- and rebalancing the prosecution’s rights to investigate and indict with the police. But he reserved his stance on what the prosecution thinks about the specific suggestions that have been floated. Public distrust of the prosecution hit a tipping point in the wake of the corruption scandal, which laid bare suspected collusive ties among politicians, ranking public servants and business tycoons. The prosecution was criticized for being lenient to the powerful.","korea top prosecutor said tuesday ,three former presidents two conservative ,during meetnig with reporters tuesday ,top prosecutor said tuesday ,top prosecutor said tuesday that","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Moo - il', 'Lee', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Roh ’s', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Moon Moo - il']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07945433  0.83239049

The Change Up Campus run by Gyeonggi Province will provide programs designed to help students to better prepare for the coming “fourth industrial revolution” on top of learning the English language, the province said.  Key panelists pose before attending a forum to discuss creativity in education held at Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning in Suwon on Tuesday. From left: Lee Chung-hwan, president of Herald Edu, Chang Jae-young, president of RAM Korea, Hong Sun-ho, professor at Seoul National University of Education, Kim Gyeong-pyo, president of Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning, and Bae Soo-moon, councilor of Gyeonggi Province. Marking the reopening, a forum was organized Tuesday by the province and the Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning, where five experts on a panel exchanged views on what kind of education Change Up Campus should strive to offer. Professor Shin Kwan-soo of Namseoul University, who obtained a Ph.D. in international education from the University of Southern California, said programs should be based on “creativity, collaboration, communication and critical thinking” in line with global educational standards. Creativity in education has often been associated with arts education, he went on, but it could be expanded to teaching students how to think creatively in various fields, he said.  Kim Gyeong-pyo, president of Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning “A great many business leaders think they were not born more creative than others, but were educated to be so,” he said, citing a study published in Harvard Business Review. Another participant, Chang Jae-young, president of Royal Academy of Music Korea, cited the UK’s art education where students must master at least one musical instrument until high school, as a successful model of teaching that needs to be adopted at the Change Up Campus. “The UK and other developed countries in Europe emphasize the importance of art education since preschool,” Chang said. “Here, we do have an art class in public schools, but it is rather treated separately among other subjects. But in the UK, arts instruction is integrated into math, science, foreign language and other subjects, allowing students to learn it in the context of everyday life,” Chang said. “By doing so, creativity can thrive,” Chang added. With the launch of the new educational hub, the province should work in partnership with local communities and educational experts for the development of its programs, said Gyeonggi Province councilor Bae Soo-moon.The councilor said that the campus could provide classes run by apprentice teachers from the region’s education colleges through partnership.“It’s a win-win for everyone. With the partnership, the province can resolve the possible problem of insufficient supply of native English-speaking teachers, while apprentice teachers can effectively develop their teaching skills,” Bae said. Seoul National University of Education professor Hong Sun-ho, however, emphasized that the province should learn from its own experiences of running the English village business and prepare for more high-quality education options. “We need to think about what to learn from the previous business model and what to work on to improve it. We need not only high-quality educational programs for students, but for teachers as well to run the programs more smoothly,” Hong said. “Having good software is as important as having good hardware as part of the overall package,” Hong added.At an opening ceremony held two days earlier in Paju, Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil said that the remodeled campus “carries the values of evolution and revolution” to provide a better learning opportunity to the next generations, and that it would “provide a model for the country’s new education.” The new campus provides classes for students including experimenting with drones, robotics, coding and 3-D printing, as well as language courses and mentoring, as part of a solution to help them learn arts, science and technology out of public schools, according to the province.By Bak Se-hwan","learning in suwon on tuesday ,reopening forum was organized tuesday ,korea first residential english camp ,tuesday the change up campus ,in suwon on tuesday","['English Village', 'South Korea ’s', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning', 'Suwon', 'Lee Chung - hwan', 'Herald Edu', 'Chang Jae - young', 'RAM Korea', 'Hong Sun - ho', 'Seoul National University of Education', 'Kim Gyeong - pyo', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning', 'Bae Soo - moon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning', 'Shin Kwan - soo', 'Namseoul University', 'the University of Southern California', 'Kim Gyeong - pyo', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning', 'Harvard Business Review', 'Chang Jae - young', 'Royal Academy of Music Korea', 'UK', 'the change up Campus', 'UK', 'Chang', 'UK', 'Chang', 'Chang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Bae Soo - moon', 'Bae', 'Seoul National University of Education', 'Hong Sun - ho', 'Hong', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Bak Se - hwan']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12241734  0.4519724

Dan Dickinson, commander of US Air Force's F-22 Demo Team, said after the performance.The Raptor, based in Alaska, is participating in the biennial ADEX along with a host of other high-profile US defense assets such as the F-35A Lightning II, B-1B Lancer, A-10 Thunderbolt II and US Navy P-8A Poseidon.""The capabilities of the jet  really exceed anything else you've seen in the world today. We are super excited to have two of them. There's only 187 of them in the world,"" the commander said. Asked about his impression of flying relatively close to North Korea amid heightened tensions, he just said he would defer all the North Korea-related topics to Washington. The US Air Force`s F-22 Raptor stealth jet demonstrates its capabilities in a demo flight in the sky over the Seoul Air Base on Oct. 16, 2017, a day before the opening of the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition. A couple of F-35A jets will be on public display as well and a B-1B Lancer strategic bomber is scheduled to fly over the ADEX site. It will mark the first time an F-35A stealth fighter has landed in South Korea.""The F-35A is the newest stealth fighter. So, in terms of survivability, in a robust threat environment, and lethality it's the best. So, it will definitely help the Republic of Korea,"" said Lt. Col. Bryan Daltona, an F-35 pilot in the 56th Fighter Wing Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.He was referring to South Korea's plan to import 40 F-35As produced by Lockheed Martin. The first jet will be rolled out next year, with the first delivery to South Korea's Air Force due in 2019.The US Air Force unit in Arizona will be in charge of training South Korean pilots for the aircraft.""We are gonna train the South Korean F-35 pilots at the Luke Air Force Base, and by doing that, we are gonna work on tactics together. So, I think it's gonna enhance the alliance and enable us to work better together on the aircraft,"" Lt. Col. Brian Healy, another F-35 pilot from Arizona, told reporters.The gathering of the advanced weapon systems here is expected to effectively send a warning message to the North reportedly preparing to engage in additional provocations.Speaking separately to reporters, Lt. Col. Michal Kloeffler-Howard, director of the US 7th Air Force's public affairs, said, ""We see this as a venue to deepen our relationship with the Republic of Korea.ADEX organizers stressed that this year's event will provide a good chance not only to show the strength of the alliance but also to support defense firms' marketing activities.""This is the largest civil-military expo in Northeast Asia,"" Jang Suk-chul, vice president of Korea Aerospace Industries Association, said in a press conference.

Kang Kyung-wha said during a parliamentary audit in Seoul that North Korea sent a letter to the International Paralympic Committee to show its intention to compete at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Paralympic Games.South Korean organizers and the government are hoping for North Korea's Olympic and Paralympic participation next year regardless of the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula sparked by Pyongyang's nuclear test and missile provocations. South Korea`s foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha speaks during a parliamentary audit on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the National Assembly in Seoul on Oct. 12, 2017. An official with the IPC, however, told Yonhap News Agency that it's still uncertain whether North Korea will actually compete south of the border, adding that the communist state hasn't made further moves to visit PyeongChang, some 180 kilometers east of Seoul, after sending the message. According to the IPC official, who asked for anonymity, North Korea's Paralympic committee sent the document via e-mail on May 9. To take part in the Paralympic Games, athletes need to earn quotas for the quadrennial event by collecting good results in international competitions or receiving wild card slots by the IPC.Since North Korea is a relatively undeveloped country in disabled sports, its realistic scenario for participation will be earning wild cards from the IPC. For wild card consideration, North Korean athletes first need to be registered in the IPC database, and then wait to be classified based on their physical abilities. However, North Korea has yet to register any of its athletes in the IPC database. South Korean officials and the IPC are expected to discuss the North Korean participation issue next week. The new IPC leader Andrew Parsons is scheduled to visit PyeongChang on Monday for the IPC Project Review meeting to examine local organizers' preparedness for the Paralympics.  North Korea has never performed at the Winter Paralympics, though it did take part in two Summer Paralympics. North Korea made its Paralympic debut in 2012 by sending one athlete to London, and was represented by two athletes at the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Paralympics.","paralympic games south korean organizers ,2018 pyeongchang winter paralympic games ,pyeongchang winter paralympic games south ,for the paralympics north korea ,the 2018 pyeongchang winter paralympic","['North Korea', 'Paralympic', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'the International Paralympic Committee', 'PyeongChang', 'south korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'paralympic', 'Pyongyang', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'IPC', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'North Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'Seoul', 'IPC', ""North Korea 's"", 'Paralympic', 'North Korea', 'IPC', 'north korean', 'IPC', 'North Korea', 'IPC', 'south korean', 'IPC', 'north korean', 'IPC', 'Andrew Parsons', 'PyeongChang', 'the IPC Project Review', 'Paralympics', 'North Korea', 'the Winter Paralympics', 'Summer Paralympics', 'North Korea', 'Paralympic', 'London']",10,"[ 0.          2.          1.         ... -0.80468506  0.18901946

The two are expected to tackle issues involving North Korea’s nuclear and missile development along with its ongoing threats to the allies and international community.The meeting will also act as a preparation stage for US President Donald Trump’s planned trip to South Korea in November. Trump may visit the heavily fortified demilitarized zone near the inter-Korean border during the tour, Yonhap News Agency said, citing an unnamed defense source. It will mark the first of its kind under the Moon Jae-in administration and the seventh overall.

The country will not see a similarly long Chuseok holiday until 2025. In that year, Chuseok falls on Monday, Oct. 6. The weekend prior to the traditional holiday is preceded by Oct. 3 National Foundation Day. The usual three-day Chuseok holiday is immediately followed by the Hangul Day holiday on Thursday. With the holidays ending on a Thursday, hopes are rising that Oct. 10, a Friday, will be designated a temporary holiday, which would stretch the holidays to Oct. 12, Sunday. A similar schedule is expected in 2028, when both Chuseok and the National Foundation Day fall on Oct. 3, Tuesday, making Thursday a temporary holiday. If Friday, Oct. 6, 2028 is designated as another temporary holiday, bridging the following weekend and the Hangul Day holiday on Monday, Oct. 9, that year’s autumn holiday would be extended to 10 days. Although designating temporary holidays is not obligatory by law, the government has allowed in-between days off to encourage more consumption and boost the economy.By Bak Se-hwan","long chuseok holiday until 2025 ,holiday if friday oct 2028 ,chuseok holiday until 2025 ,chuseok holiday until 2025 in ,holiday extend for record 10","['Chuseok', 'National Foundation Day', 'Chuseok', 'National Foundation Day', 'Chuseok', 'the National Foundation Day', 'Bak Se - hwan']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55657214  0.40748888

Frank Rijsberman, the Global Green Growth Institute’s director-general, speaks at a conference. “ South Korea to demonstrate how to develop renewable energy sources and invest in green growth,” Rijsberman said during an interview with The Korea Herald. The GGGI was launched in 2010 with the goal of bridging the rich and poor by sharing funding and technological know-how for environmentally friendly development. It seeks to introduce comprehensive planning frameworks for each member country. It has 26 donor and recipient member states working on 34 programs in 24 countries. “It’s also our mission to support green mechanisms and make sure actions are on the ground,” the director-general said. With South Korean President Moon Jae-in pushing to increase the use of renewables to 20 percent of the country’s total power generation by 2030, the country needs to focus on energy sources that are becoming cheaper, the GGGI chief stressed. “The biggest advantage of renewable energy is that it’s cheap. Korea is one of the OECD member countries that has the lowest renewable energy source use rate despite its severe fine dust problem derived from using fossil fuels.” Rijsberman said over the past 18 months, the price of solar energy fell by 70 percent -- it is on track to becoming the cheapest energy source and beating out fossil fuels. With regard to the government subsidies given to households and building owners for the installation of solar power grids here, he made it clear that the government should rethink the program. “Many countries have the government to provide subsidies for power grids, but it has become so cheap that they do not need to.”Currently, the Seoul Metropolitan Government is funding 415,000 won  for the installation of one 1.6-meter-wide and 0.9-meter-tall solar power panel at home. The resident pays the remaining 200,000 won, or can get additional subsidies from the district office.On worries that solar power grids are not quite reliable for widespread use, he said the key is innovation. “Part of that can be solved by connecting the grid with smart grid software. Korea is the world’s strong battery builder so it’s well placed to develop such programs,” he said.With renewable energy entrepreneurs like Elon Musk -- who runs a solar panel firm that specializes in efficiently storing large amounts of electricity in power banks -- solar grids for battery storage will be a “big game changer,” he said. Moving toward the paradigm of practical and cheap energy, Korea will go through similar discussions on nuclear power plants that climate leaders had in European countries, he said. “European countries also had  hard time meeting energy requirements, just like here in Korea.“Sometimes those shifts in society require a lot of discussion and there is a lot of resistance from implementing the system. Korea will go through various discussions and observations.”With global efforts underway to enforce the climate accord reached in Paris, the GGGI is hosting Global Green Growth Week 2017 together with the Government of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa from Oct. 17 to 20. World climate leaders will discuss topics such as climate finance; bankable projects in developing countries; the sustainable management of resources to address water and food security challenges; and the development of policies that drive environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth.By Kim Da-sol","hosting global green growth week ,global green growth institute seoul ,global green growth week ,said with renewable energy entrepreneurs ,director general also urged korea","['Global Green Growth Institute', 'Seoul', 'Frank Rijsberman', 'GGGI', 'Korea', 'Frank Rijsberman', 'Global Green Growth Institute ’s', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'GGGI', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'GGGI', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Korea', 'Elon Musk', 'Korea', 'european', 'european', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Paris', 'GGGI', 'Global Green Growth', 'Ethiopia', 'Addis Ababa', 'Kim Da - sol']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53155428  1.02933908

The KCNA added that Choe was also appointed a director at the party's central committee without specifying which division or branch he would head. Saturday's reshuffle raised the number of Choe's official roles in the party to eight in total.In the reshuffle, conducted ahead of the founding anniversary of the party which falls on Oct. 10, Kim's younger sister, Yo-jong, has also been elected as an alternate member of the WPK central committee's Political Bureau, according to the report.Yo-jong, 30, was first elected a member of the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's rubber-stamp parliament, in March 2014 and then a member of WPK's central committee in May last year.

On Sunday, Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun revealed that Seoul and Washington have been cooperating on keeping channels of communication with the North open, but that Pyongyang has not responded. Although Pyongyang has reportedly attempted to engage US analysts to gain insight into Trump’s stance, the reclusive regime has shown no signs that it is willing to engage in talks. Rather than back down in the face of growing international pressure, Pyongyang has used sanctions and show of force maneuvers from Seoul and its allies as justification for continuing its nuclear program. “Being nice to Rocket Man hasn’t worked in 25 years, why would it work now?” Trump added in a tweet sent later in the day.“Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won‘t fail.”Many experts say North Korea could stage another provocation this month to coincide with key anniversaries, including the founding anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea on Oct. 10.The regime conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 after launching two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.“DPRK will not obtain a nuclear capability. Whether through diplomacy or force is up to the regime,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Twitter, using the acronym of North Korea‘s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.“Diplomatic channels are open for Kim Jong-un for now. They won‘t be open forever.”As tension on the Korean Peninsula continues to mount, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan is reportedly set to visit Seoul in the coming weeks to discuss North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. According to local news reports, Sullivan’s trip is planned for mid-October, and he will meet with Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam. The meeting will focus on coordinating the allies’ responses, and plans for holding high-level talks on North Korea issues on a regular basis, as agreed by the countries‘ leaders in June.

AP-YonhapThe disclosure follows an escalating war of words between US President Donald Trump and North Korean strongman Kim Jong-un, and Tillerson issued a call for calm.Asked how he could know whether the North would even contemplate responding to new sanctions by coming to the table, the US envoy said: “We are probing, so stay tuned.”Washington has no diplomatic ties with Kim’s autocratic regime, and has been leaning on Beijing to rein in its neighbor‘s behavior through tougher sanctions.But Tillerson said US diplomats do not rely on China as a go-between in overtures to North Korea, and have themselves talked directly through “our own channels”.“We have lines of communication with Pyongyang. We’re not in a dark situation, a blackout, we have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang,” he said. In Washington, the State Department said that while such communications channels do exist North Korea has shown no interest in talking about giving up its nuclear weapons.South Korea’s presidential office backed up the US State Department‘s statement, saying that Pyongyang has shown no signs that the regime is “interested in or prepared for” dialogue. “The governments of South Korea and the US are working closely together in maintaining channels of communication with North Korea,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun said, adding that the allies are working on the shared goal of bringing Pyongyang to talks through sanctions and pressure. “As stated by the US State Department, North Korea has shown no interest in serious dialogue.” Park also said that the US has felt a need for “quiet communication” with the North to resolve humanitarian issues including the release of US citizens held captive by Pyongyang. The US has not ruled out the use of force to compel Pyongyang to halt missile and nuclear tests, and Trump has threatened to “totally destroy” the country.Tillerson, meanwhile, has been a proponent of a campaign of “peaceful pressure,” using US and UN sanctions and working with China to turn the screw on the regime, and welcomed recent measures taken by China to crack down on its neighbor.While it has backed UN sanctions against Pyongyang, Beijing has insisted that the punitive measures must be coupled with efforts to organize peace talks. China has also maintained some trade with Pyongyang, fueling criticism that such actions were giving North Korea room to breathe under mounting international pressure. However, faced with a recalcitrant Pyongyang and friction with Washington, Beijing has stepped up the pressure on North Korea, including the recent order on North Korean businesses in China to shut down as stated in the most recent UN Security Council resolution. As China takes a tougher stance, North Korea appears to be looking to Russia for support. According to North‘s Korean Central News Agency, director general of the North American department at the North Korean foreign ministry Choe Son-hui on Friday met with Oleg Burmistrov, Russia’s ambassador-at-large, to discuss issues surrounding North Korea. “Choe stressed that it is necessary for the US to stop its hostile policy toward the DPRK in order to defuse tension and ensure peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and the Northeast Asian region,” the KCNA said. DPRK stands for the North‘s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Moscow is considered friendly toward its former communist ally, but the country voted in favor of recent UN Security Council resolutions condemning North Korea‘s nuclear and missile provocations. Moscow, however, was instrumental in keeping North Korea’s fuel supply open, being one of the countries that rejected the US’s push to impose a complete fuel embargo on the reclusive regime.From news reports","resolutions condemning north korea nuclear ,businesses in china to shut ,donald trump and north korean ,compel pyongyang to halt missile ,nuclear weapons south korea presidential","['Washington', 'North Korea', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'China‘s', 'Xi Jinping', 'Tillerson', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Beijing', 'AP', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Tillerson', 'US', 'Kim', 'Beijing', 'Tillerson', 'US', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'the State Department', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Park Soo - hyun', 'Pyongyang', 'the US State Department', 'North Korea', 'US', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'Trump', 'Tillerson', 'US', 'UN', 'China', 'China', 'UN', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'China', 'UN Security Council', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'north‘s Korean Central News Agency', 'north american', 'north korean', 'Oleg Burmistrov', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'US', 'northeast asian', 'KCNA', 'north‘s', 'the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea', 'Moscow', 'UN Security Council', 'North Korea‘s', 'Moscow', 'North Korea ’s', 'US']",0,"[ 0.          3.         10.         ... -0.41658106  0.25264785

The expressway in Seoul is seen congested on Sunday, the second day of the 10-day Chuseok holiday period. YonhapThe Korea Expressway Corporation said that as of 9 a.m., the travel time on the 428-kilometer-long expressway between Seoul and the southeastern port city Busan is expected to be 4 hours and 20 minutes. It is expected to take 1 hour and 50 minutes from Seoul to Daejeon, and 3 hours and 10 minutes from Seoul to Gwangju. The KEC said congestion started on major expressways from 8 to 9 a.m. and is expected to peak between 5 and 6 p.m. and ease around midnight.According to the authorities, the country’s notorious holiday traffic is expected to be lighter this year due to Chuseok being stretched out over a record 10 days. With the government designating Monday a national holiday, this year’s Chuseok holiday stretches from Saturday to Oct. 9. Still, huge numbers of vehicles are expected to travel across the country. On Sunday alone, 4.5 million vehicles are forecast to leave Seoul while 3.8 million are to enter the capital city, the authorities said. All expressways across South Korea will be toll-free for three days from Tuesday, a day before Chuseok. Travelers are preparing to go through the departure procedure at Incheon International Airport on Sunday. YonhapKorea’s main gateway also saw the highest number of travelers to date.Officials at Incheon International Airport said almost 2 million Koreans are expected to travel abroad during the Chuseok holidays. A daily average of 177,000 people left the country since the holiday kicked off on Friday, about 10 percent more people than the last year. To prepare for the higher-than-average influx, the airport has taken measures to make the process smoother, such as opening up the departure gates at 6 a.m., 30 minutes earlier than usual, to accommodate more passengers in the early morning flights.During the Chuseok holiday, the first subway coming from Seoul Station to the airport will also start running 30 minutes earlier than usual at 4:50 a.m.By Kim Da-sol","incheon international airport on sunday ,congestion started on major expressways ,kilometer long expressway between seoul ,10 day chuseok holiday expressways ,congested on sunday the second","['Seoul', 'YonhapThe Korea Expressway Corporation', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Seoul to Daejeon', 'KEC', 'Chuseok', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Incheon International Airport', 'Koreans', 'Seoul Station', 'Kim Da - sol']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43747658  0.61647385

Yonhap    Kimchi and keytars -     It was the first of six evening performances, which included a flautist, a fan dance and a skit where two waitresses moved their limbs like marionettes, acting out a courtship between a male suitor and his darling.   Other waitresses buzzed around the restaurant, one moment grilling beef bulgogi  to be served with spicy kimchi , the next strapping on an accordion and heading to the stage.   They perform the 8:00 pm show every day of the week -- every single night of the year.   ""We makes small changes every time,"" one waitress said with an enthusiastic smile, when asked if she ever became bored of the nightly routine.   ""We arrange the music, we choose the costumes, we do everything,"" Kim Songum added.   As for holidays, the waitresses say they get a month off a year.   ""Of course, we go home to . It's home and it's cheaper there. Everything is free,"" Kim said, comparing it with the high cost of living in capitalist Dubai.   Speaking in English with help from a translation app, she said the waitresses are aware of the latest news from North Korean television.   ""We do not want war,"" Kim typed in Korean, pulling the phone back to add: ""But we are not afraid.""   'Gulf exception'?    Patrons entering Okryu-gwan cannot miss the enormous group photos of the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, flanked by the entire smiling restaurant staff.   The portraits are a treasured symbol of approval for the management, in a country which also enjoys close relations with rival South Korea and the United States.   The North Korean culinary establishment may be a taste of home for East Asian patrons -- even South Koreans, according to the waitresses -- but it is also a source of contention for Washington and Seoul, both on a fresh drive to isolate Pyongyang.   South Korea, which enjoys multi-billion dollar trade and investment ties with the Gulf states, has had recent success in pressing its allies to isolate its neighbour.   Kuwait City, the only Gulf capital to host a North Korean embassy, this month ordered its ambassador to leave and put a charge d'affaires in his stead.   Kuwait has also slashed the number of North Korean workers on its soil from4,000 to 1,500, according to a South Korean diplomat in charge of North Korean issues in the Gulf.   Qatar and Oman, which host up to 2,000 and 100 North Korean labourers respectively, are now phasing out those work permits, the UAE-based diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity.   Only the business-centric United Arab Emirates, with around 1,300 North Korean construction workers and restaurant staff, had ""unfortunately"" not taken any action, he said.   South Korea accuses North Korean authorities of confiscating a significant portion of the income of workers in the Gulf, which the diplomat said averaged around $1,000 per month.   But he acknowledged the financial contribution of an estimated 5,000 workers across the Gulf could not come close to funding a nuclear programme.   He alleged that North Korean authorities use restaurants and construction companies as cover for more lucrative side businesses.   But more important, the diplomat said, was the need to build a global consensus on implementing UN sanctions.   ""If we give an exception to the Gulf,"" he said, ""that is not good for the concept of international solidarity"".","canteen on weekend night waitress ,his darling other waitresses buzzed ,weekend night waitress wearing stoplight ,night waitress wearing stoplight red ,waitresses buzzed around the restaurant","['Dubai', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'Coca - Cola', 'asian', 'North Koreans', 'Pyongyang', 'american', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the UN General Assembly', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Dubai', 'Deira', 'korean', 'north korean', 'Dubai', 'Kim Songum', 'Kim', 'Dubai', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Korean', 'Okryu', 'Dubai', 'Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'north korean', 'east asian', 'South Koreans', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'Kuwait City', 'north korean', 'Kuwait', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Qatar', 'Oman', 'north korean', 'UAE', 'AFP', 'United Arab Emirates', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'UN']",10,"[ 0.         11.          5.         ... -0.75798202  0.60121274

""The government plans to consistently seek to offer humanitarian assistance regardless of political situations and will simultaneously make efforts to improve North Korea's human rights records,"" the ministry said.Seoul said that a center tasked with probing human rights violations will do its work in a full-fledged manner after it was launched in September 2016 in accordance with the relevant law.The law on the North's human rights was enacted and went into effect last year under the conservative government of Park Geun-hye, an ousted president on corruption charges.The 2017 action plan reflects the liberal Moon Jae-in government's stance on how to handle North Korea's human rights violations.Critics said that previous liberal administrations in 1998-2008 shied away from taking issue with the North's human rights violations out of concern that it could strain inter-Korean relations.Last week, Seoul approved a plan to provide US$8 million in aid to North Korea via UN agencies, citing a serious humanitarian crisis facing infants and pregnant women.It also said that the ministry will seek cooperation with UN bodies over the North's rights issue, adding that it will make efforts for the adoption of resolutions condemning North Korea's human rights at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.The action plan does not include Seoul's push for holding inter-Korean dialogue on human rights and identifying human rights perpetrators. Such plans were originally laid out in the three-year road map.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world. The North does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.Under the law, the government opened the Center for North Korean Human Rights Records, an agency to investigate and collect data on Pyongyang's rights situation.But the government has yet to launch a foundation to support relevant civic groups' activities and do research on the North's human rights violations due to a delay of the parliamentary process to recommend candidates for board members.","last week seoul approved plan ,three year strategy to improve ,year strategy to improve pyongyang ,north korea to stop human ,new law on north korean","[""South Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'North Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon Jae -', ""North Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'UN', ""North Korea 's"", 'the UN General Assembly', 'the Human Rights Council', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang']",10,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.62233704  0.70042902

Vincent K. Brooks, commander of the US Forces Korea, during the Armed Forces Day event in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, on Sept. 28, 2017. The award for the commander reflects South Korea's respect for his duty as the leader of 28,500 American troops in the nation technically still at war with the North. The two Koreas put an end to their 1950-53 conflict in a truce, not a formal peace treaty.Last year, he took over the command of the USFK, as well as the allies' Combined Forces Command and the United Nations Command.His role and mission are crucial to South Korea's national security, especially as the communist North has ratcheted up its military threats, and quickened its nuclear and missile development.Many South Korean defense officials recognize his leadership and strategic mind.Meanwhile, Moon presented the US Naval Forces Korea the Presidential Unit Citation, which is the highest unit-level award given by the South Korean government.It was awarded to Rear Adm. Brad Cooper, who commands the troops, officially named Commander, US Naval Forces Korea, and the other sailors of the unit for their ""outstanding contribution"" to the allies' joint defense posture.Cooper described the honor as a result of close teamwork with the allies' naval forces ""working shoulder-to-shoulder every day.""""Our relationship with the ROK Navy has always been strong, but that relationship is stronger now than it has ever been. We remain committed as ever to the defense of the Republic of Korea,"" he was quoted as saying by South Korean Navy officials.They added CNFK is making constant efforts to develop the combined combat operation system with South Korea's Navy through regular consultations and information exchange.CNFK is the US Navy's representative in South Korea.

Kang had talks separately with a group of congresswomen, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, and lawmakers of the foreign affairs committee of the Representatives of House. She also met with Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, the ministry said. In this Associated Press photo taken Sept. 21, 2017, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha speaks during a UN Security Council meeting at the UN headquarters in New York. During the meetings, Kang explained in detail about the Seoul government's approach to the North and underlined the importance of South Korea-US alliance in easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, according to the ministry.Kang asked for their full support for efforts to intensify sanctions and pressure on the North in order to use it a ""diplomatic means"" to bring the North to the negotiating table, the ministry said. She still placed emphasis on managing things ""sternly"" but in a ""cool-headed"" manner despite the tensions heightened by North Korea's recent bombastic rhetoric.The lawmakers, meanwhile, expressed concerns over the rising tensions in the wake of the North's continued provocations and emphasized that there shouldn't be a war again on the Korean Peninsula, the ministry said.They also reaffirmed their unwavering bipartisan support for peace and stability in the region. Some underlined the need to faithfully enforce U.N. sanctions, while at the same time trying to induce a change from inside the North by making outside information flow into the reclusive state. Sen. McCain, in particular, promised that he will provide every possible support in his capacity as chairman of the Senate armed services committee for South Korea to maintain deterrence strong enough to overwhelm the North's threats, according to the ministry.","congresswomen including rep nancy pelosi ,meetings in washington on tuesday ,2017 south korean foreign minister ,congresswomen including rep nancy ,of congresswomen including rep nancy","[""South Korea 's"", 'the United States', ""North Korea 's"", 'US', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Senate', 'the House of Representatives', 'Washington', 'Kang', 'Nancy Pelosi', 'the Representatives of House', 'John McCain', 'Senate', 'Associated Press', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'UN Security Council', 'UN', 'New York', 'Kang', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Kang', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.N.', 'McCain', 'Senate', 'South Korea']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11772591  0.44888753

If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won‘t be around much longer!”, Trump wrote.The bellicose rhetoric comes as international alarm mounts over Pyongyang’s weapons ambitions -- including a suggestion last week that the country is considering detonating an H-bomb over the Pacific.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov cautioned that a softer touch was needed to defuse the crisis.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei LavrovOnly “caresses, suggestion and persuasion” will work, Lavrov told Russia‘s NTV television in an interview that aired Sunday.If the US does not ease up, he said, “we could drop into a very unpredictable nosedive and tens if not hundreds of thousands of innocent citizens of South Korea but also North Korea, of course, and Japan will suffer-- and Russia and China are nearby.” Despite the heated exchanges, Lavrov said the United States would not take military action against North Korea because “they know for sure that it has nuclear bombs.” “I’m not defending North Korea. I‘m just saying that almost everyone agrees with such an analysis,” he said.Matching insult for insult, Trump and Korean leader Kim Jong-un have taken the standoff into bitter personal territory.Trump used his maiden speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday to warn that Washington would “totally destroy” the North if America or its allies were threatened.Pyongyang, which says it needs nuclear weapons to protect itself against the threat of a US invasion, responded on Friday with a rare personal rebuke from Kim, who called Trump “mentally deranged” and threatened the “highest level of hardline countermeasure in history.”North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho took things further. He, too, dismissed Trump as deranged, and said the US president’s threats had increased the chances of military confrontation.Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York that Trump‘s vow to destroy his country had made “our rockets’ visit to the entire US mainland all the more inevitable.”On the fringes of the UN meeting last week, Ri upped the tensions further, telling reporters Pyongyang might now consider detonating a hydrogen bomb outside its territory.Monitoring groups estimate that a nuclear test conducted in North Korea earlier this month had a yield of 250 kilotons, which is 16 times the size of the US bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.In a show of force, US B-1 bombers took off from the Pacific territory of Guam and flew over international waters off the east coast of North Korea, accompanied by F-15C fighters based in Okinawa, Japan.US bombers have carried out similar flights before, but the Pentagon stressed this was the furthest north of the Demilitarized Zone  between the two Koreas that any US fighter or bomber has flown off North Korea‘s coast in this century.“This mission is a demonstration of US resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said. “We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the US homeland and our allies.”Washington announced tougher restrictions Friday aimed at curbing North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, building on tough new UN sanctions aimed at choking Pyongyang of cash.US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the executive order “gives the Treasury more authorities than we‘ve ever had before.”“The president is very committed to blocking economic transactions and that’s what this is all about,” he said on CNN‘s “State of the Union” show.","washington spiking nuclear tensions ,insult trump and korean leader ,washington spiking nuclear tensions between ,trump vow to destroy ,washington announced tougher restrictions friday","['WASHINGTON', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'Trump', 'Pyongyang', 'russian', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'russian', 'Sergei LavrovOnly', 'Lavrov', 'Russia‘s NTV', 'US', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'China', 'Lavrov', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'I‘m', 'Trump', 'korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the United Nations General Assembly', 'Washington', 'America', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Kim', 'Trump', 'korean', 'Ri Yong - ho', 'Trump', 'US', 'Ri', 'the UN General Assembly', 'New York', 'US', 'UN', 'Ri', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Hiroshima', 'US', 'Guam', 'North Korea', 'Okinawa', 'Japan', 'US', 'Pentagon', 'Koreas', 'US', 'US', 'Pentagon', 'Dana White', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'UN', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Treasury', 'Steve Mnuchin', 'Treasury']",0,"[ 0.          0.          6.         ... -0.55345237  0.6921882

The event on the pleasant Sunday afternoon featured performances of Indonesia’s traditional ensemble music Gamelan and lion dance Reog, marking the launch of weekly music classes for students. “Harmony in Gamelan is created through the disciplined application of each percussion instrument,” said Indonesian Ambassador Umar Hadi in front of some 40 Koreans and other audience members. “The same principle applies to our life as well. Our life cannot operate outside the boundary of harmonious existence with others.”An artist performs a traditional Indonesian dance at the Indonesian Embassy in Seoul on Sept. 17, where Gamelan ensemble music and Reog dance were featured. Emcees of the event at the Indonesian Embassy in Seoul on Sept. 17, where Gamelan ensemble music and Reog dance were featured. Gamelan is predominantly made up of percussive instruments, including metallophone, kendhang, xylophone, bamboo flute, rebab and sindhen. The music predates the Hindu-Buddhist culture that thrived in Indonesia millennia ago, and developed into the current form during the Majapahit Empire from the late 13th to early 16th century. In modern times, Gamelan has influenced Western contemporary, romantic, avant-garde and jazz music as well as Japanese contemporary music, leaving its unmistakable melodies in the works of composers Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, Bela Bartok, John Cage, Don Cherry and Ryuichi Sakamoto, among numerous others. “I have played Gamelan for many years since I was young. Whenever I play the music, I feel replenished and mystified by its soothing sounds,” the envoy said. “Gamelan incorporates many philosophies and traditions of Indonesia, chiefly our national motto ‘unity in diversity.’ There are many varieties of Gamelan in Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan, and even in Java there are many different kinds of Gamelan music.”Describing his compatriots as a “lucky people” exposed to the country’s sundry musical traditions -- a nation comprised of some 17,000 islands spanning three time zones -- Hadi said, “Our contemporary cultures are becoming more diverse and complex, as cultures merge to create new hybrid cultures. I hope the Korean people’s experience in learning Gamelan would lead to more creative endeavors between our two countries.”At the venue, Indonesian traditional dance group Kelompok Tari Tradisional Indonesia, Gamelan-performing ensemble Laras Garis and a team of dancers in Korea, Reog Singo Mudho, showcased their music, following a lunch of traditional Indonesian dishes. Laras Garis has Korean players, who use Gamelan instruments owned by the embassy and several Indonesian communities and universities in Korea.The embassy initially opened one Gamelan class for learners, but due to the surging number of applicants, has decided to offer two classes on Saturday. Korean students who have studied in Indonesia through the government-sponsored Darmasiswa scholarship program also participated in the event.  Indonesian Ambassador Umar Hadi A tiger dance by Reog Singo Mudho “Indonesian is a relatively easy language to learn, because it uses an alphabet and its pronunciation is similar to English. The grammar is simple with no past, present and future tense,” Jun Hyo-bin, who studied in the city of Solo for a year through Darmasiswa, told The Korea Herald. “I went to Indonesia because it is a growing country with many possibilities. The market is still unpenetrated in many ways, and people love Korea thanks to the ‘Hallyu Korean Wave’ boom.”The one-year scholarship -- covering all the costs of education, housing and food -- is organized by Indonesia’s Ministry of National Education in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs, and has been offered to foreign students from countries with diplomatic ties to Indonesia since 1974. Students learn about the Southeast Asian country’s diverse cultures and language, encompassing art, music, dance, cuisine, philosophy and more.Twenty-eight Korean students were selected from a pool of about 100 applicants for the 2017-18 program, and have started their education at leading universities in and around Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Malang, Medan and Aceh, among others.Students taking Gamelan classes at the Indonesian Embassy Indonesian Ambassador Umar Hadi  with his spouse and Reog dancers For those interested in experiencing Indonesia through the scholarship, Jun advised them to “live like locals, riding motorcycles, eating on the streets and rubbing shoulders with the natives.”“Although Indonesians and people of Southeast Asia are passionate about Korea largely through our pop culture, our understanding of their cultures is skin-deep and shallow,” she said. “Koreans make up the largest foreign community in Indonesia. But if you go there without any preparation, the chance of failure in business is high. Mastering the language and understanding the culture are crucial.”By Joel Lee","weekly music classes for students ,classes on saturday korean students ,two classes on saturday korean ,launch of weekly music classes ,classes on saturday korean","['the Indonesian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'indonesian', 'korean', 'Gamelan', 'Indonesia', 'Gamelan', 'Reog', 'Harmony', 'Gamelan', 'indonesian', 'Umar Hadi', 'Koreans', 'indonesian', 'the Indonesian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Gamelan', 'Reog', 'the Indonesian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Gamelan', 'Reog', 'Gamelan', 'Hindu', 'Indonesia', 'the Majapahit Empire', 'Gamelan', 'japanese', 'Claude Debussy', 'Erik Satie', 'Bela Bartok', 'John Cage', 'Don Cherry', 'Ryuichi Sakamoto', 'Indonesia', 'Sumatra', 'Kalimantan', 'Java', 'Gamelan', 'Hadi', 'korean', 'Gamelan', 'indonesian', 'Kelompok Tari Tradisional Indonesia', 'Gamelan', 'Laras Garis', 'Korea', 'Reog Singo Mudho', 'indonesian', 'Laras Garis', 'korean', 'Gamelan', 'indonesian', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Indonesia', 'Darmasiswa', 'indonesian', 'Umar Hadi', 'Reog Singo', 'Indonesian', 'Jun Hyo - bin', 'Solo for a year', 'the Korea Herald', 'Indonesia', 'Korea', 'Indonesia', 'Ministry of National Education', 'the Department of Foreign Affairs', 'Indonesia', 'southeast asian', 'korean', 'Jakarta', 'Surabaya', 'Bandung', 'Malang', 'Medan', 'Aceh', 'Gamelan', 'Indonesian', 'indonesian', 'Umar Hadi', 'Reog', 'Indonesia', 'Jun', 'indonesian', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Indonesia', 'Joel Lee']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21728966  0.36249706

But she doesn’t usually tell acquaintances where she lives. “My friends gave me a mixed look of pity and concern when I said I live in a gosiwon,” Park, 22, told The Korea Herald. A 3.5-square-meter Goshiwon room in Sinchon, one of the university neighborhoods in Seoul, is furnished with a desk, bookshelf and bed. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldGosiwon are a form of low-cost, cocoon-like accommodation, usually larger rooms divided by thin walls and makeshift doors. Rooms are rented on a monthly basis, and are the cheapest and most flexible form of housing in a country where better options almost always require handsome deposits. Rooms are as tiny as 3.5 square meters and furnished with a desk, bookshelf and bed. If you are lucky, you get a small refrigerator in the room. But unless you pay for the luxury of a private shower or toilet, you will have to share one with up to 40 other tenants. “But you know, living in gosiwon should not be something frowned upon by others, because it may be someone’s last resort to get a place to live,” said Park who attends a university in Sinchon.She is one of 1.3 million young Koreans who live in gosiwon units, basement rooms or makeshift rooftop houses. Park said there are some perks living in a gosiwon than in a university dormitory, although she ended up in a gosiwon because of a failure to apply in time for the dorm last semester. “There are some benefits. The  rooms are cheaper and I do not have a curfew.”Gosiwon rooms generally cost 300,000 won  a month and come with a shared kitchen with complimentary rice and kimchi, although the food is often poor quality. “I do not eat the rice. Chinese rice is not delicious nor of good quality,” Park said, adding that she normally goes to a convenience store on the first floor to buy something to eat. Park’s room, which does not have a window, costs 200,000 won a month. The monthly rent goes up to 500,000 won for a room with a private bathroom and a window.“I wanted to save money for the next semester. It’s OK to live here even though I can clearly hear the man living next door fart and burp through the thin wall.” In one of the Goshiwon in Sinchon, each room is separated by walls and doors. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldGosiwon originally took off as a distraction-free housing option for students preparing for exams to become public servants and legal practitioners.Amid soaring housing prices here, however, gosiwon now function as living spaces for ordinary students, college graduates, or people on a tight budget who can’t afford to rent a house with a big deposit amount.Industry data shows that housing prices in major metropolitan cities continue to soar. Prices of homes in Seoul apartment complexes rose to 5.89 million won per square meter as of June.Even those who make it onto the property ladder can find themselves stuck. In Seoul and the surrounding area, 4 in 10 homeowners under 35 are house poor, according to Statistics Korea last year, meaning the cost of housing left them without enough money to meet the basic cost of living. In recent years, the popularity of gosiwon as living spaces has grown rapidly in areas near schools as well as office-packed areas in Seoul.“Not only students, but low-wage workers began seeking refuge in various forms of gosiwon,” said Hwang Kyu-seok, head of the Korean Gosiwon Society. “Even areas like Sillim or Noryangjin -- districts where academies for aspiring civil servants are located -- are seeing more nonstudent tenants than before,” he added. According to government data, there are at least 12,000 registered gosiwon across the country. About 7,000 of them are in Seoul.Due to their affordable prices, gosiwon have become a refuge for society’s most vulnerable, such as migrant workers, low-income earners and seniors with no family to rely on. Some of them die in their rooms and go unnoticed for weeks. In June, a man in his 50s was found dead in a gosiwon in Busan. It was reported that he had experienced economic hardship and that malnutrition may have caused his death. Police said that he seemed to have no family, friends or close relatives. In 2015, a 20-something woman was found dead in a gosiwon about two weeks after her death.Data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that the number of solitary deaths surpassed 1,245 in 2016, just five years after the figure hit 682 in 2011. Many of those deaths took place in gosiwon, police said. Civic activists demand the government come up with measures to support the house poor. “I hope the Moon Jae-in administration can provide a clear vision for the young house poor in the country, rather than focusing on policies to help prospective home buyers. Implementing practical measures to help them with housing will naturally solve social issues like late marriages and low birth rates,” said Lim Kyung-ji, chief of the Minsnail Union, a housing cooperative for young people. Kim Jin-ah, 22, who has lived in a gosiwon since she opted to live alone three years ago, said, “When it comes to other necessities of life, students can handle food and clothing, by doing part-time jobs. But we cannot really do anything about shelter.” But she doesn’t think her gosiwon life is bad. There are positive sides to it, she said, in keeping with the global fad for micro homes and minimal lifestyles. “Before, I thought living in a big house was a recipe for happiness. But now I know I can be happy, living in a small room,” said Kim.

It will be the first Olympics in South Korea since the 1988 Seoul Summer Games.In mid-March, China banned the sale of group tours to Seoul in retaliation against the installation of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in southeastern South Korea, which Beijing sees as a security threat.The move has sent the number of Chinese visitors to South Korea tumbling, hitting the local tourism industry hard. South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Lotte groups have taken a big hit in the wake of China's retaliation.Industry sources said the upcoming quadrennial sports showcase may improve the strained ties between economic powerhouses in Asia. During a summit in Berlin in July, South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to visit Seoul on the occasion of the Winter Games. Moon and Xi may ""make a decision"" to iron out the conflict over the missile defense system should the Chinese leader pay a visit to Seoul next year, they said.""We hope that the PyeongChang Games will serve as a chance to eliminate negative factors for the South Korean economy, such as China's retaliation against South Korea over the THAAD deployment and North Korea's nuclear risk,"" an industry watcher said. ""South Korean companies' active marketing activities during the games will likely help tide over the crisis.""China's retaliatory measures have dealt a harsh blow to South Korean companies. Hit hardest is retail giant Lotte Group that has invested more than 8 trillion won  in China.Lotte Group is now in negotiations with foreign companies to sell its discount store chain in China, having decided to withdraw from that market following Beijing's retaliation.About 80 percent of the 112 Lotte Mart stores in China have been closed for more than six months following a series of economic measures taken by China against Lotte's land-swap deal with the Seoul government to host the US missile defense system. Lotte Mart's damage is expected to reach 1 trillion won by the end of this year. Lotte exchanged its golf course in the southeastern county of Seongju, where the THAAD battery is now being installed, for a lot of land near the South Korean capital of Seoul.On the domestic market, Lotte's duty-free business has been floundering due to a tumble in the number of Chinese tourists.Lotte officials expected the upcoming Winter Olympics to come as an occasion for China to start relaxing its retaliatory measures.""The PyeongChang Games will be a global sports festival, so we hope they will serve as an opportunity to resolve conflicts and misunderstandings between countries,"" said an official of Lotte, an official sponsor of the Olympics.Lotte is not alone. Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. -- South Korea's top two automakers -- also want the Winter Games to become a turning point in Sino-Korean relations as the prolonged diplomatic tension has battered its operations there.""Hyundai and Kia will introduce their eco-friendly and self-driving technologies to Chinese athletes and tourists who are expected to visit South Korea during the games, thus refurbishing their image to consumers in China,"" a Hyundai Motor Group official said.Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, the flagships of the world's fifth-largest automaker Hyundai Motor Group, have been designated as domestic sponsors of the PyeongChang Games, and they plan to provide hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and self-driving cars for the Olympics.The hope comes amid their plunging sales in China. Hyundai and Kia sold a combined 576,974 vehicles in the world's largest car market in the first eight months of this year, down a whopping 44.7 percent from the same period a year earlier.Concerns are growing that the combined sales of Hyundai and Kia may drop below the 7 million mark this year, retreating to a level posted six years earlier.Despite rising hopes, some watchers offer a pessimistic outlook, saying the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may not help ease China's retaliation dramatically. ""There are no signs of China lifting its retaliatory measures that have been in place for more than six months,"" an industry source said. ""It may take a long time for things to return to normal even if China decides to end its retaliation.""","2018 pyeongchang winter olympics may ,the pyeongchang winter olympics may ,cars for the olympics ,the 2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,pyeongchang winter olympics may","['PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'China', 'US', 'PyeongChang', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Hyundai Motor', 'Lotte', 'China', 'Berlin', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Seoul', 'Xi', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'the PyeongChang Games', 'south korean', 'China', 'South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Lotte Group', 'China', 'Lotte Group', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Lotte Mart', 'China', 'China', 'Lotte', 'Seoul', 'US', ""Lotte Mart 's"", 'Seongju', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Lotte', 'chinese', 'Lotte', 'China', 'Lotte', 'Lotte', 'Hyundai Motor Co.', 'Kia Motors Corp.', ""South Korea 's"", 'sino - korean', 'Kia', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Hyundai Motor Group', 'Hyundai Motor', 'Kia Motors', 'Hyundai Motor Group', 'the PyeongChang Games', 'China', 'Hyundai', 'Kia', 'Hyundai', 'Kia', 'PyeongChang', 'China', 'China', 'China']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50883925  0.37855729

The written statement, which was released in English North Korea’s state newspaper Rodong Sinmun, vowed to consider the “highest-level” of countermeasures including options of military attack against the US. This marks the first time a North Korean leader has spoken first-hand on behalf of diplomatic purposes.The published statement, which was attached with a photo of Kim reciting a transcript, is viewed as a response to Trump’s speech on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly.  Kim Jong-un “Kim’s unprecedented move is a direct counter-response to Trump’s strong rhetoric portrayed through his recent UN assembly speech,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “It’s a diplomatic game of chicken between the two and an eye for an eye tactic by Kim. It also shows Kim is closely eyeing the reaction of the US and the international community,” he said. On Tuesday, Trump called Kim a “rocket man on a suicide mission” and claimed the US could “totally destroy” the rogue regime, in his maiden speech addressing the UN assembly. He also added he felt sorry for those who worked for the North’s current strongman. “Whatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire,” Kim warned. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho further elaborated on Kim’s statement by saying that his home country could consider a hydrogen bomb test on the Pacific Ocean, to the press outside his hotel in New York on Friday. Ri did not explain the details of the possible provocation and said Kim Jong-un was the decision-maker of such plans. The head of the North Korean delegation had previously compared Trump’s remarks to “the sound of a dog barking” and that the US President’s aides were “working for a dog” in front of the reporters who were waiting for his arrival in New York. The recent “war-of-words” between Kim and Trump echoes a similar exchange in August where the US president said the North will be met with “fire and fury” if it continues with its provocations against the international community. In clear defiance, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3 and fired a ballistic missile over Japan on Sept. 15. A government official here noted on Friday that the last time a North Korean leader issued a direct formal statement was in 1976 when North Korean soldiers murdered two US Army officers in the Joint Security Area near the inter-Korean border. The letter of apology was delivered under the name of then-North Korean leader and founder Kim Il-sung.By Jung Min-kyung","trump speech on tuesday ,trump speech on tuesday at ,north korean soldiers murdered two ,to trump speech on tuesday ,response to trump speech","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'US', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'English', 'North Korea ’s', 'Rodong Sinmun', 'US', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Trump ’s', 'the UN General Assembly', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim ’s', 'Trump ’s', 'UN', 'Kim Yong - hyun', 'north korean', 'Dongguk University', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'US', 'Trump', 'Kim', 'US', 'UN', 'North ’s', 'US', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Ri Yong - ho', 'Kim', 'New York', 'Ri', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Trump ’s', 'US', 'New York', 'Kim', 'Trump', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'US Army', 'the Joint Security Area', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Jung Min - kyung']",2,"[ 0.          8.          0.         ... -0.21733634  0.36045885

Two years later, the new decade saw the completion of the Seoul-Busan expressway -- a project personally overseen by late President Park Chung-hee and often considered a milestone in Korea’s industrialization. Since then, the network of highways have expanded to over 4,000 kilometers, and nearly 700 kilometers of new and extensions will be added by 2024. While the primary function of expressways is to facilitate the movement of vehicles, they have become a major industry in their own right.The Jungang Expressway near Danyang, North Chgungcheong Province. According to Korea Expressway Corporation, the state-run body that manages most of the expressways, there were more than 4.2 million highway journeys each day last year. The figure comes to over 1.5 billion journeys a year, raising over 4 trillion won  in toll fees. In addition, the rest stops – now numbering over 170 – employ thousands of people across the nation, and serve as retail and logistics hubs in areas that would otherwise have little commercial activities. For travelers, rest areas provide welcome breaks from journeys that can take unreasonably long for such a small country. Although the distance from Seoul to Busan comes in at just under 400 kilometers, the average duration of the journey came to about 7.5 hours during last year’s Chuseok holidays. “I used to love stopping at rest areas. It was great just begin able to run around after having spent what seemed to be forever in the back of my father’s car with my brother,” 40-year old Kim Min-sung said, recalling his childhood trips to his father’s hometown of Daegu.“I don’t think there were so many  back then, and my brother and I would start begging our parents to stop at every single one soon as we set out.”With increasing traffic and the number of rest areas, and rising living standards of Koreans, the role of such establishments have also changed.Long gone are the days when rest areas were far and between, and offered basic services.Many rest areas now include a range of retail stores, as well as specialty restaurants and entertainment. “There are some rest areas where they sell particularly good regional specialties like walnut cookies, and I have driven to a rest stop just to get a snack,” Joo Ha-yun, a 27-year old IT worker said.“There is a rest area with a dog park that is on a whole different scale in Gyeonggi Province, and I have also driven there just to play with my dog for the day.”South Korea’s expressways themselves sometime provide the stage to scenes not often seen elsewhere. Like the city roads, the expressways are not free from the nation’s notorious traffic jams, and at times and locations of slow traffic, opportunistic merchants lie in wait. Some arrange their wares -- ranging from children’s toys to wood carvings -- on the sides of the roads, while bolder entrepreneurs can often be seen venturing out to the lanes to walk in between the cars.

Choe Son-hui  Earlier this month, North Korea carried out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test yet and test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, which resulted in an angry backlash from the rest of the world.In his address to the United Nations General Assembly earlier this week, US President Donald Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" the North Korean regime, prompting North Korea to vow Friday to take the ""highest level"" action in response. The upcoming talks come in addition to a series of previous North Korea-Russia consultations.The Russian ambassador, serving as Russia's deputy nuclear negotiator, visited North Korea in late July to discuss issues involving the Korean Peninsula, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. On Monday, Choe met with Russian Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora in Pyongyang as part of the continued discussions. Russia has been unusually vocal in its call for a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear issue amid a growing war of words between Pyongyang and Washington. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned during the ongoing UN assembly Thursday that an excessive military response to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests would lead to disaster.Earlier this month, American chief envoy on the North Korean issue Joseph Yun was invited to Russia to discuss the issue with his Russian counterpart there.","russia next week to discuss ,north korea to vow friday ,next week to discuss security ,russia deputy nuclear negotiator visited ,deputy nuclear negotiator visited north","['north korean', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Oleg Burmistrov', 'Russia', 'north american', ""North Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'the United Nations General Assembly', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'russian', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'russian', 'North Korea', 'Alexander Matsegora', 'Pyongyang', 'Russia', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'russian', 'Sergey Lavrov', 'UN', ""North Korea 's"", 'american', 'north korean', 'Joseph Yun', 'Russia', 'russian']",10,"[ 0.          4.          2.         ... -0.56398934  0.81082374

They were written and stretched in 3-D and formed together in a cylinder shape.PyeongChang's organizing committee said the medals were also inspired by the texture of tree trunks, as trees represent the work put into developing Korean culture and the Olympic Games. Medals to be awarded at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics are presented at a ceremony in Seoul on Sept. 21, 2017.

Parents of the infant, who was hospitalized for urinary stone treatment at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital in western Seoul, found what appears to be a tiny insect floating inside the plastic bag connected to the child, at around 8 p.m. Sunday. It was about 14 hours after the young patient began receiving fluids from it.  The administration was stopped immediately and the child was put under close medical observation, undergoing several tests, the hospital said. As of Tuesday morning, there is no sign of a potential impact on the patient’s conditions, it added. The hospital reported the case to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for further investigation. In the meantime, it has banned the administration of such IV bag products to patients, it said. Families of the patient blamed hospital staff for negligence and a flawed hygiene management of the medical equipment. The hospital, however, put the blame to the manufacturer of the IV bag or the needle, suspecting that the insect may have gotten inside during the manufacturing process. It is nearly impossible for the insect to find its way through the needle and end up in a sealed IV bag, it claimed. Both the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and the hospital said there has been no reported case of an insect found inside an IV bag.

Mexico is Korea’s top trade partner in Latin America, while Korea is Mexico’s sixth-largest trade partner worldwide. Over 1,600 Korean companies operate in the Mexican market of $1.5 trillion, increasingly in innovative projects, the envoy highlighted. Kia Motors opened a new production facility in Mexico in September last year, and the first Mexican industrial investment transpired in the city of Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, with the launch of a steel dust recycling plant in June.Since July, a new direct flight connecting Mexico City and Seoul has also begun.

The ASEAN Culture House was established to correct any imbalance in our exchanges, and demonstrates our sincere efforts to understand ASEAN,” said Lee Si-hyung, who has taken helm of the public diplomacy institution since May last year, in an interview. “All in all, ASEAN is becoming an increasingly important partner for South Korea and has eagerly absorbed our culture, products and everything in between. It is high time for Koreans to ponder whether we have reciprocated such generosity shown by the ASEAN people.” The Korea Foundation, under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been tasked with managing the operation of the edifice located in Busan’s Haeundae District. The building was borne out of cooperation with the Busan municipal government. While the role of the foundation is to promote Korea around the world, including in Southeast Asia, the new institute is designed to strengthen and uplift Korea’s understanding of the region, according to the foundation.  Korea Foundation President Lee Si-hyung Encompassing exhibition galleries, a concert hall, a seminar room and other spaces over six floors, the facility is the largest of its kind outside the ASEAN region, and also the first in the world built by a national government. The opening of the building coincides with the ASEAN-Korea Cultural Exchange Year of 2017. Exhibitions will offer visitors easy access to the region’s distinctly unique cultures, he said, mentioning that various lectures and forums are designed to help create links between Koreans and ASEAN nationals from Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Currently, an exhibition titled “Celebrating the Beauty of Marriage -- Viewing ASEAN through the Culture of Marriage,” is underway through Dec. 3; documentary films will be screened from Thursday to Sunday in collaboration with the EBS International Documentary Festival; a series of lectures on ASEAN members’ histories and societies will be organized from October to November; and a networking platform for ASEAN and Korean students in the Gyeongsang provinces, dubbed “ASEAN-Korea Futurist,” will be hosted. “ASEAN is a multicultural, multiethnic and multireligious region,” Lee explained, citing the ancient Cambodian temple complex Angkor Wat that fused Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as Singapore’s system of categorizing its different Chinese, Malay, Indian and other ethnicities. ASEAN’s motto, “unity in diversity,” reflects its disparate political and economic systems, ranging from democracy to monarchy and military government, as well as from developing economies to developed ones, he said. Furthermore, the regional bloc’s decision-making is done through constant consultation, dubbed “the ASEAN way,” emphasizing consensus-building and political noninterference. “ASEAN’s political process may appear slower and its scope of cooperation may look smaller than the European Union’s, but it contributes to a stable process of integration,” he said. In the realm of economy, ASEAN is emerging as an economic powerhouse by capitalizing on its location that encompasses the world’s busiest maritime corridor in the Indo-Pacific region between China and India, chiefly the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea. “In a geopolitical context, it is a region where global powers’ interests converge, most notably those of China and the US. In regard to the Korean Peninsula, ASEAN can play a mediating role by using its diplomatic ties with North Korea. Thus it has the potential to shape the region’s security landscape,” the former career diplomat said. The ASEAN Culture House in Busan Lee was South Korea’s ambassador and permanent representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development from 2013-2015; deputy minister for trade at the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade from 2011-2013, during which he was also the G-20 ambassador; and ambassador to Poland from 2006-2009. ASEAN, whose combined population is 640 million with an economy of $2.5 trillion, has become Korea’s second-largest trade partner after China, Lee noted. He added that shrinking trade with China and Hallyu’s waning popularity there resulting from Beijing’s alleged retaliation against the deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in Korea has been offset by increasing commercial exchanges with ASEAN. “Korea’s perception of ASEAN as a merely cheap production site using low-cost labor needs to be transformed,” the president asserted, adding a deeper understanding would foster untapped opportunities in Southeast Asia’s young, dynamic and growing market. “Many migrants from ASEAN who have settled in Korea or are working here are mitigating our demographic decline, as our population shrinks and ages. They also play prominent roles in diverse areas of our society.”Lee added that racial prejudices against people and cultural practices of ASEAN are still prevalent in Korean society. Korea’s previous efforts at integrating outsiders have been lopsided, focusing on assimilating them rather than respecting their own cultures. “Now is the time to foster true multiculturalism in Korea, where different cultures can coexist harmoniously,” the bureaucrat urged. “To advance our society democratically, it is imperative to learn more about ASEAN. With society-wide participation, the ASEAN Culture House will be able to fulfill its role as a solid bridge of friendship and communication between the two regions.”By Joel Lee","asean korea cultural exchange year ,foster true multiculturalism in korea ,southeast asians said the president ,president of korea foundation urging ,futurist will be hosted asean","['the ASEAN Culture House', 'Busan', 'Southeast Asians', 'Korea Foundation', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'the ASEAN Culture House', 'ASEAN', 'Lee Si - hyung', 'ASEAN', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'ASEAN', 'the Korea Foundation', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Busan ’s Haeundae District', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea Foundation', 'Lee Si - hyung', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Koreans', 'ASEAN', 'Brunei', 'Cambodia', 'Indonesia', 'Laos', 'Indonesia', 'Myanmar', 'Philippines', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Vietnam', 'the Culture of Marriage', 'the EBS International Documentary Festival', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'korean', 'Gyeongsang', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Lee', 'cambodian', 'Angkor Wat', 'Singapore', 'Chinese', 'Malay', 'indian', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'the European Union ’s', 'ASEAN', 'the Indo - Pacific region', 'China', 'India', 'China', 'US', 'ASEAN', 'North Korea', 'the ASEAN Culture House', 'Busan Lee', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade', 'Poland', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'China', 'Lee', 'China', 'Hallyu ’s', 'Beijing', 'the US', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'the ASEAN Culture House', 'Joel Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62746894  0.61282003

As part of that effort, a public diplomacy delegation composed of South Korean college students staged a variety of cultural performances and events last month in the Visegrad Four countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia -- a region traditionally active in the winter sports games. They included a flash mob in the Czech Republic featuring the South Korean traditional hanbok garment and folk song Arirang as well as the youth pubic diplomacy delegation's street march in Prague, donned in hanbok and Olympics T-shirts.In May, the South Korean Embassy in Nigeria also hosted a local drawing contest featuring the PyeongChang Winter Olympics while Kim Hyoung-zhin, South Korean ambassador to the European Union, joined a marathon in Brussels dressed in a PyeongChang Olympics T-shirt.  Back in Seoul, dozens of foreign journalists, producers and bloggers were invited to tour major Olympics facilities in PyeongChang in June as well as key cultural sites in Gangwon Province, home to the host city. The foreign ministry said the string of public diplomacy events would help shape friendly images of South Korea and the approaching sports games as well as enhancing South Korea's friendship with foreign countries. South Korea plans to continue to hold cultural events for the Olympics at home and abroad to help with a successful hosting of the sports event, including invitations of foreign leaders to South Korea during the Olympics, according to the ministry.One key point of the ministry's Olympic diplomacy will be the United Nations General Assembly's conventional adoption of a resolution calling for a so-called Olympic truce ahead of a regular Olympic event, which is expected to take place in November for the upcoming games.

Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile Friday, just three days after the UN passed economic sanctions over the regime’s sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3  Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. YonhapSince North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, the UN has passed a total of 10 resolutions targeting North Korea‘s economic activities related to nuclear ambition. The latest one, adopted after Pyongyang’s sixth nuclear test, cleared the UN in the shortest amount of time since 2006.“Such  record of caution by the UN Security Council clearly demonstrated  strong and firm will of the international community to deter North Korea from possessing nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities,” Ban said. Ban was one of the speakers addressing the 10th Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference held in Seoul. Among those who attended were South Korean Army’s chief of staff Gen. Kim Yong-woo and his US counterpart Gen. Mark A. Milley.Chinese People’s Liberation Army has also sent its delegate – Lt. Gen. You Haitao. He is the first Chinese senior military officer to join South Korea’s security seminar since South Korea and the US agreed to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system on the peninsula last year.Describing North Korea’s nuclear threat as the most “urgent and grave” threat in the region, the participants stressed the need for a firm response to North Korea and vowed to enhance multilateral ties to resolve the security crisis. “We will work with the international community to come up with a strong response toward North Korea … North Korea should realize that dialogue and cooperation, not nukes and missiles, are the only means to protect its security and guarantee a bright future,” President Moon Jae-in said via a video message. In a closed-door session, Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, commander of the US Forces Korea, and security scholars from Seoul and Washington discussed ways to enhance partnership among ground forces in the Pacific region. Among the participants are Choi Young-jin, South Korea‘s former ambassador to the US; Shin Beom-chul, professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy; and Michael O’Hanlon, a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institution.Scheduled to run through Thursday, the event brought together army chiefs of staff and senior commanders from 29 Indo-Asia-Pacific countries.

A North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile is seen ready to take off in an image captured from video footage released by North Korea’s state media on Saturday. The missile was launched in the early hours of Friday.The Hwasong-12 is a 16-meter long, liquid-fueled, intermediate-range ballistic missile. Although its first test, a disastrous failure, dates back to April 5, the missile came under scrutiny of outside experts only in May, when it was unveiled to the public in a military parade. The North is believed to have conducted several test launches of the rocket since then, but most ended in failure and were not officially announced afterwards. Then, on Aug. 28, the North fired it over Japan. It was the first time that a North Korean missile flew over Japan. Then came Friday’s launch and Saturday’s declaration of it being operationally ready. “The combat power of Hwasong-12 has been realized,” Kim was quoted as saying by the nation’s official Korea Central News Agency. “As recognized by the whole world, we have made all these achievements despite the UN sanctions that have lasted for decades.” Military officials and experts here explain the comments mean Pyongyang will soon mass produce and deploy them. “Most serious missile to watch”In early August, Pyongyang had threatened to create, with Hwasong-12 missiles, an “enveloping fire” near Guam. It later backpedaled from the threat, saying it would decide after “watching the behavior of the US.” Before Hwasong-12, Musudan missiles, or Hwasong-10s, were the North’s means to contain the US territory in the Pacific Ocean, where some high-profile US strategic assets are deployed in case of an emergency on the Korean Peninsula. The Musudan, however, is widely perceived by experts here as a failure. In Friday’s test launch, the Hwasong-12 traveled 3,700 kilometers, demonstrating that Guam is well within its range. It was the country’s longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile. “It is feared that the North may now have the capacity to strike Guam, although not the US mainland,” a source at the South’s military said.Experts say the recent launches do represent a disturbing development: The missiles lifted off at a normal angle as in real operational conditions, not at a lofted angle as in previous tests. Another key development is enhanced mobility. Photos of the launch, released Saturday by the North’s daily Rodong Sinmun, showed that the Hwasong-12 was lifted off directly from a truck-mounted launcher. South Korean military had earlier said the launch site was near Pyongyang‘s Sunan airport. In previous tests, the North had moved a missile with the transport erector launcher, or TEL, but offloaded and placed it onto a separate launch pad before firing it. A road-mobile missile makes it more difficult for enemies to detect and respond. “After blastoff, the vehicle used looked intact. The North appears to have solved technical problems it faced earlier,” Yang Wook, a senior researcher of the Korea Defense and Security Forum, was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency. “The mobility of the Hwasong-12 has been advanced and it appears to be the most serious North Korean weapon to watch.” Despite the enhanced range and mobility, some experts still doubt whether the missile can really deliver in an actual combat, citing lingering questions over its accuracy and re-entry technology. David Albright, the founder and president of the non-governmental Institute for Science and International Security, said it is difficult to say that Hwasong-12 is a missile with high accuracy at the current stage of development. It’s more equipped to attack an area with condensed population rather than a small military base, he said on Radio Free Asia, adding that its circular error probable, or the distance by which a missile can miss its target, is estimated to be 5 to 10 kilometers. He also said it is difficult to extract from the latest test whether the missile has a re-entry vehicle needed to return a warhead from space to the atmosphere to hit the intended target.What next? For the past five months at least, the Hwasong-12 has been the main focus of North Korea’s weapons program. Between the first test launch in April and Friday, the regime launched 11 missiles. Six of them were Hwasong-12s, local broadcaster KBS reported, although early tests were officially classified by military intelligence here as “having involved an unknown projectile.” Now that the Hwasong-12 has been declared operationally ready, the North is likely to shift its focus to Hwasong-14, which Pyongyang claims as its first intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the US mainland. Kim on Saturday also indicated more missile tests would be forthcoming, saying all future drills should be “meaningful and practical ones for increasing the combat power of the nuclear force” to establish an order in the deployment of nuclear warheads for “actual war.”The North first test-fired Hwasong-14 in July. On Sept. 3, the regime conducted its sixth and largest underground nuclear detonation which it claimed was a test of a hydrogen bomb that can be fitted onto an ICBM. The North said it was a “perfect success.”","korean missile flew over japan ,friday test launch the hwasong ,north first test fired hwasong ,saturday the missile was launched ,before hwasong 12 musudan missiles","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Japan', 'Hokkaido', 'Guam', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'South Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Japan', 'Kim', 'Korea Central News Agency', 'UN', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Guam', 'US', 'Musudan', 'Hwasong-10s', 'North ’s', 'US', 'US', 'Musudan', 'Guam', 'Guam', 'US', 'North ’s', 'Rodong Sinmun', 'south korean', 'TEL', 'Yang Wook', 'the Korea Defense and Security Forum', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'north korean', 'David Albright', 'Institute for Science and International Security', 'Radio Free Asia', 'North Korea ’s', 'KBS', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Kim', 'North']",2,"[ 0.          4.          4.         ... -0.31109041  0.28704911

Most of the damage caused by the downpours, or 230 cases, were reported there. Busan Small buildings collapsed and some 600 elementary, middle and high schools as well as 400 kindergartens were closed. Soil at a construction site was washed away, damaging six cars. At least nine people were rescued after they were trapped in waterlogged buildings or cars. Seven major roads were temporarily shut down.Some 210 national parks were restricted from access, and 15 flights were canceled. No deaths were reported. Heavy showers, which began to batter the southern region early Monday morning, continued through the early afternoon. All the heavy rain warnings in seven cities were lifted as of 12:30 p.m. A heavy rain warning is issued when a region is expected to receive more than 110 mm of rain in six hours or more than 180 mm of rain in 12 hours. As of noon, Geoje had received the most rainfall of 308 mm, followed by Tongyeong at 273 mm and Busan with 263.2 mm. Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province were not affected.After the unexpected downpour, the weather agency came under fire for its failure to predict the rainfall and its botched response. The weather agency initially forecast more than 30 mm of rain to fall per hour, totaling some 150 mm in southern regions. Text messages were belatedly sent to citizens to notify them of the restricted roads in Busan, hours after the restriction was lifted. Regional education offices informed students that schools would be temporarily closed at around 8:10 a.m., after some students had already left for school. The KMA cited the high temperature and humidity, coupled with low atmospheric pressure, as the reason behind the heavier than expected rainfall. According to a 2017 report from the Board of Audit and Inspection, Korea’s weather agency got about 46 percent of predictions accurate between 2012 and 2015.","korea on monday flooding streets ,rain warnings in seven cities ,afternoon all the heavy rain ,heavy rain warnings in seven ,korea on monday flooding","['Korea', 'Busan Geoje', 'Tongyeong', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Busan', 'Jeolla', 'Gyeongsang', 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Busan', 'Geoje', 'Tongyeong', 'Busan', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Busan', 'KMA', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36465973  0.15777637

The 170-meter section of the 1.1-kilometer wall had been occupied by the British Embassy here for nearly 60 years. It displays traditional South Korean architecture meeting the beauty of fall foliage. An abandoned oil reserve base in Mapo, northwestern Seoul, was recently re-created into a “cultural reserve base,” an eco-friendly park housing several cultural infrastructures. The oil depot now houses a concert hall and exhibition center. An underground military bunker in Yeouido, South Korea’s main financial district, is also a unique spot where Seoul transformed a forgotten war venue into a modern art space for locals. It had been off-limits to the public since the 1970s and its reopening this month is expected to draw many curious visitors. The map also recommends a stroll on the overpass-turned-park Seoullo 7017, which received over 3 million visitors by its 100th day open.

His mother and brother, who he left behind in Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine, are among thousands on a perilous journey -- either on foot or by boat -- to flee what they call “ethnic cleansing” in the nation.   Ishaque Mohamed poses for a photo with his 7-year-old child Rayyan Mohamed in front of the Seoul Central Mosque in Itaewon, Seoul, Friday. “I cannot do anything but be stuck at home watching news on Rohingya people,” the 51-year-old said in an interview with The Korea Herald near the Seoul Central Mosque in Itaewon. When he last talked to his mother and brother Wednesday, they were preparing to cross into Bangladesh through mountains. They said they would contact him once they had arrived in Bangladesh. “Houses were burned down. People were raped and killed. It should be stopped,” Mohamed said, citing what his friends and family back home had told him. “Only those weak, old or sick, who are unable to travel for long have stayed behind in Rakhine.” So far, an estimated nearly 300,000 Rohingya refugees, mostly women and children, have fled to Bangladesh to seek shelter since the outbreak of conflicts on Aug. 25, according to the United Nations. Violence erupted when the Myanmar Army launched a counteroffensive called “clearance operation” on Rohingya insurgents who first attacked the border police. Those who fled Rakhine describe village burnings, beatings, gang rape and mass killings in the hands of the country’s security forces and the region’s Buddhists.Many of the refugees are stranded near rivers and on mountains, unable to cross but afraid to return home. The Myanmar government rejects the claims, saying Rohingya residents are burning their own houses to earn sympathy from the international community. The military is fighting against Rohingya “terrorists,” it says. Rohingya militants in Myanmar on Sunday declared a unilateral ceasefire. But the government rejected the overture, saying it would not negotiate with ""terrorists.""Ishaque Mohamed Mohamed left his native country long ago. He escaped Myanmar in fear of political persecution by Myanmar’s military regime after he participated in a pro-democracy movement in 1988 as a student. After fleeing Myanmar, Mohamed lived in Bangladesh for 12 years. He smuggled himself to Korea in 2000 via a container ship from India. It was the first available ship that was able to get him out of Bangladesh. Working illegally part-time at factories, he applied for asylum in 2003 and was granted refugee status in 2006. He now lives with his family -- his wife and three children who flew here from Rakhine in 2007 -- and runs his own business. His is among only two Rohingya families known to have settled here. The Justice Ministry does not keep relevant data. “Rohingya Muslims are not terrorists. We are just taking action for our human rights. My father and my father’s father have lived in Myanmar for generations. How can the government deny our existence?” Mohamed posed. A Muslim ethnic minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, the Rohingya are described by the UN as “the world’s most persecuted minority.” There were some 1.1 million Rohingya people living in Myanmar, with most of them in Rakhine state. Since the military junta under Gen. Ne Win came to power in 1962, Myanmar has carried out a policy of Burmanization to bolster the majority Burmese ethnic identity and Buddhism. As a result, Rohingya people were treated as illegal immigrants and denied citizenship. When Mohamed was in Myanmar, he had revered Aung San Suu Kyi, now the country’s de facto leader. She was like a motherly figure for pro-democracy activists and students, including himself. Suu Kyi was under house arrest for years for her pro-democracy activism and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. But Mohamed said that he has been disappointed by Suu Kyi. “We expected Aung San Suu Kyi to solve human rights violations faced by Rohingya people when she came to power, but the situation only deteriorated,” he said. “Before we are Rohingya people, we are human beings. I don’t understand why the human rights activist doesn’t care about our human rights.”Mohamed called for the international community to help put an end to the ongoing conflicts between Rohingya residents and the Myanmarese government. “I hope that the Korean government also speaks up for Rohingya people‘s human rights.”Mohamed suggested that the Justice Ministry invite Rohingya families to Korea and give them permanent settlement as part of its refugee resettlement program. Through a three-year pilot program, the government has accepted 86 Myanmarese refugees, but they were not Rohingya Muslims. “What we want is a nationality and our human rights protected while living with other Myanmar citizens,” he said. “I was born in Myanmar, I was brought up in Myanmar. I am a Myanmar citizen. I want to live in Myanmar one day when peace comes.”","militants in myanmar on sunday ,000 rohingya refugees mostly women ,he escaped myanmar in fear ,student after fleeing myanmar mohamed ,86 myanmarese refugees but they","['Rohingya Muslims', 'Myanmar', 'Ishaque Mohamed', 'South Korea', 'Myanmar', 'Rakhine', 'Ishaque Mohamed', 'Rayyan Mohamed', 'the Seoul Central Mosque', 'Itaewon', 'Seoul', 'Rohingya', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Seoul Central Mosque', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladesh', 'Mohamed', 'Rakhine', 'Bangladesh', 'the United Nations', 'the Myanmar Army', 'Rohingya', 'Rakhine', 'buddhist', 'Myanmar', 'Rohingya', 'Rohingya', 'Rohingya', 'Myanmar', 'Mohamed Mohamed', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Mohamed', 'Bangladesh', 'Korea', 'India', 'Bangladesh', 'Rakhine', 'Rohingya', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Rohingya Muslims', 'Myanmar', 'Mohamed', 'Muslim', 'Rohingya', 'UN', 'Rohingya', 'Myanmar', 'Rakhine', 'Ne Win', 'Myanmar', 'Burmese', 'Rohingya', 'Myanmar', 'Mohamed', 'Suu Kyi', 'Rohingya', 'Rohingya', 'Rohingya', 'myanmarese', 'korean', 'Rohingya', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Rohingya', 'Korea', 'myanmarese', 'Rohingya Muslims', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar', 'Myanmar']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68084627  0.73193884

The scale of the annual event has doubled since 2012, when it was first launched with participants from 15 countries and two international organizations. This year, the number has increased to 37 countries and three international organizations. SDD is Korea’s only high-level multilateral security dialogue and has developed into one of the top three security dialogues in Asia along with Shangri-la Dialogue and China’s Xiangshang Forum. However, there is still a long way to go. SDD will have to aim for a role in a unified Korean Peninsula as its long-term goal, but for the short run, it will have to deeply consider its direction during the five-year term of President Moon Jae-in.  Hwang Jae-ho, a professor of International Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.First, SDD needs to make full use of its platform capability. The Korean government has recently established the Korea-ASEAN Vice Defense Ministers’ Dialogue and has hosted multiple meetings such as Korea-Africa, Korea-Mekong, UN PKO contributors, Korea-V4 . Such meetings can be incorporated into SDD as special sessions. For instance, discussions on military interchange and defense cooperation can be carried out under the title of Korea-ASEAN defense cooperation. Korea should strengthen military ties with middle powers in addition to its relations with US, China, Japan, and Russia. Beside the existing MIKTA countries , other significant middle power countries like Canada, Vietnam, Italy and Saudi Arabia should be added to the club of MIKTA.SDD needs to clearly differentiate itself from other security dialogues. The dialogue should select a theme more related to its home region. If Shangri-la Dialogue is specialized in the South China Sea issue, SDD should focus more on the North Korean crisis. The main theme of the sixth SDD, “Visions for Security Cooperation in an Era of Uncertainty” was appropriate with US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un becoming more engaged in a war of words and North Korea’s ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons posing a threat to South Korea, US and Japan. However, it was not enough to address the immediate threats faced by the region. The theme should focus more on the North Korean issue in the future. SDD should give the impression that officials can update their security information related to the Korean Peninsula only when they actually attend the meeting. For the first time this year, SDD had an official from the US Department of Defense to brief proven facts. It could be good for the dialogue to include a closed briefing session for representatives to share information on North Korea. SDD can also either create one main session in which many nations interested in North Korea can participate or have several special sessions on specific issues such as North Korea’s internal problems, ballistic missile capabilities and nuclear threats. A shift from quantity to quality is needed. This year, for the first time, SDD included discussions on the influence of the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ on weapons system and warfare and the effects of future warfare on states’ defense policies. Although these are appropriate and important topics, work is needed to give them have more Korean colors. More specific topics need to be covered. For example, participants can discuss on the North Korean issue, Korea-China-Japan defense cooperation, military build-up on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia as well as confidence building measures in the region. Cyber security and maritime security which are already regularly discussed should include military implications for Northeast Asia and Korea. SDD should be able to lead the security discourse. It should select and dominate creative issues. It would be good to invite military strategists or theorists who have deep understandings of military security trends to lead the discussions.The content and suggestions discussed in the sessions should be able to be incorporated into policies. Discussions should not only be focused on issues such as North Korean missile threats but they should also cover possible solutions and policy responses. Sessions can be organized together with relevant countries to select a topic that can help achieve joint performance or coordinate policies. SDD should naturally induce interest and participation of related countries instead of forcing attention. The Chinese military delegation did not attend the dialogue both this year and last year due to the ongoing tussle over South Korea’s deployment of the US’ Thermal High Altitude Area Defense system. SDD should not beg for participation of those who are not willing to come. Instead, the dialogue should create its own charm to make them feel that they are losing voice and are harming their national interests. The scale of SDD has grown but it is important to fill it up with good content.

During the Seoul Defense Dialogue 2017, senior diplomats, military generals and security scholars called for enhanced multilateral cooperation, while stressing the need to prepare a “contingency plan” against a North Korean miscalculation.The annual security forum came amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula following the North’s sixth and largest nuclear test Sunday and its persistent threats to launch nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles capable of hitting the contiguous US. “In order to respond to North Korea’s nuclear weapons threatening South Korea, Northeast Asia and the world, we need to maximize our sanctions and military deterrence,” said South Korea’s Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon in his speech at the opening ceremony held in Westin Chosun Hotel in Seoul Also in attendance were Defense Minister Song Young-moo, Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne, Daniel Russel, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, who now serves as a senior researcher at the Asia Society Policy Institute, and about 500 delegates from 38 countries. Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam  speaks at Seoul Defense Dialogue, a three-day security forum hosted by the Ministry of National Defense, in central Seoul on Thursday. YonhapLim Sung-nam, South Korea’s first vice minister of foreign affairs, said it is not the time for dialogue with North Korea, adding that South Korea and its regional partners should beef up pressure against North Korea. Highlighting that the “ball is in Pyongyang’s court,” the vice minister urged North Korea to suspend its nuclear and missile provocations and join denuclearization talks, while demanding regional stakeholders work toward changing North Korea’s strategic calculations. “It is time to tighten the screws on North Korea with a view to forcing the regime to change its strategic calculation. … If Pyongyang makes the right choice, we stand ready to offer a brighter future and the window of a new opportunity can be open for them.”Markus Garlauskas, a US intelligence officer working on North Korea at the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned against the possibility of “multiple contingencies” in North Korea, which could end up with the “devastating failure” of deterring the North. Noting that North Korea is inching closer to securing reliable ICBM capabilities that could allow it to attack the US mainland, Garlauskas stressed the need for a “realistic assessment” of North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile capabilities. “We must be mindful that North Korea is adaptive, but also change could come quickly, unexpectedly,” he said. “We must be clear-eyed about the potential for miscalculation and how dangerous North Korea could prove in such a scenario.”Thomas W. Bergeson, deputy commander of the US Forces in Korea and commander of the 7th Air Force, highlighted the importance of “credible deterrence” against North Korea by maintaining joint military exercises with Asian allies. Describing North Korea’s latest nuclear test as a “slap in the face,” the three-star general vowed to maintain a robust readiness posture against North Korea to prevent possible miscalculation from the reclusive regime. Begerson also highlighted the importance of diplomatic approaches to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea, saying that the US military would work toward bringing North Korea “to its senses,” not “bringing them to their knees.”  Australia’s Defense Minister Maries Payne. YonhapNorth Korea’s latest provocations have prompted calls for its main ally China to play a bigger role to rein in its wayward neighbor. Beijing has appeared reluctant to join efforts out of fear that destabilizing North Korea would undermine stability of its cross-border region.Jia Qingguo, a professor of international studies at Peking University, said North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear armament is “suicidal,” calling for the regime to abandon its nuclear ambition and for regional partners to come up with a contingency plan against the North. “More and more  think North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapon poses an incredible threat to peace and security of the world and China’s own security,” he said. “We hope that North Korea’s leader would see the light to change his current practice … currant path is suicidal.”Australia’s Defense Minister Maries Payne said the country is prepared to pursue “stronger sanctions” against North Korea. “The key now is not only to ensure that existing measures are implemented -- in full -- by all members of the international community,” Payne said in a keynote speech. “We must also consider further strong measures to place additional pressure on the regime to change its destructive course.”","largest nuclear test sunday ,korean miscalculation the annual security ,nuclear armament is suicidal calling ,sanctions against north korea denouncing ,north korea nuclear weapons threatening","['North Korea', 'north korean', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Lee Nak - yeon', 'Westin Chosun Hotel', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Song Young', 'australian', 'Defense', 'Marise Payne', 'Daniel Russel', 'East asian', 'the Asia Society Policy Institute', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'Seoul Defense Dialogue', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'Seoul', 'YonhapLim Sung - nam', 'South Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'North Korea', 'the Defense Intelligence Agency', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Garlauskas', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'W.

The remark came in a late-night phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, which capped a long day of trying to rally leaders of major powers against the North’s fast-advancing nuclear weapons program, while beefing up the South’s own military capabilities.“It is time that measures for fundamentally cutting off North Korea’s foreign currency income and cutting off crude oil supply should be considered by the UN Security Council,” Moon was quoted as saying by his chief press officer Yoon Young-chan.  A man watches a television screen showing US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, Tuesday. Moon’s remarks to Putin, which was not met by a direct answer, hints at Seoul’s desire to see a bigger role from Russia. While China is thought to be Pyongyang’s main source of crude oil, Russia is a major trading partner. According to reports, North Korea-Russia trade, which mainly consists of fuel, doubled from a year ago to come in at over $31 million in the first quarter of the year. Russia, along with China, had also opposed clauses prohibiting North Korea from importing fuel in the US sanctions adopted in August. Moon’s remarks regarding Pyongyang’s foreign income refers to North Korean workers sent abroad. It is estimated that over 50,000 North Koreans are currently working abroad with much of their pay going to the Kim Jong-un regime. While agreeing on the seriousness of the North Korean nuclear program, Putin did not directly address the possibilities raised by Moon, suggesting instead that they discuss the issue at upcoming summit talks. Moon and Putin are set to hold their second summit talks on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, on Wednesday. While in the country, Moon is also scheduled to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe and expand on the “strong and real responses” the two agreed to bring against North Korea during their telephone conversation. Ahead of the conversation with Putin, Moon spoke with US President Donald Trump, during which the Korean president elicited Washington’s agreement to give Seoul more room to strengthen its missile capabilities.  “As an effective response,  agreed to lift the warhead weight limit,” the Cheong Wa Dae said in a statement. Until now, South Korean missiles’ payload was limited to 500 kilograms, and Seoul had been negotiating to have the limit raised to 1 ton. Following Monday’s agreement, Seoul is allowed to develop missile warheads of any weight within its technological capabilities. The range limit of 800 kilometers will not be affected by the changes. President Moon Jae-in in his office According to Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun, Moon and Trump also agreed on the need to apply further pressure on Pyongyang, and the US leader reaffirmed the country’s policy of defending South Korea. In the conversation, Moon also said that the temporary deployment of the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system would be completed quickly. Seoul’s Ministry of Environment recently concluded that THAAD system had negligible environmental effects. Four additional THAAD launchers are expected to be transported to the site in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, as early as this week.

As it was the bear’s second time being captured there, it has been disputed whether the bear should be allowed to settle in the new habitat.   A black bear captured in Sudo Mountain The bear was first released into a special protected area on Jirisan in 2015, 10 months after it was born in January that year. Due to the GPS failure of a chip implanted in the animal, his whereabouts had been unknown until he was caught on Sudosan in June for the first time this year. The bear is believed to have passed through Hamyang and Geochang in South Gyeongsang Province to reach Sudosan, according to the ministry. The animal’s move had surprised many, as the average typical radius of the species’ activities is less than 15 kilometers. The farthest that a black bear on Jirisan had gotten was to Hamyang in South Gyeongsang Province, which is 15 kilometers away. Calls are rising for the quick release of the bear, which has been in captivity for over a month in a nature adaptation center on Jirisan, but opinions are sharply divided over the location of its release.Environment activists say that the bear’s move is not a simple deviation, but its natural instinct to explore a new habitat. However, the government is worried about human safety and habitat protection.Opponents calling for the bear to be returned to its original habitat argue that Sudosan is not equipped to protect endangered bears and that it could also put passers-by in danger due to possible encounters with the animals. Park Bo-saeng, the mayor of Gimcheon City where the mountain is located, asked for the government to designate it as a natural habitat for the bears and promised “to create the best environment for the wild animal.”The Ministry of Environment is still considering the best option, but agrees with the need to release KM-53.“We are trying to release the bear as soon as we can, but nothing has been decided yet. It is very difficult to decide on the location because there are so many different opinions,” ministry official Kang Mi-jeong told The Korea Herald.South Korea first released four bears on Jirisan in 2001, before its endangered species restoration project officially kicked off three years later. Now, there are 47 black bears living in the Jirisan area.Considering that the receptive capacity of a natural habitat for black bears is thought to be 50, experts say it is time for the ministry to seriously consider expanding the area for the bears.

The North Korean Human Rights Act, which was passed by South Korea’s National Assembly in March 2016, calls for the establishment of a relevant foundation within the Unification Ministry, but the government here has been reportedly struggling with the task of appointing its members.  The 12-member group is to consist of five members recommended by the ruling party and another five suggested by the opposition parties, along with two handpicked by the unification minister. The law bestows the foundation with the authority to oversee core North Korean humanitarian-aid projects, while providing financial assistance to relevant nongovernmental organizations and local civic groups. Noting the sluggish progress, the Unification Ministry has submitted an official proposal to the National Assembly Secretariat, encouraging the government to fully carry out the purpose of the bill. “A number of humanitarian projects can be made possible only through the human rights foundation, which indicates that the North Korean Human Rights Act can only come into force upon the foundation’s establishment,” a Unification Ministry official said Sunday. The ministry official added that the appointment would gain traction once the opposition parties quickly reach a consensus on their five nominees, referring to the political tension that has been standing in the way of the bill. President Moon Jae-in has been trying to refocus the act by including its full enactment in his administration’s 100 policy tasks. The government has also been reportedly paying off a monthly rent of 63 million won  for the foundation’s headquarters established last October, despite the absence of its key members and employees. The bill also supports an archive that documents cases of Pyongyang’s rights violations and information regarding separated families, abductees and prisoners of war. North Korea has openly lambasted the act closely following its enactment, claiming that South Korea is not entitled to take issue with North Korea’s human rights situation and calling it a “sinister” move to undermine Pyongyang.

272,272, Validity of 2012 presidential election called into question,"The validity of South Korea’s 2012 presidential election, in which now-jailed former President Park Geun-hye beat the current President Moon Jae-in by a narrow margin, is now in doubt, after then spy agency chief was found guilty of conducting a secret operation to help Park win the race. Former President Park Geun-hye, who is now in jail over corruption charges, is taken to the Seoul Central District Court on May ...","The validity of South Korea’s 2012 presidential election, in which now-jailed former President Park Geun-hye beat the current President Moon Jae-in by a narrow margin, is now in doubt, after then spy agency chief was found guilty of conducting a secret operation to help Park win the race. Former President Park Geun-hye, who is now in jail over corruption charges, is taken to the Seoul Central District Court on May 30, 2017. Won Sei-hoon, who led the National Intelligence Agency from 2009 to 2013 under the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration, was convicted Wednesday of election and NIS law violations. He received a jail term of four years for his role in directing a secret team of psychological warfare agents to hire internet-savvy civilians to post more than 100,000 comments on Twitter and other online forums in favor of Park from then ruling block in the run-up to the election. In the race, Park received 51.6 percent of the vote to become the country’s first female president, against Moon’s 48 percent.Legal experts said the ruling, if finalized at the Supreme Court, means the 2012 election was rigged. Won’s lawyer on Wednesday said he would appeal. “Won violated the election law that bars public servants from campaigning for presidential candidates and interfered in domestic politics by misusing his power as the chief of the state spy agency,” said Nam Kyoung-kook, a constitutional scholar and law professor at the University of Seoul Law School.“That seriously challenges the validity of the presidential election,” Nam told The Korea Herald. Another constitutional law professor at Yonsei University, Lee Jong-soo, said the verdict was likely to drive more activists to file petitions asking for the result of the 2012 presidential election to be reversed. “People are likely to call on the court to review the validity of the presidential election result as the ruling concluded the state agency meddled in domestic politics,” Lee said. “But the chance of the reversal is not realistic as Park has already been stripped of power and the new president has since been elected,” Lee added. In fact, the Supreme Court in April turned down a petition filed by activists against the country’s central election committee in 2013 that sought to have the election outcome annulled. The court said there would be no real benefit in the nullification of the election as Park has already been removed from office. Nevertheless, calls are growing for an investigation to determine whether former President Lee or Park had any part in the election manipulation. Both Lee and Park have not been questioned with relation to the scandal. Park was expelled from power for corruption. She is standing trial on charges of corruption, coercion and allowing her confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs.

She won the election against her rival Moon Jae-in by a thin margin.The 66-year-old defendant headed the NIS from 2009 to 2013 under the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration. The Seoul Central District Court gave him a suspended sentence, finding him only guilty of interfering in politics in violation of the NIS law, and innocent of the election-meddling charge. But the appeals court ruled he was guilty of all charges and sentenced him to three years.  In July 2015, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower court for retrial, saying that the email files submitted as key evidence are not valid since the prosecution failed to specify who wrote them. The top court's decision got Won released on bail. The highly charged case took a fresh twist early this month as an internal NIS probe revealed new evidence that can possibly further incriminate Won. The evidence, based on which the prosecution has reopened an investigation into the scandal, alleged that Won orchestrated the secret operation of some 30 ""cyber teams,"" consisting of civilians, to post Internet comments in support of Park in the runup to the election.The Seoul High Court, however, turned down the prosecution's request to postpone the sentencing for Won, saying that there is little reason to reopen the proceedings considering the extent to which the trial has progressed.","2012 presidential election won sei ,indicted in 2013 for running ,in the 2012 presidential election ,interference in the 2012 presidential ,wednesday on former state intelligence","['Seoul', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'the National Intelligence Agency', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon Jae - in', 'NIS', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'NIS', 'the Supreme Court', 'Won', 'NIS', 'Won', 'Won', 'Park', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Won']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20723425  0.27057838

A 33-year-old man surnamed Lee filed a suit against the tech giant in 2011 requesting legal acknowledgment of the multiple sclerosis he had developed over the years of working at a Samsung factory as an industrial accident. His claim was turned down by two lower courts, which both cited a lack of evidence to prove his workplace, the liquid crystal display panel production line in Cheonan, south of Seoul, had caused the disease.   Families of industrial accident victims and a civic group representing them hold a press conference in front of Samsung Electronics headquarters in southern Seoul, on Jan. 13, 2016, urging the tech giant to come up with preventive and compensation measures. The Supreme Court quashed the judgments by the lower courts and sent back the case to the appeals court to be retried. The top court said, ""It is highly probable that the causality of Lee's illness and its aggravation may well be acknowledged in relation to his work.""It noted that Samsung's repeated refusal to disclose details on toxic substances at its production facility has hindered the plaintiff's efforts to substantiate his argument and said this should be taken into account. The court also said Lee comes from a family with no such medical history and that he was diagnosed with the incurable disease at the age of 21, far younger than the average of 38.  Lee, who worked there from 2002 to 2007, was tasked with checking the image quality of the display panels. In 2003, he started having conjunctivitis and nerve dysfunction then had chest pains and joint problems. He has argued he was exposed to electromagnetic waves and other harmful chemicals for over 12 hours a day. Lee's case is the first that the country's top court has recognized such a claim as an industrial accident. Two other former Samsung production workers with the same disease were accepted by lower courts as industrial victims in May and July, respectively, with another pending an assessment result from the state compensation and welfare agency. So far, a total of 21 workers have won legal battles for the acknowledgment as victims of industrial accidents, according to court records. They had mostly worked at semiconductor and LCD production lines, and have suffered from leukemia, breast cancer, brain tumors and other neurological disorders.","south korea top court overturned ,suffered from leukemia breast cancer ,accident two other former samsung ,his rare neurological disorder 33 ,other former samsung production workers","[""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Lee', 'Samsung', 'Cheonan', 'Seoul', 'family', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Seoul', 'the Supreme Court', 'Lee', 'Samsung', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Samsung']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35265532  0.26220053

It said there was speculation it could be part of the North's efforts to save fuel in the face of increasingly tough United Nations Security Council sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.Last month Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles that appeared to bring much of the US mainland into range.Oil is not currently subject to sanctions but fuel prices jumped in Pyongyang earlier this year, prompting suggestions that the rise was driven by a fear of restrictions being imposed.Specialist tour agencies which had scheduled trips to the air show said they had cancelled them.""We have indeed been informed that the Wonsan Air Festival has been cancelled,"" Stefan Goossens, a tour organiser at Netherland-based 4Aviation, told AFP.Rayco Vega at China-based KTG DPRK Tours & Information, said that the agency has scrapped its plans.","cancelled stefan goossens tour organiser ,missile programmes last month pyongyang ,june death of us student ,cancelled stefan goossens tour ,been cancelled stefan goossens tour","['North Korea', 'Wonsan Air Show', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the north korean Preparatory Committee', 'NK News', 'north korean', 'US', 'US', 'Otto Warmbier', 'Pyongyang', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'NHK', 'United Nations Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'Stefan Goossens', 'Netherland', 'China', 'KTG DPRK Tours & Information']",13,"[ 0.          1.          4.         ... -0.19794618  0.32475024

The man, Daniel Olomae Ole Sapit, was quoted as saying, ""There's a lot of confusion between the two.""The KOCIS officials had been worried that the similarity of the two names, coupled with the much higher level of the North Korean capital's international recognition, could cause visitors to mistake the South Korean ski town for Pyongyang.As part of ways to distinguish the South Korean host city from the North Korean capital, PyeongChang has opted to capitalize the ""c"" in its name.With the Olympics just over five months away, the KOCIS officials said they are no longer afraid, as their efforts to publicize the Olympics overseas have paid off, and they are confident South Korea's first Winter Olympics will be a success. This April 2017 file photo shows Canadian women posing for a photo with the mascots of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics -- Soohorang , a white tiger, and Bandabi, an Asiatic black bear -- during an event at a Toronto hotel to whip up interest for South Korea`s first Winter Games that will be held in the host city of PyeongChang, some 180 kilometers east of Seoul. The KOCIS, which serves as the control tower for the country's endeavors to make the Olympics known around the world, is working with the Korean Culture Center, which has been posted in 31 regions worldwide; King Sejong Institutes, which offer foreigners Korean language courses and Korean cultural activities; the Korea Tourism Organization; and the Creative Content Agency's overseas branches.The Korean Culture Center in New York engaged in publicity work for the PyeongChang Olympics through cultural activities, including a choir performance from the South Korean city of Daegu in June.In Ottawa, the Korean Culture Center has utilized the mascots of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics -- Soohorang, a white tiger, and Bandabi, an Asiatic black bear -- when it made pitches for the Olympics timed with the Changing of the Guard ceremonies taking place on Parliament Hill.The Korean Cultural Center in Paris has organized a Korean culture festival to promote the Olympics in the resort city of Honfleur in Normandy Province.With 32 offices in 20 countries, the Korea Tourism Organization is waging an all-out war to attract foreign tourists to South Korea with the Feb. 9-25 Olympics.South Korea is also promoting the Olympics to foreigners visiting state-run King Sejong Institutes set up overseas to teach the Korean language. The King Sejong Institute Foundation, the operator of the institutes, has said it is screening a promotional video for the PyeongChang Olympics in Korean cultural classes at 174 institutes in 58 countries around the world.A video, made by the KOCIS and released in July to celebrate the 200-day countdown to the 2018 Winter Olympics, has already garnered more than 8 million views. The video features South Korean magician Yu Ho-jin, who became the first magician from Asia to win the top prize at the International Federation of Magic Societies World Championship of Magic in 2012.High-profile personalities who have been designated as promotional ambassadors for the international sports event include soprano Jo Su-mi; Taeyang, a member of boy group Big Bang; the girl group Girl's Day; comedian Kim Byung-man; and former English Premier League player Park Ji-sung.Other outlets that the KOCIS is using for making pitches for the sports event are overseas broadcasters and news organizations.The US broadcaster NBC, the rights holder for broadcasting the Olympics in the United States, aired video clips on the Olympics through its program ""Today Show"" in March to April and will feature the sports event in the broadcaster's weekly travel and lifestyle television program in October.Promotional videos on the Olympics have been aired on other broadcasters, including CNN, Eurosport, Fox Sports, Fuji TV, America TV, and Vietnamese and Chinese ones.The KOCIS, which has also arranged for the coverage of the Olympics by news organizations from 40 countries, plans to invite an additional 60 journalists from overseas to the Olympics by December.Other events implemented by the KOCIS include a tour of the venues involving journalists at foreign news organizations in South Korea and the release of Olympics-related ads through overseas major broadcasters to mark the 100-day countdown to the Olympics.An official at the KOCIS said festivals and events held following the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics have given the country opportunities to tout itself as a well-off country. ""But through the Olympics this time, we plan to instill the world with a message that the country has grown up well thanks to its help, and it's about time for us to give new dreams and possibilities back to the world,"" the official said.","video for the pyeongchang olympics ,korea first winter olympics will ,the pyeongchang olympics in korean ,the 2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,promotional videos on the olympics","['pyongyang', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'Korean Culture and Information Service', 'south korean', 'korean', 'PyeongChang', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'kenyan', 'United Nations', 'PyeongChang', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Incheon International Airport', 'Daniel Olomae Ole Sapit', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'PyeongChang', 'kocis', ""South Korea 's"", 'canadian', 'PyeongChang', 'Asiatic', 'Toronto', 'PyeongChang', 'Seoul', 'the Korean Culture Center', 'King Sejong Institutes', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Korea Tourism Organization', ""the Creative Content Agency 's"", 'the Korean Culture Center', 'New York', 'south korean', 'Daegu', 'Ottawa', 'the Korean Culture Center', 'PyeongChang', 'Asiatic', 'the Changing of the Guard', 'the Korean Cultural Center', 'Paris', 'korean', 'Honfleur', 'Normandy Province', 'the Korea Tourism Organization', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'the King Sejong Institute Foundation', 'korean', 'kocis', 'south korean', 'Yu Ho - jin', 'the International Federation of Magic Societies World Championship of Magic', 'Jo Su - mi', 'Big Bang', 'Girl', 'Kim Byung - man', 'English', 'Premier League', 'Park Ji - sung', 'kocis', 'US', 'NBC', 'the United States', 'CNN', 'Eurosport', 'Fox Sports', 'Fuji TV', 'America TV', 'vietnamese', 'chinese', 'kocis', 'South Korea', 'kocis']",15,"[ 0.          3.          3.         ... -0.51543915  0.34688666

The findings were released by a team of researchers from Seoul National University‘s Graduate School of Public Health, and were from the analysis on bacterial DNA of fine dust concentrations in Seoul, Beijing and Nagasaki in Japan. South Korea is bordered by China to the west and Japan to the east.  Over the yearlong study, the researchers found that 83 percent of the total species of airborne bacteria overlapped in Seoul and Beijing. Seoul and Nagasaki showed a 73 percent similarity of bacterial communities, while Beijing and Nagasaki had 66 percent. Researchers said the highest similarity was observed in spring and winter, noting the speed and frequency of the prevailing northwesterly wind blowing from the Siberia region.Bacteria species like proteobacteria, firmicutes and actinobacteria -- common types of bacteria found from the human skin -- accounted for 67 percent of bacteria found among these three cities.“Findings are meaningful as it catalogs the diversity and similarity of bacteria in the airborne dust detected in the three Northeast Asian cities, but further study is needed to conclude that bacterial movements are driven by meteorological factors,” said professor Kim Ho who led the research.

South Korea said the projectiles appeared to be artillery rockets from a multiple-rocket launcher. The US characterized them as short-range ballistic missiles.""The firing of any ballistic missile is a violation of UN Security Council resolutions,"" the secretary said. ""We do view it as a provocative act against the United States and our allies.""He said the launches sent a signal that Pyongyang is still not prepared to back away from its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. This AP photo shows US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaking during a press conference at the Department of State in Washington on Aug. 22, 2017. ""Having said that, we're going to continue our peaceful pressure campaign, as I have described it, working with allies and working with China as well to see if we can bring the regime in Pyongyang to the negotiating table with a view to begin a dialogue on a different future for Korean Peninsula and for North Korea,"" he said.Tillerson last week noted that North Korea has exercised ""restraint"" since the UN Security Council sanctioned it on Aug. 5 for testing two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.US President Donald Trump later said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was ""starting to respect us.""Tillerson denied they were wrong to say that.""I think it's going to take some time to tell,"" he said.Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang escalated after North Korea's two ICBM tests. Trump threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" on Pyongyang if it continued to threaten the US or its allies, while the communist regime hit back with threats to launch ballistic missiles toward Guam.The war of words subsided after Kim put his plan on hold.""We continue to want the Kim regime to understand there is a different path he can choose,"" Tillerson said. ""There is also a unified international voice echoing our messages that no one wants to see a nuclear Korean Peninsula. We hope for the opportunity to engage with them as to how we might achieve that.""The latest provocation came as South Korean and US troops have been conducting joint annual drills against a possible North Korean attack. While the allies insist the command post exercise is purely defensive in nature, Pyongyang has long viewed it as an invasion rehearsal.South Korea's presidential office, Cheong Wa Dae, played down the missile launch as a typical response to the drills.""It seems that North Korea is trying not to aggravate the situation,"" a presidential official said on the customary condition of anonymity.

The rival Koreas sat together for talks for the first time after the 1950-53 Korean War, indicating that sports exchanges could be used to ease military tensions even in the wake of a particularly bloody conflict.Their attempt to make a united team fell through, but international sports games had served as a venue for the two Koreas to come to talks and seek reconciliation.South and North Korea fielded joint teams at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship.South Korean table tennis player Hyun Jung-hwa played double matches with Li Bun-hui from North Korea, upsetting China, which was gunning for a consecutive title.The 1991 world championships marked the first time the two Koreas created a united team in any international sports competition, and the team remains the only joint Korean squad in any sport to win an international title.Since 1991, the two Koreas have failed to create a single team. But athletes from the rival Koreas marched under a unified Korean flag at the opening ceremonies of the Olympics and Asian Games several times including at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics and the 2002 Busan Asian Games.North Korea did not take part in the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul, but it sent a delegation of three high-ranking officials -- Hwang Pyong-so, Choe Ryong-hae and the late Kim Yang-gon -- to the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games held in the South.Top military official Hwang is a close aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, making him the highest-ranking North Korean official to have visited the South in recent years.At the height of military tensions in 2002 when a naval skirmish occurred near the western sea border, North Korea sent its sports team and a cheering squad to the Busan Asian Games in South Korea.There were scant sports exchanges during conservative governments of President Lee Myung-bak and his successor Park Geun-hye from February 2008 and May 2017.Amid strained ties, athletes from the two Koreas did not jointly march at the opening ceremonies of international sports games since the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.","north korea playing double matches ,opening ceremonies of the olympics ,championship south korean table tennis ,the 2018 pyeongchang olympics will ,tennis championships the rival koreas","['South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'North', 'North Korea', 'Lausanne', 'Switzerland', 'Tokyo', 'south korean', 'Hyun Jung - hwa', 'Li Bun - hui', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'Koreas', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Hyun Jung - hwa', 'Li Bun - hui', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Koreas', 'korean', 'Koreas', 'Koreas', 'korean', 'Busan Asian Games', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'Hwang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Koreas']",10,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.66380227  0.71925461

The stationing of the remaining four launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system comes as the Environment Ministry wraps up a small-scale environmental review. The equipment will join the already operational two launchers, radar and other assets to form a full-fledged battery. The move will also coincide with a maiden face-to-face meeting between South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo and US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, set for Wednesday in Washington. “Currently a small-scale environmental impact assessment is under way, and I can’t say it for certain, but the results are likely to come out around Monday,” a Cheong Wa Dae official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. This photo shows a launcher of the US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system at its site in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. The Ministry of National Defense echoed the view, saying the four launchers and related apparatus will be brought to the site in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, as soon as the survey is finished. “The assessment is now in its final phase and we’re working to meet the Environment Ministry’s requests to supplement the process,” a Defense Ministry official told reporters, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter and referring to tests of electromagnetic waves and fine dust. “The necessary equipment and materials should be transferred when the EIA ends, so we will set the exact date through consultations with the US and notify the press and local residents  at least one day before the system’s delivery.” The official noted the issue of electromagnetic waves emitted by THAAD, which some lawmakers and activists have argued may be harmful to human health, would not postpone the deployment. The Defense Ministry carried out another electromagnetic waves check at three locations in the nearby city of Gimcheon early this week and found levels to be safe. It tested Seongju on Aug. 12 after a prior attempt crumbled due to the resistance of some residents. But the two officials refused to confirm Thursday’s remarks by the main opposition Liberty Korea Party’s Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, who chairs a parliamentary intelligence committee, that Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon is “bothering his mind” because of the Donald Trump administration’s demand for the four THAAD launchers to be put in place by Wednesday. The Prime Minister’s Office and ruling Democratic Party of Korea called Lee’s comment “groundless.” The lawmaker on Friday again defended his claim, saying though he does not have any recording to prove it, the PMO would have contacted him to lodge a complaint “if it was a lie.” The on-site analysis began about a month ago in line with Moon’s instruction to speed up the THAAD deployment shortly after North Korea test-fired a second intercontinental ballistic missile. The move marked a reversal of the fledgling leadership’s earlier decision to conduct a formal, comprehensive environmental review, which would delay the installment to at least late next year, triggering Washington’s discomfort and the opposition’s criticism at home. Asked whether the THAAD installment would be finalized within this year at a parliamentary session Thursday, Chung Eui-yong, chief of the presidential National Security Office, also said it would be completed “far earlier than that.” The swift deployment is expected to ease the burden for Song, who has a slew of sensitive items on the agenda other than North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats. Among them are Moon’s pursuit to amend a bilateral accord to mount missiles with a warhead weighing 1 tons -- twice the current limit of 500 kilograms -- and build an atomic-powered submarine to better counter Pyongyang’s submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Defense Minister Song Young-moo  speaks with US Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Joseph Dunford during their meeting in Seoul on Aug. 14. Song is scheduled to depart for Washington on Tuesday and also meet with Trump’s national security adviser H.R. McMaster on Wednesday. Following a three-day stay there, the minister will travel to Hawaii to visit the US Pacific Command and hold talks with Adm. Harry Harris, Pacific Fleet Commander Adm. Scott Swift and other key officials, another ministry official said. “The sides are still in consultation over the agenda for the ministerial talks but it would include the issues you could easily presume would be added,” the official said. “But the minister’s first overseas trip is chiefly designed to display close coordination between the two defense chiefs, send a strong message against North Korea and help soothe our people’s security concerns at a time when the North ramps up its nuclear capabilities and provocative rhetoric.” By Shin Hyon-hee","missile shield next week officials ,the lawmaker on friday again ,meeting in seoul on aug ,us missile shield next week ,next week officials said friday","['South Korea', 'US', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'south Korean', 'Song Young', 'US', 'Defense', 'James Mattis', 'Washington', 'US', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Environment Ministry ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'US', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Gimcheon', 'Liberty Korea Party ’s', 'Lee Cheol - woo', 'Lee Nak - yon', 'Donald Trump', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Lee', 'PMO', 'Moon ’s', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Chung Eui - yong', 'National Security Office', 'Song', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Young', 'US Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Joseph Dunford', 'Seoul', 'song', 'Washington', 'Trump ’s', 'H.R.

However, the city is becoming greener as local governments turn to forests to battle pollution. Forests in urban areas work as filters for air pollutants and fine particles. According to the National Institute of Forest Science, a single tree can absorb 35.7 grams of fine dust particles in a year -- an amount that could fill an espresso cup. A coniferous tree can absorb up to 44 grams of air pollutants, and environmentalists say such trees help raise humidity and reduce temperatures in cities. Visitors stroll through a forest in Seoul. A study conducted by the NIFS showed that in April, when the amount of fine dust particles peaks, the level of PM 2.5 concentration hits an average 75 micrograms per cubic meter inside an urban forest, while 110 micrograms per cubic meter can be recorded near bus stops.“The presence of a large number of plants, trees and shrubs contributes to the cleaning of the air,” said Park Chan-yeol, a researcher at NIFS. “What is important is that the greenery inside the city significantly contributes to air purification in terms of absorbing the dust produced by urban traffic.”Urban forests also help the city cool down.A study by the Seoul Institute showed urban forests can decrease temperatures by as much as 7 degrees Celsius and increase humidity by up to 23 percent. The study also observed that temperatures on tree-lined streets were an average 2.5 degrees lower, which researchers say is equivalent to operating five air conditioners for five hours in a room the size of 15 square meters. With more citizens preferring to live near wooded areas, certain areas of Seoul have also seen property values rise sharply. Despite increased awareness of the benefits of trees, Seoul remains far less green than other cities.The World Health Organization’s recommended per capita urban forest area is 9.9 square meters. London has the most with 27 square meters, followed by New York with 23 square meters. Seoul’s per capita urban forest area amounts to just 4.4 square meters.In April, the city government mapped out a new initiative to establish more than 400 forests by 2023 to offer outdoor education programs such as “forest kindergartens,” where children living in urban areas can experience nature.“As many citizens share the opinion that there is a lack of opportunities for them to experience nature in Seoul, we will continue to build more urban forests for families, children and senior citizens so they can enjoy the benefits of greenery without having to travel to the countryside,” said Choi Gwang-bin, a Seoul City official in charge of the green policy division.By Kim Da-sol","battle pollution forests in urban ,forests also help the city ,more urban forests for families ,forests to battle pollution forests ,build more urban forests for","['Seoul', 'the National Institute of Forest Science', 'Seoul', 'NIFS', 'Park Chan - yeol', 'NIFS', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the World Health Organization ’s', 'London', 'New York', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Choi Gwang - bin', 'Seoul City', 'Kim Da - sol']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.89499378  0.28114495

This file photo, unveiled by North Korea`s state news agency on May 27, 2015, shows an investment seminar in the Wonsan-Mount Kumgang international tourism zone in North Korea.

In May 2015, the country held an investment seminar there to develop the zone.PCE said that in the cited period, participants could attend the 2017 Pyongyang International Trade Fair, a biannual event aimed at luring foreign investment and promoting exports.They also have an option to attend an air festival in Wonsan to be held during the same weekend, it said.Mount Kumgang was the venue for an inter-Korean tourism program until Seoul suspended the project in July 2008 following the killing of a South Korean tourist by a North Korean soldier.","late next month canadian nonprofit ,pyongyang international trade fair biannual ,canadian nonprofit agency said thursday ,2017 pyongyang international trade fair ,nurturing tourism in may 2015","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'canadian', 'UN Security Council', 'Wonsan', 'Mount Kumgang', 'Paektu Cultural Exchange', 'China', 'canadian', 'North Korea`s', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'pce', 'Wonsan', 'Mount Kumgang', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'north korean']",17,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.61775309  0.64576739

According to Seoul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President Moon Jae-in and Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged congratulatory remarks.“ have been developed into a more mature relationship from the foundation of trust and understanding built by the people and governments of the two countries through communication, exchange and cooperation,” Moon was quoted as saying by Seoul’s Foreign Ministry. The ministry also said that Moon stressed the value he places in relations with China, and that he and Xi have reached an understanding on the direction South Korea-China relations should develop in. “The two countries should develop ties further to become strategic partners that contribute to peace and advancement of Northeast Asia, and the world.”The Chinese president returned similar pleasantries, but also touched on the discord between Seoul and Beijing. According to Seoul, Xi said that he also considers ties with South Korea to be very important, and that the two sides should “consolidate political trust, and reasonably resolve different opinions.”Xi’s comment regarding “different opinions” has been interpreted here as a reference to the planned deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea. Beijing opposes the US missile defense system being deployed in South Korea, claiming that THAAD poses a threat to its national security. China has retaliated by subjecting South Korean businesses’ Chinese operations to stricter regulations, while Chinese media have fanned anti-Korean sentiment. Some of South Korea’s largest companies have been heavily hit by China’s retaliation, with companies such as Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors seeing sales plunge this year. During the Park Geun-hye administration, Seoul and Washington agreed to position six THAAD launchers in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province as a defense against North Korea’s growing missile threat. Although a comprehensive environmental impact study has been launched under the new administration, Moon has stated on a number of occasions that its aim is not to scrap the agreement, but to secure “procedural legitimacy” in THAAD deployment. In addition, Moon has also ordered the Ministry of National Defense to begin talks with Washington to deploy four additional THAAD launchers after Pyongyang’s second ballistic missile launch in July. In addition to the presidents, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi also exchanged messages. Kang called for the further strengthening of ties, and for Beijing’s cooperation in resolving North Korean issues, while Wang expressed hopes to further build “mutual understanding and trust.” With relations strained, events marking the 25th anniversary appear to have been toned down. At the event organized by South Korea’s embassy in Beijing, China was represented by Wan Gang, the science and technology minister and vice chief of a parliamentary advisory body. Wan’s rank in the Chinese government has sparked speculations that a feud over THAAD may be behind his selection. In comparison, the 20th anniversary event was attended by Xi, who was the then vice president.","chinese president returned similar pleasantries ,presidents south korean foreign minister ,subjecting south korean businesses chinese ,president xi jinping exchanged congratulatory ,the chinese president returned similar","['South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Moon Jae - in', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Moon', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Moon', 'China', 'Xi', 'South Korea', 'China', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Xi', 'South Korea', 'the US', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'US', 'South Korea', 'China', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'anti - korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'Hyundai Motor', 'Kia Motors', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi', 'Kang', 'Beijing', 'north korean', 'Wang', 'South Korea ’s', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Wan Gang', 'Wan ’s', 'chinese', 'Xi']",16,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.39710462  0.50996798

Yonhap Their visits were arranged by the city government as part of its effort to attract more tourists amid a continued tourism boycott by China in retaliation against Seoul’s decision to deploy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here. The number of tourists to Korea in May -- a peak tourism month for the Chinese with a weeklong holiday marking Labor Day -- fell 27 percent on-year to 1.08 million tourists compared to last year, with a 60 percent drop in Chinese visitors. To ease the impact of China’s boycott, the Seoul Metropolitan Government launched a tourism program to provide benefits to tourists coming as a group, mainly targeting those from Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries. In a joint effort with the Korea Tourism Organization, the city government opened a tourism promotion booth in Taipei last week to attract visitors. It was the third of its kind, following promotion booths in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, earlier this year. According to the Seoul City’s tourism policy division, those who travel as a group and stay in Seoul for over two nights with an accumulated 100 nights of stay as a group can receive 20,000 won  to 30,000 won of sightseeing subsidy per person. Travelers can also participate in one of five sightseeing programs hosted by the city government, which include visiting Seoullo 7017 and Bukchon Hanok Village.As a result, the city government said at least 350,000 visitors from Taiwan visited Seoul during the first half of this year, an about 28 percent jump compared to last year. Those from Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries went up by 53.3 percent over the same period. “The city government will continue to come up with creative programs and promote the benefits of trips to Seoul, especially in the MICE tourism sector, for groups who are brought for a particular purpose like meetings, incentives, conference and exhibitions,” said Kim Jae-yong, head of the Seoul City’s tourism policy division. In recent years, Southeast Asian firms and institutions have been sending thousands of employees and students to Seoul on trips, on the back of the growing popularity of South Korean TV shows and K-pop.In April, employees of insurance firm AXA from Indonesia came for a weeklong tour and participated in a bike-riding program near the Han River, followed by a group of students from an Indonesian university who visited in July. The staff of an underwear manufacturer from Vietnam also visited Seoullo 7017 in the same month through Seoul’s sponsorship. By Kim Da-sol","tour seoul for five days ,will tour seoul for five ,korea in may peak tourism ,tourists to korea in may ,indonesia came for weeklong tour","['Taiwan', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'group', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Korea', 'Chinese', 'chinese', 'China', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Taiwan', 'southeast asian', 'the Korea Tourism Organization', 'Taipei', 'Jakarta', 'Indonesia', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Malaysia', 'Seoul', 'Seoullo 7017', 'Taiwan', 'Seoul', 'southeast asian', 'Seoul', 'Kim Jae - yong', 'the Seoul City ’s', 'southeast asian', 'Seoul', 'south korean tv', 'AXA', 'Indonesia', 'indonesian', 'Vietnam', 'Seoullo 7017', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60331702  0.70573246

Whether Americans would in fact join the marathon is unclear, however, as the US imposed a travel ban, forbidding Americans from visiting North Korea from September. The measure was taken after American college student Otto Warmbier died after being released in a coma in June from a 17-month detention in North Korea. North Korea has denounced the US travel ban and has vowed to continue to leave the door open for Americans intending to visit the country.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. North Korea staged its last major provocation on July 28, a second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, after which the UN Security Council unanimously passed new sanctions targeting a third of its annual export revenues.Tensions escalated soon after as North Korea threatened to retaliate against the US, and the two sides engaged in a war of words suggesting military action.The secretary had still held out the possibility of talks on the condition that North Korea first halt its missile tests and other provocations.

As the seat allocation process opened at 10 a.m. at the Seoul Bankruptcy Court in southern Seoul, applicants filled out forms, threw them into a box and crossed their fingers to be one of the lucky 30 people to watch the court issue its verdict on the country’s most prominent businessman. Reflecting the keen public interest in the case, 454 people entered the draw for the 30 seats reserved for the general public in the 150-seat courtroom. The remaining seats were reserved for the accused’s family, lawyers and reporters. Lee, the only son of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee, is on trial for bribery in connection with the corruption scandal that led to former President Park Geun-hye’s ouster. He faces charges of bribery, embezzlement and illegal transfer of assets abroad for paying or promising to pay 43.4 billion won  in donations to foundations controlled by Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil and in sports sponsorship to Choi’s horse-riding daughter. Lee has denied all the charges. Friday’s court session will begin at 2:30 p.m. Judges will decide whether to convict Samsung’s heir and de facto chief, and if he’s found guilty, will hand down a sentence. “I wanted to see justice served myself. I think the case was a typical one showing cozy relations between politics and business in the country,” said Han Sook-hyun, a 24-year-old university student. “I hope the court gives a righteous ruling and it paves the way for a more just and fair society.” Yi Kye-hyang, 54, called the ruling “symbolic” and “historic.”“Whether Lee is punished is not only a matter for Lee and Samsung Group, but an important matter for the public,” said Yi, who took a half day off to participate in the draw with her two children. “I thought it would teach my children a good lesson.”“I hope that the sentence hearing will be televised as the public interest is at stake,” she said. It is not yet decided whether the verdict hearing for Lee and Samsung executives will be televised. According to a recent change in court rules, the sentence hearings deemed crucial for public interest can be broadcast live. There were also many avid fans for ex-President Park who they believe was falsely accused by liberals and a biased media. They say Samsung Lee couldn’t have bribed Park, since the former leader is not the kind of a person who pursues personal interests. Park is on trial on 18 charges including bribery for making the alleged deal with Lee. “The ruling must prove Lee and Park’s innocence. I have watched the court proceedings, but they were filled with lies. The trials have been too biased against them,” said Kim Mi-ja, 57, who said she has attended hearings for Lee and Park as a spectator several times. As a court official picked up 30 pieces of paper and read out numbers to announce who gets a seat at the sentence hearing, there was both excitement and disappointment. “I could not believe it when he called my number. I feel so good! I appreciate it,” said a 60-something woman, who only gave her surname Park. She cheered and clapped hands as the court official called her number 363.Some angrily complained about a lack of seats allocated to the public. “Why only 30 citizens are allowed in the courtroom that can house 150 people? Please explain why!” a man in his 60s shouted at the court official. The court said it had reduced the seats for spectators to maintain order and ensure security. Special Counsel has sought 12 years in prison for Lee, claiming that the money was a bribe to win the government’s backing of the 2015 merger of Samsung Group’s two affiliates. It viewed the merger as a crucial step for a smooth leadership transition from its ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. Former President Park, in return for the money, is suspected of having pressured the state-funded National Pension Service, the largest stakeholder in Samsung C&T;, to vote in favor of the controversial merger.

299,299,[Herald Interview] How comfort women statues got to ride Seoul buses,"Five Seoul buses have recently received an unusual passenger -- a statue of a barefoot teenage girl in traditional Korean hanbok dress.

Do...","Five Seoul buses have recently received an unusual passenger -- a statue of a barefoot teenage girl in traditional Korean hanbok dress. Similar to the original statue situated in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, the lightweight effigy represents the euphemistically labeled “comfort women” -- women mostly from South Korea and China who were forced into sex slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Donga Traffic Service CEO Rim Jin-wook appears behind a statue of a girl installed on one of his company’s commuter buses in Seoul. Their bus ride, unveiled on the eve of the Aug. 15 Liberation Day, which marks Korea’s independence from Japanese colonial rule, has been the talk of the town in Seoul. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, accompanied by a group of journalists, rode one of the buses on Aug. 14 to pay tribute to the victims. Commuters have shared photos of the statues they encounter on the buses via social media.Behind this much-publicized event, which has also grabbed the attention of Japanese media and politicians, is Rim Jin-wook, owner of Donga Traffic Service. It was Rim who first came up with the idea and he who pushed for it, assuming the entire cost by himself. “Some may call me nationalist or political, but I’m doing what I can do as a citizen,” Rim said at the firm’s garage in Ui-dong, northern Seoul. “Only 37 of the victims are still alive . They will die sooner or later.”Rim wanted to remind passengers of the plight of comfort women and protest against the 2015 deal between the Seoul and Tokyo governments to “finally and irreversibly” settle the issue, which did not consider victims’ opinions. “The deal was made without any consent of the victims, which was just outrageous and unacceptable. I’m not a politician or in any position to protest the deal alone, but as a head of a bus company, I wanted to fight it in my own way.” Rim said. Under the deal, Japan offered 1 billion yen  in compensation, though without acknowledging legal responsibility. The money was channeled via a South Korean fund to some former comfort women and their families. The statues were created by artist Kim Eun-sung and his wife, who made the original in front of the Japanese Embassy. Rim met Kim at an alumni event in 2014. “I went to the same college with the artist, although we did not know each other back then. I called the couple earlier this June to see if they were interested in designing a set of lightweight copies to be installed on my buses and they said OK,” Rim explained. Pictures of the statues riding the buses have been carried by almost every major newspaper in South Korea. Those taken by passengers have gone viral through social media, successfully rekindling the public’s interest in the unresolved wartime atrocity.Some have paid tribute to the statues by placing floral wreaths at their knees. Others put socks on their bare feet. Not surprisingly, Rim’s actions have irked Japan, which has reacted sensitively whenever a new comfort women statue is erected. One day after their unveiling, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga publicly expressed concerns over the operation of the buses carrying statues, according to Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun. “Japan and South Korea are making efforts to develop a future-oriented relationship,” Suga told a press conference, adding that setting up the statues “may put a damper on the efforts,” the news outlet reported. Japanese news outlets, including the largest broadcaster NHK, also weighed in, saying the statues could make Japanese travelers uncomfortable.Affected bus routes include some spots favored by Japanese tourists, such as Namdaemun Market and Lotte Department Store in Myeong-dong.But that doesn’t seem to bother Rim at all. “Just think about how absurd it is when a political heavyweight such as a chief cabinet secretary himself reacts extremely sensitively to a mere owner of a local bus company like myself. If they feel uncomfortable about it, I think they should feel the same way to the horrific plight of our victims,” Rim opined.“The statues will be on the bus until the end of September as scheduled,” he said.

The embassy is scheduled to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of official South Korea-China diplomatic ties with an event on Thursday at a Seoul hotel. This file photo shows South Korean and Chinese officials attending a reception at a Seoul hotel on Aug. 24, 2017, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha plans to leave for Russia on the same day for a meeting with her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov set for Friday in Moscow, without attending the embassy function.The spokesman said that the South Korean and Chinese foreign ministers will send a message of congratulations on the occasion of the anniversary.The relatively subdued festivity this year compares with the countries' marking of their 20th anniversary in 2012 when then-South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan attended a similar Chinese Embassy event in Seoul.A government source said Kang's absence has nothing to do with the current bilateral feud as her visit to Russia had already been set up, but the ongoing friction apparently seems to be playing a part.Diplomatic ties between the two neighboring countries have been put to the test as the two remain staunchly at odds over the ongoing installation of a US missile defense system in South Korean territory. In July last year, South Korea and the US unveiled their plan to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, saying that it is intended to better defend against missiles from North Korea.China has adamantly opposed the move, claiming it is part of the US missile defense network and its powerful X-band radar, in particular, will hurt its strategic security interests. The source also said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is unlikely to attend the anniversary event organized by the South Korean Embassy in Beijing. It is still unknown who will represent China at the event, the source said.In 2012, then-Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi attended the embassy event in Beijing. Xi and Yang are now the country's president and state councilor.","aug 24 2017 to celebrate ,event on thursday at seoul ,july last year south korea ,at seoul hotel on aug ,chinese embassy event this week","['South Korea', ""the Chinese Embassy 's"", 'US', 'South Korea', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'south Korean', ""Chinese Embassy 's"", 'Cho June - hyuck', 'Lim', 'northeast asian', 'Cho', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'Russia', 'russian', 'Sergey Lavrov', 'Moscow', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'Kim Sung - hwan', 'Chinese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Kang', 'Russia', 'US', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'China', 'US', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Yang Jiechi', 'Beijing', 'Xi', 'Yang']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60057932  0.58488566

Images captured from footage unveiled by North Korea`s propaganda website Uriminzokkiri on Aug. 19, 2017, shows North Korea`s threat to fire missile strikes near the US territory of Guam.

But the regime backed off last week, saying it would watch Washington's behavior a little longer.Tensions persist as South Korea and the US kicked off annual military drills on Monday, which North Korea views as a rehearsal for an invasion. The communist nation has previously staged various provocations in protest, including its fifth nuclear test in September. Guam is a major tourist destination, with August one of the busiest months, according to the Guam Visitors Bureau. Last August, it attracted 144,758 tourists, more than any other month. According to some estimates, Japan and South Korea account for some 90 percent of all visitors, and South Koreans alone make up 46 percent.""Tourism is a fragile industry.

As part of the event, a 300-meter-long and 22-meter-high “bobsleigh waterslide” was open to the public Saturday to draw public attention to the 2018 Winter Olympics.At least 5,000 citizens gathered Saturday and waited for an average of two hours, Seoul City said. The ride was free of charge. However, the operation of the waterslide only lasted 12 hours Saturday from 10 a.m., after Seoul City officials canceled the operation Sunday following a forecast of sudden downpours in the capital on Sunday. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the city government and Gangwon Provincial Government spent 250 million won each on ordering 2,000 custom-made tubes specially designed for the large-scale waterslide. Over 400 million won went into borrowing and installing the waterslide, while 130 million won was used to hire on-site staff. Another 200 million won was spent to alert citizens to traffic restrictions in the area for four days -- from setting up the waterslide Friday until its dismantlement Monday morning. Major traffic jams continued until Monday morning, as the dismantling of the waterslide was delayed due to rain. At least three bus-only lane were blocked, leading to the inconvenience of commuters on their way to work. “Seoul City should spend such money on events for good causes, instead of wasting taxpayers’ money for just one-time entertainment or a promotional event,” wrote a commenter online. As the complaints continued, the city government released a statement Monday, saying the two-day event not only involved the operation of the waterslide but also other activities such as musical performances, Olympics promotion booths and food stalls. It added that the entire budget was not just spent on the waterslide. Seoul City’s spending on the installation of facilities or structures has long been at the center of public criticism.“Shoes Tree,” a giant art installation made from thousands of worn-out shoes, was installed in front of Seoul Station in May, in line with the opening of the highway-turned-park Seoullo 7017.The city government spent 139 million won to create the 100-meter-long and 10-meter-wide installation, with most of the budget spent on setting up the metal skeletal structures of the piece. Many called the installation “monstrous” and “eerie.”By Kim Da-sol","2018 winter olympics the waterslide ,promote pyeongchang 2018 winter olympics ,winter olympics the waterslide installed ,pyeongchang 2018 winter olympics stands ,the pyeongchang 2018 winter olympics","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyeongchang', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul City', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Gangwon Provincial Government', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Seoullo', 'Kim Da - sol']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.238703    0.42236751

The catchphrase, which urges Melakan citizens to reduce littering in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a reflection of the city’s strong drive to make it inclusive, resilient and sustainable not only for today’s population, but for future generations.  Students look around the energy-saving facilities on the rooftop of Ramada Hotel Melaka as part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop in Melaka, Malaysia, on July 9. “I learned how the effective management of the systems can turn a city into an eco-friendly city, with the backing of government’s measures and policies,” Zaw Zaw Aung, a 22-year-old student from Myanmar, told The Korea Herald.“It is sad many cities around the world are losing their culture, but Melaka has been doing an excellent job in incorporating its local culture and environment in a modern style to make it more sustainable.” Three students carry a bag bearing the slogan ""Don't mess with Meleka"" in Melaka, Malaysia, on July 9. Along with the Myanmarese student, some 40 young people from South Korea and four countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia -- joined a five-day trip in Malaysia last month, the second part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop organized by ASEAN-Korea Centre and International Youth Centre. ASEAN-Korea Centre's Secretary General Kim Young-sun and tudents plant trees along a river as part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop in Melaka, Malaysia, on July 9. By taking part in lecture, field trips and cultural activities, they not only rediscovered a meaning of sustainable development in terms of economic growth, environmental protection and social inclusion, but also forged strong networks to continue their partnership in building sustainable cities in Asia.Making cities sustainable is considered a crucial part of meeting the United Nations’ sustainable development goals as more than half of the world’s population -- some 3.5 billion people -- live in urban areas today and cities are the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The role of developing countries, especially the 10 ASEAN countries, is vital as it has a combined population of 900 million people as of 2016, some 12 percent of the world’s population, and urbanization is rapidly taking place in their cities. Malaysia is already positioning itself at the forefront of developing cities in a sustainable way by shifting to green energy, improving public transport and dispersing population nationwide. Melaka, a trading hub in Asia in its heyday, is one of the pioneering green cities promoted by the Malaysian government. Through the river rehabilitation project, it improved the irrigation system to clean the muddy water and prevent flooding. Melaka, Malaysia The participants looked around Ramada Plaza Melaka, which earned a Green Apple Award from the municipality, for its efforts to adopt an eco-friendly way of business, picked up litter and planted trees along the Melaka river. They also visited the city‘s solar farm at the Melaka World Solar Valley. But going green in terms of energy consumption is not all the city has to offer. Christ Church in Melaka, Malaysia It has turned itself into a popular tourist spot with its rich history and multicultural heritage affected by trading and cultural exchanges between East and West. It has well-preserved architecture which originated in the Malay sultanate in the 15th century and the colonial era under Portuguese and Dutch. Melaka riverside, Malaysia “As for city planning, I think that Korea should learn to protect the environment and cultural heritage to make cities sustainable. Melaka’s environment and culture are well preserved, while I think that Korea tends to focus more on destroying and re-building things,” said Im Chae-hyeon, 25, from Busan. The students also visited Putrajaya, the federal administrative capital of Malaysia, which became a sustainable low-carbon city with a goal of reducing its greenhouse emissions intensity by 60 percent by 2025, compared to 2012 levels.  Putrajaya, Malaysia In Putrajaya, buildings were constructed in accordance with green building standards. Solar photovoltaic systems are installed and electric buses are run. It also has the country’s first man-made wetland in the city.“Putrajaya’s buildings look all different. I felt like Malaysians have made efforts to conserve diversity in terms of building designs rather than focus on applying advanced technology,” said Cho Young-ju, a 22-year-old student from Korea. Students post for a photo at Wawasan Park, Putrajaya, Malaysia, on July 11. “I think diversity is an important factor in making cities sustainable. Technology can be copied, but diversity, perception and culture cannot.”Malaysia is one of the most multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-lingual society, with Malays, Chinese and Indians making up the largest ethnic groups. With its culture stemming from indigenous tribes, it has incorporated suitable elements from Chinese, Indian, Persian, Arabic and western cultures and created its own.“Malaysia’s sustainable cities are telling a story,” the center’s Secretary-General Kim Young-sun said, noting that Korea’s signature smart city Incheon is rather focused on promoting cutting-edge and energy-saving technology. “What makes sustainable cities truly sustainable is the cities’ history and culture, along with technology and environment. I hope that Korean students learn from Malaysia where diverse cultures coexist in harmony,” he said. “I hope that youths from the 10 ASEAN countries and Korea work together, form friendships and grow as future leaders through this program,” Kim added. In the first part of the workshop held from July 3-7 in Seoul, some 80 students visited facilities such as a sewage treatment plant and a tidal power plant in Incheon. They also received lectures on ASEAN-Korea relations and sustainable development from experts. Under the theme of “Promoting Clean and Green Environment through the Establishment of Environmentally Sustainable Cities,” students toured Korea and Malaysia from July 3 to 13. For the participants, it was a chance to realize the importance of continued exchanges from ASEAN countries and Korea. “The experience in both countries helped me to figure out how we can achieve a sustainable city development for our country,” said Nur Fazliyana Binti Yusoff, 21, from Malaysia. “Malaysia can learn from South Korea’s advanced technology in saving energy and environment. And Korea can learn from Malaysia‘s green environment  and use of nature,” she said.At the closing ceremony, five groups of students made presentations on ways to improve cities they chose. Some chose to transform Indonesia’s capital Jakarta into a green city, others chose to make Jeju Island and Incheon environmentally-sustainable. The top award was given to the team which suggested ideas for Jeju Island now grappling with the soaring number of tourists and environmental damage by the tourism boom. Some of their ideas for the municipality was to set up more bike rental stations, allow ride-sharing application like Uber and encourage use of electric rental cars.

Transportation is one of the key elements of preparations for the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in the nation's east coast resort town of PyeongChang in Gangwon Province, which lies some 180 kilometers east of Seoul. New roads to be opened this year include a 22-kilometer expressway between Seongnam and Anyang, which will help reduce the overall travel time from Incheon International Airport to the main Olympic venues by 40 minutes to about 95 minutes.A 72-kilometer extension of the expressway between Seoul and Yangyang, Gangwon Province, will also open by the end of this year, reducing the travel time from the capital to the remote coastal city to 90 minutes from the current 130 minutes, according to South Korea's transportation ministry.In June, another new highway linking East Hongcheon and Yangyang in Gangwon Province was opened. It used to take two to three hours to reach Yangyang, 215 kilometers east of Seoul, using existing highways and roads. This has changed, with provincial roads from East Hongcheon to Yangyang being transformed into an expressway. A speedway already exists between the capital and the city of Hongchon. Depending on traffic, it could take about 90 minutes to get from Seoul and Yangyang, according to the ministry. The new expressway will not only allow visitors to have better access to the host cities, but also take some traffic volume off existing expressways.Previously, Yeongdong Expressway 1 was the only major expressway bridging the Seoul Metropolitan area and Gangwon Province, but following the opening of Yeongdong Expressway 2 last November -- a route between Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, and Wonju -- and now with the Dongseo Expressway, Gangwon Province-bound traffic is expected to flow better. The authorities also said they are working on renovating road surfaces and other traffic facilities.While improving long-distance accessibility, Gangwon Provincial Government is trying to ensure comfortable and speedy travel near the Olympic venues. The officials are expanding or constructing 16 roads, and nine of them are 90 percent complete, while rest are 75 percent done.The organizers said these roads will be completed by November.","the upcoming winter olympic games ,upcoming winter olympic games ,upcoming winter olympic games in ,june another new highway linking ,for the upcoming winter olympic","['PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'transportation', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Seoul', 'Seongnam', 'Anyang', 'Incheon International Airport', 'olympic', 'Seoul', 'Yangyang', 'Gangwon Province', ""South Korea 's"", 'East Hongcheon', 'Yangyang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Yangyang', 'Seoul', 'East Hongcheon', 'Yangyang', 'Seoul', 'Yangyang', 'Yeongdong Expressway 1', 'Gangwon Province', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Wonju', 'Gangwon Province', 'Gangwon Provincial Government']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47363976  0.29278159

The ranch in Daegwallyeong allows an opportunity to view herds of cattle and sheep as well as beautiful landscapes all year round. Premium beef produced there, called ""Daegwallyeong hanwoo,"" is a must-eat in the area. An ice park featuring the Olympic rings opens at a snow festival in South Korea`s alpine town of PyeongChang, the venue for the 2018 Winter Olympics, on Feb. 3, 2017. Looking for winter activities for special fun, one option is to visit Hoenggyeri village in Daegwallyeong to take part in a snow and ice festival held every winter.If you want to fish for trout, known as ""songeo"" in Korean, through a hole in the frozen Odae Stream in the town, get ready to experience the PyeongChang Songeo Festival. PyeongChang is home to the fish's first and largest farming area. PyeongChang trout has a springy meat and high quality taste.The Bongpyeong area in the town is the hometown of renowned novelist Lee Hyo-seok  and is famous for its buckwheat production. A visit to Lee's birthplace and his memorial hall gives a glimpse to his literature world, including the writer's most famous story, ""When Buckwheat Flowers Bloom.""A cultural festival featuring the writer takes place every September that is aimed at paying heed to Lee's literature at a time of buckwheat flowers reaching full bloom. At the festival, visitors will find a variety of foods made of buckwheat including jelly ""muk,"" pancake ""jeonbyeong"" and noodles ""makguksu.""Timed with the Olympics, dishes newly developed for visitors include ""hanwoo bulgogi,"" or sliced prime beef marinated in sweet soy sauce, buckwheat pasta, rice topped with trout, ""hwangtae kalguksu, or hand-rolled noodles in dried pollack broth, and trout dumpling. -- Gangneung, a cultural city in harmony with tradition, coffeeIn Gangneung on South Korea's east coast, which will host competitions on ice, visitors are offered opportunities to enjoy touring sites of culture, history and arts as well as the natural scenery.Just 10 minutes from Olympic Park is Gyeongpodae Pavilion, a must-visit place known to be the No. 1 tourist attraction on the east coast. It is often said that in the pavilion, visitors are able to see the sky, the sea, the lake and the moon reflected in a glass of drink and the pupil of one's eye.The lake of Gyeongpo, around which many young people walk on a date, has Wolpa Pavilion on it. The name Wolfa originated from the sight of lake being shaken by waves in the moonlight.Near Gyeongpodae are the birthplace of Heo Nanseolheon, a 16th century poet, and the Ojukheon house, where Shin Saimdang , Korea's maternal icon associated with raising Korean Confucian scholar Yulgok of the Joseon Dynasty, lived. It is also worthwhile to visit Seongyojang, an aristocratic house and one of the best preserved traditional houses in Korea. Cherry blossoms reach full bloom near Gyeongpo Pavillion and Gyeongpo Lake in the city of Gangneung on South Korea`s east coast in this undated file photo. Just south of Gyeongpo Beach is Chodang Dubu Village, which produces ""sundubu,"" or soft Korean-made tofu. In the making of Chodang dubu, salt water from the East Sea is used in the congealing process that results in a soft and light tofu. The name of this village, Chodang, originates from the pen name of Heo Yeop, the father of writer Heo Gyun and poet Heo Nan-eolheon.Other delicacies in the area are raw fish and white noodles in spicy raw fish soup ""mulhoe.""Gangneung is also characterized by the popularity of coffee.People's love of coffee is palpable wherever you go in Gangneung, as there are more than 300 coffee houses in a city with a population of 220,000. Strolling on the coffee street of Anmok Beach, visitors can spot many coffee houses roasting their own coffee beans. A group of seasoned baristas has set up coffee houses on the street since 2007, leading to the establishment of the coffee street.-- Jeongseon, a town of folk song ""Arirang""The town of Jeongseon, which will host the Olympics' alpine skiing speed events, is strongly associated with the origin of ""Arirang,"" a traditional folk song that was put on UNESCO's intangible heritage list in 2012.The Olympic town is best known for ""Jeongseon Arirang,"" one of the folk song's variations that is Intangible Cultural Asset No. 1 designated by the Gangwon provincial government. Essentially a simple song, Arirang consists of the refrain ""Arirang, arirang, arariyo"" and two simple verses, which differ from region to region. Experts estimate the total number of folk songs carrying the title ‘Arirang' at some 3,600 variations belonging to about sixty versions.Visitors to a traditional market that is open every five days in the town are treated to a glimpse into how everyday Koreans used to live and a performance of ""Jeongseon Arirang.""Also at the market are homegrown medical herbs and traditional dishes that include ""gondeure bibimbap,"" or edible wild plant ""gondeure"" mixed with steamed rice, sesame oil and soy sauce. A bronze statue of Virgin Auraji stands in Auraji in Jeongseon, a town in the northeast province of Gangwon. Two other dishes available are the weird-looking but tasty noodles ""olchaengi guksu"" -- noodles of dough droplets that look like tadpoles -- and ""kotdeung chigi"" -- buckwheat noodles. Meaning hitting one's nose ridge, the noodles of kotdeung chigi are rough and solid in texture.In order to do sports with a scenic view, visitors can take part in Jeongseon Rail Bike, a 7.2 kilometer-long ride in a comfortable rail bike that passengers pedal through the area's landscape. The bike sits on a continuous descent that makes it easy to ride along clean valley waters and crimson red foliage.At the end of the ride is Auraji Station, a pier on the Dong River that flows from PyeongChang to the nearby towns of Jeongseon and Yeongwol in Gangwon Province. Auraji is also the birthplace of ""Jeongseon Arirang Aejeongpyeon""The folk song involves the heartbreaking story of a woman whose husband, a raftsman, departs down the river one day never to return. A bronze statue of Virgin Auraji representing the woman stands near the station.","for 2018 winter olympics pyeongchang ,winter olympics set to open ,2018 winter olympics on feb ,pyeongchang winter olympics set to ,2018 pyeongchang winter olympics set","['PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon', 'Gangneung', 'Jeongseon', 'Alpensia', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon Province', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'Daegwallyeong Pass', 'Daegwallyeong', 'Daegwallyeong', 'PyeongChang', 'hoenggyeri village', 'Daegwallyeong', 'Korean', 'Odae Stream', 'the PyeongChang Songeo Festival', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'Bongpyeong', 'Lee Hyo - seok', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Gangneung', ""South Korea 's"", 'Gyeongpodae Pavilion', 'Gyeongpo', 'Wolpa Pavilion', 'Wolfa', 'near Gyeongpodae', 'Heo Nanseolheon', 'Ojukheon', 'Shin Saimdang', 'Korea', 'korean confucian', 'Yulgok', 'Seongyojang', 'Korea', 'Gyeongpo Pavillion', 'Gyeongpo Beach', 'Korean', 'Chodang', 'Chodang', 'Heo Gyun', 'Heo Nan - eolheon', 'Gangneung', 'Anmok Beach', 'Jeongseon', 'Jeongseon', 'Arirang', 'UNESCO', 'Jeongseon Arirang', 'intangible Cultural Asset', 'Gangwon', 'Arirang', 'Arirang', 'Koreans', 'Jeongseon Arirang', 'Virgin Auraji', 'Auraji', 'Jeongseon', 'Gangwon', 'Auraji Station', 'PyeongChang', 'Jeongseon', 'Yeongwol', 'Gangwon Province', 'Auraji', 'Jeongseon Arirang', 'Virgin Auraji']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73057866  0.58946091

YonhapSouth Korea on Wednesday won the bid to host the international quadrennial event in Saemangeum, North Jeolla Province, at the 41st World Scout Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. Saemangeum competed with Poland’s coastal city of Gdansk and won 607 to 365 in a ballot held among the 168 members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. Each member nation was allowed six votes. President Moon Jae-in shared a congratulatory message via Facebook saying, “I’d like to thank the President of the Korea Scout Association, Ham Jong-han and all who .”“I hope the effort of North Jeolla Province leads to the development of Saemangeum,” he said. Moon also vowed to back the event with full government support and said he is personally looking forward to watching the “grand spectacle” of the global gathering.About 5,000 youth scout members from 168 countries are expected to gather in the area for the 12-day event. A government think tank report shows the event is capable of generating about 79.6 billion won  in economic impact and 1,054 jobs at a national scale. The North Jeolla Province government unveiled plans to establish special laws and a committee for the event, along with measures to secure funds. It is also preparing to build sustainable infrastructure dedicated to global youths, with accommodation services and camping grounds. Despite South Korea entering the race almost a year later than Poland, North Jeolla Province officials campaigned rigorously. The delegates personally visited scout associations in major continents to ask for support. The Korea Scout Association has been actively pursuing the 2023 event in order to mark 100 years since its establishment in 1922. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also attended the Baku conference to join the campaign and meet with key scout officials there. The Saemangeum area spans 40,200 hectares and is home to the world’s longest man-made seawall at 33.9 kilometers. The seawall was completed in 2010 to attract businesses mostly in the agriculture and renewable energy industry. It was also certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest man-made sea barrier in the world, in the year of its completion. On the other hand, it has also financially burdened the South Korean government for decades, as both environmental and political issues slowed the construction process. A total of 7.3 trillion won is believed to have been invested in the project so far. The Moon administration has been ramping up efforts to invigorate Saemangeum by building roads connecting the area to other key cities. The first phase of the two-tier construction project is slated to be finished by 2022. The 2023 jamboree coincides with the WOSM’s goal to enter China and expand its membership to 100 million. South Korea hosted the World Scout Jamboree in 1991 in Goseong, Gangwon Province. The event is believed to have contributed to the local community through cultural development and road expansion, with 19,000 scout members from 135 nations participating. The World Scout Jamboree was first organized by The Boy Scout Association in London in 1920. The event is attended by scouts aged between 14 and 17.By Jung Min-kyung","world scout jamboree in 2023 ,south korean delegation celebrates winning ,scout jamboree in 2023 ,korea on wednesday won the ,scout jamboree in 2023 in","['South Korea', 'south korean', 'Baku', 'Azerbaijan', 'YonhapSouth Korea', 'Saemangeum', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Baku', 'Azerbaijan', 'Poland', 'Gdansk', 'the World Organization of the Scout Movement', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Korea Scout Association', 'Ham Jong - han', 'North Jeolla Province', 'saemangeum', 'Moon', 'North Jeolla Province', 'South Korea', 'Poland', 'North Jeolla Province', 'the Korea Scout Association', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Baku', 'Saemangeum', 'the Guinness Book of World Records', 'south korean', 'Moon', 'Saemangeum', 'China', 'South Korea', 'the World Scout Jamboree', 'Goseong , Gangwon Province', 'the Boy Scout Association', 'London', 'Jung Min - kyung']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5784269   0.43982047

Beijing has been adamantly opposed to the move, claiming that it is part of the US missile defense system that will hurt its strategic security interest.The forum is seen as one of just a few joint events between the two countries at a time when the friction over the THAAD system seems to be intensifying.""I think friends refer to relations in which each understands and respects different views, not to agree on everything.

Kim suspended that plan early Tuesday, saying he would watch Washington's behavior ""a little more.""""I have no response to his decisions at all at this time,"" Tillerson said.North Korea conducted two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, sharply increasing tensions in an already volatile region.The missiles, according to many experts and officials, had the range to strike the mainland US. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks at the briefing room of the US State Department in Washington, DC. The UN Security Council adopted tough new sanctions against North Korea to deprive the regime of money needed to finance its missile and nuclear programs.Pyongyang threatened to retaliate against Washington, a key author of the resolution. Then, the Washington Post reported, citing US intelligence, the North has succeeded in miniaturizing a nuclear warhead to fit inside one of its missiles.Trump unleashed a series of unusually strong warnings in response, saying the communist nation should prepare for ""fire and fury"" if it continued to threaten the US He later added that military solutions are ""locked and loaded"" should the North act ""unwisely.""Other US officials, including Tillerson, sought to allay concerns the nuclear armed nations may go to war.Pundits warn of further provocations later this month, when South Korea and the US conduct regular military exercises. The North has long condemned them as a rehearsal for a northward invasion despite the allies' reassurances they are purely defensive in nature.","new sanctions against north korea ,suspended that plan early tuesday ,stopping missile tests tensions flared ,against north korea to deprive ,rehearsal for northward invasion despite","['the United States', 'North Korea', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Tillerson', ""North Korea 's"", 'the State Department', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Guam', 'Kim', 'Washington', 'Tillerson', 'North Korea', 'US', 'US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'the US State Department', 'Washington', 'DC', 'the UN Security Council', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'the Washington Post', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'Tillerson', 'South Korea', 'US']",0,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.59064937  0.07251021

Marine Corps. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the country is capable of defending the peninsula, Guam and the continental US, despite Pyongyang’s series of threats to launch an “enveloping fire” around the western Pacific island. While vowing a “decisive response” to any enemy attack, he was seen downplaying the possibility of a potential US pre-emptive or preventive strike on North Korean facilities, stressing the need to focus on a nonmilitary approach. “I think what is important is not to confuse military action with policy,” Dunford said at a news conference in Seoul. “Our job is to make sure our leadership has an option available to them. I believe there are two things we are clear about -- one is our responsibility to defend against attack, and two is our requirement to make sure we have a decisive response in the event of attack.” His remarks were in line with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal published Sunday jointly by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, in which they said the administration’s “peaceful pressure campaign” involving diplomatic and economic means remains key to resolving the crisis. Dunford, who met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in earlier in the day, said the sides did not discuss any pre-emptive war, and refused to speculate on what might happen if the ongoing campaign fails, calling it a “political decision” for President Donald Trump. “So for the military perspective even, the military dimension for today is directly in support for that diplomatic and economic effort. We are seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis. That is an important message,” he said.“Do we have the capability to defend the peninsula? Do we have the capability to defend Guam and the United States? Yes we do now, and in the future. Based on the projection and capacity we have, we will make our adjustments to our force posture.”His Asia tour, which included a stop in Tokyo over the weekend and was set to bring him to Beijing later in the day, is aimed at assessing the situation on the peninsula and exploring ways to defuse tension. In Beijing, Dunford plans to raise the need for its thorough enforcement of the sweeping UN Security Council resolution adopted last week, while fostering military ties to build strategic trust, he said. “One of the real purposes of my China trip unrelated to North Korea is military to military relations that will result in mitigating the risks of miscalculations and making sure that we have the ability to communicate in a crisis,” he said. During an earlier meeting with South Korea’s Defense Minister Song Young-mo, he reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to defend South Korea and discussed ways to address the escalating threat from North Korea, ministry officials here said. At a separate parliamentary session, Song said it is “highly unlikely” for Pyongyang to carry out missile launches toward Guam as suggested, although the regime has capability to do so. The minister also downplayed the possibility that North Korea has secured key technologies that can deliver its intercontinental ballistic missile to the contiguous US, such as a miniaturized nuclear warhead and a reliable re-entry vehicle capable of withholding extreme heat and pressure when plummeting through the atmosphere.“Based on the assessment between the allies’ high-level military generals, we believe ,” Song said, adding that there is no guarantee that the North has succeeded in securing the re-entry technology and that the South Korean military does not acknowledge that the North has developed miniaturized nuclear warheads.","president washington top priority ,force posture his asia tour ,the president washington top priority ,us military commander on monday ,decision for president donald trump","['US', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'Marine Corps', 'Joseph Dunford', 'the US Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Guam', 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'north korean', 'Dunford', 'Seoul', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Jim Mattis', 'Dunford', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Donald Trump', 'Guam', 'the United States', 'Tokyo', 'Beijing', 'Beijing', 'Dunford', 'UN Security Council', 'China', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Defense', 'Song Young', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Song', 'Pyongyang', 'Guam', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Song', 'south korean']",13,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.37584478  0.60078096

Park said he is envisioning a city that is similar to a southwestern city of Freiburg in Germany, which is known as the greenest city in the world with eco-housing and car-free streets. The Seoul Metropolitan Government’s green energy division told The Korea Herald that it is currently studying a budget expansion for 2018 to financially support more households to install solar panels at their houses. As of June, 34,000 households installed solar panels at their houses, less than 1 percent of a total of 3.6 million households in Seoul. Seoul City officials attributed such a number to a lack of subsidy to promote use of solar power. Currently, the city government is funding 415,000 won  for installing one 1.6 meter wide and 0.9 meter tall solar power panel at home. The resident pays the rest of 200,000 won, or can get additional subsidies from the district office. The panel can be attached to the veranda to generate up to 30 kWh of electricity per month, enough to run a refrigerator. By Kim Da-sol","more households to install solar ,greener energy sources seoul mayor ,seoul metropolitan government green energy ,studying budget expansion for 2018 ,households wishing to install solar","['Seoul City', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Freiburg', 'Germany', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4538855   0.05977679

Starting from next week till the end of September, five buses will have seats that feature a light-weight copy of the 1.5 meter-tall bronze statue of a barefoot girl seated on a chair, created and erected in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul in 2011 by artists Kim Woon-sung and Kim Seo-kyung.  A girl statue symbolizing victims of Japan's sexual slavery during World War II. It is part of a campaign to remember the victims of sexual trafficking by theJapanese military from 1939 to 1945, many of whom have died. “The victims were forcibly taken out of the country during the Japanese colonial era and into isolation and sex slavery . We hope the bus campaign can console and free their souls,” artist Kim Woon-sung who is organizing the event told The Korea Herald. After the bus event, the statues will be moved to five different locations nationwide where they will be displayed for the Chuseok holiday in October, or Korean Thanksgiving.  Around 200,000 women are said to have been forced by the Japanese authorities to work as wartime sex slaves. Most of them were Korean, while others were from China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Indonesia. The issue is a long-standing thorn in Japan‘s diplomatic ties with the victims’ countries. South Korea and Japan signed a settlement deal in 2015, describing it as ”final and irreversible,“ but the new Moon Jae-in administration is seeking to scrap the agreement, calling it “unacceptable to the public sentiment.“ Artists and activists have been installing around the world dozens of the Peace Statues to honor the victims.As of January, there are approximately 55 such statues nationwide, and others in the US, Canada, Australia and China.

Last month, a woman lodged the first complaint with the prosecution, claiming her 5-year-old daughter now has permanently damaged kidneys due to hemolytic-uremic syndrome after eating a Happy Meal burger served with an undercooked patty. A few other families and an individual followed suit, putting the total number of claimed victims at five.Yet, the KCA said no enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, known to cause HUS, was found in any of the 38 hamburgers tested.The announcement came shortly after a regional court dismissed an injunction filed by the local unit of McDonald's seeking to stop the disclosure of the report.McDonald's claimed that the probe did not follow the proper procedures in transporting the food. It said the consumer watchdog official carried the burger in question in a shopping bag instead of a sealed and sterilized container designed to maintain a low temperature.The court, however, dismissed the fast-food chain's request earlier in the day. Following the ruling, McDonald's immediately released a statement saying that it is reviewing whether to file a separate suit against the KCA for disclosing the report results and failing to meet due procedures in the course of carrying out the inspection.","hamburgers sold at five local ,allegations mcdonald served undercooked meat ,38 hamburgers tested the announcement ,burger from mcdonald contained three ,38 hamburgers sold at five","[""McDonald 's"", 'US', 'the Korea Consumer Agency', ""McDonald 's"", 'Staphylococcus', 'McDonald', 'KCA', 'HUS', 'McDonald', ""McDonald 's"", 'McDonald', 'KCA']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20052007  0.39849293

Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army, said the country plans to launch four Hwasong-12 intermediate or long-range ballistic missiles that will ""cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi prefectures of Japan"" and hit waters 30 to 40 kilometers away from Guam.""The KPA Strategic Force will finally complete the plan until mid August and report it to the commander-in-chief of the DPRK nuclear force and wait for his order,"" the North Korean general said.

The Korean Education Center is a government-funded institution aimed at helping foreigners choose the Korean language as their second or third language as part of the school curriculums. Besides Korean language classes, the center is engaged in promoting Korean culture among locals.The center also provides support for the children of overseas and ethnic Koreans to learn the Korean language.An increasing Korean population and the rising influence of the Korean pop culture, also known as the Korean Wave, or ""hallyu,"" have led to the new establishment of the center in Atlanta, where some 240,000 Korean-Americans live and 115 Korean language schools are located, the ministry said.","wednesday south korea opened the ,in atlanta slated for thursday ,and 115 korean language schools ,currently 41 korean education centers ,said wednesday south korea opened","['the Korean Education Center', 'Ministry of Education', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Atlanta', 'US', 'Georgia', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean Education Centers', 'the United States', 'Washington ,', 'DC', 'Los Angeles', 'Houston', 'the Korean Education Center', 'Atlanta', 'Houston', 'the Korean Education Center', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Korean Wave', 'Atlanta', 'korean', 'korean']",17,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00533061 0.99001008 0.16315867]

But is it safe to play there? Does anyone mind the water quality? Children play in a floor fountain at Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul, on Aug. 3. “I think it is a great idea to build splash parks like this for kids to play with water in the middle of the city,” said a mother in her 30s, who brought her 7-year-old son to a splash park at Seoul Square last week, when the daytime high recorded 34 degrees Celsius. “I hope my son did not drink a single drop of that water though,” she said. According to Seoul city officials, the play fountain at Seoul Square is not equipped with any kind of water purifiers, although the water contains some chlorine, as required by law. The water is tested for contamination once every two weeks, in accordance with the law, they added. Whether this is enough seems to depend on who you ask. “I saw from an online community of mothers that waterscape facilities without water purification devices have the same water quality as the water in a swimming pool unfiltered for two weeks. Of course I cannot stop worrying about water contamination,” said a mother in her 40s, who frequently takes her kids to splash parks near the Han River. Lee Cheol-hae, manager of the water recycle system division at Seoul City, said the current level of monitoring is OK, adding that the city has had no issue regarding water quality so far. “But, we are planning to strengthen monitoring during the summer vacation period and conduct  up to three times a day at certain facilities,” he said. To enforce stricter monitoring and further alleviate public concerns, the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Monday announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive safety examination of a total of 186 waterscape facilities currently in use, over the next three weeks. Seoul Metropolitan Government officials, along with the Seoul Institute of Health and Environment, the Animal Health Laboratory and district public health centers, will check the levels of pH, turbidity and E. coli, among others, in water collected from the facilities, they added. Of the 204 waterscape facilities that are used for children’s water play in summer in Seoul, 81 are not equipped with water purification devices, which would enable constant and automatic water quality management, Seoul Metropolitan Government revealed in response to an inquiry from The Korea Herald. The number is the same as last year’s, as not a single facility had new purification devices installed this year, the city said. Some popular splash parks, such as the one at Mulbit Square by the Han River and a fountain at Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul, are also not equipped with the devices. “It costs at least 10 million won to install an automatic water purification device, which makes it difficult for the city government to practically change all of the water facilities,” said the city government’s Lee. Another problem is that the city’s measure leaves many splash pads and water playgrounds unchecked, as there is a loophole in the regulations: privately-run water facilities in big residential complexes. The current law covers water fountains, artificial streams, spray grounds and splash parks in privately run hospitals, tourism venues, sports facilities and children’s facilities, on top of all public facilities, but it leaves out those in private residential complexes. “We thought that water fountains and splash pads installed at public facilities should be prioritized  since more people have access to them,” said Chung Kyung-yoon from the Environment Ministry, which pushed for the revision of the related law to have all waterscape facilities subject to the law to receive regular checks every 15 days and report the results to the authorities. The amended and toughened law came into effect late last month. The ministry said it is currently considering whether to expand the law’s scope to include those in apartment complexes. A decision will be made in November, it said. By Kim Da-sol","her kids to splash parks ,the play fountain at seoul ,play in summer in seoul ,to splash park at seoul ,old son to splash park","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Lee Cheol - hae', 'Seoul City', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Seoul Institute of Health and Environment', 'the Animal Health Laboratory', 'pH', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Chung Kyung - yoon', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09150585  0.1840495

Yonhap“There have been consistent talks within the International Olympics Committee meetings here to send the torch to Mount Kumkang or Pyongyang during the final stages of the relay in Gangwon Province -- with distance and time in consideration,” the source said, requesting anonymity. The insider based the time frame on the theory the torch would travel by foot and boat. The organizing committee for the 2018 Winter Games announced in April the torch will arrive in South Korea on Nov. 1 from Greece to embark on a tour through 17 cities nationwide. It is then scheduled to pass through another 18 cities and counties in Gangwon Province. The prospects of a North Korean leg of the torch relay look slim, however.  The source stressed that reviving frozen inter-Korean dialogue was a prerequisite of the collaboration. “The committee’s talks on the plan are on hold due to diplomatic circumstances. They are expected to resume once inter-Korean ties recover,” the source said. The source also revealed North Korea’s recent series of intercontinental ballistic missile liftoffs have posed as obstacles and the committee has not yet officially informed South Korea’s Ministry of Unification of the plan. The North Korean regime’s ongoing silence toward the Moon Jae-in administration’s offer of an olive branch is dimming prospects that the plan will come to fruition. It already indirectly rejected Seoul’s offer to hold separate military and Red Cross talks at the truce village of Panmunjeom in July. But Seoul has refused to give up hope that it can work out sports exchanges with Pyongyang, including a South-North unified team for the Olympics next year. On Monday, South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism Do Jong-whan pledged to continue to persuade North Korea to participate in the upcoming Winter Games, according to Yonhap News Agency. Do said discussions to fuel the inter-Korean sports exchanges were being carried out, referring to a July meeting between World Taekwondo chief Choue Chung-won and North Korean IOC member Chang Ung. The two reportedly talked about a possible WT demonstration team performance staged in North Korea. When he first took office in June, Do voiced his wish to extend the torch relay route to key North Korean regions such as Kaesong, Pyongyang, and Mount Kumkang, but it was uncertain whether the IOC had received the message. President Moon said “South Korea will keep the doors open until the last minute” for its Northern neighbor to respond to the invitation for the Winter Games, during an Olympic promotional event held on July 24, marking 200 days until the start of the games. Moon added that the IOC has also agreed to “open the doors for North Korea’s participation” and Pyongyang’s response is the key to a historic event. Mount Kumkang, a tourist destination in North Korea known for its beautiful scenery, straddles the North Korean side of Gangwon Province. It is in close proximity to PyeongChang -- the designated venue for the upcoming Winter Olympics -- which lies some 180 kilometers east of Seoul in South Korea’s side of Gangwon Province. The 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games take place from Feb. 9 to 25.By Jung Min-kyung","for the upcoming winter olympics ,olympics torch for the 2018 ,pyeongchang olympics organizing committee ,2018 pyeongchang winter games may ,torch for the 2018 pyeongchang","['PyeongChang', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee Hee - beom', 'Insooni', 'Gangwon Province', 'Choi Moon - soon', 'the International Olympics Committee', 'Kumkang', 'Pyongyang', 'Gangwon Province', 'South Korea', 'Greece', 'Gangwon Province', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Unification', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Red Cross', 'Panmunjeom', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'inter - korean', 'World Taekwondo', 'Choue Chung - won', 'north korean', 'Chang Ung', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kaesong , Pyongyang', 'Mount Kumkang', 'IOC', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'IOC', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Kumkang', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Gangwon Province', 'PyeongChang', 'Seoul', 'South Korea ’s', 'Gangwon Province', 'PyeongChang', 'Jung Min - kyung']",8,"[ 0.          5.          3.         ... -0.15833153  0.31619355

""It's feared that our  efforts will end in vain, if an ICBM is fired  and the THAAD battery is deployed in .""Do, however, said efforts to maintain sports exchanges between the two Koreas must go on since the process itself is important.""Problems get solved when military tensions ease after reaching a peak,"" he said.

Do Jong-whan, minister of culture, sports and tourism, speaks during an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul on Aug. 4, 2017. Do said the South is pushing to bring in the North Korean athletes to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics with help from the International Olympic Committee. For the Paralympics, he added that the South is pursuing North Korean participation through its own channel. ""The IOC's stance is basically to have the two Koreas exchange peacefully through sports and North Korea participating ,"" he said. ""But if the South is hasty, it may be forced to take responsibility for the outcomes, and many unexpected things could occur. So all the plans should be approached step by step with a broad perspective.""Do said inter-Korean exchanges in other sports are also being discussed. In June, a North Korean taekwondo demonstration team performed at the World Taekwondo Championships in South Korea.  ""World Taekwondo chief Choue Chung-won met with North Korean IOC member Chang Ung last month to discuss the WT demonstration team's performance in North Korea in September,"" he said. ""Discussions are also under way for North Korea's participation in the Asian Cup & Asian Inter-Club Weightlifting Championships . Since weightlifting is a sport that North Korea collects medals in, we have a high expectation of its participation.""With the PyeongChang Olympics less than 200 days away, Do said the government will lead the way to promote the first-ever Winter Games in South Korea. He said the government will help South Koreans pay more attention to the games and let them participate in the promotion activities. ""I think the G-100 and the torch relay events will be important for the promotion of the Olympics,"" he said. ""We will escort our president to PyeongChang when there are events. Not only the Gangwon provincial government or the organizing committee, but the  government will also step up to promote the Olympics."" When asked about the post-Olympic plans for the competition venues, Do said he will come up with ""sustainable measures.""

The annual ASEAN Regional Forum hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will gather together 27 foreign ministers from nations across the region and the European Union. The ARF launched in 1994 is a rare international gathering attended by the North, along with all other countries involved in the now-suspended six-party talks aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions. This year's forum comes amid increasing pressure on the North following its two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, which prompted the United Nations Security Council to adopt a fresh sanctions resolution Saturday .A chairman's statement will be issued at the end of the forum. The ARF statement issued after last year's meeting in Laos expressed concerns over tensions around the Korean Peninsula and its support for efforts to denuclearize the North.  Keen attention is placed on North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho's remarks during the meeting. Since his arrival here Sunday, Ri has stayed mum. Last year he talked about the North's stance on the UNSC sanctions. In a bilateral meeting with Ri on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for Pyongyang to stop nuclear and missile tests. Their traditionally close relations have been strained after North Korea's defiant military provocations despite Beijing's warnings.An informed source told Yonhap that the North will likely hold a press meeting after the ARF is over to make its stance on the growing pressure on its regime and other issues clear.","manila on monday to discuss ,fresh sanctions resolution saturday chairman ,nuclear ambitions this year forum ,meet in manila on monday ,military threats the annual asean","['MANILA', 'Manila', ""North Korea 's"", 'ASEAN Regional Forum', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'the European Union', 'ARF', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'ARF', 'Laos', 'keen', 'north korean', ""Ri Yong - ho 's"", 'Ri', 'UNSC', 'Ri', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'Beijing', 'Yonhap', 'ARF']",17,"[ 0.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00 ... -4.08570111e-01

The North’s latest test of an ICBM marked a step closer to them being capable of striking the US mainland with a nuclear weapon. To attack the South, conventional artillery and short-range missiles would suffice. The situation gives many South Koreans an eerie feeling that their fate is falling into the hands of others, namely US President Donald Trump and the North’s leader Kim Jong-un. “My biggest worry is that the US would plot a pre-emptive attack on North Korea and carry it out without consulting our government,” said Kim Ho-joon, a 40-year-old office worker. “I think it may be a plausible option for the US, because the war would play out on the Korean Peninsula, not on their land.” A 30-year-old Korean-American office worker, Lee Ha-young expressed similar concerns over what the escalating hostilities between the North and US would mean for South Korea. “What if Trump posts a tweet like ‘North Korea is out of control and it must be taken down’ and North Korea takes it as a declaration of war?“North Korea is irrational, but not irrational enough to risk the survival of its own regime. But with Trump’s reckless words, I fear the North may feel pressured to do something more dangerous,” Lee said.  US President Donald Trump. YonhapFueling such worries have been Trump’s inconsistent remarks swinging between the possibilities of a military strike against the North to a more reserved diplomatic approach, as well as the growing belligerence among Americans against the defiant North Korean regime. In an interview with Reuters in April, after ordering a missile attack on Syria for its use of chemical weapon against civilians, the US president said a “major, major conflict” with the North was possible. Two days after the North’s July 4 ICBM test, which Trump had previously said “won’t happen,” he said he had “severe things” on his mind. And this week came the unnerving news that the US president told a senator that he was willing to go to war with the North. “If there’s going to be a war to stop him , it will be over there ” Sen. Lindsey Graham said on a TV show. “If thousands die, they’re going to die over there. They’re not going to die over here -- and he’s  told me that to my face.” A Fox News poll in July found 55 percent of Americans think the US should seek military options against the North and 68 percent said they were worried about a war with North Korea. A Washington Post survey revealed a similar result, with 74 percent of respondents expressing concerns about the possibility of a “full-scale war” with the North and 66 percent saying the communist country poses a “direct threat” to US security. “I don’t know exactly what Trump’s policy on North Korea is,” said 28-year-old graduate student Ham Young-ku. “Sometimes he talks about military strikes and then suggests diplomacy. ... I just hope he won’t do something crazy.” In Seoul‘s National Assembly, conservative opponents of President Moon Jae-in are speaking up about South Korea being sidelined in US-led discussions on the North Korean issue, which is critical to the South’s national security. They wanted the president to cut short his scheduled vacation and return to work immediately, saying the security crisis the country is currently facing is the greatest since the end of World War II.To be sure, much of the political rhetoric on the North is meant to criticize liberal President Moon -- whose recently unveiled peninsular peace initiative is “naive and unrealistic,” according to them -- not to offer an objective assessment of the country’s security conditions. Military experts here and abroad view the idea of the US carrying out a pre-emptive strike on the North, in particular without consulting South Korea, as far-fetched. The last time the US seriously considered attacking North Korea was in 1994 when then-Defense Secretary William J. Perry sought a “surgical strike” against the North’s nuclear reactor. He canceled the plan after concluding that it would escalate into a full-scale war that could lead to hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties. Even if the US were to proceed with a surprise military campaign -- like the one Trump conducted in Syria -- the allies have built “procedural safeguards” that can prevent Trump or any other US president from acting unilaterally, experts said. Under the current chain of command, the Combined Forces Command, the allies’ supreme command during the wartime, cannot engage in a military mission unless there is a prior agreement between the two countries’ military and political leaders.“The United States’ unilateral pre-emptive strike against North Korea is impossible unless the US wants to completely destroy the South Korea-US alliance,” said Kim Yeol-su, an international politics professor at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul. President Moon and top security officials in Seoul have said repeatedly that they will not let another war happen on the peninsula. In an effort to assuage the public again, Cheong Eui-yong, chief of the National Security Council, on Thursday revealed that the Seoul government had confirmed with the US, through many channels, that war would not break out. By Kim Da-sol, Yeo Jun-suk","women university in seoul president ,old korean american office worker ,seoul president moon and top ,university in seoul president moon ,in seoul president moon","['Seoul', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Kim Jin - yong', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korea Herald', 'North ’s', 'US', 'North ’s', 'ICBM', 'US', 'South Koreans', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'North ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Kim Ho - joon', 'US', 'korean', 'Lee Ha - young', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'Trump ’s', 'Lee', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump ’s', 'Americans', 'north korean', 'Reuters', 'Syria', 'US', 'Trump', 'US', 'Lindsey Graham', 'Fox News', 'Americans', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Washington Post', 'communist', 'US', 'Trump ’s', 'North Korea', 'Ham Young - ku', 'Seoul‘s National Assembly', 'Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'Moon', 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'William J.

According to a team led by Oh Jeong-eun, a professor of environmental engineering at Pusan National University, at least seven kinds of drug components were detected from samples of untreated wastewater from Busan’s three major sewage systems from July to September 2013. One of them directly controls wastewater from popular beaches. The seven drug components include methamphetamine -- the most common illegal drug in Korea -- codein, meperidine and cis-tramadol, which are normally used in painkillers. The team calculated the amounts using a method called sewage epidemiology. The daily consumption of meth per 1,000 inhabitants went up to 31.89 milligrams during the peak summer season, about 2.4 times higher than in winter. The amount is equivalent to nearly 2 percent of the average consumption in European countries.Sewage epidemiology is an analysis method used to obtain direct evidence on how much drugs a community consumes by looking into what is excreted into sewage systems. The daily consumption of meth per 1,000 inhabitants rose to 31.89 mg in August from 21.20 mg in July, and dropped to 17.88 mg in September as the vacation season ended. The analysis was conducted on three separate occasions. The end of July and the entire of August are the most favored periods for vacation in South Korea. Previous data from the team showed that the daily consumption of meth per 1,000 inhabitants was 13.10 mg in December 2012. The team, the first to try sewage epidemiology in Korea, had previously found that 410 kilograms of drugs are consumed every year in Korea, nearly 20 times larger than the amount seized by the prosecution annually.Their findings were published in the latest issue of Science of the Total Environment, an international scientific journal.“Drug consumption is not only a serious issue in developed countries but rising as a social problem around the globe. There’s more need to actively make use of sewage epidemiology to prevent drug-related crimes in Korean society,” said Professor Oh who conducted the research. As of last year, 8,853 people were arrested for drug-related crimes. Nearly 80 percent of the narcotics confiscated by the Korea Customs Service were methamphetamines, according to police. By Kim Da-sol","popular beaches the seven drug ,major sewage systems from july ,wastewater from popular beaches ,most famous beach in southeastern ,consumed every year in korea","['Busan', 'South Koreans', 'Haeundae Beach', 'Busan', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Pusan National University', 'Busan ’s', 'Korea', 'european', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Science of the Total Environment', 'korean', 'the Korea Customs Service', 'Kim Da - sol']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73527426  0.2138384

According to the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, Chung revealed that the US does not consider war likely, in a meeting with the party’s Floor Leader Rep. Woo Won-shik and other lawmakers at the National Assembly.  National Security Council chief Chung Eui-yong speaks to reporters at the National Assembly on Thursday. Yonhap“Chung reported that  has confirmed  that war will not break out, through many channels,” Democratic Party floor spokesman Rep. Kang Hoon-sik said. According to Kang, Chung revealed that he and Seoul’s Minister of National Defense Song Young-moo and Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha are in constant contact with their US counterparts, and that Seoul was in similarly close communication with China. “Chung reported that based on their conversations, the danger of imminent war on the peninsula is deemed unlikely.”Kang added that the lawmakers present at the meeting requested Chung maintain Seoul’s relations with Beijing and Washington, and added that the parliament will closely monitor how the environmental impact study on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is carried out. Following North Korea’s latest missile launch, which is widely considered to represent significant advancements in Pyongyang intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities, President Moon Jae-in ordered the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense deployment to be hastened. At an NSC meeting following the missile launch, Moon ordered four more THAAD launchers to be deployed in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, on a temporary basis. The environmental impact study reinitiated by the Moon Jae-in administration will go ahead as planned. The government maintains that the decision to deploy THAAD in South Korea will not be changed. At Thursday’s meeting, Chung also informed the lawmakers that the related government organizations are taking steps to counter North Korea’s growing threat, including the temporary THAAD deployment, and initiating talks with the US on revising the missile development agreement. Regarding North Korea, Chung told reporters that the Kim Jong-un regime will face tougher international sanctions. Highlighting that North Korea’s actions could bring “fundamental changes in the security environment for South Korea and the region,” Chung said that Seoul must respond effectively to the North’s provocations.","consider war on the korean ,national assembly on thursday yonhap ,north korea chung told reporters ,democratic party floor spokesman rep ,steps to counter north korea","['South Korea', 'US', 'Seoul ’s', 'National Security Council', 'Chung Eui - yong', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Chung', 'US', 'Woo Won - shik', 'the National Assembly', 'National Security Council', 'Chung Eui - yong', 'the National Assembly', 'Yonhap“Chung', 'Democratic Party', 'Kang Hoon - sik', 'Kang', 'Chung', 'Seoul', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'US', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'North Korea ’s', 'pyongyang', 'Moon Jae - in', 'NSC', 'Moon', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'South Korea', 'Chung', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Chung', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Chung', 'Seoul', 'North ’s']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16729914  0.77848363

Last January, Meari claimed that North Korea’s National Science Institute had developed and introduced a variety of 3-D PC games. The state mouthpiece added that one of the game’s main purposes is to educate its users through the use of realistic strategies, tactics and techniques. It also stressed that the game reflects modern-day soccer and trends. Like the “FIFA” video game series, the game allows its players to experience simulations of major tournaments including the prestigious UEFA Champions League and the UEFA European Championship. The game also features realistic characters based on actual soccer players and what is perceived as an expert evaluation of the athletes’ statistics. The statistics in such games include speed, stamina and temperament. Complementary settings such as training and highlights are also included in the package, which happens to be a characteristic of the FIFA series. The game is reportedly built for PC, mobiles with the Android system and Kinect, which is a line of motion sensing devices by Microsoft. North Korea has been developing computer games over the years, despite most of its citizens’ restricted access to the internet, PCs and mobile phones. Most of its games are 2-D flash games of poor quality, distributed through propaganda sites. Online services and technology are permitted only to the privileged, with the country’s telecommunications network tightly controlled. In 2013, foreigners in North Korea gained internet access via a 3G network run by the state’s wireless telecommunications provider Koryolink, according to foreign media outlets. “FIFA” is a football video game annually released by Electronic Arts, a US-based video game developer. It is a household name among similar sports video games, with a record as one of the best-selling video game franchises.

In 2008, the designation was canceled in exchange for progress in multilateral denuclearization talks.State terrorism sponsors face restrictions on US foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and financial and other sanctions.Following the North's two tests last month of what it claims to have been an intercontinental ballistic missile, Seoul, Washington and other partner countries have been discussing coordinated punitive measures.Asked about the ""regime change"" issue, Yun was quoted as saying that it is for putting pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and that under new sanctions, the North would, in the end, come to the negotiating table.","opposition lawmaker here said thursday ,military drills with south korea ,multilateral denuclearization talks state terrorism ,his recent trip to washington ,korea party speaking during press","['the United States', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Khang Hyo - shang', 'the Liberty Korea Party', 'Washington', 'Joseph Yun', ""the US State Department 's"", 'North Korea', 'Khang Hyo - shang', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'the State Department', 'Khang', 'Yun', 'Washington', 'US', 'Washington', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Yun', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.56334895  0.49183059

(Park ...","When Ahn Seung-hwa started her career in volunteer management as chief program manager of South Cheungcheong Volunteer Center in 1999, she had no office or budget to run. “Me and two other colleagues literally started from scratch,” Ahn recalled in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.  Ahn Seung-hwa, CEO of Seoul Volunteer Center, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald in her office in Seoul. The center was among several community-level facilities that opened in 1997, as part of the government’s campaign to promote and nurture volunteerism in South Korea, after rapid urbanization and industrialization destroyed communities. Ahn was one of the few first-generation volunteer coordination and management experts in the country. Nearly two decades have passed since then, but Ahn says South Korea still has a long way to go when it comes to discovering the joy of helping others.  In her opinion, the current education system takes the wrong approach to volunteerism, making students feel as if volunteer work is extra homework -- something that they do because they are “told to do so.”“It’s so burdensome for young students to wake up early in the morning and go pick up trash for a certain amount of hours just because they are told to do so. They would think that volunteering is time-consuming, boring and meaningless.”Until 2000, South Korea’s middle and high schools forced students to spend 20 hours annually volunteering for their community. It has since become more flexible and the required hours are down to 10. The system of mandatory hours of community service or volunteer work has led to a barrage of students each year counterfeiting their certificates of volunteer service or inflating their service hours.Ahn, who now heads the Seoul Volunteer Center, said that South Korea’s volunteering culture is “conservative,” often associated with the stereotype of one-off street cleaning campaigns or helping the disabled at welfare centers. “Most volunteering programs here involve welfare programs. Volunteer program facilitators as well as participants should think out of the box and forget the concept of mandatory volunteer hours. Volunteering can be more fun and easy, done in everyday life.”“Volunteering is not difficult. It is as simple as showing others that we respect them and sharing what we have,” she said. In a similar vein, the Seoul volunteer center is exploring creative ways of volunteering, she stressed. At a recent conference organized by her center, over 250 volunteer program managers, experts and social workers gathered to discuss ways to change the volunteering paradigm, such as venturing into digital platforms. In a society where social disconnection and isolation are major problems, she said regular volunteering can help communities. She suggested that active participation from those in their 20s and 30s could make a society even stronger.“Although those in their 20 and 30s are riddled with serious unemployment, the low birthrate and housing problems, a good dose of volunteering can help them contribute to community and provide them with the time to look back on themselves amid busy daily routines,” she said. Noting that the young generation’s participation in volunteering is more crucial ever than before, the Seoul Volunteer Center plans to financially support startups and social entrepreneurs that strive to make a social impact and spread positive messages. “We do not know yet the exact budget for the project. I think it will be probably small, but we’ve decided to help them because it is our -- as a volunteer center -- role to serve the society,” Ahn said.

The 2012 World Expo was the historic city’s turning point, shaping it into a tourist destination.  Gaedo Island is one of 365 small islands that surround Yeosu. YeosuThe city attracted about 13 million tourists annually in both 2015 and 2016, according to government data.Citizen-centered governmentThe city’s Mayor Ju Cheol-hyeon has been working toward establishing a more citizen-centered governing system. The Committee of 100 Yeosu Residents was formed as a watchdog for the city’s expanding projects and businesses when Ju took office three years ago. “The committee of 100 citizens has been ‘filtering’ necessary policies through the perspectives of citizens since I took office three years ago,” said Ju. The system is based on his belief that the “citizens are the mayors themselves,” which highlights the trust and partnership between the city government and Yeosu residents. The committee members can contribute to rural development throughout their term -- one year per citizen.  Yeosu City Mayor Ju Cheol-hyeon. Yeosu“The committee’s system and support brought transparency to the city’s decision-making process and a noticeable cutback in civil complaints,” added Ju. Yeosu, which means “beautiful water,” was a sleepy coastal town until the 2012 World Expo, which spawned big-scale attractions such as the 16,400-square-meter Aqua Planet aquarium. About 288,000 residents currently reside in the town that is quickly evolving into one of South Korea’s top tourist destinations. Technology and development have swept across the city, but it has struggled to adjust to the sudden change. The city reported that its accommodation options have expanded from 19 venues in 2014 to 88 this year. Overpriced food and poor customer service are the two core complaints that Ju has prioritized to solve. The mayor launched a team dedicated to food sanitation and a 200-member panel that reviews and rates local hotels and restaurants. In addition, service sector operators with high ratings are endorsed by Yeosu for promotion, while others are strongly encouraged to perform better. This led to a drop in civilian complaints from 169 in 2015 to 94 in 2016, according to Yeosu’s metropolitan government. “Citizens are the true minds behind the city government, but there wasn’t enough room for them to participate before,” Ju said. “To overcome this issue, we decided to create more room for community participation and we are currently experiencing its results after it led to the development of the area.”Summer attractions The southernmost city of South Jeolla Province came into the global spotlight when it hosted the 2012 World Expo. The city’s landscape created synergy with the event’s theme, “the sea that lives and the coast that breathes.” The summer expo promoted 105 nations and 10 international organizations. It attracted 82 million visitors before it wrapped up in August 2012. A nighttime view of Yeosu. YeosuIts success opened smoother transportation routes to the city along with the high-speed rail KTX from Seoul to Yeosu Expo Station. The station is located within walking distance to major tourist attractions. The city is also gearing up to use its geographical and cultural assets this summer to attract visitors. Tourists can go sightseeing in cable cars that glide above waters, giving them an aerial view of the ocean. A rail bike trail that extends 3.5 kilometers along breezy mountains is an immersive experience that allows users to connect with nature. Yeosu’s annual fireworks festival will be held from Aug. 11-12 at Jongpo Maritime Park, also known as Adm. Yi Sun-sin square. Launched last year, the program drew 260,000 tourists and boasted nighttime views of the city’s seashores. Along with its fireworks show, the city plans to host a busking festival from Friday to Sunday on stages installed across Jongpo Park. It has been cultivating a reputation as a popular busking spot after the release of the popular song “Nightscape at Yeosu Seashore” by indie band Busker Busker in 2012. A small-scale beer festival and art markets will complement the main festival. For hungry festivalgoers, the city takes pride in its food street full of “pocha,” or street vendors selling snacks and alcohol. They mainly serve seafood dishes. The history of the city is also hard to ignore. Its nearby waters were a fierce battleground between Korea and Japan in the 16th century. Adm. Yi Sun-sin, who is revered as one of the greatest military leaders here, led the naval force with tactics that blocked Japanese invasion.

Standard one-week trips cost about $2,000.But Han Chol-Su, vice-director of the Wonsan Zone Development Corporation, denied that the loss of business would have any impact. “If the US government says Americans cannot come to this country, we don’t care a bit,” he told AFP in Pyongyang.Washington announced the move after the death of Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was sentenced to 15 years’ hard labour in the North for trying to steal a propaganda poster.Warmbier was sent home in a mysterious coma last month -- Pyongyang said he had contracted botulism -- and died soon afterwards, prompting US President Donald Trump to denounce the “brutal regime”.The State Department has long warned its citizens against travelling to North Korea, telling them they are “at serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea’s system of law enforcement”, which “imposes unduly harsh sentences for actions that would not be considered crimes in the United States”.Han’s organisation is trying to promote the Wonsan-Mount Kumgang International Tourist Zone, a grandiose vision of a tourism hub on the east coast.He said Washington’s move was politically motivated. “The US has been continuing with sanctions against us but we don’t care at all,” he said.Pyongyang officials consistently say that sanctions against their country have no effect on it.But according to tour companies business has already been hit hard by recent developments, including tensions over the North’s weapons programmes, with Trump administration officials warning that military action was an option on the table. “Certainly, of all the dramas that have gone on lately, the Warmbier issue is the biggest one for tourism,” said Simon Cockerell, general manager of market leader Koryo Tours which has seen bookings fall 50 percent. “It’s depressed the market quite considerably.”The US decision, he said, would hit North Koreans working in the tourist sector, and wipe out “any possibility of a humanising human element between those two sides who demonise each other so much”.Matt Kulesza, of Young Pioneer Tours -- the company which brought Warmbier to the country -- said the ban’s effect on the North would be “absolutely nothing”.But Americans, he added, would lose “the freedom to travel to DPRK  and experience the DPRK for themselves”.  Gleaming towersA promotional video for Han’s project takes in beach resorts, the Masikryong skiing centre, and Mount Kumgang, renowned throughout the peninsula for its beauty.It shows the port of Wonsan transformed into a mass of gleaming towers, shopping, entertainment and trade districts, served by multiple transport links including a dual carriageway with four lanes in each direction -- a far cry from the bumpy potholed road with unlit tunnels that currently links it to Pyongyang.Air routes from China, Russia and Japan are also displayed, but no regular international flights have so far been scheduled to Wonsan’s newly-built airport.n 2015, said Han’s colleague Ri Kyong-Chol, there had been negotiations to start direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai. But “since then, because of political circumstances, the participants of the other side balked”.The vast majority of foreign tourists to North Korea are Chinese.Han was unable to put a cost on the scheme. Foreign investment would be welcome, but so far none had been forthcoming due to US sanctions, he said.Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans used to visit Mount Kumgang every year, travelling to a Seoul-funded tourist resort that was the first major inter-Korean cooperation project.But that came to an abrupt end in 2008 when a North Korean soldier shot dead a South Korean tourist who strayed off the approved path and Seoul suspended the trips.New South Korean president Moon Jae-In favours engagement with the North to bring it to the negotiating table as well as sanctions.In a five-year plan unveiled last week, his government said it would move to resume tours to Mount Kumgang and re-open the shuttered Kaesong Joint Industrial Zone, where South Korean firms employed tens of thousands of North Korean workers, “when conditions are ripe”.But the North’s tourism development plan did not factor in visitors from the other side of the divided peninsula, Han said. “We don’t need to think of them,” he said. “North and South should cooperate among themselves but because of US sanctions, this is not being done. Southern authorities have no intention to do so either.”","seoul suspended the trips new ,korean soldier shot dead south ,washington ban on us citizens ,dead south korean tourist who ,trips new south korean president","['pyongyang', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'United Nations', 'Americans', 'Han Chol - Su', 'the Wonsan Zone Development Corporation', 'US', 'Americans', 'AFP', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Otto Warmbier', 'the University of Virginia', 'Warmbier', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'the State Department', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'United', 'Han ’s', 'Washington', 'US', 'pyongyang', 'Trump', 'Simon Cockerell', 'Koryo Tours', 'US', 'North Koreans', 'Matt Kulesza', 'Young Pioneer Tours', 'warmbi', 'Americans', 'Han ’s', 'Masikryong', 'Mount Kumgang', 'Wonsan', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'Wonsan ’s', 'Han ’s', 'Ri Kyong - Chol', 'Beijing', 'Shanghai', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'Han', 'US', 'South Koreans', 'Mount Kumgang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - In', 'Mount Kumgang', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'the North ’s', 'Han', 'North and South', 'US']",2,"[ 0.          2.          4.         ... -0.76593101  0.45834953

Under the deal, Seoul can load up to 500 kg of warheads on missiles with the range of 800 km.  In this file photo provided by the Ministry of Defense on June 23, 2017, Hyunmoo-2, a new homegrown ballistic missile with a range of 800 kilometers, is test-fired from a mobile launch pad at a test site of the Agency for Defense Development in Anheung, 200 kilometers southwest of Seoul, the same day with President Moon Jae-in on hand.

It has recouped money spent on the work through yearly lawsuits against the central government. Based on the Status of Forces Agreement between South Korean and US forces, the responsibility to compensate a third party for a damage related to US military bases lies in the South Korean government. This is the 13th time Seoul has demanded compensation since the oil contamination was first reported in 2001.  Concerns have been intensifying over the health effects of exposure to contamination on the base.

Pyongyang rejected the offer for talks with silence, refusing to confirm the meeting Seoul hoped to hold Friday.  Relatives separated by the Korean War bid a tearful farewell to each other after a reunion event in 2015. YonhapHowever, the meeting between the two Korea’s respective Red Cross officials on Aug. 1 remains scheduled, and if the meeting materializes it is expected to act as a key to reviving cross-border reunion events. The events were indefinitely halted in 2015. Amid North Korea’s cold shoulder, several South Korean citizens are holding out hope to meet their relatives in the North. “We received three new applications July 17-21, following the current administration’s offer to hold a Red Cross meeting with North Korea,” a South Korean Red Cross official said Sunday. “We also sent seven more application forms to family members who requested them after the announcement of the talks offer -- they are expected to apply by mail.”The South Korean government urged the North to respond swiftly after the military talks failed, but said they would remain patient with the process. “It’s necessary for us to make step-by-step efforts in a calm manner. ... We expect the North’s swift, positive response,” deputy ministry spokesperson Lee Eugene said during a press briefing Friday, stressing there is no “deadline” for cross-border dialogue.But luring Pyongyang back to the negotiation table is forecast to be a time-sensitive task for Seoul, with the physically frail state of the remaining war-torn family members in South Korea. According to the Ministry of Unification, out of 131,200 South Korean family members registered in a government database, only 60,513 are alive as of 2017. There are 70,687 deceased members on the rolls, which amounts to 53.9 percent of registered applicants. About 62.6 percent of the remaining population is over 80 years old and in June, 258 members passed away. North Korea’s state-owned newspaper Rodong Sinmun said Thursday that it is nonsense for Seoul to hope to improve inter-Korean relations while supporting sanctions against Pyongyang simultaneously.Pyongyang has also demanded the return of 12 North Korean restaurant workers who defected to South Korea last year, claiming they were abducted against their will. While South Korea hopes for improved inter-Korean relations, the situation faced by North Koreans eyeing to escape continues to deteriorate. A North Korean family of five attempting to defect to South Korea via China took their own lives when captured and questioned by Chinese Police, according to the Yonhap News Agency on Saturday. The father of the family was a 50-year-old former district executive and is believed to have possessed poisonous substances upon entering the Chinese border, said Ahn Chan-il, the head of the Seoul-based World North Korea Research Center.

A monument to comfort women stands in the garden of Trinity Episcopal Church near Cliffside Park, New Jersey, on July 19, 2017. It marked the fourth such monument in New Jersey and the eighth in the United States.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were mobilized by the Japanese military to work in front-line brothels during the war. Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910-45.The issue of the ""comfort women,"" a euphemistic term for the victims, has long been a thorn in South Korea-Japan ties. The two sides reached a deal in 2015 to resolve the issue, but many of the victims have rejected it, saying it fails to address their grievances. Korean residents and American veterans of the Korean War attend an unveiling ceremony for a monument to comfort women at Trinity Episcopal Church near Cliffside Park, New Jersey, on July 19, 2017. The tablet is engraved with a picture of a girl crouching with her face in her hands, as well as a description of the atrocity that took place.Kim Jin-sook, a leader of the Korean community, said she hopes the monument will serve as a reminder of the painful history of the comfort women and of the fact that it should not be repeated.","wednesday to commemorate the korean ,to commemorate the korean women ,new jersey wednesday to commemorate ,korean war attend an unveiling ,brothels during the war korea","['New Jersey', 'New Jersey', 'korean', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Trinity Episcopal Church', 'korean', 'american', 'Trinity Episcopal Church', 'Cliffside Park', 'New Jersey', 'New Jersey', 'the United States', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'american', 'Trinity Episcopal Church', 'Cliffside Park', 'New Jersey', 'Kim Jin - sook', 'korean']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14356256  0.19776765

The State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee also advised the Moon Jae-in government to use all possible means to address the North's nuclear threat, including possibly resuming the long-suspended six-party denuclearization talks.They are part of the policy recommendations made by the committee which recently wrapped up its two months of activities.It has served as a de facto transition team for Moon who was inaugurated immediately after winning a by-election held on May 9 prompted by the ouster of his predecessor involved in a massive corruption scandal.  ""To induce an agreement by 2020, it is necessary to prepare a comprehensive denuclearization strategy seeking a complete nuclear dismantlement by way of a freeze,"" the committee said. To keep the process on track, the committee said that the government should work hard to prevent additional provocations, while at the same time seeking talks including the long-suspended six-party platform to secure a ""tangible"" progress in denuclearization efforts. ""It needs to lead the North to denuclearize by employing all available means, including sanctions and dialogue,"" it noted. The six-party talks involving the two Koreas, the US, China, Russia and Japan started in 2003 to persuade the North to give up its nuclear aspirations. It, however, has not been held since late 2008 when the North walked away from the negotiating table.North Korea conducted nuclear tests twice last year alone. On July 4, it claimed to have held a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, ratcheting up tensions surrounding the Korean Peninsula and drawing strong condemnation from the international community. In his speech in Berlin on July 6, President Moon emphasized the importance of dialogue to address the nuclear issue. He added that his government will work to establish a permanent peace regime on the peninsula.In a follow-up measure earlier this week, South Korea offered to hold inter-Korean military talks on Friday to ease tensions along the tense border and Red Cross talks on Aug. 1 to resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. There has been no response from the North to the overtures. The committee said that it is necessary to prepare a ""road map"" by the end of this year through which the government can discuss the issue of establishing a peace regime on the peninsula, but noted it should be sought based on efforts to secure support from major powers and international community. It also advised the Moon government to ""regularize"" inter-Korean talks and also reconnect the communications channel between the two divided countries. It asked for efforts to seek talks with the reclusive state in the sports, military and economic sectors. On top of pursuing talks, the committee advised the government beef up its efforts to secure military readiness against the North.In particular, it underlined the need to enhance its ability to counter ""asymmetric"" threats from the North such as its nuclear, missile and cyber attacks.The committee recommended the government take back wartime operational control of the country's forces from the US ""as early as possible"" through which South Korea needs to build a joint defense posture spearheaded by ""our military.""","strategy seeking complete nuclear dismantlement ,seeking complete nuclear dismantlement ,completely dismantle north korea nuclear ,nuclear program by 2020 presidential ,seeking complete nuclear dismantlement by","['South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee', 'Moon', 'Koreas', 'US', 'China', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Berlin', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Red Cross', 'Moon', 'inter - korean', 'US', 'South Korea']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61530316  0.10936094

But on Sunday Lim abruptly appeared in a video on the North's propaganda network, describing how her “fantasy” about the wealthy South had been shattered.In the video, posted on the North's Uriminzokkiri website, Lim says she had “returned home” last month and was now living with her family in the western city of Anju.It is unclear whether Lim returned voluntarily, with South Korean media speculating that she might have been kidnapped at the Chinese border with the North while trying to reunite with her family.Seoul police sources who probed Lim's home and financial accounts in Seoul told the South's JoongAng Ilbo daily there was little sign of her trying to wrap up her life in the country and move elsewhere.“Relevant authorities are investigating the North Korean defector Lim Ji-Hyun,” said Lee Yoo-Jin, deputy spokeswoman of Seoul's unification ministry handling North Korea affairs. Seoul's spy agency declined to comment. In the video, Lim identified herself as Chon Hae-Song, which she said was her real name in the North.Wearing a traditional silk hanbok and red badge bearing the images of the North's two former leaders, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, Lim tearfully detailed her “miserable” life in the capitalist neighbour where “money is all that matters.” “I went to South Korea harbouring this fantasy that I would able to eat and live well there, but the South was not the place I imagined,” she said, adding she wanted to become an actress in Seoul. “Every single day in the South was like hell. Every night ... I cried thinking about my motherland and my parents in the North,” she said.  Lim also accused a Korean TV station of pushing her to lie about her life in the North to make it sound more miserable than it actually was. “Everything I said on TV was scripted ... to make North Koreans look barbaric, ignorant and stupid,” she said, describing herself as “human trash”.Other defectors who have reappeared in the North have been displayed on similar programmes, prompting speculation they had been kidnapped by Pyongyang or coerced into returning by threats to their families.Many defectors who reach the South hire brokers to take their remaining family out of the North through the border with China, and some even visit the Chinese border areas themselves -- a dangerous move in a region monitored and frequented by North Korean agents.  The North has tightened border security since young leader Kim Jong-Un took power in 2011, sharply reducing the number of defectors and increasing the cost of hiring brokers.","celebrity refugee in seoul but ,became celebrity refugee in seoul ,celebrity refugee in seoul ,korean defector who became celebrity ,refugee in seoul but recently","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Lim Ji - Hyun', 'Seoul', 'south korean tv', 'Lim', 'Anju', 'Lim', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Lim', 'Seoul', 'Ilbo', 'north korean', 'Lim Ji - Hyun', 'Lee Yoo - Jin', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Lim', 'Chon Hae - Song', 'Kim Il - Sung', 'Kim Jong - Il', 'Lim', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Lim', 'korean', 'North Koreans', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - Un']",12,"[ 0.          3.          2.         ... -0.95929235  0.76504207

Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyun ""The proposal for the early stage of contact to resolve humanitarian issues and ease cross-border tensions is a matter that is different from full-fledged talks for North Korea's denuclearization,"" Lee Eugene, vice spokesperson at the ministry, said at a press briefing.South Korea on Monday offered to hold inter-Korean military talks on Friday to ease tensions along the tense border and Red Cross talks on Aug. 1 to resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.The White House said Monday that current conditions are ""far away"" from those needed to reopen dialogue with North Korea as South Korea proposed inter-Korean military and family reunion talks.China welcomed Seoul's dialogue offer, saying that the move will help ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Japan first said that it is not time to seek dialogue, but to employ sanctions on the North. But it later changed its stance, saying that the proposal is compatible with the latest vow by leaders of South Korea, the US and Japan to strengthen pressure against Pyongyang.A South Korean civic group said that no country has the right to take issue with South Korea's move to seek inter-Korean dialogue for better ties.The group is seeking to hold a joint event with their North Korean counterpart on Aug. 15, Korea's liberation day from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.It said that it has proposed holding a meeting with representatives of its North Korean counterpart in Pyongyang or in a third country to discuss ways to hold the joint event. It is not known whether Pyongyang will accept the offer or Seoul approve of it.","korean military talks on friday ,uncomfortable with seoul latest offer ,tougher sanctions over north korea ,korean military and family reunion ,korea denuclearization to resume unification","[""South Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'US', 'Japan', ""North Korea 's"", 'Cho Myoung - gyun', ""North Korea 's"", 'Lee Eugene', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Red Cross', 'the White House', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Japan', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          2.          3.         ... -0.30353984  0.64387435

It was the largest crowd that the pro-gay event, held as part of the Korea Queer Culture Festival, has attracted since the inaugural event in 2000. Last year’s parade, the previous record-setter, had drawn about 50,000. Sexual minorities and their advocates march through central Seoul in the pride parade Saturday. “I am happy that I can finally express who I really am. I am surprised that so many people came here because I usually don’t see openly gay people around me,” said a 22-year-old university student, a lesbian who only wanted to be identified by her surname Park.“I haven’t told my parents or friends about my sexuality,” she said. “I would have no friends if I came out of the closet. I would feel excluded. People would see me differently.”Moon Cheol-beom  and his friends pose for a photo at Seoul Plaza ahead of the pride parade in central Seoul on Saturday. While homosexuality is not a crime in South Korea, LGBT people live largely on the fringes of society, as the majority of Koreans remain intolerant of homosexuality. Conservative Protestant groups here typically oppose homosexuality, believing it is sin and a condition that can be cured.Even left-leaning President Moon Jae-In -- formerly a human rights lawyer -- said that he “opposed homosexuality” on his presidential election campaign trail in April.Sexual minorities and their advocates march through central Seoul in the pride parade Saturday. This year’s pride parade came amid growing calls for the abolishment of a gay ban in the military after the military court in May sentenced a gay solider to six months in jail, suspended for a year, for having consensual sex with a soldier of the same sex in a private place.“I feel that Korean society is changing to embrace differences, given that so many people came here today despite the heavy rain,” said Kang Myeong-jin, who has headed the organizing committee for the Korea Queer Culture Festival since 2010. “I cannot say I am not mad at anti-gay protesters, but it is not their fault. They just cannot accept drastic changes,” he said, citing a need for the Korean government to play a bigger role in raising awareness and enforcing policies banning discrimination against LGBT people Same-sex couples march while holding hands during the pride parade in Seoul on Saturday. Participants marched 4 kilometers following nine decorated trucks, dancing to music blaring from the floats, waving rainbow flags and joyfully cheering at anti-gay protesters along the way. Many same-sex couples were seen engaging in public displays of affection. A group of friends pose for a photo at Seoul Plaza ahead of the pride parade in central Seoul on Saturday. “When my daughter came out six years ago, I could not accept it and I had conflicts with her. But I learned that it is she who has to suffer most in the face of people unfavorable to the LGBT community,” said a 53-year-old man who is father to a 26-year-old lesbian.“I hope that my daughter will be able to live in a society without discrimination based on sexual orientation or identity.” A group of parents of sexual minorities march through central Seoul during the pride parade, Saturday. On the other side of the festivities, thousands of anti-LGBT campaigners, mostly right-wing and Protestant groups, staged counter protests near Seoul Plaza. They signified their opposition to homosexuality by collectively praying and singing religious hymns.“Homosexuality is bringing down social values and ethics and striking society with illness. We, in the name of the public, oppose those attempting to spread homosexuality in disguise of human rights activities,” pastor Choi Ki-hak said in a speech in front of the Deoksugung palace.But not all Protestants supported the anti-gay movement.“I came here to show that opposing homosexuality is not the Bible’s teaching,” said Chung Sang-hyuk, a 26-year-old Protestant who dressed as Jesus. “What Jesus has taught us is to love everyone. Homosexuality is not sin. It is love. It is not subject to approval or opposition.”Anti-gay protestors hold up placards reading “homosexuality is sin, return to Jesus” and “No!! Same-sex marriage” on the sidewalk as pro-gay participants parade through central Seoul during the pride parade on Saturday. Some 6,000 police officers were stationed around the plaza and along the parade route to separate LGBT advocates from their opponents. No major clashes were reported.Earlier in the day, 101 human rights organizations, global companies, embassies from 13 countries including the US and the UK and university groups set up booths to raise awareness and understanding of gay rights, as well as to sell goods.Chung Sang-hyuk, a 26-year-old Protestant who dressed as Jesus, poses for a photo at Seoul Plaza ahead of the pride parade in central Seoul on Saturday. The National Human Rights Commission of Korea also joined the event for the first time.“As hate speech and discrimination against sexual minorities continues in society, we wanted to take this chance to improve the public awareness,” said Ahn Hyo-chul, an official from the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. “It is time for Korean society to respect diversity.”The 10-day Korea Queer Culture Festival kicked off Friday and will run until Sunday.

It will be a real opportunity,” Morgan said in an interview in Seoul on Wednesday.“Making transition to renewable energy is a good start but it can go even further. The key is to get the right policy to make sure that benefits go to the people.” Going 100 percent renewable is what Greenpeace asks for from all countries, governments and companies around the world, Morgan said. Nuclear energy and climate change are the two biggest threats to humanity, requiring efforts on all levels and fronts, she went on. “Climate change should not be something political. It should be about us, our kids, nieces and nephews.” The top environmental activist was in South Korea on a five-day visit, meeting policymakers and administers interested in environmental issues. Among them were Gangwon Province Gov. Choi Moon-soon, South Chungcheong Gov. Ahn Hee-jung and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. “I think it is important that those governors are linked in with others who try to move forward. They are key players, not only nationally but also globally as well,” she said.On Wednesday, Morgan gave a lecture at Ewha Womans University on Wednesday, saying the massive impeachment protests last winter were “inspiring” for activists around the world to see. “By looking at photos and news showing people power, I noticed the evolution of democracy, which is a type of people power that Greenpeace relates to,” Morgan said. “You would not know how connected you are to other groups around the world.”Founded by Canadian and US environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace has over 3 million supporters worldwide. It has presence in 55 countries, operating 26 regional offices. In Asia, it has four offices in Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei and Seoul. Although Seoul office is relatively young, established in 2011, there is “so much occurring” here, Morgan said. Since South Korea is home to high-tech and IT companies, it should challenge the industry by showing the way to recycle gadgets, like smartphones, Morgan said. Globally, the IT industry is making a green revolution, she added.“Committed to 100 percent renewable energy values, IT companies like Apple, Google, Facebook have moved to solve their IT waste issues and they support related laws to get passed,” Morgan said. On the US’ recent pullout from the Paris Agreement, the Greenpeace chief said it was wrong. “He  was so inaccurate,” she said, “Trump is holding back other Americans who want to move forward.”By Kim Da-sol","people going 100 percent renewable ,interview in seoul on wednesday ,industry is making green revolution ,renewable sources phasing out nuclear ,coal power plants simultaneously greenpeace","['South Korea', 'Greenpeace', 'Jennifer Morgan', 'Jennifer Morgan', 'Greenpeace', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Morgan', 'Seoul', 'Greenpeace', 'Morgan', 'South Korea', 'Gangwon Province', 'Choi Moon - soon', 'South Chungcheong', 'Ahn Hee - jung', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Morgan', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Greenpeace', 'Morgan', 'canadian', 'US', 'Greenpeace', 'Hong Kong', 'Beijing', 'Taipei', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Morgan', 'South Korea', 'Morgan', 'Apple', 'Morgan', 'US', 'Greenpeace', 'trump', 'Americans', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54128879  0.70244336

The survey was conducted just three days after the North successfully carried out its first ICBM test.

A “Tekken” arcade machine at a Game Land arcade in Seoul 




This may be a typical childhood scene, but in an era when even coins may soon become relics, the future of coin-operated video games looks bleak. 

“It seems things could never be worse,” Park Sang-hyuk, owner of Game Land, an underground game arcade in Imun-dong, eastern Seoul, told The Korea Herald. 

It was Wednesday afternoon and the place was nearly empty. 

Park sighed deeply at a question about the prospects of the coin-op game industry. 

“Monthly income has come down more than half compared to a decade ago. I don’t know how long I can keep doing this,” he said. 

There used to be two more arcade malls in the neighborhood, but they all shut down, the 62-year-old added. 

He still gets some nostalgic visitors, but not enough to think about the future. 

Coin-op game arcades thrived in the 1980s and ‘90s, giving young Koreans a new option in the art of idling. 

Now, their popularity is increasingly in retreat: South Korea’s game arcades had combined revenues of 47.4 billion won  in 2015, 36 percent down from 73.6 billion won in 2011. Last year, the number of coin-op video game arcades stood at 450, an 89 percent decrease from 3,877 in 2009, according to government data. The figure does not include claw game arcades.

Not surprisingly, mobile games and other high-tech pastimes have dealt a heavy blow to the arcade cabinets. 

According to the 2016 White Paper on Korean Games released by the Korea Creative Content Agency, which handles the country’s game policy, in the country’s video gaming market of 10.7 trillion won, PC and mobile games accounted for 49.2 percent and 32.5 percent, respectively, in terms of revenue. Arcade malls generated only 0.4 percent of the total. 

“Penny arcade games no longer attract younger customers because there is no fun in them anymore,” said Park Sung-gyu, 49, head of the Korea Amusement Industry Association and director of a local game machine developer.

“And there is no fun in them because we have so many regulations to deal with, which makes it utterly impossible for developers to keep up with the trends.” 

In 2005, sometime after game arcades began their long, slow decline, South Korea’s arcade industry had a brief rebound with the introduction of Sea Story cabinets, similar to Japan’s Pachinko gambling devices or Western slot machines. 

After several addicted players committed suicide, the government launched a clampdown on arcades for adults, which had illegally reprogramed the games to change the odds of winning the jackpot. 

The incident brought about the formation of an independent body, the Game Rating and Administration Committee. It strictly bans gambling content it sees as addictive and has clamped down on adult arcades that operate past midnight. 

To find a way out, attention is now turning to claw machine shops, which have grown 24-fold over the last two years. The claw machines too, however, face yet another set of regulations, blocking the newly emerging market from becoming the real deal.

“The authority now bans using dolls that cost more than 5,000 won as prizes in a claw machine to remove gambling quality. Authentic Pikachu dolls cost around 20,000 won each, so people use fake ones instead. If you both run video games and claw machines, you have to close the store before midnight,” said Park of the amusement industry association. 

The restricted business hours also apply to claw machine shop owners. 

The rules may have been successful in stopping coin-op arcades from turning into gambling dens, but they also effectively killed innovation and creativity, industry insiders have said. 

In fact, the global coin-op amusement industry is having a revival with the arrival of new networked, multiplayer arcade games and a breakthrough in virtual reality technology. 

According to the game watchdog, the world market grew 12.8 percent in 2015. 

“If we are not prepared, we will fail to gain a foothold in the global arcades market, where so many leading game makers are already pouring resources into developing new products,” said Han Jae-suk of Hanmax Entertainment, which sells imported coin-op cabinets. 

The game rating and administration panel, in a short response to The Korea Herald, revealed an outdated approach. 

Asked about claims that excessive regulations are hindering development of the industry, the committee’s deputy manager Kang Suk-ha said the committee “has difficulty in applying the same approach” to the arcade industry as other sectors. 

The committee’s website says its mandate is to foster a “sound game culture” for teenagers and adults, classify game contents that are produced and distributed here and “protect the public from negative influences.” 

Han of Hanmax Entertainment called for a paradigm shift in the industry as well as the regulatory authorities in order to allow coin-op arcades to find new appeal that goes beyond nostalgia. 

The global popularity of augmented reality mobile game “Pokemon Go” shows how explosive it can be when nostalgia meets new technology, other experts said. 

“Honestly, I understand why kids like to play games on their iPhones or computers more,” said Kim Ki-soo, a 31-year-old businessman who said he traveled several blocks to visit Game Land from time to time.

Playing “Tekken” at a lunch break, the nostalgic gamer said it felt like traveling back in time to his boyhood years when things were simpler. In Tekken, a few good punches and kicks is all you need to feel proud of yourself. 

“Look at this game, still as amusing as anything else to kill some time,” said Kim, watching the “KO” sign blazing across the screen. He adds, “Why not continue the fun, or even make it better?”

Our mission is to promote Australian business, the Australia-Korea business partnership and AustCham members’ interests in Korea by being an effective source of information, connections and representation. The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, or the Kim Young-ran Act, came into force in late September 2016 with laudable objectives of eradicating corruption and bribery in Korean society and business culture. AustCham welcomes the measures designed to create a fairer, impartial and transparent marketplace in Korea. AustCham believes that in a modern and globalized Korean business environment there is no room for improper business conduct or practices through facilitation payments or money-for-favors.AustCham firmly believes that this act will not only assist to evolve the Korean business environment but help foreign companies conduct business on a level playing field in Korea. This will foster greater confidence in the economy, attract international investors and help foreign businesses view and value their Korean counterparts as credible business partners. AustCham believes that the Korean community expects the highest level of conduct from both government organizations and private business enterprises alike. Our member companies understand the obligation to act with the highest ethical standards, which is part of our social license to operate in Korea. Therefore, we view the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act to be consistent with the values and principles that guide the conduct of our member companies in engaging in business activities not only in Korea but in all parts of the world.Australian enterprises are well-accustomed to having internal processes and policies to ensure compliance with international standards on improper solicitation and anti-corruption legislation. In particular, companies with global profiles and operations have high awareness of the requirements of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  and the United Kingdom Bribery Act  and the extra-territorial application of both these laws. As such, many AustCham member companies already operate under advanced internal compliance regimes and these systems and processes, have for the most part, enabled our member companies to have a smooth transition and adapt to the new Korean legislation. Ethical conduct is a core company value for our member companies, whose workforces are educated on the expected behavior in relation to improper solicitation. Several member companies publicly report on any contraventions.On the introduction of the new legislation, AustCham had early engagement with the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, as the organization leading the implementation of the new legislation. The ACRC has provided AustCham with several opportunities to engage directly with them and they remain open to ongoing engagement. The regular engagement with the ACRC has enabled AustCham to increase our understanding of the new legislation, the approach to implementation and obtain clarity in certain areas. In turn, AustCham has been able to increase the awareness of the new legislation among our member organizations and gain an understanding of the areas where they may require more clarity.AustCham has received positive feedback from our members that they are witnessing changes in Korean business culture and practices since the introduction of the Kim Young-ran Act. We are optimistic that the act will achieve its stated objectives for the betterment of Korean business and society. AustCham firmly believes that the proper implementation of the act should be the ongoing focus. There is a need for awareness that the one-size-fits-all aspects of the act may have some unintended consequences. It will remain crucial that any prosecutions under the act are targeted at instances of genuine acts of corruption and bribery; rather than focusing on unintended, innocent, minor breaches. AustCham encourages the government to ensure the ongoing engagement, guidance and clarification on the issues concerning the practical implementation of the act. We acknowledge and appreciate that the ACRC has been responsive, pro-active and facilitative. AustCham will continue to act as a channel and voice for our members on this issue. We look forward to continuing to cooperate with and support the efforts of the ACRC to realize the objectives of the act.

Among the five was Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party, the only female candidate in the race who fought hard to the end.  Sim Sang-jeung On Monday, Sim announced she would step down from her role as chief of the minor opposition party, which holds just six parliamentary seats and is not recognized as a parliamentary negotiation group. She was named chairwoman in 2015. “I now return as a proud member of the Justice Party and a lawmaker, but with a bigger mission -- to build South Korea’s dream in which there are confident labor values and the youth and women can love again,” Sim said at a press briefing held at the National Assembly on Monday.The 58-year-old labor activist-turned-lawmaker is a rare character in Korean politics. She is currently in her third term, making her career in the National Assembly the longest among female progressives. She is also viewed as a trailblazer and role model for progressive candidates for the tough fight she displayed to the end of the election. In two previous presidential elections, progressive candidates quitted midway, crushed between the traditional rivalry of liberals and conservatives. Unlike her predecessors, Sim refused to endorse a mainstream liberal candidate. “I vowed to transform the Justice Party into a powerful and charming party when I became its new chairwomen back in 2015,” Sim said. “The number of members and approval rate for the party have doubled within the past two years, but my main focus was to transform the Justice Party into a group more adaptable to the modern political party system.”“I believe setting a foundation for the Justice Party to become a progressive party for the people was my biggest accomplishment .” Sim also added that this year’s election was meaningful for both her and her party due to the attention and support they received for their labor policy.“We were able to clearly present the vision of a ‘welfare state’ -- where the value of labor is respected -- to the people.” Sim said. “This earned the support of the South Korean youth, women, and irregular workers.”Although the election victory went to President Moon Jae-in with 41.1 percent of votes, while Sim secured 6.2 percent, political pundits have spoken highly of her achievement. The number of votes she earned was the highest among progressive candidates in South Korean election history to date. The progressive candidate started the race with a near zero support rating, but garnered public support through a series of clean-cut remarks in televised debates. After the fourth televised presidential debate in April, the Justice Party received 250 new members and campaign donations worth 150 million won , a milestone for the party at the time. In the debate, Sim, who openly advocates the LGBT community in South Korea, criticized Moon for his stance on homosexuality, which he “does not approve of.”“Homosexuality is not something you can approve or disapprove of. It is a sexual identity,” Sim said during the debate. During Monday’s press briefing, the lawmaker vowed to meet and talk with citizens at the center of their lives, work, and residential areas to develop a “new South Korea.” By Jung Min-kyung","2017 south korean presidential election ,the fourth televised presidential debate ,fourth televised presidential debate ,fourth televised presidential debate in ,the 2017 south korean presidential","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Sim Sang - jeung', 'Justice Party', 'Sim Sang - jeung', 'Sim', 'the Justice Party', 'South Korea ’s', 'Sim', 'the National Assembly', 'korean', 'the National Assembly', 'Sim', 'the Justice Party', 'Sim', 'the Justice Party', 'the Justice Party', 'Sim', 'Sim', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Sim', 'south korean', 'the Justice Party', 'Sim', 'LGBT', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'Sim', 'South Korea', 'Jung Min - kyung']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58756304  0.48301548

Comfort women is a euphemism for Asian women, mostly Koreans, who were forcibly taken to front-line military brothels to serve the Japanese army during World War II. Chung made the remarks during a visit to the House of Sharing, a shelter for the former sex slaves, in Gwangju, east of Seoul. The visit was her first on-site activity as minister since her inauguration late last week.The comfort women question no longer remains an issue just between South Korea and Japan, the minister said, adding it is now an international one.  Gender Equality Minister Chung Hyun-back talks with former sex slave Kang Il-chool during a visit to the House of Sharing, a shelter for the former sex slaves, in Gwangju, east of Seoul, on July 10, 2017. It's hoped that the museum will be erected near the National Museum of Korea in Yongsan, the eastern part of Seoul, the minister said, adding that the government plans to immediately start the work by securing a lot for it first.""The minister also said the government will hastily seek the listing of the comfort women as a UNESCO heritage as part of ways to expedite the museum project. Chung's remarks are a sharp departure from the stance of the former Park Geun-hye government on the issue, which declared the ""final and irreversible"" resolution of the comfort women issue in a December 2015 deal with Japan. In exchange, Japan provided 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims. The organization was launched last year.South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a telephone conversation made soon after his inauguration in May that most South Korean people could not ""emotionally"" accept the deal, strongly hinting at a possible renegotiation of the deal.During her parliamentary confirmation hearing, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, who had long worked in UN human rights organizations, also said doubts linger over whether the agreement was surely based on ""a victims-oriented approach."" Many Korean people censure Japan for refusing to recognize its legal responsibility for the forced mobilization of the women. They also criticized the deal being hastily arranged without sufficiently listening to the opinions of the victims. Since the conclusion of the deal, however, Tokyo has called on Seoul to faithfully implement it, insisting that the issue has been completely settled amid the international community's high evaluations. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.Later in the day, Minister Chung reiterated the government's will to launch the comfort women museum while attending a ceremony to mark the opening of a special exhibition on the women at the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History in downtown Seoul. The government will go ahead with projects to investigate and study the comfort women issue ""stably and systematically"" by setting up the museum, and strengthen related education for the next generations, she said in a congratulatory speech. ""I'm very sorry and regretful whenever I see our grandmas  struggle to attend the regular Wednesday rally,""she added. Surviving former sex slaves and civic activists have been staging the weekly rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul every Wednesday for more than a decade, calling for Japan's official apology and compensation.","wartime sexual slavery in seoul ,south korea gender equality minister ,up museum for korean victims ,korean people censure japan for ,korea gender equality minister","[""South Korea 's"", 'Gender', 'Chung Huyn - back', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'the House of Sharing', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Chung Hyun - back', 'Kang Il - chool', 'the House of Sharing', 'Seoul', 'the National Museum of Korea', 'Yongsan', 'Seoul', 'UNESCO', 'Chung', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'UN', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Chung', 'the National Museum of Korean Contemporary history', 'Seoul', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Japan']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32994384  0.06521658

With a rapidly aging society and a struggling economy taking priority on the national political agenda, professor Park said people who suffer from a mental illness -- particularly those with a more severe illness -- are not a sought-after section of voters and funds are being allocated elsewhere.“The elderly was a very important issue in the election because we are an aging society, so voting rights are very important, but mentally disabled people are not such attractive voters so the politicians and bureaucrats don’t focus on mentally ill patients,” he said.Known for long work hours and competitive society, South Korea has the developed world’s second-highest suicide rate and the highest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, according to OECD data. Despite this, mental illness is still a taboo subject that Koreans seem reluctant to address. Government statistics released earlier this year showed that 1 in 4 Koreans experience a mental health disorder at least once in their life with only 1 in 10 pursuing professional help. Of those surveyed, a quarter said they suffered from disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and alcohol addiction at least once, while 12 percent said they suffered from a psychiatric illness in the past year. However, there seems to be change emerging in how people deal with their emotional health here. Dr. Park Jin-seng, a private practitioner in Gangnam, said that he has witnessed an increase in Koreans coming to his practice for help over the past few years. The reasons drawing people to seek help, he says, is the high expectations people feel society places on them. “If you live and you work in Korean society there is a lot of competition and it’s a hard working society. It’s very stressful,” he said.“Life is like a marathon so in the course of life, sometimes people can fail and sometimes people succeed, but in Korea if they fail sometimes they think they can’t rebuild.”Numerous research studies and data confirm that Korea is a nation suffering from stress issues. Last year, a study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs found that, of the 7,000 people surveyed, over 90 percent said that they were under some form of stress, while a quarter said that they were under high stress. A study by Yonsei University Institute for Social Development released last year, which focused on the happiness level of children and young people, found that Korea’s youth were the least happy in the OECD.In a bid to raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide prevention, the government initiated the National Youth Healing Center under the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in 2012. The service recruits youths with mental health issues, such as ADHD and depression, who are willing to participate in the treatment program for four months. This year the Ministry of Health and Welfare finished a yearlong suicide prevention campaign “Are you OK? Air kiss campaign” which included an array of celebrities.In December the government announced an allocation of 48.2 billion won  for suicide prevention and mental health projects, a 7.7 percent increase from the previous year.However, a health policy overview of Korea last year by the OECD stated that Korea lags behind other countries in terms of mental health services and reports the third-highest excess mortality rates from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the bloc of 34 countries.While an increase in funds allocated to mental health is a positive sign, recent moves to strengthen mental health policies have caused controversy. The revision of the Mental Health Act, which came into effect in May, changes the criteria for involuntary committing a psychiatric patient. The change has come under fire from medical professionals, including both professor Park and doctor Park who say it complicates a system which is already lacking in resources.Professor Park said that the lack of support available to psychiatric patients after they have been discharged from hospital means they could easily end up back in hospital or could potentially pose a risk to themselves or others.As a way to combat this he recommends the government invest in training programs and residential facilities where caretakers can oversee that medication is being taken.However, he doesn’t see this happening in the near future. For now, he believes more focus should be put on promoting mental health literacy to end the stigma surrounding it and funding research which can be used to give a voice to those suffering from a mental illness.“In the current government, I think the mentally ill have the last status following other disabilities. They don’t have any capacity to raise their voices. I think it’s related to stigmatization against mental illness,” he said.By Anita Mckay","koreans experience mental health disorder ,university with rapidly aging society ,struggling economy taking priority ,lacking in resources professor park ,government think the mentally ill","['South Korea', 'Park Jong - ik', 'Kangwon National University', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Park Jin - seng', 'Gangnam', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Yonsei University Institute for Social Development', 'Korea', 'the National Youth Healing Center', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Korea', 'the Mental Health Act', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Anita Mckay']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48459896  0.28338054

President Moon Jae-in  sits with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a bilateral summit held in Hamburg, Friday, local time. Moon previously met with US counterpart Donald Trump in a separate bilateral summit in Washington last week, as well as in a trilateral summit with Japan in Hamburg on Friday.He also sat with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Berlin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Hamburg before the G-20 summit kicked off.During the 50-minute meeting, Moon and Putin exchanged their views on matters of common interest, ranging from economic cooperation to North Korea’s nuclear provocations.Moon underlined that Russia, sharing its border with the Korean Peninsula, is an optimal partner for Korea to jointly aspire for the peace and prosperity of the Eurasian region.Reciprocating, Putin pledged to expand on the mutually beneficial relationship of the two countries and invited Moon to the Russia-led East Economic Forum to take place in Vladivostok in September this year, to which Moon consented.Of their common interest was the plan for South Korean companies to participate in the development of Russia’s far east region where an extensive range of transportation infrastructure is to be built over the following years.The two countries, located across North Korea, also shared the view that the communist nation should be denuclearized and brought back to the negotiating table at all costs.Some tension had escalated between the two countries, especially after Russia vetoed the adoption of a UNSC resolution denouncing North Korea's recent launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Russia claimed that the missile was a mid-range one and thus not sufficient a threat to regional and global security.The Korea-Russia summit marked President Moon’s successful encounter with the Big Four nations within his first two month in office, according to the Blue House.By Bae Hyun-jungKorea Herald correspondent","vladimir putin on friday president ,summit held in hamburg friday ,putin on friday president ,president vladimir putin on friday ,putin on friday president moon","['HAMBURG', 'Germany', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Germany', 'south korean', 'russian', 'Hamburg', 'Group of 20', 'Moon Jae - in', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Hamburg', 'Moon', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Washington', 'Japan', 'Hamburg', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Berlin', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Hamburg', 'Moon', 'Putin', 'North Korea ’s', 'Russia', 'Korea', 'eurasian', 'Putin', 'Moon', 'Russia', 'Vladivostok', 'Moon', 'south korean', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'UNSC', ""North Korea 's"", 'Russia', 'Korea', 'Russia', 'Moon', 'the Blue House', 'Bae Hyun - jungKorea Herald']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.97719568  0.74814415

Trump, President Moon Jae-in, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met in Hamburg, Germany, on July 6 to discuss the serious and escalating threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The three leaders condemned the DPRK’s unprecedented launch, on July 4, of a ballistic missile with intercontinental range, a major escalation that directly violates multiple UN Security Council  resolutions and that clearly demonstrates the growing threat North Korea poses to the United States, the Republic of Korea , and Japan, as well as countries around the world.They affirmed the importance of working together to counter the North Korean threat and to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner, a shared goal among the three countries.They also committed to continue to cooperate to apply maximum pressure on the DPRK to change its path, refrain from provocative and threatening actions, and take steps necessary to return to serious dialogue for denuclearization.The three leaders emphasized that they, together with the rest of the international community, stand ready to offer a brighter future for the DPRK if it chooses the right path. The United States, Japan, and the ROK will never accept a nuclear armed DPRK. President Trump, President Moon, and Prime Minister Abe decided to press for the early adoption of a new UNSC resolution with additional sanctions to demonstrate to the DPRK that there are serious consequences for its destabilizing, provocative, and escalatory actions.They called on the international community to swiftly and fully implement all UNSC resolutions and to take measures to reduce economic relations with the DPRK.The three leaders also called on the nations that border the DPRK to make further efforts to convince the DPRK regime to abandon its current threatening and provocative path and immediately take steps to denuclearize and to halt its ballistic missile program. The three leaders underscored their commitment to further strengthen their respective alliances and ensure they continue to increase the capabilities to deter and respond to any attack from the DPRK.They committed to continue advancing trilateral security cooperation in the face of the threat posed by the DPRK.President Trump reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to defend the ROK and Japan using the full range of US conventional and nuclear capabilities.By Bae Hyun-jungKorea Herald correspondent","nuclear armed dprk president trump ,held in hamburg on thursday ,germany on july to discuss ,trilateral summit held in hamburg ,armed dprk president trump president","['the Republic of Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'Hamburg', 'the United States of America', 'Republic of Korea', 'Japan', 'Donald J.

The second part of the 2017 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop will continue in Malaysia from Saturday to Wednesday. Under the theme of “Promoting Clean and Green Environment through the Establishment of Environmentally Sustainable Cities,” the students took part in lectures, field trips and cultural activities from Monday to Friday.  At the closing ceremony, videos that students made to promote a sustainable environment were played, speeches on their experience in Korea were made and cultural performances by students from Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia were staged. “When I was in Seoul’s Energy Dream Center, I was astonished to find that a zero carbon emitting building actually exists,” Christian Cabatay from the Philippines said. Christian Cabatay “This means that someday the whole ASEAN community can learn how Korea took on challenges of climate change seriously,” he said. “Personally, I felt emotional to realize how big the gap in technology here and in the Philippines. But that doesn’t stop me from believing that we can do what Korea did.” A Korean student, Yu Ah-ran, said that she had learned about the importance of collective efforts to make cities sustainable and her generation’s role as a youth. “All in all, the program raised awareness of the environment we are currently living in. Not only that, I think it could help other countries to be inspired by Korea’s efforts in dealing with environmental issues,” she said.The workshop in Korea was jointly organized with the United Nations ESCAP North-East Asia Office and Incheon Metropolitan City.The students visited facilities such as a sewage treatment plant and a tidal power plant. They received lectures on ASEAN-Korea relations and sustainable development from experts. They also engaged in cultural activities including a tour to historic sites. “It makes me sad that we are closing doors to the dynamic exchange of ideas, to interesting activities, and bid farewell to our newly-found friends,” said Hong Sung-wook, head of the development planning and general affairs unit at the ASEAN-Korea Centre.“I am glad, knowing that through this workshop, we have been able to forge strong networks and inculcate knowledge,” said Hong, expressing hope for a continued friendship between Korean and ASEAN students. In Malaysia, some 70 students from ASEAN member states and Korea will visit Melaka, Putrajaya, and Kuala Lumpur to get a glimpse into how environmentally-friendly cities are run during the five-day workshop. They will take part in activities such as a wetland experience in Putrajaya, tree-planting and the cleaning of a river in Melaka, and visit the Melaka Green Technology Corp. and Melaka World Solar Valley. The ASEAN-Korea Centre, an intergovernmental organization to enhance social, economic and cultural exchanges between ASEAN countries and Korea, has held an annual youth workshop on environmental issues since 2013.

The fifth World Education Leaders Forum, hosted by IYF and sponsored by Busan Metropolitan City and Korea Tourism Organization, was held July 5 at Nurimaru APEC House in Busan. Over 60 university presidents and vice presidents from 25 countries attend the World Education Leaders ForumIt was attended by over 60 university presidents and vice presidents from 25 countries. The event looked at solutions to youth problems faced in today’s society from an educational perspective under the theme of “character education, the power behind the growth of convergent-type talent in the fourth industrial revolution.’In his welcome speech, organizing committee Chairman Sang Yong Kim said, “In a rapidly developing industrial society, we need to bring back the focus of college education on the minds of people.” “As technology develops and information increases, the values of the people utilizing them will greatly determine its outcome,” he added, highlighting why the World Education Leaders’ Forum was focusing on character education.The forum discussed the following: What convergent-type talent is needed in the future? Character education is the strength of deep-thinking and self-control; and wise future character education learnt from the past. It also discussed the direction of future character education based on the advantages and disadvantages of the past system.The university presidents agreed to the need for convergent-type talent possessing both knowledge and character.President Kabera Callixte of the University of Tourism Technology and Business Studies in Rwanda said, “For the correct character development of students, character education for educators must be prioritized. Education for global future leaders must be based on character education and family, schools, government, etc. society must work together.” IYF founder Ock Soo Park gave a keynote speech explaining that what helps youths free themselves from problems is not restrictions such as “Don’t do.” Those who are stronger can help those who are weaker, therefore he asked the university presidents to help guide the youth to build up strong minds so they can overcome their desires and walk the right path. The World Education Leaders Forum, which searches for systemic and practical character education implementation methods at the college-level, will be held twice more on July 10 and 12 at Muju Taekwondo Center.","visited south korea to discuss ,education for global future leaders ,busan over 60 university presidents ,worldwide recently visited south korea ,leaders worldwide recently visited south","['South Korea', 'IYF', 'Busan Metropolitan City', 'Korea Tourism Organization', 'Nurimaru APEC House', 'Busan', 'Sang Yong Kim', 'Kabera Callixte', 'the University of Tourism Technology and', 'Business Studies', 'Rwanda', 'iyf', 'Soo Park', 'Muju Taekwondo Center']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49460909  0.88460767

The two state chiefs also agreed that their bilateral partnership in the economic field should be expanded in the new and renewable energy sector so as to trigger new sustainable growth momentum for the future.President Moon vowed last month to convert the nation’s energy sources to environment-friendly ones, a move which seemed to take after Germany’s decision in 2011 to completely abolish nuclear power.Both also agreed that employment should be a high priority in a nation’s socioeconomic vision.Moon presented the South Korean government’s restructuring plan to establish a new ministry devoted to small-sized enterprises as part of his plan to pull up and sustain the nation’s employment rate. Merkel earlier came up with a road map to achieve full employment by 2025.“I believe that  much resembles Germany, which was home to the social market economy model,” Moon said, calling for joint efforts from both countries on economic agendas.Highly anticipated to win her fourth term as chancellor this September, Merkel will likely remain Moon’s counterpart throughout most of his five-year presidency. Under Germany’s parliamentary government system, executive administrative powers are mostly bestowed upon the chancellor while the president assumes a symbolic role.In a separate meeting with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Moon reiterated his pledge to adopt a two-way track approach with North Korea by responding to its military provocations with stronger sanctions while maintaining peaceful communication.“I am concerned that the persisting nuclear and missile provocations from the North will ratchet tension and lead to a military clash. Never again should there be a war on the Korean Peninsula,” Moon said.It is for such reasons that South Korea, along with the international community, should not renounce efforts to bring the North back to the negotiating table, he added.“Germany has not only overcome its division, but also has experience in arbitrating the US and Iran to solve the latter’s nuclear problem,” Moon said, requesting for Germany’s advice on denuclearization talks with North Korea.Steinmeier, who previously served as foreign minister, first from 2005-2009 and later from 2013-2017, expressed concerns over the recent situation of the Korean Peninsula.“It is true that the possibility of inter-Korean unification has diminished,” he said, nevertheless urging Korea to keep up hope.By Bae Hyun-jungKorea Herald correspondent","merkel in berlin on wednesday ,president moon vowed last month ,germany for the annual group ,over summit held in berlin ,held in berlin on wednesday","['Moon Jae - in', 'Germany', 'Group of 20', 'german', 'Moon', 'German Federal Republic', 'Frank - Walter Steinmeier', 'Angela Merkel', 'Berlin', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moon', 'north korean', 'german', 'Moon ’s', 'inter - korean', 'Moon Jae -', 'german', 'Angela Merkel', 'Berlin', 'Moon', 'Germany', 'Moon', 'south korean', 'Germany', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Germany', 'Frank - Walter Steinmeier', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'Moon', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Iran', 'Moon', 'Germany', 'North Korea', 'Steinmeier', 'inter - korean', 'Korea']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31115857  0.75867248

South Korean President Moon Jae-in speaks at a luncheon with Korean nationals in Berlin on Wednesday, local time. South Korea and China have long been at odds over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, however tensions seemed to have calmed slightly since President Moon expressed caution over its hurried deployment after he was sworn-in.Speculations thus escalated that the two state leaders may temporarily shelve the THAAD controversy during their first face-to-face talk, choosing to place more focus on regional security and economic partnership.But with North Korea pushing ahead with its nuclear ambition and increasing tension against the South Korea-US alliance, it has become plausible that China should raise its voice upon the anti-missile battery.In his bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, the Chinese leader reiterated his opposition to THAAD, accusing the deployment of bringing serious harm to the strategic security interest of the peninsula’s neighbors. Chinese President Xi Jinping shakes hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday. “North Korea’s missile test will escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula, which will be reflected in the US and South Korean determination to deploy the THAAD system,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a briefing, following the launch on Tuesday.China’s view on THAAD was that its deployment was a run-up to the US ambition to expand its military presence in the Asian region, which the US has refuted, claiming it to be a protective measure against possible attacks from the North.The fact that the North is now capable of hitting the US mainland with its missiles, thus setting a milestone in its nuclear armament plan, has provided further grounds on the allies’ deployment plan.President Moon, who has so far underlined the necessity of peaceful talks with Pyongyang, has shown signs of stiffening up against the communist regime.South Korea and the US jointly staged a ballistic missile exercise on Wednesday upon the suggestion of President Moon, sending a warning sign to North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un.“There is the need to display our solid alliance in missile defense to North Korea once and for all,” Moon said, before leaving for Germany.By Bae Hyun-jungKorea Herald correspondent","on tuesday south korean president ,meet in berlin on thursday ,wednesday north korea missile test ,tuesday south korean president moon ,berlin on wednesday north korea","['BERLIN', 'Moon Jae - in ’s', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'Berlin', 'Hamburg', 'Group of 20', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae -', 'korean', 'Berlin', 'South Korea', 'China', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'US', 'China', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'german', 'Angela Merkel', 'Berlin', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'south korean', 'China ’s Foreign Ministry', 'China', 'US', 'asian', 'US', 'US', 'Moon', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'Moon', 'Germany']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.98070931  0.69920754

Aging homes transform into cafes and restaurants. Placards notifying renovation work clutter streets, with newly-opening shops, all without harming the original ambience of the area.“When looking at the Seoul City’s urban restoration projects, it is interesting how historical values or decadeslong originality of neighborhoods are preserved even after the transformation,” Kim told The Korea Herald. Kim is one of 11 curators participating in the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s public art project called “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens.” A total of 105 Seoul citizens are part of the two-month long project that kicked off in May to find and promote the hidden artistic gems of Seoul.Throughout the project, the participants are asked to make suggestions on ways to promote Seoul’s art scenes, along with field works and lectures on public art theories.“One other thing I discovered about Seoul’s town redevelopment and gentrification is that public art can play a positive role in the city’s restoration,” said the 40-year-old industry insider.Aiming to find Seoul’s unknown charms, Kim led a group of 10 participants and held 10 rounds of field work in areas such as Ikseon-dong in Jongno-gu.Kim said Seoul is full of artistic appeal found in unexpected areas. “The recent gentrification of Ahyeon-dong was peculiar. ‘Haenghwatang,’ a public bath house which opened its door in 1950s, is a good example,” Kim said.It used to be frequented by nearby residents until that part of the region underwent rapid development, along with the construction of apartments in 2011.With a boom of clean and large sauna houses and young people averting public bathing altogether, Haenghwatang struggled to make ends meet for many years until it was transformed into one of the most unique cultural spaces in Seoul.“Many can ask what public art has to do with urban restoration. If one defines public art as something that vitalizes the community with artistic appeal, there is no boundary because art can change the purpose of buildings and space,” said Kim.The SMG’s two-month project “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” will come to an end Saturday. To wrap it up, participants will gather and give their final presentations on their discoveries at Seoul City Hall, according to the city government’s design policy division.The final presentation is open to all visitors.

YonhapBach, in response, expressed his full support for Moon’s vision and efforts to bring North Korea to the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics Games. Cheong Wa Dae quoted the IOC chief as saying that supporting Moon’s plans was in line with the Olympic spirit. Moon also said that he will request Chinese President Xi Jinping’s help in the matter, calling on the games’ organizing committee and the Gangwon Province government to do their part. Moon first voiced the idea of inviting North Korea to next year’s Winter Games in a speech given at the opening ceremony of the World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championships on June 24 in Muju, North Jeolla Province. The South Korean president pushed the point further in the meeting with the IOC and Cheong Wa Dae officials, saying that his summit with US President Donald Trump has given Seoul a wider opportunity for sports exchanges with Pyongyang. “ has secured support for South Korea taking the lead role in establishing inter-Korean peace, it is now possible to strengthen collaboration in the field of sports,” Moon said.In a joint statement released after the summit Friday, the two countries agreed that Seoul would take a “leading role in fostering an environment for peaceful unification.” The statement also said that Trump supports Moon’s plans to “restart inter-Korean dialogue on issues, including humanitarian affairs.” North Korea, however, has so far remained relatively quiet on the issue. Its IOC member Chang Ung has expressed doubt on suggestions made by Moon.

First lady Kim Jung-sook has also stuck with tradition, wearing a sky blue hanbok for the official dinner at the White House on Thursday night, hosted by US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump. In her hand was a gray-blue square clutch made of nacre, or mother of pearl.The two state chiefs wore formal suits and matching blue ties, while the US first lady sported a sleeveless white dress.South Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook  heads to a dinner at the White House in Washington, DC on June 29, 2017, together with her US counterpart Melania Trump. Kim’s hanbok dress was elegant and classy, but fell short of making a fashion statement. Cheong Wa Dae, however, says the message is in the fabric. The hanbok she wore was made of material her mother gave her as a gift when she got married in 1981. Kim’s mother ran a linen shop in Gwangjang Market in central Seoul. The fabric was dyed in a traditional method, using a wooden roller and natural dyes extracted from plants. “The first lady wished that the linen market would be reinvigorated and the traditional costumes be worn more often in daily lives,” an official at the Blue House explained. This combined photo shows South Korean first lady Kim Jung-suk in various outfits during her visit to the US. The overriding theme of the first lady’s styles during this trip to the United States is “tradition meets modern fashion,” the official added. Kim’s style for photos shot on the stairs of Air Force One as the plane was bound for Washington, Wednesday, was Western formal with a white blouse and black blazer, but her shoes had traditional overtones: Their pointy toes resembled the tip of traditional Korean padded socks, curled in a round swirl. It was Kim’s idea to add a touch of Korean accessories, Cheong Wa Dae explained. On arrival at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington on Wednesday, the first lady wore a white jacket with a blue tree print on top of a silky white dress. “The color carries the message of hope for a successful first summit in trust building between the two countries,” the official said.By Jo He-rim","donald trump and his wife ,dress south korean first lady ,hanbok for the official dinner ,trump and his wife melania ,traditionally south korea first ladies","['South Korea ’s', 'american', 'Korea', 'Kim Jung - sook', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Melania Trump', 'US', 'south korean', 'Kim Jung - sook', 'Washington', 'DC', 'US', 'Melania Trump', 'Kim', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Gwangjang Market', 'Seoul', 'the Blue House', 'south korean', 'Kim Jung - suk', 'US', 'the United States', 'Kim ’s', 'Washington', 'korean', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Cheong', 'Washington', 'Jo He - rim']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71364534  0.92627686

The first stop on his five-day trip was the memorial dedicated to the US veterans of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir during the 1950-53 Korean War. The battle, also known as Changjin Lake Campaign, raged from Nov. 27 to Dec. 13, 1950 and is considered one of the fiercest battles in the three-year conflict. On Nov. 27, 1950, thousands of allied soldiers, including a few thousand from the US X Corps, suddenly found themselves encircled by an overwhelmingly larger number of Chinese soldiers, high in the mountains of Changjin, North Korea. A brutal 17-day battle, fought in extreme cold temperatures, soon followed and the allied forces eventually managed to escape the deadly trap, with heavy casualties.President Moon Jae-in and first lady Kim Jung-sook listen to an explanation during a visit to the Jangjin Lake Battle Monument at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia, the first scheduled event on his four-day visit to the United States. For Moon, the battle has an even more significant meaning. In his own words he owes his life to the veterans of the engagement, as the battle enabled the evacuation of tens of thousands of refugees -- with Moon’s parents among them -- from Hungnam, a port city in North Korea. During the evacuation, about 200,000 soldiers and troops were moved out of the port city. In the operation, the US merchant marine ship SS Meredith Victory is credited for the largest rescue mission by a single vessel, as it carried more than 14,000 refugees to South Korea, giving rise to the name “Ship of Miracles.”In paying his respects, Moon referred to the evacuation of Hungnam as “the most humanitarian operation in the history of civilization,” and thanked US military officials, veterans and their families attending the ceremony, including retired rear Adm. James Robert Lunney, who was part of the crew of SS Meredith Victory.Moon highlighted his family’s connection to the battle, retelling the story of how his parents were among the evacuees. “I was born two years later on Geoje, where Victory set down . With the bravery of the Changjin Lake Campaign, without the evacuation of Hungnam, my life would not have begun, and I would not be here today,” Moon said. “Beyond my personal and familial history, I am moved by the humanism of the American soldiers, who rescued so many refugees from North Korea,” Moon said. “This is the reason why Changjin Lake Campaign and the evacuation of Hungnam is the greatest victory in the world’s history of warfare.”Moon went on to relay his mother’s story of the US troops handing out candies on Dec. 24, 1950 to the evacuees aboard the ship. He said that he has always felt grateful for the soldiers’ warmhearted actions. “Korea remembers the sacrifice and dedication of you and your parents. The memory of gratitude and respect will live on forever,” he added. He went on to say that the “Korea-US alliance was forged in the fires of war” and that its meaning and integrity were greater than “promises made with signatures on pieces of paper.” “ will move forward with President Trump. From the foundations of the great Korea-US alliance,  will bring about the end of the North Korean nuclear program and peace on the Korean Peninsula.” For survivors of the battle, Moon wished health and longevity. “I heard there are only about 50 survivors. I hope you all live long to see the two Koreas unite again.”By Choi He-suk Korea Herald correspondent","korea brutal 17 day battle ,53 korean war the battle ,north korea brutal 17 day ,move forward with president trump ,korea brutal 17 day","['WASHINGTON', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Moon Jae - in', 'US', 'US', 'the Battle of Chosin Reservoir', 'Changjin Lake Campaign', 'the US X Corps', 'chinese', 'Changjin', 'North Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Jung - sook', 'the National Museum of the Marine Corps', 'Virginia', 'the United States', 'Moon', 'Moon ’s', 'Hungnam', 'North Korea', 'US', 'SS Meredith Victory', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'Hungnam', 'US', 'James Robert Lunney', 'Moon', 'the Changjin Lake Campaign', 'Hungnam', 'Moon', 'american', 'North Korea', 'Moon', 'Changjin Lake Campaign', 'Hungnam', 'US', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'US', 'Trump', 'Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'Moon', 'Koreas', 'Choi He - suk', 'Korea Herald']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.23521169  0.43524322

His government and his new foreign minister have been clear in stating their view that there is a process involved in completing the deployment of that system. They've both said that they don't see that should not be equated with a reversal of the decision to deploy THAAD,"" the official said during a briefing to preview the summit set for Friday.""So, I don't think that that is necessarily a major point of conversation,"" he said.Should the issue come up, it will do so as ""a routine matter of housekeeping in the bilateral relationship,"" he said. The official was referring to Seoul's decision to suspend the deployment of an additional four THAAD launchers pending an environmental assessment. South Korea has rejected speculation the halt might be a precursor to reversing the decision on THAAD deployment altogether.The White House official said that Trump wants to have frank discussions on trade.""His view is that there are aspects of the trade relationship that aren't in balance. He will be, I think, forthright in talking about things like US autos and the fact that there are still some barriers to US auto sales in Korea; certainly, the enormous amount of steel that sometimes ends up being surplus Chinese steel that comes to the United States via South Korea,"" the official said.Though South Korea's trade surplus with the US is shrinking and US exports rising, there is still a ""large gap,"" the official said. ""It's caught the president's eye. And I think that he'll talk about that,"" he said.On North Korea, the official said that the US wants to stay closely coordinated with the South, adding that it doesn't matter that Moon's government is from a different political party than the previous government.""The similarities in our approaches are already evident. I mean, if we look at what President Moon has said to date, both in terms of the overarching goal of denuclearization. He made a comment the other day about, you know, the engagement that he would eventually seek with North Korea, being very similar to what President Trump has talked about,"" he said.""And that is engagement when the conditions are right. And until they are right, and even once the conditions may present themselves to enter into dialogue, we must maintain and actually increase pressure on North Korea. That's President Moon's approach. It's President Trump's approach. So, we're actually quite comfortable with where the two governments are right now,"" he said.Trump's policy is to substantially increase economic and diplomatic pressure on the North in order to change its calculus to have substantive talks once it shows they're willing to begin reducing the threat, the official said. ""Right now, we see no evidence that they are seeking to reduce the threat, in the form of nuclear weapons, in the form of missile -- ballistic missile technology, including work being conducted on an ICBM capability that's clearly designed -- explicitly designed to threaten Americans here at home,"" he said.The official also called for China to do more to pressure the North.""China is still falling far short of what it could bring to bear on North Korea in terms of pressure,"" he said. ""The salient point here is that we very much want to see China do more than -- than it's willing to do. While we do recognize that China's doing more than it has done in the past.The official praised South Korea as a ""model ally"" in terms of defense cost sharing.""South Korea, in many respects, is the model ally because they are spending somewhere on the order of 2.7 percent of their GDP on their defense,"" he said. ""South Korea has paid an enormous amount of money to help host US troops in their country, including through things like -- is it Camp Humphreys? -- the new base south of Seoul, which 92 percent of that cost was shouldered by South Korea.""Burden-sharing is part of the conversation Trump has with allies, but the US ""shouldn't view South Korea as somehow laggard on that front,"" the official said.

A summit meeting with President Trump is scheduled for Friday. The official agenda for the meeting, the first between the two leaders since taking office, will focus on reaffirming the decadeslong alliance and coordinating the two nations’ response to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Moon has said that his goal is to build “trust and friendship” with the US leader.President Moon Jae-in and first lady Kim Jung-sook wave as they board a plane at a military airport in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday, before leaving for the United States. Still, thorny issues, such as the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in Korea and the renegotiation of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, may be brought up, possibly turning what is supposed to be a trust-building event into a stormy meeting. Mindful of that, experts interviewed by The Korea Herald on the prospects of the Moon-Trump summit advised the two leaders to avoid an “open clash of wills” and to strive for “a quiet summit,” leaving specific issues to be discussed at the working level.“More important than the specific tactics is a renewed, top-level commitment to forge a common North Korea policy,” said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia Program at the Center for a New American Security. For South Koreans, Moon’s foreign trip signals the resumption of top-level diplomacy, after eight months of political turmoil that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. “The meeting is the first stage of summit diplomacy that normalized the ‘abnormality of diplomacy’ caused by the scandal,” the ruling Democratic Party of Korea said in a statement, referring to the scandal that led to the downfall of Park. The party added that North Korean nuclear issues will be a key issue and that the summit will be an opportunity to revisit the meaning of the alliance between Seoul and Washington. The minor conservative opposition Bareun Party chose to hone in on the apparent disparity between North Korean policies of the Moon administration and other concerned nations. Since taking office on May 10, Moon has repeatedly stated that he would seek to thaw inter-Korean relations while continuing to pressure Pyongyang into denuclearization.“ must show that the alliance remains firm and put to rest the concerns about the Korea-US alliance raised both in and outside the country,” the party said.Over in Washington, a series of US congressmen took to the parliamentary floor to welcome Moon and to call for further strengthening of the alliance between the two countries.“President Moon’s trip comes at a critical time -- a critical time for America’s strategic relationship with South Korea. And I look forward to welcoming him to Capitol Hill,” Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said during a floor speech Monday.Royce also said that the US and South Korea “stand together in defense of democracy, and freedom, and prosperity and the strength of our friendship is now more important than ever as we face growing challenges in the Asia-Pacific region.”Moon is accompanied by a number of Cheong Wa Dae officials including Senior Economy Secretary Chang Ha-sung, National Security Council chief Chung Eui-yong, and head of Presidential Security Service Ju Young-Hoon. From the Cabinet, only Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha is accompanying the president. More than 50 South Korean business leaders are also accompanying Moon, including Park Yong-man, chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun and Hyundai Motor Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun.

In April, a clampdown on two English immersion alternative schools in Seoul led to the deportations of some 14 foreign teachers and ultimately the shutdown of the institutions. “The investigation was initiated upon a request from the education office as well as complaints from some parents who send their children to other English language institutes,” the office said in a written response to an inquiry. The immigration office, however, declined to reveal whether other alternative schools or private academies are being targeted, saying the probe is still “open and ongoing.”The authority instead confirmed its stance on the issue, stating that under the current law teachers working in Korea with E-2 visas are limited to leading language conversation classes only. “In order to teach elementary, middle and high school curriculum, an E-7 visa is mandatory,” the office said. The two schools shut down in the wake of the immigration crackdown were Canadian British Columbia International School and Westminster Canadian Academy, both of which had provided Canadian public school curriculum for years and hired E-2 visa holders as teachers. Certified by Canada’s British Columbia province but not authorized as a school by the Korean education office, the institutions were unable to sponsor E-7 visas. There are another 11 such unauthorized foreign alternative schools certified by other Canadian provinces and jurisdictions in the United States still operating in South Korea, according to local reports. Sources say many English language institutes also offer a US curriculum in order to target advanced students.“After almost 13 years of living in Korea, I was suddenly treated like a criminal by immigration and given a 30-day departure order to end my life in Korea and have a one-year ban,” Christina King, formerly a teacher at one of the institutions and who was forced to leave the country in April, told The Korea Herald. “At my school alone, eight highly qualified teachers with teaching licenses, master’s degrees and even a Ph.D. got these orders with little information. We could not give our case or pleas. I understand this is a government agency, but they were the ones who issued the visas in the first place,” she added. As of April 30, 15,189 foreign residents were working as language instructors with E-2 visas, according to the immigration watchdog. It is unclear how many of them engage in unauthorized teaching.By Bak Se-hwan","law teachers working in korea ,korea herald in april clampdown ,hired visa holders as teachers ,deportations of some 14 foreign ,unauthorized foreign alternative schools certified","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'E-2', 'canadian', 'British Columbia International School and Westminster Canadian Academy', 'canadian', 'Canada', 'British Columbia', 'korean', 'canadian', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Christina King', 'the Korea Herald', 'e-2', 'Bak Se - hwan']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12967056  0.46551338

The North's Korean Central TV reported on May 14 that new children's traffic parks were launched in the northeastern city of Rason and the city of Kanggye in North Korea's northern Jagang Province.In a June 13 report, the Rodong Sinmun said traffic police officers in South Hwanghae Province had been mobilized for the construction of a children's traffic park.Based on the reports, the North appears to be implementing a project to construct children's traffic parks in major cities.The North's traffic park construction boom is interpreted as a result of the social phenomenon of fast-rising traffic. An increase in the number of traffic accidents caused by heavy traffic could prompt the authorities to provide children as well as adults with traffic education.Chinese and other people participating in tour programs in the North say that the number of traffic lights and CCTV for checking violations has increased in major North Korean cities due to a surge in traffic since leader Kim Jong-un took office in 2011. In Pyongyang, the word ""traffic congestion"" has even popped up.Ahn Byung-min, a senior researcher at the Seoul-based Korea Transport Institute, said the activation of markets coupled with a traffic surge has prompted vehicles to come into residential areas and alleys, giving rise to frequent traffic accidents involving children.","new children traffic parks ,building children traffic parks to ,is building children traffic parks ,that new children traffic parks ,to construct children traffic parks","['North Korea', ""the Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'Pyongyang', ""Pyongyang Children 's"", 'North Korea`s Korean Central TV', 'Kanggye', 'Jagang Province', 'Korean Central TV', 'Rason', 'Kanggye', ""North Korea 's"", 'Jagang Province', 'South Hwanghae Province', 'chinese', 'CCTV', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Ahn Byung - min', 'Seoul', 'Korea Transport Institute']",3,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.60657984 -0.18168151

The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education was set to announce Wednesday the results of an assessment it conducted on five of the 29 foreign language and autonomous private schools across the city.The review was conducted with the aim of deciding whether to cancel Seoul Foreign Language High School and four other schools’ designations as special institutions.Seoul is home to nearly half of the nation’s autonomous high schools as well as many other specialized private schools, which are considered by many to provide unfair advantages. If the Seoul education office decides to push to cancel the special status of selected schools, it would be a second attempt. Seoul’s education office had decided to revoke the status of five autonomous institutions in 2015, but the move was blocked by the Ministry of Education under the previous conservative administration. Under the progressive Moon-Jae-in administration, the elite institutions are expected to face a tougher road ahead, as President Moon has pledged to shift away from elitism toward equality. “The current education system  has departed from the initial purpose of creating diversity and autonomy in education to providing training designed to enter top-tier universities,” Seoul Education Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon told Yonhap News Agency on Tuesday.

Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.In 2007, Honda wrote House Resolution 121 and helped it pass through the House unanimously.

423,423,[Herald Interview] ‘Moon should show support for THAAD at summit’,"This is the second of five interviews with prominent US scholars on an upcoming South Korea-US summit and the alliance. -- Ed.When South Korean President Moon Jae-in meets his US counterpart Donald Trump in Washington this week, he should give the US leader full assurance on the parts of the US missile shield system already deployed in South Korea, a renowned security expert said. “At the summit, President Moon shou...","This is the second of five interviews with prominent US scholars on an upcoming South Korea-US summit and the alliance. -- Ed.When South Korean President Moon Jae-in meets his US counterpart Donald Trump in Washington this week, he should give the US leader full assurance on the parts of the US missile shield system already deployed in South Korea, a renowned security expert said. “At the summit, President Moon should emphasize his support for the two  launchers already put into operation,” Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia Program at the Center for a New American Security, told The Korea Herald in an email interview.  Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia Program at the Center for a New American Security Short for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, THAAD looks set to be a sticking point in the first summit between Moon and Trump, who Cronin said must present a “united front” on the increasingly defiant and belligerent North Korea. The introduction of the US advanced anti-missile system was an agreement of the two sides’ previous administrations. Since taking office in May, President Moon has taken a series of actions that many in Washington saw as attempts to delay its full rollout. Two THAAD batteries and a radar are already deployed and are declared operational, but the rollout of the remaining four batteries face suspension of at least six months following the Moon government’s order to conduct a proper environmental impact assessment on the project site. Cronin’s remark appears to echo mounting calls in Washington that the leaders should reinforce the firmness of their alliance amid growing signs of a rift over the deployment of the US defense asset in South Korea. In a letter to President Trump on Friday, a total of 18 senators urged the allies’ leaders to seek a way to “expedite the procedural review,” highlighting that THAAD is an alliance decision only designed to defend South Korea and US forces stationed here. “The environmental review is a convenient political device, albeit one that does comport with domestic law,” Cronin said. “However, in the likelihood that North Korea remains determined to field more and more capable missiles, then it let us hope the environmental study does not undermine the ability of the alliance to bolster deterrence and defense,” Cronin said. Regarding Moon’s recent emphasis on bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table, Cronin struck a cautious tone, saying ensuring meaningful progress on North Korean denuclearization should be the prerequisite to any dialogue. “The Trump administration will be keen to work with President Moon if there is tangible evidence that Pyongyang will halt its nuclear and missile tests as the first step toward reducing tension,” the scholar said. “The real question is whether  Kim Jong-un is prepared to break with longstanding North Korean practice of provoking, escalating, de-escalating, pocketing concessions, and then starting the cycle anew with another provocation.” He also voiced caution toward the Moon administration’s possible attempts to thaw inter-Korean tensions with “concessions,” such as scaling back of the allies’ joint military exercises or the reopening of the Kaesong industrial park, which was shut down in 2016 in response to North Korea’s nuclear and rocket test. “The Trump administration will certainly want to know what we expect to receive from Pyongyang should we start making concessions regarding military exercises or should Seoul wish to provide economic support to the Kim regime,” he said. In the interview, the scholar stressed the importance of Moon and Trump presenting a “united front” against North Korea at the summit, as the death of US college student and former North Korean prisoner Otto Warmbier last week fueled the voices of hard-liners within the US. In order to achieve this, Moon and Trump should devote their efforts to coming up with “basic strategic approaches,” not a detailed game plan, and differences over specifics should be delegated to subordinates for future consideration, the scholar suggested. “The most contentious issues should not be decided at a first summit but shifted to lower levels for bilateral negotiation. More important than the specific tactics is a renewed, top-level commitment to forge a common North Korea policy with both engagement and security dimensions.” By Yeo Jun-suk","to president trump on friday ,upcoming south korea us summit ,president trump on friday total ,president trump on friday ,rocket test the trump administration","['US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Washington', 'US', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'Patrick Cronin', 'the Asia Program', 'the Korea Herald', 'Patrick Cronin', 'the Asia Program', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Moon', 'Trump', 'Cronin', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Moon', 'Washington', 'Moon', 'Cronin ’s', 'Washington', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Trump', 'South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'regard Moon ’s', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Trump', 'Moon', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Moon', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Trump', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'US', 'north korean', 'Otto Warmbier', 'US', 'Moon', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          3.          2.         ... -0.45232314  0.50236028

YonhapChang is currently visiting South Korea for this year’s World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championships in Muju, North Jeolla Province, as head of the 32-member North Korean demonstration team. “When we fielded a joint team at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, there were 22 rounds of inter-Korean talks and they took five months,” Chang was quoted as saying at a dinner reception after the opening ceremony, according to a WTF competition official. “That is the reality that we’re faced with.”On co-hosting skiing competitions in North Korea’s Masikryong, Chang said, “As an Olympics expert,  it’s a bit late.” Masikryong is the only ski resort in North Korea. It was criticized by the international community as Kim Jong-un’s showpiece when it opened in 2014. The largest world taekwondo competition to date kicked off Saturday with President Moon Jae-in’s congratulatory speech embodying his wishes to restore inter-Korean dialogue through cross-border cooperation for the upcoming winter games. In a short interview with local daily DongA Ilbo on Saturday, Chang also disagreed with Moon’s comparing of the inter-Korean exchange plans to ping-pong diplomacy between US and China in the early 1970s.“It’s inappropriate to bring the Olympics into political affairs,” Chang said. “I disagree with the saying that ping-pong diplomacy made the global community. Issues surrounding the political environment should be solved first because politics is always above sports.”Despite Chang’s series of comments that threw cold water on Seoul’s hopes for reviving ties with Pyongyang through sports, the Moon administration remains behind the idea of a joint Winter Olympics team. “If the North accepts the president’s offer, there will be many tasks to be done at the working level. We are expecting the North to  respond to Moon’s proposal,” Lee Duk-haeng, spokesman at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, said during a press briefing Monday. Rep. An Min-seok of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, who attended a luncheon meeting with Chang Ung in Muju on Saturday, also supported Seoul’s goals, but stressed time management as a crucial factor. “The Olympics won’t wait for us,” An said. “But the nature of sports talks is that once the leaderships of both Koreas make political decisions, the pace of things can really pick up and it could lead to great results.”“It could be summer or autumn, but if we do hold a new round of sports talks, we could discuss the PyeongChang Winter Olympics within that framework.”An expert in Seoul suggested taking a step back and viewing the administration’s approach as part of the bigger picture. “Forming an inter-Korean sports team is a very complicated process technically,” said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It would be wise to see this as the Moon administration’s gesture to reinstate dialogue with North Korea rather than an actual plan to achieve solid cooperation for the upcoming Olympics.”“The past cases of joint teams with table tennis and soccer was based on win-win strategies thoroughly crafted for both sides -- this time, there’s lack of time to achieve such goals.” South Korea and North Korea fielded joint teams at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship. They also marched in together for the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2004 Athens Olympics under the same name, “Korea,” but competed separately for the games.By Jung Min-kyung","world taekwondo championship on saturday ,discuss the pyeongchang winter olympics ,ceremony of world taekwondo championship ,taekwondo championship on saturday ,pyeongchang winter olympics appears bleak","['Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'PyeongChang', 'the North ’s International Olympic Committee', 'Chang Ung', 'north korean', 'IOC', 'International Taekwondo Federation', 'Seoul', 'Jong - hwan', 'north korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'World Taekwondo Championship', 'Muju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'YonhapChang', 'South Korea', 'World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championships', 'Muju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Chang', 'WTF', 'North Korea ’s', 'Masikryong', 'Chang', 'Masikryong', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'inter - korean', 'DongA Ilbo', 'Chang', 'Moon ’s', 'inter - korean', 'US', 'China', 'Chang', 'Chang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Moon', 'North', 'Moon ’s', 'Lee Duk - haeng', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'An Min', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Chang Ung', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'PyeongChang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Lee Woo - young', 'the University of North Korean Studies', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'korea', 'Jung Min - kyung']",10,"[ 0.          3.          1.         ... -0.75901347  0.53851372

The rental homes will be supplied gradually during the President Moon Jae-in's five-year term that began May 10.  This undated Yonhap News TV graphic image shows Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee, a real estate contract and a pile of cash. In a move to fulfill one of the chief executive's major pledges, the government will announce a specific plan to provide share houses and other forms of rental homes to people in their 20s and 30s. The move involves transforming old public buildings into residential homes, Land, Infrastructure and Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee said. She made the comment during her visit to rental homes offered to young graduates who are residing in Dongdaemun-gu and Gwangjin-gu in eastern Seoul. Many college graduates are struggling to cope with high tuition fees and high residential costs compounded with the difficulty of landing a job, particularly in Seoul.In her inaugural speech last Friday, the minister vowed to crack down on speculative real estate investments.Pointing out it is real-estate speculation that has pushed up home prices in recent years, she said the government will show zero tolerance toward forces seeking high returns through repetitive property investments. Such actions are cited for making it harder for ordinary people to buy homes.New lending rules announced June 19 are set to take effect July 3. The stricter rules allow homebuyers to draw mortgage loans worth up to 60 percent of their property value or 50 percent of their income. The ratios were lowered from the previous 70 percent and 60 percent, respectively.","000 rental homes to jobseekers ,new lending rules announced june ,seoul in her inaugural speech ,monday the rental homes will ,korea will launch project later","['South Korea', ""Moon Jae - in 's"", 'Yonhap News tv', 'Kim Hyun - mee', 'Kim Hyun - mee', 'Gwangjin', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43665725  0.55693555

South Korea imported eggs from the United States for the first time in January, but stopped the process due to a bird flu breakout there.The government has been dealing with rising egg prices since it suffered the worst avian influenza outbreak last winter, which led to the culling of more than 33 million birds. It has been grappling with another outbreak since early this month. The imported eggs are likely to be priced at some 100 won  each, less than half the average price of eggs sold in the domestic market at present. Still, experts say it is unclear whether they will contribute to containing the rising egg prices with such a modest amount, considering that the country consumes about 30 million to 40 million eggs per day.","planned to import million eggs ,worst avian influenza outbreak last ,eggs bound for south korea ,in south korea last week ,this month the imported eggs","['Thailand', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'southeast asian', 'New Zealand', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'Denmark', 'Netherlands', 'Spain', 'South Korea', 'the United States']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42063767  0.66949207

He traveled with a delegation from the North Korea-led International Taekwondo Federation, whose demonstration team performed at the WTF event's opening ceremony.Chang crossed the tense border just days after South Korea's new sports minister, Do Jong-hwan, proposed forming a joint women's hockey team and holding skiing events at North Korea's Masikyrong resort during the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.As an IOC member, Chang has been peppered with questions about Do's ideas. According to an official with the WTF competition, Chang spoke of his doubts about the South Korean minister's suggestions.""When we fielded a join team at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, there were 22 rounds of inter-Korean talks, and they took five months,"" Chang was quoted as saying at a dinner reception Saturday, after the WTF championships' opening ceremony.

Yet with liberal-minded Moon in office, PyeongChang 2018, the first Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea, has emerged as a potential platform on which to engage North Korea in sports exchanges.Earlier Sunday, Chang attended a luncheon meeting in Muju hosted by the WTF's South Korean president, Choue Chung-won.While Chang kept mum about what went on at the meeting, An Min-seok, a legislator with the ruling Democratic Party, told reporters afterward that Chang took a cautious approach on a joint Korean team.

He made the overture at the opening ceremony of the 2017 World Taekwondo Championships in Muju, North Jeolla Province, to which the North sent a rare demonstration team. The liberal president, who envisions a restart of dialogue for a thaw with the isolated neighbor, recalled the instance of 1991, when the two Koreas competed for the first time as one team for the World Table Tennis Championships and FIFA World Youth Championship. In 2000, athletes from the two countries marched together behind a unification flag as the Summer Games in Sydney kicked off.President Moon Jae-in  pose with taekwondo demonstrators from South Korea and North Korea after the opening ceremony of the World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championships at T1 Arena in Muju, North Jeolla Province, on June 24, 2017. “I hope our achievement in taekwondo will lead to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. I believe that if a North Korean delegation participates, it will greatly contribute to realizing the Olympic values of mankind’s harmony and world peace,” Moon said in a congratulatory address. “I wish to see the glory of 1991 again. I would like to feel the sensation of 2000 again. I hope North Korea’s cheering squad will also come along so that we could set a milestone for inter-Korean reconciliation.” The speech was closely watched by Chang Ung, the North’s sole member of the International Olympic Committee. Jang arrived here Friday, leading the 32-strong International Taekwondo Federation demonstration team, and joined by three other Pyongyang officials.Moon also requested Chang’s cooperation, stressing the significance of the ongoing event as the venue for the first cross-border sports exchange since he took office on May 10.“Once adversaries, the US, China, and Vietnam achieved peace through Ping-Pong diplomacy,” the president said. “I believe in the strength of sports that has been establishing peace.”The offer for the joint team reflects his bid to revive ties with Pyongyang starting with nonpolitical areas while floating a nuclear freeze agreement. Over the past month, the Moon administration has also granted approval for civic groups’ plans to provide humanitarian assistance and resume religious exchanges. Marking the 17th anniversary for a watershed inter-Korean peace declaration in 2000 on June 15, he said he would pursue talks with Pyongyang if it halts nuclear and missile tests. With North Korean leader Kim Jong-un having promoted sports at home as an avid fan himself, the PyeongChang Olympics to be held in Gangwon Province could mean a chance for the nascent leadership to engage the regime with relatively less political burden, analysts say. Choi Jong-kun, a professor in political science and international studies at Yonsei University who has been advising Moon since long before the campaign period, has said his administration wants to use the event as a platform to reinitiate inter-Korean talks designed to induce a moratorium on the North’s nuclear and missile tests in return for economic incentives such as a reopening of the Kaesong industrial park and Geumgangsan tours. “If we could manage to perk up the mood through the Olympics and then expand interactions, we will be able to send a meaningful signal about our intention,” Choi told The Korea Herald last month. “And if the North takes explicit steps on denuclearization, we may take our own corresponding measures, such as on Kaesong and Geumgangsan.” Given heightened tensions and the absence of communication channels, the event could “set the mood” for cross-border dialogue, said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor in North Korean studies of Dongguk University in Seoul. “The proposal was apparently intended to pursue sports exchanges regardless of, or rather to improve, the political situation, and the PyeongChang Olympics would be a key occasion,” Koh said Sunday. “Just like the Muju case, North Korean officials would come here together with the athletes’ delegation. Then there will most likely be direct and indirect talks with the South’s government during which the sides may sound out each other’s stances and explore what to do to improve the relationship going forward.”By Shin Hyon-hee  and Jung Min-kyung","world taekwondo championships at t1 ,2018 winter games in pyeongchang ,the 2017 world taekwondo championships ,world taekwondo championships in muju ,2017 world taekwondo championships in","['Moon Jae - in', 'Koreas', 'PyeongChang', 'Muju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Koreas', 'the World Table Tennis Championships', 'FIFA World Youth Championship', 'Sydney', 'Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'the World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championships', 'Muju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'north korean', 'Moon', 'North Korea ’s', 'inter - korean', 'Chang Ung', 'North ’s', 'the International Olympic Committee', 'International Taekwondo Federation', 'Pyongyang', 'Moon', 'Chang', 'US', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Ping - pong', 'Pyongyang', 'Moon', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Gangwon Province', 'Choi Jong - kun', 'Yonsei University', 'Moon', 'inter - korean', 'North ’s', 'geumgangsan', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'Koh Yu - hwan', 'north korean', 'Dongguk University', 'Seoul', 'Koh', 'north korean', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Jung Min - kyung']",8,[0.         4.         3.         ... 0.1087438  0.17970772 0.0655624 ]

In an email to The Korea Herald, the United States Forces Korea said that the US was fully transparent with the Korean government throughout the process, highlighting that Washington trusts South Korea’s official stance that the THAAD deployment was an alliance decision. “The US trusts the  official stance that the THAAD deployment was an Alliance decision. We have worked closely and have been fully transparent with the  government throughout this process,” the USFK Public Affairs Office said. THAAD battery in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province. The USFK, however, declined to comment on when the deployment would be finished and whether the process should undergo environmental assessment, citing operational security. Moon said that the deployment is subject to an environmental assessment that could take at least six months.The announcement came amid controversy over Moon, who said in an interview with Reuters Thursday that “for the reasons unknown to him,” the allies have deployed the entire set of a THAAD battery, although they had initially agreed to deploy only one launcher this year.Two THAAD launchers are stationed in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, with the other four launchers stored in a US base in the southern part of the peninsula. The existence of the four launchers was not revealed to the public until last month. The controversy is likely to weigh on Moon’s fist summit with US President Donald Trump, who was allegedly “indignant” over the South Korean government’s dealing with the THAAD deployment. Trump also demanded South Korea pay for THAAD, whose cost he estimated $1 billion. In an attempt to minimize diplomatic impact, presidential office Cheong Wa Dae stressed that the president’s remark was designed to ensure “procedural legitimacy,” not an attempt turn the THAAD negotiation in its favor ahead of the summit scheduled on June 29-30. “The president’s remark came as a part of his effort to explain that the South Korean government is not trying to postpone . It was aimed to highlight the government’s effort to follow the legitimate process for the deployment,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun said. Seoul’s Defense Ministry declined to comment on exactly what sort of agreement the allies made over THAAD when they decided to deploy the platform last year. “There is nothing we can tell you beyond what the president said during the Reuters interview,” said a ministry official under the condition of anonymity. Since Cheong Wa Dae found out last month that there was four THAAD launchers deployed on the peninsula without their knowledge, the government temporarily halted the stationing process by ordering an environment assessment on the THAAD battery site. The measure came after the allegation that Seoul’s Defense Ministry deliberately dropped information about the four launchers from their report to presidential security advisers. The investigation is still underway over how and why such a decision was made.

It usually leaves it to the Pentagon or refers media to South Korea's defense ministry.It came a day after a foreign news report said that Moon, a liberal leader who took office in early May, took issue with the timeline of the deployment of the US strategic asset on the peninsula.In an interview with Reuters, Moon was quoted as saying that just one THAAD interceptor launcher was originally scheduled to be installed this year, with five others to arrive in 2018.In fact, two THAAD rocket launchers are in place at a former golf course in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province. Four others were brought to South Korea earlier this year and stored at a local USFK base.Work on the THAAD installation has been suspended as the Moon administration is reviewing the relevant domestic procedures including the scope of a new environmental impact assessment. The THAAD issue is expected to be high on the agenda when Moon holds his first summit talks with US President Donald Trump in Washington D.C. next week.Moon told Reuters that he will request that Chinese President Xi Jinping lift Beijing's measures of economic retaliation against Seoul in connection with THAAD, when they have a chance to meet in Germany next month on the sidelines of a G-20 summit.South Korea and the US reached a deal on deploying a THAAD battery on the peninsula in March last year, two months after North Korea's fourth nuclear test. South Korea was under the administration of a conservative president, Park Geun-hye, who was impeached later amid a bribery and influence-peddling scandal.A THAAD battery is known to require at least six truck-mounted launchers. Eight interceptors are loaded per launcher as they can be fired and rapidly reloaded, according to the US Missile Defense Agency.It also comes with a powerful X-band radar, which searches, tracks, discriminates objects and provides updated tracking data to the interceptor, a battery support center and a fire control & communication system.Speaking by phone in March this year, South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo and his American counterpart Jim Mattis ""discussed the alliance's responses concerning the THAAD deployment to the USFK,"" announced their offices.

A 36-person delegation of the North Korean-led International Taekwondo Federation will arrive in Seoul by plane via Beijing on Friday and is scheduled to stay until July 1, the ITF and the South Korea’s Ministry of Unification said Thursday. The delegation includes a total of 32 North Korean nationals, including current ITF chief Ri Young-sun and Chang Ung, the only North Korean member of the International Olympic Committee and a former ITF chief, and 12 North Korean athletes.The 2017 World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championship is to run from Saturday to Friday in Muju, some 240 kilometers south of Seoul in North Jeolla Province.This undated photo provided by the World Taekwondo Federation shows a taekwondo demonstration team of the North Korea-lead International Taekwondo Federation. The first inter-Korean taekwondo exchange in nearly a decade, the visit comes as President Moon is openly expressing hopes to re-engage the North with diplomacy and dialogue, amid Pyongyang’s relentless pursuit of nuclear and missile programs.“To resolve the issue we have to add dialogue to the current menu of sanctions and pressure,” Moon said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.The Moon administration is also drawing up plans for a possible inter-Korean sports team for the upcoming 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics to paint the event as the “Peace Olympics.” “There are plans to talk with the IOC to create an inter-Korean women’s hockey team,” Do Jong-hwan, South Korea’s new sports minister, said Tuesday. “Hopefully, we‘ll be able to thaw lingering tensions as we try to bring North Korea on board.” Do also added that Thomas Bach, president of the IOC and who is scheduled to attend the closing ceremony of the taekwondo championship, has plans to meet Moon on July 3, upon the president’s arrival from Seoul-Washington bilateral summit. The meeting is expected to be an opportunity for Moon to roll out his ideas for the Peace Olympics. President Moon himself also expressed hopes for the two Koreas to collaborate in the bidding process to host the 2030 World Cup. “If the neighboring countries in Northeast Asia, including North and South Korea, can host the World Cup together, it would help to create peace in North and South Korea as well as Northeast Asia,” Moon said earlier this month, according to the president’s spokesperson Park Su-hyun. The upcoming taekwondo event is expected to be the largest world championship of the sport, indigenous to Korea, to date, with a record number of 971 athletes from 183 nations registered to compete. South Korea’s Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung will attend the event with the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism overseeing the tournament, according to a Ministry of Unification official Thursday. Demonstration teams from each federation will hold a joint performance choreographed for the tournament’s opening ceremony, marking the first time it is being showcased in South Korea. The WTF, headquartered in Seoul, is a control tower for taekwondo worldwide with the IOC’s support. The ITF, although sanctioned by the North Korean regime, is headquartered in Vienna.

The subsidy amount is 500,000 won  per month for up to six months. Providing cash is the most practical and effective way to help underprivileged youth to escape long-term unemployment, Seoul officials said. The recipients consist of 2,629 women and 2,371 men who were unemployed for about 20 months on average. About 60 percent of them are graduates from four-year courses in universities.A banner of youth subsidy, put up by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2016. “Along with the cash subsidies, the city government plans to provide support in terms of job preparation such as mentoring services,” said Jeon Hyo-kwan, an official of the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The Seoul Metropolitan Government first brought up the idea of the youth subsidy program in November 2015, stressing that cash allowances would help jobless youth to escape “a vicious circle of having to earn money first in order to study to land jobs.” The program, however, was opposed by the previous conservative Park Geun-hye administration. Nevertheless, it distributed the first cash handouts to 2,831 recipients in August last year, prompting the Ministry of Health and Welfare to issue a correction order. After the impeachment of the former president, the ministry reserved its stance on the program. Critics have raised concerns toward the program, questioning whether the money would really be spent on job searches and preparation. City officials argued that the selection process was fair and transparent and that recipients will be required to submit receipts and a report on how they used the stipend. Meanwhile, separate data from Statistics Korea showed that the number of long-term unemployed people here hit a 13-year high in May, with some 120,000 people looking for work for six months or longer.By Kim Da-sol","500 000 won per month ,long term unemployment seoul officials ,000 won per month for ,000 won per month ,the subsidy amount is 500","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Jeon Hyo - kwan', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Statistics Korea', 'Kim Da - sol']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40186045  0.21098489

""That's what we'll be focusing on in this discussion with the Chinese this week,"" she said.This week's talks take place as tensions between the US and the North rose further following the release of a long-detained American college student, Otto Warmbier, and revelations he had been detained in the North for more than a year even after he fell into a coma.Asked if the US is considering any retaliatory action, Thornton avoided a direct answer.""We are very happy to see that Otto Warmbier has been able to return to his family in Ohio and be reunited with them,"" she said. ""We're certainly aware that there are three other American citizens still being held by the North Korean regime, and we very much hope that they can come home soon.""Adding to the tensions was the US seizure of a diplomatic package that a delegation of North Korean officials were carrying at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on their way back home after attending a U.N. meeting.Pyongyang strongly protested and demanded an explanation.Thornton said that the incident was part of a ""lawful"" inspection.""There's a lawful outbound inspection of all passengers, including persons holding diplomatic visas. So I think it's important to note that the inspected individuals in this case are not exempt from inspection at our nation's ports of entry or departure,"" she said.""I understand that this was an action that was undertaken by the Department of Homeland Security, so I would refer you to them for any details.

In truth, a diet in which you cut out large swathes of food is going to be difficult anywhere -- so I hear from gluten-free and paleo diet friends alike. But Korea may be a unique situation. “What can you eat at a Korean restaurant?” I asked a vegan friend. “Mostly plain bibimbap without the fried egg,” was her reply.Even the basic side dish of kimchi is off-limits for strict vegetarians. According to Korean Bapsang, a weekly column that runs in the food section, traditional kimchi requires salted shrimp and fish sauce. So there’s no doubt I’ve taken a somewhat easier path by “only” going pescatarian, which means while eschewing other meat, I still eat seafood. That guarantees finding something to eat at almost any restaurant I go to in Korea. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll just say I don’t eat meat. But even that hasn’t been so simple. The most commonly offered food after saying so? Chicken. I don’t clarify that someone who eats chicken but not other meat -- including seafood -- would be a pollotarian, or that someone who is OK with either would be a pollo-pescatarian. I’ve had to go through this vocabulary lesson myself. It can be a bit cumbersome. But let’s try. Here’s the short version: What is mostly thought of as “vegetarianism” would specifically be ovo-lacto vegetarianism. That means not eating meat, but still consuming dairy and eggs. Ovo vegetarians eat eggs and not dairy and lacto vegetarians eat dairy and not eggs. Vegans, on the other hand, eat no meat and nothing that comes from an animal -- no dairy, no eggs -- or perhaps nothing that has ever touched an animal, which takes most bottles of wine off the table. Then there are the fruitarians -- the ranks of which included Apple co-founder Steve Jobs -- who also avoid most vegetables and primarily eat fruit, seeds and nuts. What this all goes to show is that vegetarianism need not be thought of as all or nothing. As concerns over global warming increase and the link between meat and its negative environmental impacts become clearer, there’s been a stronger push for “flexitarianism” -- being primarily vegetarian, but occasionally indulging in meat -- and weekend or part-time vegetarianism. In 2009, noted celebrity vegan Paul McCartney launched nonprofit group Meat-Free Monday to encourage people to devote a day a week to swearing off meat. The group cites a conservative estimate from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that pins 14.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions on livestock production, while other estimates have ranged as high as 51 percent. Environmental concern was a key driver that led me to what began as an experiment. I was also motivated by wanting to see a change in my health and by the viral Matt Cutts TED Talk video “Try Something New for 30 Days” -- yes, I know I’ve overshot the mark. As for health, I discovered it was no sweat eating poorly without meat. Convenience store pastries and copious amounts of peanut butter and cheese were things I had to learn to be careful of.But after 30 days I also discovered it was no big deal to keep it going. Maybe I would stop in the summer. After, I could make it to Christmas. Later, I may as well go past a full year. Then, two years. Now it’s been three years, three months, three weeks and two days. And I guess I’ll keep going a while.

He also presented the formation of an integrated market over the long term and a vision for clinching a new inter-Korean basic agreement.Since the administration of liberal President Kim Dae-jung, South Korea's inter-Korean policy has a special name to symbolize a leader's North Korea policy.Kim sought the Sunshine policy of engaging North Korea, and his liberal successor Roh Moo-hyun's policy was dubbed the policy on peace and prosperity.Conservative President Lee Myung-bak pursued the so-called ""denuclearization, opening and 3,000 dollars"" strategy. This called for Seoul to help the North attain a per capita income of $3,000 if the communist country gives up its nuclear weapons.Former President Park Geun-hye's key inter-Korean policy was called the Korean Peninsula Trust-Building Process, which called for building mutual trust to pave the way for unification.Some foreign media came up with the term ""Moonshine"" policy for Moon's strategy on the belief that he is likely to succeed the spirit of Kim's Sunshine policy.""The ministry is mulling over a term that can comprehensively and precisely reflect Moon's North Korea policy,"" a ministry official said.","solving north korea nuclear problems ,nuclear weapons former president park ,korea and his liberal successor ,for solving north korea nuclear ,korea nuclear issue and pursue","[""South Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'Moon', ""North Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', ""South Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'Sunshine', 'North Korea', ""Roh Moo - hyun 's"", 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Seoul', ""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'inter - korean', 'the Korean Peninsula Trust - Building Process', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Sunshine', 'Moon', 'North Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25924969  0.20886531

A comprehensive environmental impact assessment, ordered by the Moon administration, can take up to one year. The delay, coming right after a probe into the Defense Ministry over the omission of key information about the project, stoked questions over whether the new liberal Moon administration is trying to distance itself from the THAAD agreement.Chung underlined that, despite the setbacks, the government has no intention to make fundamental changes to what has been promised on grounds of the Korea-US alliance.In the run-up to the May 9 presidential election, Moon had expressed disapproval of the THAAD plan, blaming the rushed decision-making process under his predecessor Park Geun-hye. His claim was that the deployment should first be ratified by the legislature before taking further progress.“Our intention is to go through the required formalities, while confirming the democratic and procedural legitimacy ,” Chung said.“The top priority factor at all times will be the interest and security of our nation.”By Bae Hyun-jung","washington over the project delay ,the may presidential election moon ,senior security adviser to president ,security adviser to president moon ,may presidential election moon","['South Korea', 'US', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'south korean', 'US', 'Chung Eui - yong', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'Moon', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Moon', 'Chung', 'Korea', 'US', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chung', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29649231  0.32626572

We will allow no more unfortunate accidents,” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said via radio.  On May 30, a 32-year-old man from Kazakhstan jumped from the 17-meter high Seoullo 7017 in an apparent suicide, crossing over the 1.4-meter-high safety walls erected to prevent a fall. The incident occurred just 10 days after the elevated park opened on May 20. It has sparked concerns that the capital’s newest landmark might become a site for suicide attempts in a country with one of the world’s highest suicide rates. Fears of secondary accidents also surfaced, as the park is above a high traffic area near Seoul Station. To prevent suicide attempts, Seoul Metropolitan Government plans to increase the number of guards for the park from the current 16 to 31 officers. At least 10 guards will man the overpass-turned-pedestrian park around the clock from July. The city government, however, decided against raising the height of the existing walls, considering structural safety issues, such as the total weight of the elevated walkway and wind pressure. Instead, safety hand rails will be augmented. Modeled after New York’s iconic High Line, Seoullo 7017 was a project involving the renovation of a 40-year-old highway into a public park.The city government said an average of 100,000 to 120,000 people have visited the park on weekends and 40,000 to 70,000 on weekdays.

But the People’s Party is also finding itself in a deepening dilemma over its relations with the new liberal administration led by the Democratic Party of Korea with which it shares the same political roots. In last week’s parliamentary endorsement of Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, the centrist party became a key ally for the 120-member ruling Democratic Party and passed the vote on Lee through the 299-member National Assembly.  Now with another figure -- Fair Trade Commission nominee Kim Sang-jo --awaiting a parliamentary verdict, many of the party’s lawmakers seem to be pondering the same question: Does an opposition party that does not oppose have a place to stand in South Korea’s traditionally acrimonious ruling-opposition rivalry? The People’s Party’s pro-Moon stance has irked other opposition parties which appear to have decided to stick with the tradition. Denouncing the centrist bloc for supporting Lee’s confirmation and pressuring it to get tough on others, the largest opposition and conservative Liberty Korea Party called it a “second army of the ruling party.” “The People’s Party has given up its position as an opposition group to reconsider appointing an unfit figure, Fair Trade Commission nominee Kim Sang-jo,” a statement released by the party read. “The party should just announce their merger with the ruling party.” Indicative of its existential dilemma, the People’s Party is hesitating on its decision on Kim. As two conservative opposition parties have expressed their disapproval toward Kim, due to allegations including copying his academic research paper in 2000, the People’s Party’s decision will make or break the appointment of the renowned chaebol critic. President Moon tapped the economic professor to lead chaebol reforms, which is also what the People’s Party has long called for. The party’s spokesperson Monday said they had requested to push back the date for the scheduled Wednesday meeting to Friday to publish a joint report on Kim. They had previously voted to pass the appointment of Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, who they had initially criticized for his wife’s record of using a fake address, but later approved him for “broad causes.”The label of being a “second army of the ruling party” is not welcomed by the People’s Party, which was established from a group that broke out of the now ruling party. Its founder Ahn Cheol-soo, who ran against Moon in this year’s presidential election, had defected from the then New Politics Alliance of Democracy to create the People’s Party in 2016.However, it is not easy for the party to take a one-sided stance as either a supporter or the opposition of the Moon Jae-in government. While having most of its supporters in the Honam region -- a liberal stronghold in Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces -- they are aware of the liberal president’s popularity there. “Basically, the party’s existence is dependent on Honam’s support, so the party cannot just ignore the regional sentiment of their main supporters,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. President Moon, in a latest poll by Realmeter, garnered 78 percent of support for his managing of state affairs, with the figure standing at 88.1 percent in the region. The People’s Party’s future position would still affect state affairs to some extent. With its 40 parliamentary seats, it holds the key to other main issues being pushed by the new government, including Moon’s No. 1 campaign pledge to increase jobs in the public sector via a supplementary budget. The Finance Ministry unveiled an 11.2 trillion won  supplementary budget plan on Monday, it is set to be submitted to the National Assembly on June 7 for approval. The opposition parties have long been criticizing the plan as “unrealistic” and “short-sighted,” and for the plan to pass the parliament, support from the opposition is crucial. While some say the party is being ambiguous and is unstable, some political pundits view the party as being “flexible” and “rational.”“There are obvious factors such as the sentiment of Honam that affect the party’s decision making, but I think its current decisions are also relatively rational” Yoon said. “Instead of setting a unilateral party platform, it is trying to take in more diverse voices inside the party itself.”He pointed that the party’s leadership is not fully established, which may reflect its lack of definiteness. While Floor Leader Kim Dong-cheol and interim chief Park Joo-sun are leading the party, its chief position will remain vacant until the National Convention expected in July or August.

Because by talking about it, they can take the meaning of art to the next level, like ‘Shoes Tree’ in front of Seoul Station,” Shim told The Korea Herald.“Shoes Tree,” an art installation made of 30,000 worn-out shoes near Seoul Station, elicited mixed reviews after its unveiling last month.Some called it a giant pile of garbage. But others, refraining from premature judgment, expressed curiosity about its artistic intention and meaning.Although the city government is providing a variety of cultural programs to appreciate public art like through municipal art lectures, providing a platform for citizens to appraise and discuss about Seoul’s public art is important in improving public art, according to Yim. Shim So-mi, an independent curator with a 14-year experience in the industry, echoed the view.  Shim So-mi talks with citizens during their excursion to public art in Seoul. “When it comes to public art, citizens should participate from the early stage of planning to removal. Citizens, instead of institutions or building owners, are the main appreciators of public art with responsibility to provide their opinion,” Shim said. As such an example, the curator referred to Taiwan’s Treasure Hill, an illegal settlement-turned-artist village where residents there reinvented the area into a sustainable urban community in Taipei. “I personally believe that Treasure Hill shows the best example of what citizen participation can attribute to society through art. The community’s effort to give a new life to the existing village proves that citizens can lead to the discovery of art that can be enjoyed by many.”By Kim Da-sol","the supervisors for seoul city ,34 year old freelance curator ,many koreans are still shy ,seoul streets found by citizens ,supervisors for seoul city program","['Yim Na - re', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Citizens', 'Seoul', 'Yim', 'Koreans', 'Seoul Station', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul Station', 'Seoul', 'Yim', 'Seoul', 'Taiwan', 'Taipei', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63100702  0.26266423

Instead, the US should express its willingness to ""accept Chinese priority interest for stability and the political status quo,"" they said.""A new strategy implies adjusting the objectives of an old, failed strategy, so that priority objectives are more likely to be achieved.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Thursday that it would introduce fare exemptions for bus and subway users during commuting hours -- from the first train or bus to 9 a.m. and from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. -- on days when the daily average concentration of ultra fine dust is above 50 micrograms per cubic meter. The same will apply when the fine dust concentration is forecast to be above 80 micrograms per cubic meter on the following day.“This measure is to boost citizen participation in the odd-even license plate number program,” said Jung Mi-seon, a Seoul City official in charge of air quality management division. The system is a voluntary program that encourages drivers to leave their cars on days designated according to the last number of their license plate. In a public debate last week, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon vowed that he will prioritize concerns for citizens over costs in battling air pollution. The debate, held in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, had brought some 3,000 citizens and experts together to help solve the fine dust problem.“Seoul may suffer 25 billion won  in financial losses a year when public transportation is offered for free, based on last year’s record of fine dust levels rising to ‘serious’ seven times,” said Park during a talk with citizens.“But the value of human beings is far greater than that of money.”Calling the fine dust situation a disaster, the city government said it would implement a revised ordinance and new advisory system to protect the vulnerable, such as elderly and children, from air pollutants and related health risks. The city will inject 2.9 billion won to install air purifiers at 6,284 child care centers and 488 child welfare institutions. Another 13 billion won will be allocated to providing face masks for the vulnerable when the fine dust advisory is issued. Both plans will start from July, the city government said.In addition, traffic will be restricted in the center of the city.If the Transport Ministry approves the plan, the roughly 17 square kilometers within Seoul’s city walls will be off limits to vehicles with poor emissions ratings. The city said it would introduce this new traffic policy as early as next year, along with measures to install CCTV systems and charge penalties to those who drive in the designated area.By Kim Da-sol","july seoul will provide free ,debate last week seoul mayor ,curb air pollution the seoul ,subway users during commuting hours ,seoul may suffer 25 billion","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Jung Mi - seon', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'the Transport Ministry', 'Seoul', 'CCTV', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66876769  0.31576875

This undated file photo shows the Iron Flagpole of the 918-1392 Goryeo Dynasty, known as ""Cheol Danggan"" in Korean, in Cheongju, central South Korea. The Cheongju municipal government and an association of merchants at the Seongan Road Market had requested the Cultural Heritage Administration grant permission for the implementation of the project as part of efforts to draw more customers and tourists to the market.In March, the administration in charge of construction projects involving cultural properties greenlighted the 200 million-won  project after the business group pledged to preserve the plaza's original form and have experts supervise it.The project called for the recreation of the plaza as a lively rendezvous for young people in their teens and 20s, highlighting the medieval flagpole.Among the plans is using optical fiber and light-emitting diodes  to illuminate the plaza and the flagpole, respectively.Other measures being considered include LED ad boards, digital signs and a nighttime laser show.A business group official said, ""We hope we will make good use of Cheol Danggan as a splendid attraction, adding the improvement of the plaza through the project will boost projects aimed at improving business at traditional markets in the city.""The ""Cheol Danggan"" Iron Flagpole, which is located at the entrance of the now-demolished Yongdu Temple site, was built in 962, during the reign of King Gwangjo, the fourth monarch of the Goryeo period. Danggan, which means flagpole in Korean, was used to affix a flag called ""Dang"" to pay tribute to the virtues of Buddha and Bodhisattva or to expel evil spirits, when Buddhist ceremonies were performed at temples.The only iron flagpole remaining in South Korea that has inscriptions detailing the time of the erection has 20 iron tubes put together up right, with each iron tube measuring 43 centimeters in diameter and 65 centimeters in hight. It also has two pillars supporting the pole.It was designated as National Treasure No. 41 in 1962 after being named as a treasure in 1936 by Japan, which ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45.Prior to the designation of the national treasure, the flagpole had been poorly protected due to the lack of understanding the importance of its value as a cultural property and budgetary constraints, among others.","korea said thursday it plans ,the state run korea tourism ,nighttime laser show business group ,market in march the administration ,central south korea said thursday","[""Korea Tourism Organization 's"", 'Cheongju', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'the Iron Flagpole', 'the 918 - 1392 Goryeo Dynasty', 'Cheol Danggan', 'Korean', 'the Iron Flagpole', 'the 918 - 1392 Goryeo Dynasty', 'Cheol Danggan', 'Korean', 'Cheongju', 'South Korea', 'Cheongju', 'the Seongan Road Market', 'the Cultural Heritage Administration', 'Cheol Danggan', 'Yongdu Temple', 'King Gwangjo', 'Danggan', 'Korean', 'Buddha', 'Bodhisattva', 'buddhist', 'South Korea', 'Japan']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64633644  0.85496014

North Korea is not a member.On the sidelines of the session, Han is expected to hold a series of bilateral and multilateral meetings with some of his counterparts, such as US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Japan's Tomomi Inada.In talks with Mattis, North Korea's growing missile and nuclear threats will be high on the agenda.It's almost certain that the THAAD issue will be raised as well, as it comes ahead of summit talks between South Korea's new President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart Donald Trump slated for late this month.The US Forces Korea has positioned two THAAD rocket launchers and a cutting-edge X-band radar at the designated site in Seongju, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, under a bilateral deal signed in 2016.Four more launchers remain stored at a nearby US military base to be installed there.Han has come under fire amid allegations that he has sought to conceal the dispatch of the four extra launchers to the country.The presidential office said the defense ministry ""intentionally"" dropped a related explanation from a report to Moon on pending defense issues.The THAAD equipment apparently arrived here before Moon took office on May 9 in a process that the Pentagon says was transparent.But Moon has stated that THAAD was brought into the country without public consent and due procedures. He wants to review Seoul's decision on THAAD or renegotiate it with the Trump administration.","week his ministry announced thursday ,south korea new president moon ,donald trump slated for late ,his ministry announced thursday ,held in seoul on feb","[""South Korea 's"", 'Singapore', 'Han Min - koo', 'north korean', 'US', 'south korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'american', 'Jim Mattis', 'Seoul', 'Han', 'the Shangri - La Dialogue', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Han', 'US', 'Jim Mattis', 'Japan', 'Tomomi Inada', ""North Korea 's"", 'thaad', ""South Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'american', 'Donald Trump', 'the US Forces Korea', 'Seongju', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Han', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Pentagon', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Trump']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.145712    0.8667438

Jeff Davis told reporters.Earlier in the day, Moon said it was ""very shocking"" to learn that the Defense Ministry failed to report to him that an additional four launchers for THAAD have been brought into the country in addition to the two that had already been installed.Moon also ordered a probe into the matter.The ministry, however, claimed that it has reported the deployment of the additional launchers to Moon's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong.The THAAD deployment has been one of the most sensitive political and defense issues in South Korea for years as China has vehemently opposed the deployment, claiming that the system, especially its powerful X-band radar, hurts its security interests.The deployment has become even more unpopular in South Korea as the public raised questions about decisions made by former President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and then ultimately ousted from office on corruption charges. It was when Park was in office that Seoul decided to host the system.Moon has also been critical of the decision, saying it was made without due process to collect public opinion.US President Donald Trump fueled opposition to THAAD among the South Korean public by demanding Seoul pay for the $1 billion system. The demand runs counter to a deployment agreement under which the US agreed to pay for the system if the South agreed to host it and provide land.","south korea after president moon ,installed moon also ordered probe ,korea after president moon ,to south korea after president ,president donald trump fueled opposition","['the US Defense Department', 'South Korea', 'Moon Jae -', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Pentagon', 'Jeff Davis', 'Moon', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Chung Eui - yong', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'US']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67596585  0.5300017

Some called it a giant pile of garbage. Others, refraining from premature judgment, expressed curiosity over its artistic intention and meaning. The artist, Hwang Ji-hae, sat down with The Korea Herald on Monday, two days after its unveiling Saturday, to discuss her work.Hwang Ji-hae, garden designer and environmental artist, stands in front of her installation art Shoes Tree in front of Seoul Station on Monday. “Each of these shoes, whether they are high heels, baby shoes, sandals or running shoes, carry different stories, memories and meanings of those who wore them. “And we all wear shoes,” said the 39-year-old artist. Nearly 30,000 shoes form cascading tree bushes, decorated with plants and flowers, just outside Seoul Station, in celebration of the grand opening of Seoullo 7017, an old overpass-turned-public park. It was a pro-bono work by Hwang, an internationally recognized garden designer and environmental artist. In 2012, she won the gold medal at the 2012 Chelsea Flower Show with her work “Quiet Time: DMZ Forbidden Garden.” A year before, she won the same award by turning a traditional Korean bathroom into a garden, called “Hae-woo-so.”Her previous works featured naturalized planting, old military shoes, sand mold for casting metals and a bunch of twigs, Hwang said. “But on top of that, my favorite material to work with is bolt nuts. They are cheap and easily found.”The reason why Hwang specifically picked shoes this time was to highlight the meaning of urban restoration to visitors of Seoullo 7017.“Both ‘Shoes Tree’ and Seoullo 7017 are given new life with new meanings, reborn as a creative upcycling art and a unique park, respectively.”She added that using shoes to create a tree was to remember the historical significance of the Yeomcheon-gyo handmade shoes street, located behind Seoullo 7017.A partipant of the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” takes a photo of installation art Shoes Tree in Seoul Station on Saturday. But her selection of shoes for art material was primarily because she believed shoes reflected the connection between herself, her art and the public.“Through shoes, something we wear every day and an easy material to get, I wanted to show people that everyday material can also become part of art.”From the early stage of installation, however, Shoes Tree was at the center of controversy. “At first, I thought it was a pile of garbage,” said 49-year-old Kim Gui-ri. “Looking at it up close, it is surely a garbage mountain and smells really bad,” Kim said. Cho Sook-hyun, a local freelance art journalist, said that “the idea of recycling worn-out materials is creative, but since it was created as public art, which must at first give joy and have a healing effect on citizens, I personally think ‘Shoes Tree’ does not serve its purpose correctly.”There are also many who appreciate it as a creative artwork.“Since art is not something that must be always beautiful or contain an aesthetic side, I think ‘Shoes Tree,’ as a work of art itself, can portray a different perspective of appreciating art,” said freelance artist surnamed Kim.Hwang expressed regret about people’s negative reviews because it was made of untidy, worn-out shoes and didn’t help Seoul look prettier. “Many probably felt unfamiliar and uncomfortable looking at ‘Shoes Tree,’ because they have never thought that shoes could be part of art. I understand people appreciate art in different ways,” Hwang said.The artist stressed that she wanted to make a strong impression on viewers with the artwork. “Since Shoes Tree will be removed after nine days, I wanted to make it strong and impressive during a short period of time. I hope Shoes Tree speaks for who I am as an artist,” Hwang said. “I could have used golden bars to lure the public and make a good impression, don’t you think? My art is always an attempt to communicate with the public.”By Kim Da-sol","planting old military shoes sand ,grand opening of seoullo 7017 ,unveiling saturday to discuss her ,shoes tree in seoul station ,seoul station on monday each","['Seoul Station', 'Hwang Ji - hae', 'the Korea Herald', 'Hwang Ji - hae', 'Seoullo 7017', 'Hwang', 'Forbidden Garden', 'korean', 'Hwang', 'Seoullo', 'Seoullo 7017', 'Yeomcheon', 'Seoullo', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim Gui - ri', 'Kim', 'Cho Sook - hyun', 'Kim', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'Hwang', 'Shoes Tree', 'Hwang', 'Kim Da - sol']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26091835  0.42549846

Eight years have passed, yet all of you here have ever stayed by President Roh Moo-hyun's side, and for this I don’t quite know how to express my gratitude.I am also deeply thankful that I was able to keep my promise I made during the election season that I shall attend today‘s memorial ceremony as president.It seems to me that on this day, even President Roh may be standing somewhere among us in the crowd, thanking everybody and saying “Ah, it feels good!”Years have passed, perhaps enough to fade the commemorative memory, yet still more people are calling out Roh Moo-hyun’s name.The name Roh Moo-hyun has become a symbol of a world without foul play or privilege, a world where common sense and principles are valid.Roh's death, over which we have all suffered so, led to the awakening of citizens and eventually became a power to change the world.These days, I am receiving praise and love which I do not deserve.It is not that I have done anything special, except making efforts to make a normal country and to become a normal president.The fact that such normal efforts have come to be taken as something special indicates how our society has been seriously abnormal for a long time.President Roh Moo-hyun’s dreams were not so different.His dream was to build a country in which democracy, human rights and welfare function properly, a nation without regionalism, ideology conflicts and discrimination.With such a goal, he struggled to renounce his presidential authority and to communicate with the people in their language.His lofty ideals, however, lacked power.He failed to overpass the wall of reality.Since Roh's discouragement, our society and politics have retrogressed into the abnormal, growing further away from the people’s hope.But that dream of his hereby takes another leap.Roh Moo-hyun's dream has been revived by the power of the citizens.The dream which we dreamt together led us here today.From now on, we shall never fail again.We will reflect on the past 20 years, not only on the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, but also on the Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun governments, to step ahead into the road of success.We have to expand our dream beyond the Participatory Government to a whole new Republic of Korea, a decent country.We have to put down the guilt of failing to protect President Roh and move on to building such a country together.Let us show once again that we are much more competent in national security, economy, and in state affairs in general.My dream is to build a government for all, to become a president for all.The most important thing is to keep hold of the people’s hands and to walk with them all the way.I shall walk ahead, keeping in mind that even the reason I carry out reform is to benefit the people and fulfill their wishes, not because it is my personal belief, not because it is the right thing to do.Should the people pace ahead, I will speed up. If they slow down, I will communicate and persuade them.I will achieve a tangible reform so that the next democratic government may carry on the task, if the Moon Jae-in government fails to carry through within its term.President Roh Moo-hyun, I miss you, I miss you ever so dearly.But during the rest of my term, I shall keep you in my heart only.This is to be the last time that I attend this memorial ceremony as standing president.I hereby return you to the people.I promise you that I will come to see you, after completing my mission as a successful president.I hope you will then greet me with a bright smile, saying “Ah, it feels good!” just the way you used to say it.I once again thank all those who have attended the event, and offer my condolence to Lady Kwon Yang-sook and the bereaved family members who have endured with courage.Thank you.May 23, 2017President Moon Jae-inBy Bae Hyun-jung","late president roh moo hyun ,memorial address delivered on tuesday ,anniversary of the late president ,tuesday at the eighth anniversary ,service for late former president","['Moon Jae - in', ""Roh Moo - hyun 's"", 'Moon Jae -', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Bongha', 'Seoul', 'South Gyeongsang Province', ""Roh Moo - hyun 's"", 'Roh', 'Roh Moo - hyun ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', ""Roh Moo - hyun 's"", 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Republic of Korea', 'Roh', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Lady Kwon Yang']",17,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01601328 0.57874095 0.13493013]

Ousted former President Park Geun-hye  sits at the defense table at the Seoul Central District Court as her trial on corruption charges begins on May 23, 2017, also involving her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil . Park is suspected of soliciting 59.2 billion won  in bribes for herself and Choi, an allegation that could have her imprisoned for a minimum 10 years to life if convicted.The start of her trial could highlight the nadir of Park's fate, which has drastically changed over the course of only a few months.She was in the country's highest elected office less than eight months ago when her corruption allegations first surfaced in October.Despite her repeated denials, it has been a steady roll down hill for her ever since.The parliament voted to impeach Park in December, marking the second impeachment of an incumbent president in the country's history.And on March 10, the Constitutional Court upheld the parliamentary impeachment, making Park the first South Korean leader to ever be removed from office.On Tuesday, Park became the third president in the country's history to face a criminal trial.On the opposite side of the spectrum is former President Roh Moo-hyun, who had largely remained disgraced and accused of corruption since he took his own life eight years ago Tuesday amid a prosecution investigation on corruption allegations involving his family members.An annual memorial service again marked his tragic death in his native hometown of Bongha, a small village located some 450 kilometers southeast of Seoul in South Gyeongsang Province.What made this year's service special was the attendance of President Moon Jae-in, apparently reinstating the late president's honor.The president was also joined by a series of political leaders such as National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, as well as his top presidential aides, including chief of staff Im Jong-seok.When asked to comment on former President Park's trial, however, officials at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said they had nothing to say.","president ousted former president park ,trial for ousted former president ,former president park trial however ,ousted former president while memorial ,former president ousted former president","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'south korean', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Bongha', 'Seoul', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Moon Jae - in', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Park']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26409423  0.57842594

Seoul`s new high rise park dubbed ""Seoullo 7017"" At that time, Park revealed a plan to transform the old Seoul Station elevated road built in 1970 into a new landmark public park both for residents and visitors, instead of its dismantlement.The 1,024-meter-long and 10.3-meter-wide elevated road, which was used by vehicles visiting Seoul Station for 45 years, has been converted into a park full of green trees and flowers, officials at the Seoul Metropolitan Government said.The government said the new park, dubbed ""Seoullo 7017"" for its completion in 1970 and rebirth in 2017, opened to the public at 10 a.m. Saturday, with a formal opening ceremony slated for 8 p.m. the same day. Visitors dip their feet in a mini pool at the newly opened park on Saturday. It noted that about 24,000 flower and tree pots have been installed along the elevated park, while restaurants, flower shops, a library, marionette theater, benches and other facilities will provide convenience to citizens and tourists.Particularly for the convenience of foreign tourists, the so-called ""Seoullo Tourist Cafe"" will offer various tourism information and luggage storage services. Tourists can also use copying, scanning and fax machines at the cafe.A man looks into ""Shoes Tree,"" a public art installation made of 30,000 pairs of shoes.

She chose the location because it is only a few minutes from the nearby subway station with a lot of foot traffic from office workers who she thought might need some solace in art.   On Friday, the museum unveiled the next -- and the last -- lineup of its current exhibition, ""Everyone is an Artist and Everything is Art,"" with two Korean artists Gwon O-sang and Dongi.They are credited for lowering the high bar that art laymen may feel contemporary art has, explained the museum.   Exploring new materials and formats in sculpture, Gwon pushes the boundaries of sculpture and photography. In his signature artwork ""Deodorant Type,"" he creates a Styrofoam sculpture covered with thousands of photo images.    Best known for ""Atomouse,"" a character that combines Atom from Japanese animation and Mickey Mouse from Disney's, Lee tries to redefine fine art by borrowing images from mass media and culture and putting what has been considered low art on par with high art by reenacting pop culture in a traditional painting.     The selection of the two artists and the display of their artwork in an unconventional way are meant to make visitors feel more comfortable with contemporary art, said the director.   ""I've intentionally destroyed the tension among art pieces on display even though it might not be the most sophisticated way of displaying artwork,"" she said.   Indeed, some of the paintings are hung above others, a display rarely seen in traditional art museums.    ""In most museums, artwork is sacred.

China's customs inspections, which had been strengthened due to the THAAD system, seem to be somewhat alleviated, a vendor, only identified by his last name Lee, said Friday. ""Not long ago, Chinese inspectors searched even our pockets when we departed China, but yesterday they let us easily go through customs,"" he said. A Chinese vendor, asking to not be named, also said the frozen atmosphere in China looks to be thawing little by little. ""The amount of products that Chinese merchants are bringing into South Korea from China also seems to be on a gradual increase,"" he said.In fact, the number of ferry passengers on routes linking Incheon to Chinese cities is showing a slow recovery. Since the Chinese government's ban on traveling to South Korea on March 15, the number of ferry passengers dived 30.3 percent to 55,804 in March from a year ago, and 65.5 percent to 34,686 last month. But the comparable figure recorded 22,755 during the first 18 days of May, producing a daily average of 1,264. The daily average is a 9.3-percent increase from last month's 1,156. Friday alone, 1,267 passengers from six Chinese cities, including Weihai, Shidao and Dandong, entered Incheon aboard ferries. ""Vendors still make up the most passengers, but Chinese tourist groups will significantly increase as in the past once China's tour ban is lifted,"" a ferry official said. The Incheon port authorities are also trying to recover the number of cruise ships entering the port.This year, cruise ships from Chinese cities were originally scheduled to dock at Incheon 31 times, but the figure plunged to eight due to a flood of trip cancellations on account of THAAD. Up until Friday this year, only five cruise ships carrying a mere 14,138 Chinese passengers entered the port, according to the authorities.""Cruise entries will be activated again once the ties between the nations return to normal,"" Ahn Kil-seop, a port authority official, said.","hae chan in beijing friday ,after liberal south korean president ,korea will improve after liberal ,improve after liberal south korean ,early this month chinese president","['INCHEON', ""South Korea 's"", 'Incheon', 'China', 'US', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'chinese', 'Xi Jin - ping', 'Moon', 'Lee Hae - chan', 'Beijing', 'south korean', 'China', 'chinese', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Lee', 'chinese', 'China', 'chinese', 'China', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Incheon', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Weihai', 'Shidao', 'Dandong', 'Incheon', 'chinese', 'China', 'Incheon', 'chinese', 'Incheon 31', 'chinese', 'Ahn Kil - seop']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75925112  0.71255541

Revisions Moon envisions include a four-year presidency with the possibility of re-election, while some in the opposition bloc have called for a semi-presidential system. Moon and the floor leaders also agreed on creating a consultative group that would involve regular meetings among the lawmakers across the aisle.“The idea was first offered by the president. While it would be chaired by the prime minister, the president said he would also preside once in a while,” Chung in a briefing after the meeting. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party offered broad-minded cooperation to the new administration, but will also make sure that they express opposition when it goes in the wrong direction, he added.On the issue of national security, Moon promised to share information with the National Assembly. A team of special envoys has been sent to visit allies and neighboring countries including the United States and China. The main opposition has asked to deliver the reports of their foreign meetings upon their arrival.With the deployment of the US-led missile defense system, THAAD, Moon reiterated that the matter should put to a vote at the National Assembly. For the Moon administration to proceed with much of their plans, they need to get a majority of votes from the opposition-led parliament. Currently his ruling Democratic Party controls 120 National Assembly seats, short 30 votes from a majority in the 299-seat unicameral house.By Jo He-rim","meeting two hour long luncheon ,june 2018 at meeting ,parties the meeting two hour ,press briefing afterwards the party ,constitutional revision by june next","['Moon Jae - in', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Moon ’s', 'Park Soo - hyun', 'Woo Won - shik', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Kim Dong - cheol', 'the People‘s Party', 'Chung Woo', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Bareun Party', 'Roh Hoe - chan', 'Justice Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Chung', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Moon', 'the National Assembly', 'the United States', 'China', 'US', 'Moon', 'the National Assembly', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', '120 National Assembly', 'Jo He - rim']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54001427  0.30805129

Lee Hee-beom, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, answers a question during a roundtable event with journalists at the South Korean Embassy in London on May 18, 2017. ""South Korea will welcome North Korea and when they decide to come, the South Korean government will allow them to come by road,"" Lee was quoted by Reuters as saying. ""And when they have supporting teams, the  Korean government will allow them to come by ship. All nations are very welcome, including North Korea and Russia . We want it to be the peace games.""Typically, North Korean athletes competing in the South have flown in via Beijing. The Korean Peninsula has remained divided since 1953, with the demilitarized zone, a 4km-wide buffer zone, guarded on either side by troops.According to an official with the organizing committee, President Moon Jae-in, before taking office, had spoken of possibly opening the land route for the North Korean Olympic delegation in his January meeting with Gangwon Province Governor Choi Moon-soon. PyeongChang is located in the eastern province.Tension lingers in the area with a string of missile launches by North Korea, the threat of an imminent nuclear test, and virtually all inter-Korean exchanges have been put on hold.Yet athletes from either side made cross-border trips for competitions last month. The South Korean women's football team went to Pyongyang for the Asian Football Confederation Women's Asian Cup qualifying matches. Around the same time, the North Korean women's hockey team came to Gangneung, Gangwon Province, for the International Ice Hockey Federation Women's World Championship Division II Group A.During the hockey team's visit, a North Korean sports official told Governor Choi that North Korea will try to send ""as many athletes as possible"" to PyeongChang.Moon is expected to adopt a more conciliatory approach toward North Korea, though his hands appear to be tied by Pyongyang's continued push with its nuclear and missile programs.","2018 winter olympics in south ,korean sports official told governor ,hockey federation women world championship ,winter olympics in south korea ,and paralympic winter games answers","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'London', 'Lee Hee - beom', 'PyeongChang', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Lee', 'Lee Hee - beom', 'the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee', 'Paralympic Winter Games', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'London', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Lee', 'Reuters', 'korean', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'north korean', 'Beijing', 'Moon Jae - in', 'north korean', 'Gangwon Province', 'Choi Moon - soon', 'PyeongChang', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', ""the Asian Football Confederation Women 's"", 'north korean', 'Gangneung', 'Gangwon Province', ""the International Ice Hockey Federation Women 's World Championship Division II Group"", 'north korean', 'Choi', 'North Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang']",10,"[ 0.          5.          2.         ... -0.65290004  0.85798287

The measure, still under discussion at related ministries, would be a follow-up to President Moon Jae-in’s surprise directive last week to temporarily close down old coal-fired power plants to combat the country’s worsening air quality. An official at the Education Ministry confirmed to The Korea Herald on Wednesday that it is currently reviewing the budget. If the measure gets the green light, at least 160,000 day cares, kindergartens, elementary schools and nursing homes for the elderly nationwide will have an air purifier in every room. As many as 1 million South Koreans are expected to benefit.An image of air purifier While the shutdown of outdated coal-powered plants is part of fundamental controls on dust emissions, installing air purifiers in classrooms and other places would help reduce the damage, the ministry official explained.President Moon, who was sworn in a week ago, said during a visit to an elementary school on Monday that the government would “inject some 60 billion won  to complete installing dust-measuring devices at some 11,000 elementary to high schools across the nation to constantly monitor air quality.” Moon also added he would make sure classrooms and gyms at schools are equipped with air purifying devices so students can enjoy activities any time they want.The Seoul Metropolitan Government welcomed the move.The capital city said it will work hand in hand with the central government’s plan to protect the vulnerable from air pollutants and related health risks. In line with the government’s efforts to combat fine dust, Seoul City said it plans to restrict traffic volume in the center of the city.If the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport approves the plan, some 17 square kilometers surrounded by Seoul’s four main gates -- Namdaemun, Changuimun, Hyehwamun and Heunginjimun -- will be off limits to vehicles. The city said it will introduce this new traffic policy as early as next year, along with measures of installing CCTV systems and charging penalties to those who drive in the designated area. “In the so-called ‘green zone,’ all vehicles will be restricted, considering the increased traffic volume, environment issues and, most importantly, to reduce fine dust levels,” said Lee Sang-hun, the city government’s transportation policy head. But when there is traffic congestion during rush hours, officials said it may adopt a plan B, such as only allowing preregistered vehicles and ecofriendly tour buses in the green driving zone. Based on government data that showed outdated diesel cars are one of the main causes of air pollution here, the Seoul Metropolitan Government banned in April some 1.4 million diesel cars that were registered before 2005 from its roads.By Kim Da-sol","april some million diesel cars ,160 000 day cares kindergartens ,fired power plants to combat ,the korea herald on wednesday ,korea is moving to distribute","['South Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Koreans', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul City', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Seoul', 'CCTV', 'Lee Sang - hun', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Kim Da - sol']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70168436  0.903543

Flower seeds have been planted inside each shoe. “We invited Hwang to install Shoes Tree to give a meaning of urban restoration to visitors of Seoullo 7017,” said Choi Kwang-bin, the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s city gardening department.“Both Shoes Tree and Seoullo 7017 are given new life with new meaning, reborn as a creative upcycling art and a unique park, respectively.”The reason Hwang used shoes to create a tree was to remember the historical significance of the Yeomcheon-gyo handmade shoes street, located behind Seoullo 7017, the artist was quoted as saying.Workers hang worn-out shoes on Shoes Tree on Seoullo 7017, Seoul’s soon-to-open pedestrian-friendly park, near Seoul Station on Tuesday. The city restoration project of Seoullo 7017 began four years ago to make use of an old overpass that once served as a major road connecting western and central Seoul. Public calls for its removal had mounted after a safety assessment classified the outdated overpass as dangerous in 2006.

History mingles with a bustling metropolis here. Society’s top elites share the space with protests of all kinds and tourists. It is also here that South Koreans witnessed the massive grassroots movement that unseated former President Park Geun-hye and brought in a new leader, President Moon Jae-in, this week.  An aerial view of Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul Millions of South Koreans relentlessly took to the streets of Gwanghwamun, calling for former President Park’s ouster over a corruption scandal, just a few kilometers away from the presidential palace. “The square has been where pain and joy coexist. For me, it is a symbol of defiance and victory,” said Cho Mi-ran, who joined the anti-Park rallies almost every weekend for months. Professor Choi Chang-ryul of Yong In University sees Gwanghwamun as a symbol of the country’s vibrant democracy. “The square is a crucial part of direct democracy and a reminder that the owner of this country is the people,” he said. The area’s name Gwanghwamun derives from the namesake gate of Gyeongbok Palace, built in 1395 during the Joseon Dynasty and reconstructed several times. Stretching from the gate, the 557-meter-long Gwanghwamun Square in the middle of the 10-lane thoroughfare opened to the public in 2009, after yearslong restoration. Before then, it was mostly a busy office district for elite workers in the central government and finance industry. Now, the square is bustling with tourists as it features statues of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and King Sejong the Great -- two of the county’s most respected ancestors -- with an exhibition hall and a museum underground. The area also has the nation’s biggest bookstore, the US embassy and a concert hall. And almost every day, someone is protesting against something here. A unionized worker accuses his employer for the abuse of basic labor rights; a minority group demands an end to social discrimination against them; a disabled person calls for better access to public transport. Last summer, even two Britons held protests here to urge South Koreans to stop slaughtering dogs for meat. Various groups also put up performances and flash mobs -- sometimes drawing hundreds of participants, in order to make their voices heard. In summer of 2014, when Pope Francis held an open-air mass here, the area had virtually turned into a giant outdoor cathedral. Earlier that year, the square witnessed an outpouring of sorrow as the nation mourned the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. A joint alter was erected for the 304 people who lost their lives in the tragic sinking -- mostly students on a field trip. The openness of Gwanghwamun is a microcosm of the history of the relationship between the ruler and the ruled that traces back to Joseon Dynasty , says Kim Baek-young, one of co-authors of a book “Seoul Sociology.”When the kings and queens came out of Gyeongbok Palace, at the northern end of the area, ordinary people played musical instruments to capture attention and let their hardships known, he explained. During the Japanese colonial rule of Korea, the area witnessed a mass civilian uprising for independence in 1919. The April Revolution of 1960 and the June Democratic Uprising of 1987 also occurred here. “The events triggered by a burst of fierce public energy embody Korean society’s tradition of strong political awareness and engagement,” the author said. However, the significance of Gwanghwamun as a center for democracy has somewhat weakened with the arrival of a modern representative democracy in South Korea in 1987. That changed with the anti-Park protests of the last winter. Candlelight rallies against the former leader began at Gwanghwamun in October and soon spread to major cities nationwide in what some later described as the “candle revolution.” A cumulative 1.7 million people had joined 23 rallies at Gwanghwamun, and more in elsewhere, according to the rally organizers. The massive peaceful movement eventually led to Park’s parliamentary impeachment, which the Constitutional Court upheld in March this year. “The rallies were for the citizens to get back their square from those abusing power bestowed by the public,” Nam Jeong-su, a spokesperson for an association of 1,500 civic groups that organized the anti-Park rallies.Professor Lee Na-young of Chung-Ang University said the experience has taught many South Koreans how to do democracy. “While protesting for the same cause to condemn the government’s wrongdoings, minorities raised their voices and people stood in solidarity. Koreans learned how to do democracy in everyday lives,” the sociology professor said. Under the new Moon Jae-in administration, Gwanghwamun is likely to gain more significance as a social and political center stage. Moon, who began and ended his election campaign at the square, has vowed to usher in the “era of Gwanghwamun presidency.” He wants to move his work office from Cheong Wa Dae to the area. The president earlier announced the launch of two committees to handle the project to relocate the presidential office and overhaul the center of Seoul to be more citizen-friendly. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon also unveiled his plan to restructure the square to downsize the current 10-lane road, expand the square’s size and re-enact Yukjo street, the main street of old Seoul, to restore a historic meaning to the area.Meanwhile, Nam, the organizer of the candlelight rallies against Park, vows to keep a close watch on how the government is run and voice their opinions at the square. “We will gather again at the square as we always have if we think the government goes the wrong way,” he said.

It’s held in Gangwon Province and  the first major international event to be hosted by the new government, and there’s less burden because of its non-political nature and the Olympic spirit,” he said in an interview, referring to a region that shares a border with North Korea. “It could serve as a crucial platform for us to start talks with the North.”South Korean President Moon Jae-in Given heightened tension and the absence of cross-border communication channels, the event could set the stage for Seoul to sound out Pyongyang’s willingness to engage in negotiations. The plan is to increase exchanges, such as through reunions of separated families, and then extract the moratorium in exchange for “corresponding” measures such as on the Kaesong and Kumkangsan projects, Choi said.  Mindful of potential diplomatic and domestic backlash, the Moon administration will take the measures only after Pyongyang does its part and reverse them if it backpedals on its promises. The initiative would also require consultations with the US and other neighbors given controversy over whether the projects infringe upon the UN Security Council resolutions and independent sanctions adopted by past Seoul governments and Washington, he noted. “If we could manage to perk up the mood through the Olympics and then expand interactions, we will be able to send a meaningful signal about our intention,” Choi said. “And if the North takes explicit steps on denuclearization, we may take our own regarding Kaesong and Kumkangsan.” Yet the president will not be bent on rushing talks for the sake of talks, he said, adding there are “lots of procedures to undergo, and nationwide consensus should be built before we get there.” The professor has been working with Moon since long before he launched his second presidential bid. His name is currently being floated for top diplomatic jobs including foreign minister. The president, who served in ranking posts in the Roh Moo-hyun administration, is widely expected to carry on with the late liberal leader’s strategy of pursuing greater political and economic cooperation with the North. On the campaign trail, Moon had pledged to revive the Kaesong district and Kumkangsan tours. During his formal oath of office Wednesday, he said he would visit Pyongyang under the “right conditions” to negotiate on the nuclear issues. That approach is kindling concerns over potential friction with the US’ Donald Trump administration, which has recently settled on its North Korea policy focusing on “maximum pressure and engagement.” Choi ditched the view, saying the Moon government would never defy UNSC resolutions for its own political interests nor create a crack in international coordination on the nuclear program, though it may give more weight to negotiations than its predecessors. “The new government will begin its own policy review after house cleaning and a buildup for a couple of months, but I assume it will no longer apply strict reciprocity as previous ones did,” he said. “Yes, the possibility and resolve for dialogue is higher than before, and the signal should be sent to the North.“Our aim is to take the lead in one of the two prongs of international cooperation -- negotiations and contact -- while the UNSC continues to steer the other. Otherwise, there won’t be any breakthrough to foster peace and stability on the peninsula.” Despite skepticism over leader Kim Jong-un’s unruliness and will for denuclearization, dialogue is all the more necessary now than ever to comprehend the precise situation, he said. “North Korea under Kim Jong-il and North Korea under Kim Jong-un are quite different. Since we haven’t have any access to Pyongyang for the past decade, we don’t know who they are and they don’t know who we are, which is why there are sustained doubts,” Choi said. “What the Moon government wants to do is conduct empirical research, getting to know about their vision for denuclearization, how they want to resolve the situation, and how big and broad the gap is between ours and theirs. With that, we can only figure out whether we should talk or sanction or completely isolate them.”By Shin Hyon-hee  and Yeo Jun-suk","hosting the 2018 winter olympics ,launched his second presidential bid ,2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang ,korea hosting the 2018 winter ,tone for nuclear moratorium","['South Korea', 'PyeongChang', 'the Korea Herald', 'Choi Jong - kun', 'Yonsei University', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Gangwon Province', 'North Korea', 'korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Kumkangsan', 'Choi', 'Moon', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Choi', 'Kaesong', 'Kumkangsan', 'Moon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Kumkangsan', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'Choi', 'Moon', 'UNSC', 'UNSC', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - il', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Choi', 'Moon', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",13,"[ 0.          0.          5.         ... -0.3064847   0.3541815

Suh, 64, had worked at the spy agency for more than 28 years until his retirement in 2008. He is currently a professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. During his service at the NIS, Suh was known as a North Korea expert, having played a key role in helping arrange summit talks between the two Koreas in 2000 and 2007. “Arranging an inter-Korean summit is necessary to reduce military tensions in the Korean Peninsula and to start a talk for resolving the nuclear issue, although it is too early in the current stage to bring up the summit,” said Suh during a press conference held at Cheong Wa Dae. “I think  can go to Pyongyang if some conditions are met.”Along with Suh, the president also announced his picks for the prime minister and chiefs of the presidential secretariat and presidential security service.

Animal rights groups, pet lovers and a local newspaper Hankyoreh are demanding President Moon Jae-in make good on his promise to adopt Tory, a 4-year-old dog, from an animal shelter in Seoul. Tory, a 4-year-old mix-breed dog Moon was sworn in at noon Wednesday after winning the election the previous day. During his 60-day electioneering, the liberal politician, who has one dog and two cats, met with fellow pet lovers and supporters of animal rights groups, vowing to make Korea a better place not just for humans but also animals. Since being saved from slaughter two years ago, Tory has stayed at the shelter, as he was unpopular with would-be adopters. During the meeting, Moon was asked to be its new owner and he had promised then to take it to the presidential residence, if elected. “My family and I anticipate the day to welcome Tory as a new family member and will make sure he adjusts well to the new environment,” Moon said via his camp last week. Moon Jae-in talks with pet owners and supporters of animal rights groups at an animal park in Seoul on April 15. His election pledges on animal welfare included the construction of more playgrounds for pets and feeding facilities for stray cats. On the dog meat trade, however, he stopped short of pledging an immediate and complete ban, saying it should be phased out. Moon’s predecessor Park Geun-hye had kept Korean indigenous Jindo dogs at the presidential residence. She had been criticized for abandoning them when she moved out hurriedly from Cheong Wa Dae following the historical impeachment ruling that removed her from office. After facing criticism, Cheong Wa Dae said it had found new owners for Park’s nine pet dogs.By Kim Da-sol","jindo dogs at the presidential ,wednesday after winning the election ,korea new first family animal ,breed mutt rescued from dog ,adopt tory year old dog","['South Korea ’s', 'Hankyoreh', 'Moon Jae -', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'korean', 'jindo', 'Park', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8276332   0.60132998

Yet, the months of turmoil have also left the country deeply divided along political and generational lines, as evidenced in the 60-day, condensed campaigning for the snap presidential election. The turmoil that brought South Korea to where it is now was set off by the scandal surrounding former President Park Geun-hye which broke in October last year. It began with allegations that former presidential secretary Ahn Chong-beom was involved in raising funds for a cultural foundation. The allegation, relatively minor in Korea’s long history of presidents and their associates’ corruption, was a prelude to a scandal that would lead to the ouster of Park.  Protesters hold a candlelight rally calling for President Park Geun-hye's resignation at Ghwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, on 26 Nov, 2016. The allegation was soon followed by the revelation that Choi Soon-sil, a longtime associate of Park, was behind the foundation. Accusations quickly piled up against Choi, whom Park described as being similar to a maid to her, and subsequent investigations uncovered evidence that Park was involved in the alleged wrongdoings. Park denied all the allegations, but she was ultimately impeached and then arrested over a host of charges including corruption.Conservative chaosFor the country’s rightwing, Park’s downfall has spelled chaos and revealed a lack of strong leadership, and led to the Saenuri Party splitting into the Liberty Korea Party and the more moderate conservative Bareun Party. Since the early 2000s, the conservatives were dominated by two main factions, whose leaders -- Park and Lee Myung-bak -- both went on to serve as presidents. With Park removed, the conservatives scattered, flocking from one possible champion to another.First, the conservatives hung their hopes on former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, with many referring to him as a man who served as the “world’s president.” When Ban called off his bid less than a month after setting up shop, the right looked toward acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn. Hwang, however, had other ideas and chose to stay out of the election all together. Ban and Hwang’s decisions threw the conservatives into turmoil until the Liberty Korea Party, the larger of the two Saenuri splinters, picked Hong Joon-pyo as its candidate.  Conservative Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party  and Yoo Seong-min of the Bareun Party While Liberty Korea Party chose to back outspoken Hong, Bareun Party’s choice was soft-spoken Rep. Yoo Seong-min. The events of past 10 months, however, have not all been bad for the conservatives. The birth of the Bareun Party marks the beginning of reform in the conservative bloc, which Yoo describes “the new hope of conservatives.” The reform envisioned by Yoo appears to have gained more momentum after more than a third of its lawmakers chose to leave the party. According to the party, daily donations increased 13 fold immediately after the development. For the established conservatives, the rapid growth of Hong’s popularity reaffirmed the presence of a solid supporter base. Although Hong began his campaign far behind his rivals, his approval ratings increased rapidly with some polls placing him on par with People’s Party’s Ahn Cheol-soo.Personality cultRecent developments have also highlighted the imbalance between ideologies and policies, and the weight carried by individuals in Korean politics. Park’s presidency has been characterized by the words “betrayal” and “traitor,” and shown some political heavyweights as placing more importance on factions and leaders than policy direction. The words were used not to describe those who acted against national interests, but to refer conservative politicians who openly disagreed with Park. Former President Park Geun-hye Park is known to place particular importance on loyalty, and such tendencies were critical in her personnel management. One of the most prominent examples is former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon. Kim’s connection to Park goes back to 1974 when he obtained a confession from Mun Se-gwang for the assassination of Park’s mother Yuk Young-soo. From then on Kim remained within Park’s sphere of influence, and his loyalty to her appears to have gone beyond the boundaries of a democratic republic’s politics. According to Rep. Lee Hye-hoon of the Bareun Party, Kim was in the habit of referring to Park as his “lord” in the sense of the ruler of a monarchy. Kim is also said to have referred to Park’s instructions as “commands.”While her emphasis on loyalty may have served her personal needs, it was also instrumental in splitting the country’s normally united conservatives. At the opposite end of Kim is Bareun Party’s Yoo, one of the most infamous “traitors.” His 2015 statement “welfare without tax increase is fiction” regarding Park’s welfare funding ideas gave rise to the term “politics of betrayal.” The tag has followed Yoo ever since, and is thought to have been a major factor in his low ratings, which hovered around 5 percent throughout the campaign period.Golden opportunity for liberals?The fall from power of Park and the ensuing fragmentation of the conservative force should bode well for the liberals striving to retake power after 10 years. With the electorate clearly leaning more left than right, Moon, who carried the flag of the former Democratic United Party and was defeated by Park in the 2012 presidential election, started the 60-day race as the flag-bearer for the Democratic Party of Korea with a convincing lead over his rivals. Midway into the race, however, he faced challenges, first from centrist Ahn and then from conservative Hong. Hong’s rise in popularity, in particular, signaled the resurgence of conservatives from the Park Geun-hye fiasco and a nation more divided than any time before.

Taking a cue from the special occasions, major presidential candidates have set out child-, senior- and family-friendly pledges. Front-runner Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea has vowed to make children happier, emphasizing the importance of play in a country where private education starts years before entering the school system.  Moon Jae-in “ children’s welfare is the first step towards building the welfare of the nation,” the liberal candidate wrote via Facebook. “Children should be able to play freely and safely and grow up happily under the next administration.” Notable among his child-friendly pledges is the once-a-month “no-class days” at elementary and middle schools. On this day, schools are envisioned to hold cultural, arts and outdoor activity programs instead of regular classes. Separately, underprivileged students are to be provided with vouchers for theaters and arts activities. Last month, Moon, who has two adult children, pledged to expand the number of state-run day care centers and kindergartens to account for 40 percent of total children enrolled in such facilities. As for senior-friendly policies, Moon promised to make Parents’ Day a national holiday so that children have time to visit their parents. Moon’s pledges for the elderly include a hike in monthly basic pension payments of 250,000 won , from the current 206,050 won, for those aged 65 or older and in the bottom 70 percent income group by 2020, and 300,000 won from 2021. He also promised to cover 90 percent of medical costs of dementia treatment with the state-run health insurance and reduce the financial burden of dental implants by half.  Ahn Cheol-soo Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party, meanwhile, has promised more state support during the period of pregnancy, delivery and early child care. While, like Moon, promising to expand the public daycare centers, the centrist candidate also envisions monthly cash support of 100,000 won per child for families belonging to the bottom 80 percent income bracket until the child reaches age 11. Earlier in the race, the candidate had put forward a radical education reform plan that envisioned the nation’s mandatory education starting at age 6, one year earlier than currently. Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party has promised a twofold increase in monthly cash benefits for those on parental leave. Currently, parents on child care leave receive 40 percent of their salary with an upper limit set at 1 million won. Hong’s idea is to raise the limits to 80 percent and 2 million won. The candidate also promises a one-time childbirth bonus of 10 million won for families for the second child and doubling the current monthly child care allowances for families with three children.

The new unit will be called the 524th Military Intelligence Battalion, they said.In the brigade, the 532nd Military Intelligence Battalion is in charge of human intelligence affairs, but its main duty is analyzing intelligence, not directly gathering it.But the newly formed unit will be in charge of getting intelligence on North Korea through human sources and contact with other intelligence agencies while taking over the duty of analyzing human intelligence from the 532nd battalion. Sources say the US troops will soon secure high-tech equipment for this endeavor.Seoul officials predict the US troops will likely rely on high-level North Korea defectors, foreign figures with experience on North Korea and have visited the country, and US intelligence agencies to gather intelligence on the world's most isolated country.""I see high chances that the US troops will make use of the country's human intelligence gathering channels like the Central Intelligence Agency,"" a South Korean spy agency official said on condition of anonymity.","getting intelligence on north korea ,korea local authorities said sunday ,us troops in south korea ,high level north korea defectors ,south korean spy agency official","['US', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'HUMINT', 'the Eighth US Army', '501st Military Intelligence Brigade', 'US', 'Forces Korea', 'the 501st Military Intelligence Brigade', 'the Eighth US Army', 'the 524th Military Intelligence Battalion', 'the 532nd Military Intelligence Battalion', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'US', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'US', 'US', 'the Central Intelligence Agency', 'south korean']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40175852  0.86857152

The Trump administration is clearly eager to change North Korea's trajectory?in any way possible. And Beijing's role in helping do so seems to be a litmus test that will influence the future of the US-China relationship,"" Snyder said.""Yet Chinese and American analysts alike point out the likely limits of China's willingness to pressure North Korea to the extent the Trump administration desires,"" he said.Though Chinese analysts recognize the dangers posed by the North, they have long seen Chinese influence as limited and believe that US hostility toward North Korea is the root cause of peninsular tensions, Snyder said. But American analysts and political leaders are increasingly frustrated that China has not cut the umbilical cord of food and energy supplies that the North depends on for its economic survival despite its political isolation, he said.""The Trump administration ultimately expects Beijing to put enough pressure on Pyongyang to make Kim realize that the nuclear program endangers rather than assures the survival of his regime,"" Snyder said. ""However, this course of action imposes on China higher risks than the country has been willing to take so far. It prefers the status quo to the dangers of political instability and refugee flows across China's border,"" he said.Synder said China has long struggled with a menu of unsatisfactory policy options on North Korea.Placing the level of pressure needed to force Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear weapons program risks the North Korean regime collapsing, leading to refugee flows and potentially a unified Korea allied with the United States, he said. But refusing to crack down on North leads to a North Korea racing toward its nuclear finish-line, US military build-up in Northeast Asia, and even a direct military conflict with the United States, the expert said.""The price that Beijing pays for its longstanding support for a North Korean regime that exports instability as its only sure means of regime survival is a bill that has finally come due.

If you don’t vote, shy-shy-shy.” The familiar tune from K-pop girl group Twice blares from a loudspeaker atop a remodeled truck in a Seoul street, apparently being used for the campaign of presidential candidate Moon. The verse has been rewritten to encourage voters to support the liberal aspirant. A bigger truck, with a makeshift stage, is parked in the middle of a wide street in Uijeongbu, north of Seoul, with a large crowd gathered in front. On the stage, Moon, the candidate for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, gives a speech in a thundering voice. Citizens watch Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea giving a speech on a makeshift stage truck in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, Monday.  The two scenes represent a typical Korean election campaign, not confined to just the particular candidate or this presidential race. And again, many seem to be asking the same question: “What is the point of outdoor canvassing? Is someone actually persuaded by this?”For foreign residents and visitors, in particular, the typical scenes of Korean electioneering appear quite different to those of their home countries, they said.  “I have never seen anything like this before,” Peter Dudek, an English teacher told The Korea Herald on Monday, while taking a video of Moon addressing the citizens of Uijeongbu, north of Seoul, from a campaign truck. His truck speech drew a large crowd of about 15,000 citizens and supporters, creating a scene of a street literally filled with people. “You can never imagine this with a presidential candidate so close on a random street with random crowds in the United States,” Dudek said. Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea bows to his supporters at a canvassing in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. The American, who has lived in Korea for about a year, explained that election campaigns are much more chaotic in the US, with security being of the utmost concern for camps in outdoor canvassing. “The presidential hopefuls usually hold a rally in concert venues and stadiums, with heightened security.”After Moon’s speech, cheerleaders came onto the stage, dancing to familiar and addictive tunes of popular songs to appease the crowd. The April 26 canvassing of Yoo Seong-min, candidate for the conservative splinter Bareun Party, in Seoul’s Hongdae also started off with dances and performances on a remodeled truck, intended to grab the attention of passersby. Yoo Seong-min of splinter conservative Bareun Party campaigns in front of Hongik University subway station in Seoul on Thursday. “The dances are ridiculous,” quipped Paul Venhaus, a tourist from Germany, before asking how the dances and performances were related to the candidates and their elections. “I thought trucks were some kind of an advertisement for a TV program.”“In Germany, election campaigns are usually very dry,” the 24-year-old added, taking a video of Yoo speaking from the truck stage. Nineteen-year-old university student Samantha Cavagnaro said she was surprised to see a presidential candidate waiting to shake hands with passersby near her school entrance. “These people  are so close to the people, it is different from where I come from, New York,” she said. But as for the electioneering trucks with promotional advertisements on them or playing songs with changed lyrics repetitively, she was skeptical if they were effective. Trucks are the favorite choice of campaign vehicles for their great mobility and accessibility to even narrow residential streets, camp officials explained. With just a few days left to the election, the presidential aspirants are on a hectic schedule of electioneering, sometimes visiting more than half of the country’s nine provinces, including the southern Jeju Island, inside 24 hours. A 1-ton truck with light-emitting diode screens costs an average of 30 million won , but expensive ones can cost as much as 100 million won, people familiar with the industry said. Moon reportedly has rented some 300 trucks, while candidate Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party has some 270. For minor candidates, the trucks can pose a financial burden. Yoo, polling last among the five mainstream party-backed candidates, launched a bicycle team to run a cost-effective campaign on their planned budget of 9 billion won.Some Koreans complain that canvassing with trucks, loud music and crowds gathering on busy streets is a nuisance. An average of 200 noise complaints have been made daily to police since the official campaign period begin on April 17. Hong Joon-pyo of conservative Liberty Korea Party appeals for support in Daegu on Wednesday. “It is good that the politicians are trying to reach out to people and communicate, but how they are blocking the road and making such noises is really disturbing,” Lee Hye-jin, 31, said as she walked past an election campaign blocking a crowded subway station exit. “This way of delivering their messages would only arouse antipathy among those who do not support the candidate.” While the current way of outdoor stumping has proved effective in the past, the candidates should come up with new ways to reach out to the voters, in tandem with changing times, according to some pundits. “The truck campaigning is an old style. But I see new approaches this year, with more online content and fresh events being churned out by campaigns,” Sung Youl-hong, an advertising and public relations professor at Hongik University, said.

About 101 Seoul residents gathered at Dongdaemun Design Plaza on Saturday to embark on a mission to find and promote the hidden artistic gems of Seoul.In its second year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens,” will run from April through June.Participants of “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” pose for a photo in Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul, Saturday. The program is part of the municipal government’s efforts to promote lesser-known public art and landmarks in the capital. “This program will be able to enhance the city’s artistic appeal through a greater variety of culture, architecture and street art,” said Byun Seo-yeon, Seoul City’s design policy division head.Participants, ranging from high school students to those in their 70s and with various occupations, presented their plans for promoting the city’s public art. Kim Min-yeob, 32, a freelancer in the art industry, said his group would go out to the streets to discover less charming public art.“There are a number of art pieces considered to be eyesores. Some are randomly installed in the middle of the street without clear context or description. Our group will try to find such pieces and suggest improvements,” said Kim.Another group said it would try to find lesser-known art districts in the capital.“A compound near Hongik University has long been considered an art cluster. But due to gentrification, many of the artists have moved out to settle in adjacent areas like Yeonnam-dong,” said Jeon Ha-rim, a 29-year-old office worker.“Like that, our team would like to discover newly rising artistic areas in the neighborhood so ordinary citizens do not have to travel to enjoy art,” Jeon added.Eleven groups comprising the selected 101 participants are to be joined by field experts and art connoisseurs. Their discoveries are to be shared via the city’s official social media channels.Ahn Kyu-chul, a sculpture and installation artist who also heads consultation for the city’s public art programs, speaks during the starting ceremony of “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” held at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul, Saturday. Once the field work is complete, the participants will vote for the most beautiful public art installations and be asked to make suggestions on ways to promote Seoul’s art scene.“Since citizens are the most important enjoying participants of public art, they should come up with suggestions and improvement points,” said Ahn Kyu-chul, a sculpture and installation artist who also heads consultation for the city’s public art programs. “These types of citizen-driven art projects will draw more public attention to public art, making sure that it is citizens who can improve Seoul’s art scene,” said Ahn.Ahn Kyu-chul, a sculpture and installation artist who also heads consultation for the city’s public art programs, speaks during the kickoff of “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” held at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul, Saturday.

The North had been widely speculated to conduct a nuclear test in April, during which two of the country's key national events fall -- the birthday of North Korean founder Kim Il-sung and the anniversary of the formation of its military.As the speculation sparked security jitters, the US has sent a strike group led by aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and nuclear-powered submarine USS Michigan to waters off the Korean Peninsula.The Trump administration also unveiled its North Korea policy line last month, which vowed to step up sanctions and engagement to get the North to give up its nuclear program.

Iridescent clouds are formed by tiny ice crystals or water droplets in the air that cause light to be diffracted ? spread out ? creating a rainbow-like effect. The term comes from Iris, the Greek personification of a rainbow.Iridescence is usually seen in high and mid-level clouds including thin cirrostratus, cirrocumulus and altocumulus clouds.On the island, the fairly uncommon phenomenon was observed for 25 minutes on June 16, 2001, marking its first advent since Jan. 24, 1959, when it was previously spotted.The island had four cases of the phenomenon in 2011, three in 2012, and four in 2013 before it was sighted for 10 minutes on Nov. 19, 2014, and for one hour on April 12 this year.","spotted thursday in the sky ,on south korea largest resort ,2017 shows iridescent clouds hanging ,of light was spotted thursday ,light was spotted thursday in","['JEJU', ""South Korea 's"", 'Jeju', 'the Jeju Meteorological Administration', ""South Korea 's"", 'Jeju', 'Iris', 'greek']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28146449  0.54036802

So I must assume that Kim Jong-un's nuclear claims are true. I know his aspirations certainly are. And that should provide all of us a sense of urgency to ensure PACOM and US Forces Korea are prepared to fight tonight with the best technology on the planet,"" he said. ""That's why Gen. Brooks and I are doing everything possible to defend American homeland and our allies in the Republic of Korea and Japan.""Gen. Vincent Books is commander of US Forces Korea.Harris said that all options are on the table in dealing with the North. Still, he said, the US goal is to bring the North's leader to ""his senses, not to his knees."" Pressed for preemptive strike options, the commander said the US has ""a lot of pre-emptive options"" against the North, but declined to elaborate in an open hearing.Harris also called for putting missile interceptors in Hawaii in addition to those in Alaska and California.""The interceptors that we have the defend our homeland directly in Alaska and California are critical. I have suggested that we consider putting interceptors in Hawaii that defend Hawaii directly and that we look at the defensive Hawaii radar to improve Hawaii's capability,"" he said.Asked what the North could do militarily against US assets in the region or allies, Harris said anything could be possible, including previous types of provocations, such as the 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and the artillery attack on the island of Yeonpyeong.Harris apologized for the confusion over the whereabouts of the Navy strike group led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson that had been reported to be heading to waters off the Korean Peninsula to deter the North when it was actually moving in the opposite direction.""That's my fault on the confusion and I'll take the hit for it. I made the decision to pull the Carl Vinson out of Singapore, truncate the exercise that it was going to do south of Singapore, cancel the support visit to Australia and then proceed north,"" he said.""Where I failed was to communicate that adequately to the press and the media. That is all on me but we've done exactly that. We pulled out of Singapore, truncated the exercise, cancelled the port visit and then moved it north.

The group handed over one of its properties to the Korean military so it can be used as the site for THAAD.Beijing has strenuously opposed the deployment, arguing THAAD's powerful radar could be used to spy on its military and thus would undermine its strategic security interests. Seoul and Washington contend that THAAD only targets a provocative Pyongyang."" visited  to offer encouragement  as we have felt sorry that the group is suffering large damage due to its decision to cooperate with the government's security policy,"" an aide to Hwang told Yonhap News Agency, declining to be named.Hwang toured the building's observation deck and its disaster prevention center.The acting president asked Lotte officials to ensure the safety of visitors and voiced his hopes that the building will emerge as a world-renowned tourist attraction.The country's tallest skyscraper opened to the public on April 3. The 555-meter high building consists of offices, a lavish residence and luxury hotel, and is topped with a glass observation deck.","skyscraper in seoul wednesday ,landmark skyscraper in seoul wednesday ,skyscraper in seoul wednesday as ,seoul wednesday as us forces ,group landmark skyscraper in seoul","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', ""Lotte Group 's"", 'Seoul', 'US', 'US', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Lotte', 'China', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Hwang', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Hwang', 'Lotte']",5,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.60138559  0.29464754

Would you continue to oppose it even if Pyongyang proceeds with a sixth nuclear test or fire an intercontinental ballistic missile?A: A pre-emptive attack should not be allowed even if the North carries out a sixth nuclear test or launches an ICBM, but sanctions should be enforced. A pre-emptive measure against the North would likely lead to war on the Korean Peninsula, which only means mutual destruction of the two Koreas. War should be prevented in any circumstances.Q: Many fear that the US may choose to intervene militarily in North Korea, just like it did in Syria, without prior consultation with South Korea. They claim the next president should have something to offer the US in order to dissuade it from the extreme action. A: The US and South Korea negotiating over a possible pre-emptive strike on North Korea is irrational. The most important task is putting an end to North Korea’s nuclear threat.If the US tries to ask something in return from South Korea for abandoning the pre-emptive strike, it will not only worsen public sentiment in South Korea, but will spark global criticism, so I believe the Trump administration would not make such a request. The sanctions imposed by the United States is different from their actions against Syria. Syria lacks military capability to fight back against a pre-emptive attack, but the North does not. In addition, Russia does not agree to the United States’ call to pressure Syria. China, on the other hand, is also taking part in pressuring North Korea, and I believe the nuclear weapons issue with North Korea shall unfold differently from that of Syria.Q: You have changed your stance on the THAAD missile defense system to support its deployment, saying that it is an agreement between two countries. By this logic, should the agreement made with Japan on the comfort women also be respected?A: The deal made last December between Korea and Japan on Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women is different from THAAD. The victims are still alive. Their opinions should be taken into account in solving the issue with Japan. The December deal should be reconsidered and the Japanese government should admit their liability and offer a sincere apology, along with taking legal responsibility.Q: You stressed the roles of the private sector and government subsidies in preparing for the fourth industrial revolution. Please elaborate.A: In the past, the government’s R&D; support was results-oriented, and focused on projects with a high probability of success. New and creative research is impossible under such a system. The standardized government-led method is unfit for the fourth industrial revolution as we live at a time of increasing societal subdivision, and commercialization of diverse convergent technologies is unpredictable.Q: How would you encourage companies to participate in your plans voluntarily at a time when companies are avoiding investments due to economic uncertainties?A: South Korea faces five major challenges -- exports, domestic consumption, unemployment, declining population, and weak diplomacy. The Park Geun-hye administration failed to provide solutions or a vision for the future, instead, they abused corporations as tools for corruption. It’s understandable that corporations are reluctant under these circumstances. We need leadership that will create jobs and help corporations and the private sector to achieve their potential. The political arena must lay the foundations for companies to freely conduct economic activities and to create jobs. In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, the government needs to take on the role of supporting corporate and private sectors’ decision and create an environment for fair competition. Then, corporate investment will follow naturally.Q: How would you lead social change, especially in instruments of power such as the prosecutors’ office?A: One of the most important reform tasks for the next administration is ending the alliance of government and businesses. We need overhauls in the prosecution and top conglomerates or chaebol. I see the people’s trust in the prosecution has hit bottom and efforts made inside the group cannot lead to a reform. That is why founding a new government body to watch for corruption in public offices is inevitable.A major point of prosecution reform is to free the public prosecutor general and the prosecution from other powers. If I am elected, the appointment of public prosecutor general would need consent from the National Assembly. In addition, I will tighten the control on the prosecution’s right “to not prosecute,” expand the eligible target to apply for a ruling, and introduce jury system to certain casesQ: What is the “national unity” you speak of and how does it differ from the Democratic Party candidate Moon Jae-in’s ideas?A. True integration can only be achieved when different opinions are respected, and democratic decisions are accepted. Integration is not an empty slogan. However, Moon labeled the citizens who oppose him as “forces of evil.” That’s hegemonic politics which creates division. Politics should not stand in the way of the people when heading into the future. The people will decide who will bring change and reform to create a better future. I will work only for the people and bring unprecedented change to South Korea’s political landscapeQ: Your education reform plan, as drastic as it appears, has earned both positive and negative responses.A: My education policies aim to reduce the financial burden, while implementing a new education system to foster creativity through education reform. There will not be a widening of the education gap. First of all, I will change the Korea Scholastic Ability Test to a qualification test, and change the system’s focus on examinations to create a structure in which education is about self-development.Through my proposal of the “5-5-2 system,” students will go through the process of seeking career paths from high school, and software education will be strengthened in elementary, middle and high school to nurture individuals fit for the fourth industrial revolution. The government will provide free education to all from kindergarten to high school and the role of universities would expand to cover education from young children to elders.","koreas war should be prevented ,launches an icbm but sanctions ,to war on the korean ,cheol soo the presidential candidate ,preventive strike on north korea","['the Korea Herald ’s', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'icbm', 'Koreas', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Syria', 'South Korea', 'US', 'US', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Trump', 'the United States', 'Syria', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'the United States', 'Syria', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Syria', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'Democratic Party', 'Moon Jae - in ’s', 'Moon', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Scholastic Ability Test']",13,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.88582754  0.20585132

Opening part of the “Seoullo 7017” on Tuesday, ahead of the official opening in May, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon on Tuesday described the urban sky park as a place where “nature and humans can live side by side.”Pictured is the Seoul Road 7017 in front of Seoul Station, an overpass that is receiving the final touches for its opening set for May 20, 2017. “ will not only restore the overpass, but become a catalyst for the revival and regeneration of neighboring regions through the high number of visitors,” Seoul Mayor Park said.The pedestrian-friendly park will stretch for about a kilometer and link seven surrounding areas including Seoul Station and Namdaemun Market to 12 pedestrian walkways.Touted as a rival to New York’s High Line Park, the city government said it will feature over 24,085 plants representing 228 species of trees, shrubs and flowers found in and outside Korea.Complementing the plants will be cafes, street markets, flower shops and performance stages, the city said.Officials said the park will provide not only a stretch of greenery, but also a botanical education, allowing citizens to have a closer look at the labeled plants arranged in alphabetical order. The project began four years ago to make use of an old overpass that once served as a major road connecting western and central Seoul. Public calls for its removal had mounted after a safety assessment classified the outdated overpass as dangerous in 2006.The “70” in the name Seoullo 7017 refers to the year 1970 when the Seoul Station flyover was constructed, while 17 is a reference to the number of walkways connected to it and the year 2017 when its construction is to be completed.Pictured is the Seoul Road 7017 in front of Seoul Station, an overpass that is receiving the final touches for its opening set for May 20, 2017. Putting safety as a top priority, about 40 percent of the 59 billion won  of construction cost was put into securing the earthquake-proof structure, the city said. “The elevated urban park was constructed to stand up to a magnitude 6.5 earthquake, and to allow over 50,000 people to walk on the park at once,” said Seoul City official Kim Kwon-ki.A total of 29 surveillance cameras will be installed around the park to enhance security for citizens, he added.The official opening of the Seoullo 7017 is slated for May 20. The lighting ceremony and the celebration chorus will begin at 7 p.m.A variety of events involving citizen participation will take place at Seoullo 7017 and continue until June 18, the city said.

The following is the third installment on Seoul, the nation’s capital. -- Ed.Nearly half of the nation’s 50 million population resides in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province and the number of votes up for grabs here is proportionally great -- roughly 17 million. Like other metropolitan cities of the world, the “greater Seoul area” also boasts diverse communities. Many residents here came from all over the country -- some even from outside the country. For this reason, the regions have often held the deciding vote in elections, with much of the rest of South Korea divided between the liberal west and conservative east. With two weeks left to the May 9 presidential election, it wasn’t easy to see which way this region will vote. Voters that The Korea Herald spoke to were almost evenly divided between Moon Jae-in and Ahn Cheol-soo, the two front-runners from the liberal and centrist camps. The two front-runners from the centrist and liberal camps, Ahn Cheol-soo and Moon Jae-in Recent regional polls show that Moon of the Democratic Party of Korea has the lead over Ahn of the People’s Party, while Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party is at a distant third place, in line with nationwide results. In the latest Gallup Korea survey, Moon garnered 38 percent of support against Ahn’s 34 percent and Hong’s 9 percent. His nationwide rating was 41 percent, while that of Ahn and Hong were 30 percent and 9 percent, respectively. “I think Moon is the most eligible person to get rid of society’s past wrongdoings and return this country to normal,” said Kim In-pyo who introduced himself as a 26-year-old company worker. Seoul was the hotbed of monthslong anti-government rallies sparked by the sweeping corruption scandal involving former conservative President Park Geun-hye. Kim and many other Moon supporters had joined the massive candlelight protests against Park and now seem to see Moon as the only candidate who can push for a new social paradigm. “Park Geun-hye should strictly be punished and the wrongdoings of the past should be cleared out with a new regime,” Um Joo-yeon, 28, a Yoga teacher living in Seongdong-gu in east Seoul said. “Moon knows it and has the anger needed to lead such action, but Ahn lacks that factor.” More moderate voters, however, showed interest in Ahn, a centrist seeking to appeal to a wider spectrum of voters, even the conservatives. A taxi driver, Park Yoon-sang, 60, said he seeks for a leader who relies less on ideology and more on administering state affairs. “Ahn seems to be an upright and clean figure. I think people want a leader who does not carry a strong political tint,” Park said. “We do not want those with vested rights to take back power. We need a new political paradigm. A fresh new figure should be able to govern the country.”A 70-year-old retiree, who wanted to be identified only by his surname Oh, echoed the view, adding that he wants a “rational” president. Hong Kyung-hee, 57, who voted for Park in the last election, also backed Ahn as a new figure in politics. Her friend who refused to give her name agreed, but pointed out that Ahn also has a weak image.“Though I prefer Ahn  than Moon, I am not so sure about his leadership. I am worried he may be controlled by others,” the Seodaemun-gu resident said. The anti-sentiment against conservative candidates was widely prevalent. Hong and other conservative candidates are far behind Moon and Ahn, polls show. “I support Hong for his conservative policies,” said 26-year-old Lee Won-yul who moved to Seoul from his hometown in Daegu, a conservative stronghold. “He holds strong opinions on national security and he has the highest understanding of market liberalism. He also has the power to restrain the strong labor unions.”Seoul and metropolitan areas have had slightly left-leaning turnouts in past elections -- particularly those held under conservative administrations -- as the busy urban communities have a tendency to seek change, Jun Kye-wan, a political commentator said. “In the past when the race was mainly between liberals and conservatives, it was easier to predict which way voters would vote in this region. Now, it is harder for anyone to say anything about the results since the race is between liberal Moon and centrist Ahn,” Jun explained.By Jo He-rim","million population resides in seoul ,the third installment on seoul ,greater seoul area also boasts ,monthslong anti government rallies sparked ,third installment on seoul","['the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Gallup Korea', 'Moon', 'Ahn ’s 34 percent', 'Hong ’s 9 percent', 'Ahn and Hong', 'Moon', 'Kim In - pyo', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'yoga', 'Seongdong - gu', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Park', 'Hong Kyung - hee', 'Park', 'Ahn', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Lee Won - yul', 'Seoul', 'Daegu', 'Jun Kye - wan', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Jun', 'Jo He - rim']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71114075  0.36401334

This photo, released by the Incheon municipal government on April 25, 2017, shows a 17th-century cannon, called ""bullanggi"" and used during the 1392-1910 Joseon Dynasty. The cannon, believed to date back to the dynasty in 1680, has been discovered in the Geonpyeong Fortification on Ganghwa Island, in which repair work was underway. The inscription on the cannon, which is 1.05 meters long and has a caliber of 0.04 meter, revealed that it was one of the 150 bullanggi deployed on the island in February 1680.Bullanggi, introduced to Joseon via China from Europe in the 16th century, quickly became a favorite of the Korean military and stayed that way for a long time. This kind of cannon was much easier to load and fire than the artillery Korea had used up to that point. The fortification was one of 54 that had been built to defend the island in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty since China's Qing Dynasty troops' invasion of Korea in 1636.","the incheon municipality said tuesday ,2017 shows 17th century cannon ,incheon municipal government on april ,incheon 17th century cannon ,incheon municipality said tuesday","['INCHEON', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Incheon', 'Joseon', 'China', 'korean', 'Korea', 'China', 'Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01892988  0.86605597

Yoo Seong-min, presidential nominee of the Bareun Party, announces his election pledges for Gangwon Province at the headquarters of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee in the county some 180 kilometers east of Seoul on April 24, 2017. ""I will turn Gangwon Province into a land of opportunity where culture and tourism thrive,"" he said in a press conference, referring to the province where PyeongChang is located.The lawmaker said he would establish a presidential committee to support the event if elected on May 9 and build the host cities into a winter sports mecca so that the facilities can be used after the Olympics next February. He said the government would provide financial aid to that end.The candidate promised to turn Gangwon into a gateway to Eurasia by constructing additional rail and road links there. He also vowed to promote the marine tourism industry in three specific regions to serve as sustainable growth engines for the province.Meanwhile, Yoo continued to face pressure from some members of his party to drop out of the presidential race or merge his candidacy with another contender. Yoo's approval rating has ranked fifth among the five major contenders at around 3 percent.The party said it has convened a general meeting of lawmakers later in the day to hold ""frank"" talks with Yoo on the future of his campaign. Yoo has so far refused to step down, saying he was nominated by a democratic process.Bareun, which means ""righteous"" in Korean, currently holds 33 seats in the 300-member National Assembly.","winter olympics and boost tourism ,his election pledges for gangwon ,pyeongchang winter olympics and boost ,conservative presidential candidate yoo seong ,after the olympics next february","['Yoo Seong - min', 'Bareun Party', 'the PyeongChang Organizing Committee', 'Seoul', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the Bareun Party', 'Gangwon Province', 'the PyeongChang Organizing Committee', 'Seoul', 'Gangwon Province', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon', 'Eurasia', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Bareun', 'Korean', 'National Assembly']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49948859  1.06787372

The following is the second installment on Daejeon and its surrounding Chungcheong region. -- Ed.DAEJEON -- Daejeon, the nation’s fifth-largest city by population, is often clustered with the neighboring Sejong Administrative City and the surrounding Chungcheong provinces as the “middle ground” in national e...","The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles that try to capture the voter sentiment in key regions. The following is the second installment on Daejeon and its surrounding Chungcheong region. -- Ed.DAEJEON -- Daejeon, the nation’s fifth-largest city by population, is often clustered with the neighboring Sejong Administrative City and the surrounding Chungcheong provinces as the “middle ground” in national elections.The term has a double meaning: the region is located inland, in between the Seoul-Gyeonggi metropolitan area and the southern parts of the country. It also tends to be relatively unbiased with no specific political tendency. As a result of such neutrality, the Daejeon-Chuncheong cluster has often been deemed an ace in the hole for relatively centrist political aspirants, due to its large number of swing voters and weak party affiliation.For the upcoming presidential election, slated for May 9, Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party and Rep. Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea seem to have their eyes on this region for extra momentum.A region largely underrepresentedThe North and South Chungcheong provinces, Daejeon and Sejong City altogether accounted for some 10.5 percent of the nation’s entire population as of the end of March this year, data from the Interior Ministry showed.In terms of representation and political leverage, however, the region has long seen itself as underestimated, receiving less attention than the progressive-leaning southwestern region and the conservative-leaning southeastern region, respectively dubbed Honam and Yeongnam.The fact that none of the past presidents have had ties to the region was seen as the source of some complaints. Speculations that former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- born in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province -- might run for presidency had once heightened the expectations of voters in the region due to the chance at having “one of their own” in power. After Ban announced he would not be running in February, it was South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung of the Democratic Party of Korea who took the spotlight, but he, too, dropped out of the presidential race by failing to defeat Moon Jae-in in the party’s primary.Sejong City, the key in local voter sentimentThe Daejeon-Sejong-Chungcheong belt nevertheless carries considerable weight in terms of government policy, embracing not only the Daedeok Science Complex but also a majority of the country’s administrative divisions.The special administrative city of Sejong has increasingly been mentioned as a new location for the National Assembly or even the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.The newly built city was initiated by former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun as a comprehensive administrative capital in an effort to achieve balanced regional growth.But amid persisting disputes and legal controversies, the blueprint was revised so as to relocate most of the administrative functions only.The presidential candidate who presented the most radical development plan for Sejong City was Rep. An, who had pledged to redefine the city as the nation’s administrative capital and to relocate the legislature and presidential office.Moon, who beat An to become the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, in contrast, said that he would move the Blue House to Gwanghwamun in central Seoul to promote communication with the public.An’s drastic relocation pledge gained a warmer response from the administrative city, including its Mayor Lee Choon-hee who issued an official statement to appreciate An’s ideas.Moon-Ahn rivalry to win over middle ground Nationwide, public opinions show that the race is likely to come down to a showdown between Moon and Ahn, with Moon cementing his lead beyond the margin of error. Ahn Cheol-soo of the centrist People’s Party But in this region, the two appear to be neck and neck, with some poll results even showing Ahn in the lead. A Realmeter survey, released Thursday, puts Ahn slightly ahead of Moon, with 37.7 percent of support against his 36.7 percent of support in the region. Nationwide, Moon is outpacing Ahn, with 43.8 percent of support compared to his 32.3 percent. Another pollster Research & Research showed similar results, putting Ahn ahead at 35.8 percent against Moon’s 33.3 percent, while the nationwide trend is the opposite -- Moon at 40 percent and Ahn at 30.1 percent. Gallup Korea offered a different picture with Moon’s support of 46 percent far surpassing Ahn’s 29 percent, and their nationwide standings at 41 percent and 30.1 percent, respectively. Ahn has been appealing to the region’s voters who were let down by Ban and Gov. An. “Daejeon is the birthplace of  political revolution, where I first started the Youth Concert and where the People’s Party celebrated its kickoff,” he said in Daejeon earlier this month after confirming his victory in his party’s primary. “For me, Daejeon-Chungcheong is a land of promise, of victory, of future.”He also underlined his affiliation with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, highlighting his past career as a medical doctor, IT expert and scholar.Ahn’s tentative gestures to recruit former UN top official Ban to his camp were taken as an effort to further appeal to the Chungcheong region voters.Housewife Kim Yoo-jeong, who was born and lived in Seoul before settling down in Sejong with her family four years ago, said there appears to be a big generational divide in voter sentiment. “There are a lot of Moon supporters among the younger generation here, but among senior voters, there is the widespread notion that Moon is unfit to lead","in local voter sentimentthe daejeon ,local voter sentimentthe daejeon sejong ,voter sentimentthe daejeon sejong chungcheong ,32 percent another pollster research ,local voter sentimentthe daejeon","['the Korea Herald', 'Daejeon', 'Sejong Administrative City', 'Seoul', 'Daejeon - Chuncheong', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'North and South Chungcheong', 'the Interior Ministry', 'Honam', 'Yeongnam', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Eumseong', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Ban', 'an Hee - jung', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'Sejong City', 'Sejong', 'the National Assembly', 'Cheong', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Sejong City', 'An', 'Moon', 'the Democratic Party', 'the Blue House', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'Lee Choon', 'Nationwide', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Ahn', 'Research & Research', 'Ahn', 'Moon ’s 33.3 percent', 'Moon', 'ahn', 'Gallup Korea', 'Moon ’s', 'Ahn ’s 29 percent', 'Ban', 'An', 'the Youth Concert', 'the People ’s Party', 'Daejeon', 'Daejeon - Chungcheong', 'the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology', 'ahn ’s', 'UN', 'Ban', 'Chungcheong', 'Housewife Kim Yoo - jeong', 'Seoul', 'Sejong', 'Moon', 'Moon']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67732316  0.54572225

Those who participated in the study sessions will be eligible to become the selected 150 participants to run the program.In groups of 10, participants will be joined by field experts and art connoisseurs. Their discoveries will be shared via the city’s official social media channels.Once the field work is complete, the participants will present on their discovery of Seoul’s less known public are and also announce their suggestions on ways to promote Seoul’s art scene.Groups with the most number of public art discoveries or the most innovative idea to improve the public art policies will be awarded.

The comments were released by US President Donald Trump in an April 12 interview with the Wall Street Journal. During their summit, Xi explained the history of China and Korea, about “thousands of years ... and many wars. And Korea actually used to be a part of China,” Trump said. It remains uncertain whether Xi actually made such remarks, whether Trump misinterpreted the statement or if there was a translation error. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck on Thursday flatly rejected Xi’s argument, citing “historical facts that no one can deny” and adding the agency is working to verify the authenticity of the remarks via diplomatic channels. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang did not confirm nor deny it, saying South Koreans do not “need to worry.”President Donald Trump talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping, with their wives, before dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, early this month. While drawing outrage among South Koreans, the revelation laid bare Beijing’s deep-rooted, imperialistic views on the history of the peninsula, as well as the Trump administration’s lack of historical understanding and diplomatic courtesy. China maintains the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo , located across what is now the northern peninsula and southern Manchuria, was its vassal state. Under the so-called Northeast Project, Beijing has claimed its past sovereignty via state media, official reports and cultural sites, prompting diplomatic spats. China’s growing assertiveness in the region has been a source of concern that has grown more serious recently due to its economic retaliation against South Korea for its decision to station the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here. As for Trump, the exposure was seen as another blunder and a diplomatic faux pas both for Seoul and Beijing. But perhaps a more disturbing element was his lack of understanding of Northeast Asia, where long-festering historical and territorial rows often strain diplomatic relations, analysts said. “Trump is basically a businessman, and therefore he appears to lack basic understanding of the regional dynamics,” said Park Byung-kwang, a professor at the Institute for National Security Strategy, who studies Northeast Asia relations. “I think Trump may have interpreted Xi’s remark as an ordinary individual would without proper understanding. And it could have been delivered a bit more inaccurately through translation and explanation. It’s regrettable.” Despite the furor, the event’s long-term diplomatic impact is likely to be limited, but may indicate a diplomatic challenge to be faced by Seoul’s next administration in dealing with the Trump administration, the experts said. “I believe it is mostly a one-off event between Trump and Xi over their attempt to solve North Korea’s nuclear issue. Trump is still in a learning curve to reduce gaps between him and Washington’s foreign policy elite,” said Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. Kim Heung-kyu, a political science professor at Ajou University, said, “If we take the remark at face value, it is quite offensive. But I guess Trump was seeking to warn Trump against discounting China’s influence and words in the face of his rising demands for a greater role in resolving the North Korea issues.""By Yeo Jun-suk","the controversy over chinese president ,trump talks with chinese president ,the unpredictable trump leadership ,controversy over chinese president ,vex south korea next president","['chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Korea', 'China', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'Trump', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'Xi', 'China', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'China', 'Trump', 'Xi', 'Trump', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Cho June - hyuck', 'chinese Foreign Ministry', 'Lu Kang', 'South Koreans', 'Donald Trump', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Florida', 'South Koreans', 'Beijing', 'Trump', 'China', 'korean', 'Goguryeo', 'Manchuria', 'Northeast Project', 'Beijing', 'China', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Trump', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'trump', 'Park Byung - kwang', 'the Institute for National Security Strategy', 'Trump', 'Xi ’s', 'Seoul', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Xi', 'North Korea ’s', 'Washington', 'Kim Han - kwon', 'the Korea National Diplomatic Academy', 'Kim Heung - kyu', 'Ajou University', 'trump', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44958586  0.82590008

Under the slogan ""Fly to Korea,"" the campaign will entail a massive promotion event, including discounts and gift vouchers, to attract individual travelers from Hong Kong, the Korea Tourism Organization said in a statement. The campaign will start March 20, running through the end of June. With about a dozen airlines taking part in the promotion, visitors from Hong Kong who plan to come to Korea between May and September of this year will be given a variety of discount benefits for things that travelers need to rent or buy during a trip, such as Wi-Fi eggs and train passes, it said. Other special treats will include some free accommodation vouchers and complimentary tour bus tickets. The move by the state tourism agency comes amid growing concerns over a rapid fall in Chinese tourists, who accounted for about half of last year's inbound foreigners, after diplomatic relations with China frayed over Seoul's deployment of a US anti-missile system, known as THAAD. South Korea has seen the tally on Chinese visitors drop by more than 30 percent since March 15, when travel agencies in the mainland stopped selling trips to Korea at the behest of the Beijing authorities.In efforts to stave off the sharp drop in Chinese travelers, the local government and related industries have stepped up to secure more individual tourists from Southeast Asia and other neighboring countries. The KTO said it plans to visit Hong Kong later this month to meet with local travel agencies and media there to host a promotion event for Jeju, the country's resort island located off the southern tip, as part of the campaign. Some 92,000 visitors from Hong Kong came to Korea in the first two months of this year, up 11.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the KTO.","selling trips to korea ,campaign will start march 20 ,stopped selling trips to korea ,selling trips to korea at ,state tourism agency said wednesday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hong Kong', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Hong Kong', 'the Korea Tourism Organization', 'Hong Kong', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'China', 'Seoul', 'US', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'KTO', 'Hong Kong', 'Jeju', 'Hong Kong', 'Korea', 'KTO']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28959748  0.68201846

North Korean people attend a send-off ceremony in the western port city of Nampho the previous day to mark the sailing of a trade cargo ship, the Jaryok,  According to the daily, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un instructed a 5,000-ton cargo ship to be built and named the ship in person, with the word ""Jaryok"" meaning self-reliance.North Korea held a launching ceremony for the ship in May last year when the North's ruling party held its first congress in 36 years.The North's maritime transport is one of its sectors hit hardest by the UN Security Council's strengthening of sanctions against the country following its fourth nuclear test last year.Under the measure, ships owned by Ocean Maritime Management Co., a Pyongyang-based shipping company, were blacklisted in the sanctions resolution imposed on the North for carrying out the nuclear test in January last year. It was part of a move designed to act as a logistical restriction that will prevent the free movement of banned ships cited for engaging in North Korea's nuclear and other weapons development programs. The registrations of many North Korean vessels made in the third country's nationality were called off. The North Korean shipping firm has been evading the sanctions regime by changing the names of most of its ships.The trade ship sailing is seen as the North's resolve to flout the economic sanctions in order to expand its international trade based on the spirit of self-reliance stressed by the North Korean leader.""I understand the North is trying to show the international community it has its own technologies to carry out shipbuilding and is able to engage in trade despite international sanctions,"" said Cho Bong-hyun, a senior analyst at IBK Economic Research Institute.","fourth nuclear test last year ,north state media on tuesday ,north korea held launching ceremony ,set sail during the ceremony ,country following its fourth nuclear","['North Korea', 'UN', 'Rodong Sinmun', ""North Korea 's"", ""Workers ' Party"", 'Jaryok', 'Nampho', 'north korean', 'Nampho', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', ""the UN Security Council 's"", 'Ocean Maritime Management Co.', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Cho Bong - hyun', 'IBK Economic Research Institute']",10,"[ 0.          5.          1.         ... -0.51086116  0.71963716

It is Pence’s second foreign trip as vice president. He traveled to Germany and Belgium in February to meet with NATO and European Union officials.Here are five things you should know about President Donald Trump’s No. 2 at the start of his visit.On message:If Trump is known for his unpredictability and blunt talk, Pence projects a polite Midwestern humility and is more measured in his speeches, rarely going off-script. Pence’s first foreign trip to Europe included steady assurances that the US would honor its commitment to NATO, even after Trump had said the military alliance was “obsolete.” The Republican has doggedly pursued an agreement in Congress to repeal and replace the so-called “Obamacare” health care law, but lawmakers have failed to cut a deal. The vice president was initially out of the loop when former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russia emerged at the start of the administration, though Flynn had denied those conversations. Pence said he was “disappointed” in Flynn and supported Trump’s decision to fire him.Indiana roots:Pence is a former Indiana governor and congressman. He was a prominent conservative member of Congress during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, frequently championing anti-abortion causes and reducing federal spending. He opposed Bush’s White House on education and prescription drug plans, arguing that the administration had veered from its conservative principles. He unsuccessfully challenged future House Speaker John Boehner in a leadership election, but joined the House Republicans’ leadership team two years later. Elected Indiana’s governor in 2012, Pence signed a controversial “religious freedom” bill in 2015 that critics said allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians by allowing them to cite religious beliefs as a reason for denying services. After facing backlash from corporations, Pence softened the law, which had been criticized as discriminatory.Asia ties: Mike Pence’s late father, Edward Pence, served in the US Army during the Korean War and was awarded the Bronze Star on April 15, 1953. The vice president displays in his office his father’s Bronze Star, accommodation letter and a photograph of his father receiving his pin. Indiana has a significant Japanese manufacturing hub andPence conducted two trade missions to Japan while serving as governor. Toyota, Subaru and Honda all have manufacturing plants in Indiana, and Japanese companies employ tens of thousands of workers in the state. Honda’s plant in Greensburg, Indiana, is near Pence’s hometown of Columbus, Indiana, near Indianapolis. Pence will be making his first visits to South Korea, Indonesia and Australia.Faith and family:Pence often describes himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.” Pence and his wife, Karen, a former elementary school teacher, have been married since 1985 and have three adult children. Their son, Michael, is serving as an officer in the US Marines. Their two daughters, Charlotte, a recent college graduate and filmmaker, and Audrey, a college senior, are traveling to Asia with their parents. Pence often speaks of his Christian faith and has participated in Bible study groups in Congress. One of the first activities on his itinerary in South Korea was to attend Easter services with US and South Korean troops and their families.Talk radio, art therapy:Before serving in Congress, Pence was a conservative radio and television talk show host in Indiana during the 1990s. His shows were not known for the combative style that marked conservative radio talk shows during the era. Pence liked to call himself “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.” Karen Pence is a longtime advocate of art therapy, the use of art in mental health treatment and forms of rehabilitation. She will be attending art therapy events throughout the trip.","obama frequently championing anti abortion ,10 day four nation tour ,korea on sunday amid tensions ,elected indiana governor in 2012 ,and barack obama frequently championing","['US', 'Mike Pence', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pence', 'Japan', 'Indonesia', 'Australia', 'Germany', 'Belgium', 'NATO', 'European Union', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump', 'Pence', 'midwestern', 'Pence ’s', 'US', 'NATO', 'Trump', 'Republican', 'Congress', 'Michael Flynn ’s', 'Russia', 'Flynn', 'Pence', 'Flynn', 'Trump ’s', 'Indiana', 'Pence', 'Indiana', 'Congress', 'George W.

Chinese investors are also big clients in Jeju's property market.South Korea's decision to host a US anti-missile defense system, however, had afflicted the China-led boom, with Beijing forbidding group tour packages to South Korea. The island's tourism business was further hurt by the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014 that killed more than 300 people. Most of the victims were high school students who were on a school trip to Jeju.More than 600,000 students had come to Jeju in 2011 on school trips.

Selected tigers at the Seoul Zoo will be relocated to a 48,000-square-meter forest designed to simulate a wild tiger habitat. The area, called “Tiger Forest,” is part of the ministry’s 220.1 billion won  project to build Asia’s largest arboretum in North Gyeongsang Province, set to officially open to the public this year.A Siberian tiger residing at Seoul Zoo in Gwacheon Province stares out from a cage. The government plans to pick two or three tigers, including at least one female, for the move, but the exact number, male-to-female ratio and their moving-out date has yet to be announced. A series of medical tests will be conducted on tigers within the zoo to select a healthy batch for the project. The procedure includes a blood test run by animal experts, along with in-depth screening. The supervisors of the process are being extra cautious with the medical test after controversy that followed the death of a male tiger relocated to the reserve from a zoo in Daejeon in April. According to a government report, the animal suffered from a chronic disease that developed into uremia due to the stress of the relocation process three months prior to its death. During the transfer the tigers will be provided a car designed to respect their highly sensitive nature. Temperature and humidity will be controlled inside the cage and the car will travel at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour. After arriving at the forest, the tigers will be given an adjustment period of two to three months and released by the time of the official arboretum’s opening, scheduled to be in either September or October. Safety fences will be installed around the forest for public viewing.

Now standing as the liberal presidential flag-bearer for the second time in his life, Moon vows to finish the reforms started by his dearest friend, ally and supporter, and the reason he entered politics: late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.

Since then, he has had a quick rise to be where he is now, which for others would have taken decades.  Moon Jae-in Moon was born in 1953 to a poor refugee family on Geoje Island in South Gyeongsang Province that had fled from North Korea during the Korean War.   Moon was a gallant young man who could not stay quiet whenever he saw injustice, he recalled in his book “The Republic of Korea Asks. Moon Jae-in Answers.”He entered Kyung Hee University in 1972 to major in law, and stood in front among student activists against dictator and President Park Chung-hee, the late father of now jailed former President Park Geun-hye. While in jail for leading street demonstrations, Moon passed the bar exam in 1980. He also served in the special forces of the Korean military. As his criminal record blocked him from being appointed a judge, Moon moved back to his hometown of Busan and met the person he says changed his fate -- Roh.  This file photo shows Moon Jae-in , then presidential chief of staff, talks with President Roh Moo-hyun at Cheong Wa Dae. The two worked together as human rights lawyers. In 1988, Moon was asked to bid for the general election by the then-President Kim Young-sam, along with Roh and fellow lawyer Kim Gwang-il, but Moon refused, saying he was not a politician. It was only Roh’s favor that Moon could not turn down, and he served as Roh’s presidential secretary and the chief of the presidential staff in the Roh administration from 2003 to 2008. He later revealed that he lost 10 teeth, which he filled with dental implants, due to stress in those years. Roh’s death in 2009 prompted Moon to take part in politics. The late president had taken his own life amid an investigation into corruption accusations involving his family members and associates.Moon jumped into politics in 2012 determined to carry on the legacy of Roh. In the same year, he declared his first presidential bid, eventually losing to former President Park by 3 percentage points -- 1.08 million votes. Now, 64, the two-time presidential candidate has one son and one daughter with wife Kim Jeong-suk and four pets -- two dogs and two cats.

The Korea Development Institute, a state-run think tank, approved the feasibility study for the 5.97 trillion won  project to build an airport after conducting a detailed study of the plan over the past nine months, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The plan calls for the construction of a new 3,200-meter-long runway, a terminal and other relevant facilities and infrastructure at the western part of the existing Gimhae International Airport that services the port city of Busan, South Korea's No. 2 city, and the broader Gyeongsang region. The project once completed could allow the expanded airport to handle 38 million passengers per year, compared to the present capacity of 17.33 million people. The ministry said the new airport is a fundamental solution to meet growing demand for air travel in the southeastern region of the country, which is home to many of South Korea's biggest manufacturing companies. It said initially, the airport will not be operated around the clock.South Korea is set to break ground on the new airport in 2021 and opening it in 2026.","the new airport in 2021 ,project to build new airport ,ministry said the new airport ,new 200 meter long runway ,the new airport is fundamental","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Korea Development Institute', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Busan', ""South Korea 's"", 'Gyeongsang', ""South Korea 's"", 'South Korea']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56733799  0.21224128

The possible test is also likely to be the last before Pyongyang sophisticates its nuclear capability, according to Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute. This photo unveiled by the communist country's Korean Central News Agency on Feb. 13, 2017, shows North Korea's launch of a new type of intermediate-range missile, also known as the Pukguksong-2. ""The possibility of North Korea pushing ahead with a nuclear test before the  anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army on April 25 cannot be ruled out,"" Cheong said in a forum in Seoul.""It is assumed that North Korea would finish sophisticating its nuclear capabilities through the last nuclear test ahead of the launch of a new administration in the South before seeking to mend the fence with the new administration using a nuclear test freeze as a negotiating card,"" he noted. South Korean officials believe North Korea is ready to conduct its sixth nuclear test at any time upon its leader's decision. Since 2006, North Korea has carried out a total of five nuclear tests. Experts said the country may be just a few tests away from achieving a complete nuclear weapon system.On May 9, South Korea will hold an early election to pick a president who will succeed Park Geun-hye after her ouster in March over a massive corruption scandal.Cheong said North Korea may launch a satellite rocket first and then attempt a nuclear test or an intercontinental ballistic missile launch in protest of likely international sanctions and condemnation on the satellite launch.","nuclear test before key anniversary ,upgraded nuclear test before key ,nuclear test before the anniversary ,last nuclear test ahead ,an upgraded nuclear test before","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'communist', 'Korean Central News Agency', ""North Korea 's"", 'North Korea', ""the Korean People 's Army"", 'Cheong', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Cheong', 'North Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.43977451  0.50786686

Despite the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s repeated requests to vacate the space, about 40 pro-Park tents remain clustered in one-third of the area, refusing to yield both to government orders and the Constitutional Court’s decision to expel Park from power.Pro-Park protest tents are pitched on Seoul Plaza in front of City Hall. When The Korea Herald visited the square Friday, the grass in the area had withered and several protesters -- mostly middle-aged or older -- were found in the camp, discussing the “bleak” future of South Korea while eating instant ramen and drinking soju. A loudspeaker announcement claiming Park’s innocence and wishing for her return pierced through the air.“We have slapped the pro-Park protest tents with a fine of 30.3 million won ,” said Chung Sang-taek, chief of general affairs at the Seoul Metropolitan Government, adding that the illegal occupiers have paid just a portion of that fine -- 9.2 million won. “So far they have clearly expressed their reluctance to remove the tents, but we are trying to solve this problem as peacefully as we can.”Located in front of Seoul City Hall, Seoul Plaza is a 6,294-square-meter grassy area frequented by Seoul citizens and tourists due to its proximity to tourist attractions such as Gyeongbokgung and the Myeong-dong district. It is also a venue for major festivals such as the annual Queer Culture Festival in June, South Korea’s largest LGBT parade. A notice has been posted on the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s website, saying that the square is unavailable for use until April 30 due to “unauthorized occupation by some groups.” So far, a total of nine annual spring festivals -- including the Spring Flower Market, Joint Worship for Easter Sunday and Earth Day Festival -- have been canceled, and five festival committees have retracted their applications to hold events there, according to the city officials. Preschoolers take a stroll around the pro-Park protest tents at Seoul Plaza. The problem also extends to issues related to lawn maintenance, as seed sowing in the area has been delayed indefinitely since March 1. Still, Hyun Yoo-jin, a woman in her sixties, who was volunteering as a receptionist for the group of tents, was adamant at remaining in the spot. “We will move out once the tents related to the Sewol ferry are removed,” she told The Korea Herald, referring to a similar tent zone in Gwanghwamun Square, just a few blocks away. “We have a mission to steer the country in the right direction.”A view of Seoul Plaza The Gwanghwamun tent zone, set up shortly after the tragic sinking of the ferry Sewol, considered the worst peacetime maritime disaster in South Korean history, also remains, as of Friday. The government said that out of the 14 tents in the square, only three tents are unregistered and have been regularly paying fines since 2014. The 11 registered tents are being funded by the government upon the request of the Sewol victims’ families. The situation is also drawing complaints from parents and teachers who take children around the area for daily strolls. “A lot of children come out to play around here, but the current environment has cut back the number of visits to the plaza for a lot of schools in the area --  doesn’t seem to have a healthy influence on a child’s mind,” said Choi Eun-young, a 29-year-old teacher at a local preschool in Junggu district, who was chaperoning a group of 10 children Friday.By Jung Min-kyung","park protest tents at seoul ,south korea largest lgbt parade ,protest tents at seoul ,power pro park protest tents ,korea largest lgbt parade notice","['Seoul', 'Seoul Plaza', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'pro - park', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'South Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Chung Sang - taek', 'Seoul City Hall', 'Seoul Plaza', 'Seoul', 'Gyeongbokgung', 'South Korea ’s', 'LGBT', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'the Spring Flower Market', 'Joint Worship', 'Hyun Yoo - jin', 'the Korea Herald', 'Gwanghwamun', 'south korean', 'Choi Eun - young', 'Junggu district', 'Jung Min - kyung']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.31064534 0.09104116 0.18934789]

Jo is a deputy director of the Organization & Guidance Department under the ruling party.  Jo, currently a deputy director of the Organization & Guidance Department under the ruling party, is seen as a close aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as he accompanied the leader the most on his field inspections.Kim, 72, was fired from the post of the spy chief in mid-January after a probe by the WPK found his agency had abused authority, according to Seoul's unification ministry.""If Jo is named the minister of state security, the move would pave the way for current or former officials from the WPK's Organization & Guidance Department to take key posts in the military and the intelligence agency,"" Cheong said.Military chief Hwang Pyong-so, widely viewed as the No. 2 man in North Korea, had assumed the first deputy director at the WPK's department before becoming the director of the general political bureau of the Korean People's Army in 2014.Other possible candidates for the spy chief include Pak Yong-sik, minister of the armed forces, and Jo Nam-jin, a senior official at the KPA's general political bureau, according to Cheong.The SPA, the country's legislative body, is the highest organ of state power under the North's constitution, but it actually rubber-stamps decisions by more powerful organizations, such as the WPK.At the SPA session held in June last year, ruler Kim was elected the chairman of the newly created state organ State Affairs Commission, which replaced the National Defense Commission.At the upcoming meeting, North Korea is likely to change one of eight members of the SAC to fill the vacancy as former spy chief Kim doubled as a member of the new organization.Cheong said that there is a low possibility that it will change the president of the SPA Presidium, which is being currently held by ceremonial leader Kim Yong-nam, 89.""Kim Yong-nam is likely to remain in his seat as he is normally playing his part and is not seen to have health problems,"" he added.The SPA holds a plenary session in April around the birthday of late founder Kim Il-sung, attended by hundreds of deputies, to finalize the country's budget spending and overhaul Cabinet organs.The expert earlier said that at the assembly, North Korea may decide to increase budget spending on the light industry or agriculture, rather than the military as it anticipates South Korea's political transition in May.""But there is a high possibility that Pyongyang could conduct large-scale provocative acts, including another nuke test or the launch of an ICBM, ahead of the founder's birthday slated for April 15,"" Cheong added.","upcoming parliamentary meeting an expert ,the upcoming meeting north korea ,meeting an expert said wednesday ,korea political transition in may ,upcoming meeting north korea","['North Korea', 'Kim Won - hong', 'Jo Yong - won', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", ""the Supreme People 's Assembly"", 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'Jo Yong - won', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Jo', 'the Organization & Guidance Department', 'Jo', 'the Organization & Guidance Department', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'WPK', 'Seoul', 'Jo', ""the WPK 's Organization & Guidance Department"", 'Cheong', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'North Korea', 'WPK', ""the Korean People 's Army"", 'Pak Yong - sik', 'Jo Nam - jin', 'KPA', 'Cheong', 'SPA', 'wpk.at', 'Kim', 'State Affairs Commission', 'the National Defense Commission', 'North Korea', 'SAC', 'Kim', 'Cheong', 'the SPA Presidium', 'Kim Yong - nam', 'Yong - nam', 'SPA', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Cabinet', 'North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'Cheong']",10,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.52535212  0.42282581

Nagamine was quoted by NHK as saying during the meeting in Abe's office, ""I will make utmost efforts to fulfill the present task,"" indicating he will try to ensure the current and next South Korean governments carry out the obligations under the deal struck on Dec. 28, 2015, and get the statue removed. Under the deal, Tokyo apologized and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for the creation of a foundation aimed at helping the victims, euphemistically called ""comfort women.""They also agreed to resolve the rift over the wartime atrocity ""once and for all.""Nagamine is expected to come back to Seoul, along with the Japanese Consul General in Busan Yasuhiro Morimoto, who was also recalled over the statue dispute.Tokyo claimed that the statue built before its consulate, along with another one standing in front of its embassy in Seoul, runs counter to the Seoul-Tokyo deal, while Seoul has called for an appropriate solution to the dispute over the statue but veered off from making a promise to get it removed or moved to another place, saying that it is not in its purview to do so since the statue was built by civic groups.Asked about how he will demand Seoul implement the deal, Nagamine said he is arranging a meeting to hold talks with South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who is also serving as the acting president, about the issue.Nagamine said prior to his meeting with Abe he paid a courtesy call on Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who instructed him to make every effort to demand the next South Korean government inherit the 2015 deal.The next South Korea government that is set to be launched next month should observe the deal, Suga told a press conference earlier in the day.South Korea is set to hold a presidential election on May 9 following the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. Some major presidential candidates have hinted at renegotiating the deal.Critics in Seoul demand the cancellation of the accord, saying that the Japanese government still refuses to recognize its legal responsibility and denied the women were forcefully recruited to front-line military brothels. The deal was also reached without consultation with the victims, they said. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II. Around 40 surviving South Korean victims are mostly in their late 80s.South Korea's foreign ministry reiterated its position that it will ""faithfully"" carry out what was agreed upon between the two countries and that it is important for all parties involved to respect the spirit of the deal. With regard to the statue, however, the ministry didn't elaborate, only to say that it will communicate with Japan on the issue."" We have repeatedly made our stance known. In that context, we plan to discuss with Japan going forward,"" Cho June-hyuck, foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing in Seoul. ""What is important here is that all relevant parties should respect the spirit and objective of the deal.""The ministry previously said that it is not desirable to install such a statue in front of a diplomatic mission in view of safety and international courtesy and asked those involved to gather wisdom and find a better place for it.The spokesman added that there was no prior consultation between the two countries regarding Nagamine's return to Seoul and that the envoy's meetings with foreign ministry and other government officials here will be discussed and decided by ""our government"" when he makes an official request.Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday instructed its ambassador to South Korea to request that Seoul implement a landmark 2015 deal to resolve the long-running rift over Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women, a Japanese broadcaster reported.","sexual enslavement of korean women ,seoul implement landmark 2015 deal ,reporters in tokyo after meeting ,40 surviving south korean victims ,minister shinzo abe on tuesday","['Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'Yasumasa Nagamine', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Busan', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Yasumasa Nagamine', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Nagamine', 'NHK', 'Abe', 'south korean', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japanese', 'Busan', 'Yasuhiro Morimoto', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Nagamine', 'south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Nagamine', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Yoshihide Suga', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'Suga', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'south korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Cho', 'Seoul', 'Nagamine', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'korean', 'japanese']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29240903  0.56983703

Based on interviews with 196 defectors and other surveys last year, the latest edition details the regime’s rights breaches on the right to life, public executions, gulags, border controls, women and children and overseas laborers, especially over the last five years.Until a 2013 amendment of its criminal law, North Korea had sentenced capital punishments for crimes including treason, terror and conspiracy. Narcotics manufacturing was previously punishable by up to five years of hard labor.The latest addition runs counter to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of which the country is a member, said Do Kyung-ok, director of the Center for North Korean Human Rights Studies within the institute. “The change may attest to how prevalent opium and drug production is there,” she said at a news conference in Seoul. “Nevertheless, it doesn’t serve the covenant’s basic interpretation, and we see it as backtracking in terms of the guarantee of the right to life.”On border controls, the Kim Jong-un regime has been sharply stepping up its efforts since the second half of 2015, installing high-voltage electric fences along the Tumen River, which flows along part its border with China and provides an escape route to those seeking to flee. In August 2014, authorities evicted some 200 households and demolished their homes in Samjiyon County, Ryanggang Province, where the wooded environment made it easier to cross the river. “The campaign gave birth to a new kind of forced migration under the Kim Jong-un leadership,” another KINU fellow Han Dong-ho said. “A majority of the 30,000 defectors living in the South are the lower class from the northern border regions, and we’ve learned that the authorities didn’t even take any measures after forcing them out of their homes.” From 2013-16, the think tank collected cases of North Korean laborers in China, Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Libya to look into their living conditions. The study concluded that the workers, though largely voluntarily dispatched, faced forced labor because they were required to pay back secondment costs, with their forms of identification confiscated by managers. The regime also continues to execute not only executives, but rank-and-file citizens throughout the country, often coercing other residents to watch, KINU said. It cited a defector’s testimony that about 300 residents in Ryanggang Province were instructed to watch a public trial and ensuing execution in a schoolyard in August 2014. The National Intelligence Service also said in 2015 that at least 70 high-profile officials had been killed since Kim took power. Throughout all types of detention facilities, violence and cruel treatment have been “routinized,” researcher Lim Ye-joon said, noting that conditions were particularly harsh at border detention houses run by the Ministry of State Security, where mostly failed escapees are held. Nationwide food production slightly improved last year, but persistent shortages prompted North Koreans to resort to underground markets, private farming and other self-help measures.

The system will be applied to all flights of 86 airliners that depart for South Korea from 169 airports in 43 countries, the ministry noted. The entry ban has so far been implemented selectively on a trial basis.Under the system, an airliner sends passenger information from departure airports to the ministry's Immigration Information System. Then the immigration authorities here give real-time feedback on whether to allow boarding for specific individuals after examining their records of involvement in terrorist attacks and previous refusals of entry and verifying their passports.Preparations for the system began in March 2014 after a Malaysia Airlines plane went missing and the first test run was carried out for an Asiana Airlines flight departing from Japan's Narita International Airport in February 2015.In the test operation, a total of 2,271 crime-prone foreigners, including those convicted of attempted murder, drug-related crimes and theft, as well as holders of stolen or lost passports, have not been allowed to enter South Korea.For instance, an Egyptian national convicted of attempted murder was barred from boarding a Cathay Pacific flight bound for South Korea at Hong Kong International Airport in October last year, while a Vietnamese national wanted by Interpol was not allowed to board a Korean Air plane in Hong Kong in January this year.""The government will further strengthen border controls and contribute to national security by blocking entry to crime-prone foreigners,"" a ministry official said.","barred from boarding international flights ,south korea from 169 airports ,convicted of attempted murder drug ,month the government said thursday ,2014 after malaysia airlines plane","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Immigration Information System', 'Malaysia Airlines', 'Asiana Airlines', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'egyptian', 'Cathay Pacific', 'South Korea', 'Hong Kong International Airport', 'vietnamese', 'Interpol', 'korean Air', 'Hong Kong']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26065218  0.51667172

The structure comes with the new name “Seoullo 7017,” combining the year 1970 when it was first built and 2017 -- when it was remodeled to be a pedestrian-friendly road.The overpass had been used as a major driveway connecting Mapo-gu, western Seoul, and Jung-gu, central Seoul, for 40 years. However, as it deteriorated in the 1990s, citizens strongly called for its removal. In 2006, a safety assessment classified the outdated overpass as dangerous.In 2014, the city of Seoul came up with a basic plan to develop the road into a public park. The next year, it announced the “Seoul Station 7017 Project.”Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon plans to turn the 1.15-kilometer overpass into a rest area and tourist attraction. The city met with local residents and merchants more than 600 times to hear opinions on the renewal of the overpass. It also held an international design competition to receive proposals from the world’s leading designers. The final winner was a Dutch architect named Winy Maas, who put forward a design titled “Seoul Arboretum.”Seoul finalized the design of the project early last year. It kicked off construction in earnest in March last year, repairing existing bridges and roofs and installing trails and landscape facilities.The revamped overpass largely consists of a main and link roads connected to Toegye-ro and Malli-dong Square. A total of 17 newly built pedestrian walkways will lead citizens to major areas of Seoul, such as Yongsan-gu, Jung-gu, Namsan Park and Seoul Station.Seoullo 7017 will be pedestrian-only for all sections, becoming the first car-free street to be constructed on a permanent basis in Seoul.The city plans to designate the overpass as “special pedestrian zone,” covering the 1.7 square kilometer area in Malli-dong and Hoehyeon-dong near Seoul Station. The city plans to remove illegal advertisements and install facilities to slow down passing cars for those who want to walk in the area. The city also expects the refurbished overpass will lead to urban regeneration in underdeveloped areas around Seoul Station.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it aims to build a “walkable community” through the new overpass and surrounding infrastructure in a way that helps the people enjoy walking through all the major historical and cultural attractions. Seoullo 7017 is expected to help Seoul become a more pedestrian-friendly city.By Byun Hee-jin","seoul station overpass once driveway ,said the newly renovated overpass ,new citizen park the seoul ,station 7017 project seoul mayor ,7017 project seoul mayor park","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Mapo - gu', 'Seoul', 'Jung - gu', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'dutch', 'Winy Maas', 'Malli - dong Square', 'Seoul', 'Yongsan - gu', 'Jung - gu', 'Namsan Park', 'Seoul Station', 'Seoul', 'Malli - dong', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Byun Hee - jin']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30798694  0.19539148

Pyongyang’s state media said it tested a new high-thrust rocket engine Saturday, a step seen as part of its efforts to build an intercontinental ballistic missile, for which Kim has said a test is in the final stage of preparations. US President Donald Trump “He’s acting very very badly,” Trump said of Kim as he departed his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to a White House pool report. The president also said he had meetings about North Korea with administration officials over the weekend.Trump’s remarks came as US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrapped up his Asia tour consisting of stops in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing. During his stay here, he signaled that Washington, which is currently carrying out a North Korea policy review, would take a tougher line, saying all options including military action are “on the table.” On Friday, Trump also lashed out in a tweet at Pyongyang for “behaving very badly” and “playing” the US for years, while accusing China of having “done little to help.” Speculation persists that the Kim regime may test-fire the KN-08 or KN-14 ICBM in the first half of this year in a bid to exploit presidential transitions in Seoul and Washington. It has threatened the launch could come “at any time and any place.” Overseeing the engine test, the young leader said the “whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries,” saying it marks what will be known as the “March 18 revolution” in the development of the country’s rocket industry. Seoul’s Defense Ministry said the new model appears to be comprised of a main engine and four auxiliaries, though military and intelligence officials are carrying out a detailed analysis. “We assess that through the latest test, they have apparently made meaningful progress in engine performance, but a further analysis will be needed to verify the engine’s precise thrust and prospects for its future utility,” deputy ministry spokesman Col. Lee Jin-woo said at a news briefing. Following Tillerson’s trip, the top nuclear negotiators of South Korea and the US are set to intensify consultations. Joseph Yun, US special representative for North Korea policy, arrived in Seoul later in the day after visiting Beijing over the weekend to meet with his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei.

He also said that the US was considering a wide range of options, including the use of military force.Tillerson also declared an end to former President Barack Obama's much-denounced North Korea policy, known as ""strategic patience,"" which centers on waiting for Pyongyang to show good faith while increasing sanctions and pressure on the regime. Ken Gause, a North Korea expert at CNA Corp. Tillerson's remarks sound tough, but the substance won't be much different from the strategic patience policy, according to Ken Gause, a North Korea expert who is director of the international affairs group at CNA Corp. in Washington.""Much of the rhetoric sounds like strategic patience. The US is going to continue to apply pressure on North Korea through sanctions; we are going to pressure China to get North Korea to do the right thing. Although we haven't taken the military option off the table, it doesn't sound like it is the preferred option,"" Gause said.""I just see more of the same -- sanctions and pressure. Maybe some adjustments around the edges to make the policy more severe.However, the lack of a balanced strategy of carrots and sticks will hamstring any US-North Korea policy,"" he said.The expert said that Tillerson's tough talk in Seoul and Tokyo appeared to be aimed at a number of different audiences, and designed to show that the era of strategic patience has ended and the US is moving ""boldly in a new direction, getting tough on North Korea.""Gause, who has expertise in North Korea leadership, said that there is a good likelihood that the North will look for a chance to respond to Tillerson's aggressive rhetoric with more provocations, including nuclear and missile tests.""North Korea cannot be seen as being weak in the face of international, including US, threats and pressure. To do so will weaken Kim Jong-un's position within the regime,"" he said.Still, Pyongyang would also be careful in determining the timing of additional provocations because aggressive action could galvanize conservatives in South Korea ahead of May's presidential election, Gause said.""Pyongyang is also cognizant that its actions will have an impact on politics in Seoul. Given that the progressives are leading in the polls, North Korea will want to make sure that it calibrates its response to avoid giving ammunition to the conservatives,"" he said.The expert said that dialogue and diplomacy must be a key part of the US policy on the North.""Dialogue and diplomacy are critical to making any strategy work. North Korea and China most likely do not believe the US will resort to pre-emption or other military pressures out of fear of unintended consequences,"" he said.More sanctions, no matter how targeted, can be skirted either by North Korea on its own or in conjunction with China that may or may not vigorously enforce sanctions, and China has larger regional equities that will likely prevent it from fully supporting efforts to denuclearize North Korea, he said.""The result will likely be that North Korea will continue to accelerate its attempts to develop a viable nuclear program with a capability to target the United States. The closer that this comes to a reality, the harder it will be for the US to avoid the military option,"" Gause said.","obama much denounced north korea ,president barack obama much denounced ,barack obama much denounced north ,barack obama much denounced ,obama much denounced north","['US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tillerson', 'US', 'Tillerson', 'Barack Obama', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Ken Gause', 'North Korea', 'CNA Corp.', 'Tillerson', 'Ken Gause', 'North Korea', 'CNA Corp.', 'Washington', 'US', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Gause', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Tillerson', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'US', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Tillerson', 'Korea', 'US', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'Gause', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'China', 'US', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'US', 'Gause']",0,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.37625602  0.73073405

There are only a handful of such labs currently operating in the world, the center said. At least 24 billion won  has been injected for the new lab project, which officials said would enhance the country’s preparedness for deadly diseases and help local firms’ research for vaccines. In the envisioned lab, experiments on about 20 of the most deadly kinds of human viruses, including Ebola and Lassa fever, will be carried out. Scientists still do not know much about how these diseases spread and have so far failed to develop vaccines. The risk group 4 viruses can kill up to 90 percent of those who contract them and can be passed along by close contact with bodily fluids, perhaps even by a sneeze. Only a handful of doctorate-level scientists, who are trained at BL-4 laboratories in other countries, will have access to the lab to conduct tests, the KCDC said. Cocooned within a submarine-like airtight facility, each room inside the laboratory is equipped with state-of-the art air and sound pressure infrastructure to prevent the spread of virus. Currently, Korea only operates BL-3 labs that handle pathogens in risk group 3, which usually cause serious human or animal disease but do not easily spread by casual contact. The Middle East respiratory syndrome that struck Korea in 2015 belongs to this group. In 2014, a local pharmaceutical company developed an Ebola treatment substance, but had to seek separate research in a US-based lab, due to the lack of facilities here.The authorities, however, have yet to finalize the opening of the lab, as it requires a review of the risks that taking deadly viruses into the country could pose to public safety.By Kim Da-sol","local firms research for vaccines ,country first biosafety level lab ,2014 local pharmaceutical company ,korea only operates bl labs ,the deadliest of human viruses","['South Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Osong', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Lassa', 'KCDC', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'US', 'Kim Da - sol']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42374378  0.52550834

Since South Korea agreed to host the system last year, China has denounced the move, saying its high-power radar will be used to spy on its military. Lee Hee-beom , president of the organizing committee for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, speaks during a press conference following meetings with the International Olympic Committee's Coordination Commission, chaired by Gunilla Lindberg , on March 15. On Lee's watch, PyeongChang and Beijing, along with Tokyo, host of the 2020 Summer Games, have formed a tripartite cooperative network. At a press conference following the meetings of the International Olympic Committee's Coordination Commission on PyeongChang, Lee said the diplomatic situation hasn't influenced the two's sports cooperation.""I believe the Olympic Games should be operated purely in accordance with the Olympic spirits,"" Lee said at Alpensia Convention Centre in PyeongChang, some 180 kilometers east of Seoul. ""And I think the Olympic Games shouldn't be affected by any external factors.""Lee noted that Beijing has sent ""a large number of delegates to PyeongChang"" during an ongoing series of Olympic test events, so that they could study Winter Games venues closely and learn more about organization and operations of winter sports events. Lee has previously spoken about using some of PyeongChang's Olympic venues as training facilities for those competing at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.""The organizing committees of PyeongChang and Beijing are closely cooperating with each other,"" Lee added. ""And discussions for further bilateral exchanges in the areas of sports and culture are ongoing. I believe many Chinese tourists will visit PyeongChang in 2018.""Aside from the THAAD row, PyeongChang has also had to deal with the political uncertainty at home, in light of the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye.Gunilla Lindberg, head of the IOC's Coordination Commission, said she has been reassured by South Korean political leaders that parties will put aside their differences to fully support the PyeongChang Games. Lindberg has met with Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun during her visit.""All of them assured that independent of what's happening on the political side in Korea, they will fully support PyeongChang 2018,"" she said. ""We have the assurance from the political side and we have trust in Korean politicians.""Lee pointed to the National Assembly's resolutions on PyeongChang, drafted late last year, as evidence of the political parties' willingness to back the first Winter Games in the country.He also said stability will be restored following the presidential election on May 9.""Under the new president, I believe we will have a more stable system in place,"" he said. ""And I believe the PyeongChang Winter Olympics will unite our people again.""Lindberg said PyeongChang will have to ""clarify"" its transportation system and improve its accommodations, but added she's otherwise pleased with the host city's progress.""I am pleased to report that fans and athletes from around the world can expect a unique Winter Olympic experience in PyeongChang,"" she said. ""From the fans' point of view, the Olympics will be mixed with cultural activities. And athletes can expect top-quality venues and fields of play on both snow and ice.""Lindberg said the support of the South Korean public will be ""very important"" for the success of the Olympics, and it's crucial for PyeongChang's organizers to reach out and engage the people.Lee admitted the organizing committee still has work to do to create more excitement about the Olympics, and Lindberg predicted the situation will improve soon once plans for the Olympic torch relay are finalized.""The Olympic torch and the torchbearers' uniforms were unveiled last month, with the torchbearer selection process expected to be launched in the coming months,"" she said.

Following the district office’s redevelopment plan, announced in December, the removal of brothels resumed earlier this month. By 2020, four 65-story luxury residential-commercial complexes and a 42-story shopping mall are to be erected in the 41,586 square meters area, just five minutes’ walk from Cheongnyangni Station. The abandoned houses are left with shattered windows and large red letters spelling out “demolition” written on broken walls. Most sex workers and pimps have already left. Most of the 156 brothels are closed, and now the abandoned houses are left with shattered windows and large red letters spelling out “demolition” written on broken walls. Still, eight shops were in business, refusing to move out, when The Korea Herald visited the area last week. Although only one or two women were sitting in front of the large window doors to attract customers, a stream of middle-aged men approached them. Only few went inside. According to the Dongdaemun District Office, 85 percent of 716 households in the area, including regular shops and residential houses near the red-light street, have completed moving out.The rest are still in negotiation for compensation, the district office said. Cheongnyangni 588 has long been a major cause of complaints for residents and businesses in the neighboring residential and commercial areas, as Cheongnyangni Station develops into a major shopping center. “There is much room for growth because Cheongnyangni Station has served as one of the transportation hubs for Seoul by connecting major bus, railway and subway lines,” a real estate agent near Cheongnyangni Station told The Korea Herald.The redevelopment committee, representing about 130 property owners and tenants, ruled out the possibility of negotiation, saying they have already gone through real estate appraisals for compensation of the land.Developers already started the demolition process in the neighborhood earlier this month, after receiving a court order that allowed them to demolish and evict the defiant tenants and sex workers.Some developers even installed surveillance cameras in the neighborhood to drive the sex business out of the area. Sex trade is illegal in South Korea, with sex workers, their clients and pimps all subject to punishment. A long-time resident and now evictee, surnamed Kim, told The Korea Herald that not enough financial compensation was offered to cover relocation costs. This file photo shows the once thriving brothels in the Cheongnyangni 588 red-light district in Seoul. “The district office and the development committee only agreed to provide 1 million to 1.5 million won  for tenants. But you know, we are paying at least 3 million won per month for rent,” said Kim, who is also a member of the association for the evicted or relocated residents. Yoo Deok-yeol, head of the Dongdaemun District Office, said that there will be “no forced removal“ of tenants and sex workers before the redevelopment construction takes place.Cheongnyangni 588 enjoyed its heyday in the 1980s and ‘90s, hosting over 1,000 sex workers. It was one of the three largest red-light districts in Seoul, along with one in Cheonho-dong in eastern Seoul and Miari in northern Seoul. There are two major theories about where the number 588 came from. Some say it came from the street number of the district, Jeonnong-dong 588, while others point to the number of a bus that passes by the district. But in 2004, an anti-prostitution law made these red-light districts illegal. Since then, the sex business has become more discreet and moved online, reducing demand for brothels like those at Cheongnyangni.According to statistics last year, there are officially 44 red-light districts in Korea. But the numbers are rapidly falling now.Doors of brothels are marked with an “X,” marking it for demolition in the coming months. The Cheongnyangni 588 red-light district is located in Jeonnong-dong, Seoul. In 2010, a brothel area around Yongsan Station in central Seoul was removed for a redevelopment project led by Samsung. Another at Miari in northern Seoul has turned residential. Ones in Cheonho-dong in southeastern Seoul and Yeongdeungpo in southwestern Seoul are rapidly losing customers.Industry workers say the demolition of red-light districts cannot completely root out sex business. “Many sex workers have already left Cheongnyangni 588, but no one really knows where the evicted sex workers have gone,” said an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous.“I heard some went to red-light districts in other parts of the country. Others probably went to find jobs at room salons, karaoke bars and massage parlors that receive reservations only online,” she added.By Kim Da-sol","dong seoul in 2010 brothel ,the 156 brothels are closed ,brothels resumed earlier this month ,seoul in 2010 brothel ,southwestern seoul are rapidly losing","['Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Dongdaemun District Office', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'the Dongdaemun District Office', 'Seoul', 'Cheonho - dong', 'Seoul', 'Miari', 'Seoul', 'Jeonnong - dong', 'Korea', 'Jeonnong - dong', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Samsung', 'Miari', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92249393  0.60514706

Presidential hopeful Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo from the People’s Party announces the pledges at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. Sejong was initially envisioned by the late President Roh Moo-hyun as a new capital city that could replace the overcrowded Seoul. It is home to 40 government agencies and over 250,000 residents.Ahn also released some drastic political reform plans, vowing to provide citizens with stronger rights and to reduce the power of the president. “The Constitutional Court’s ruling on the ouster of  President Park Geun-hye shows that no one can stand above citizens and the law,” he told a news briefing at the National Assembly. Ahn laid out four reform plans: expanding voter rights, balancing regional development, making transparent the election process and efficiently running state affairs. On expanding voting rights, Ahn said he would reintroduce the initiative law to allow citizens to bill motions, which had been in place until it was abolished in 1972. He also vowed to grant citizens the right to revise laws that the parliament struggles to pass, if elected. “The president’s authority over human resources shall be reduced,” Ahn said.If a president is to organize a Cabinet, all the ministerial positions the leader designates should be approved by the parliament, he said. “We should not demand the voters, who are the masters of this country, to exercise their rights only once in four or five years to choose a leader,” he said. “As voting is stronger than candlelight vigils and a system is stronger than voting, we should make good systems.”By Jo He-rim","assembly in seoul on monday ,in seoul on monday sejong ,in seoul on monday ,seoul on monday sejong ,wednesday unveiled the electoral pledge","['Ahn Cheol', 'the National Assembly to Sejong', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Seoul', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'Ahn', 'Cabinet', 'Jo He - rim']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39745465  0.28336105

The one consistency in the last 40-plus years has been that we have never taken any kind of defense or aggressive movement toward North Korean testing. I think it's time to do so,"" she said.Considered one of the leading candidates for undersecretary of defense for policy, Long said that the ongoing deployment of the US THAAD missile defense system is one of the examples of such military measures.""It is signaling to the North Koreans, the South Koreans, the Chinese and others that we will be able to take active measures, but I think we need to have a dialogue with the Chinese to make sure that they understand that that is going to go into place and operational and that its intent is to intercept only the North Koreans,"" she said.The US should also explain to Beijing that THAAD would not have been necessary if China had been serious about stemming North Korean threats, Long said, adding that China is ""as responsible for the THAAD having to be taken into place as anyone else is"" because it failed to rein in the North.""I think we need to re-examine whether we declare that we will intercept while it is on the pad or in flight, any further missile that is launched by North Korea, particularly any of those with the range or the payload beyond the Scud that we've all been living with and I believe at an increased tempo,"" Long said.She noted that there were a grand total of about 21 ballistic missile tests by the North that were in violation of UN resolutions last year, and this year alone there have already been five launches that have demonstrated an increasing tempo and an increasing range.Long also suggested a ""collective security declaration"" providing assurances to South Korea and to Japan.""Having this declared declaration will also give a framework within which we can talk to both the Chinese and the North Koreans as far as what we're going to do militarily and diplomatically,"" she said.","down any missile the communist ,about stemming north korean threats ,senior defense official said monday ,intercept only the north koreans ,nation test fires former senior","['the United States', 'North Korea', 'Mary Beth Long', 'Council on Foreign Relations', 'north korean', 'Long', 'US', 'the North Koreans', 'the South Koreans', 'Chinese', 'Chinese', 'US', 'Beijing', 'China', 'north korean', 'long', 'China', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Chinese', 'the North Koreans']",13,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.33290488  0.57901275

""It's a very reasonable and real response to a very provocative threat that is facing people in South Korea.""Asked if the US would accept a reversal in South Korea's decision to host THAAD, Thornton said that the deployment was an alliance decision made jointly between the US and the South. Park's ouster came just days after the US brought into South Korea the first elements of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery that the two countries agreed to host in the country to defend better against North Korean missile threats.Her exit could raise doubts about her decision to host THAAD amid intensifying pressure from China, which has strongly railed against the deployment, claiming the system, especially its powerful radar, can be used against the country. Thornton also said that Park's impeachment and ultimate removal from office took place through ""a pretty transparent process undergirded by varying democratic institutions which have really proven their mettle in the unfolding of this peaceful process.""She said that how to deal with North Korea will be an important topic in Tillerson's trip.""This trip will allow Secretary Tillerson to engage allies and partners on not only a range of bilateral issues, also importantly to discuss and coordinate strategy to address the advancing nuclear missile threat from North Korea,"" Thornton said.""The United States is committed to holding North Korean accountable for its flagrant and repeated disregard of UN Security Council resolutions which explicitly prohibit ballistic missile and nuclear programs. We will defend our friends and allies, of course, the Republic of Korea and Japan and seek to work collaboratively to the maximum extent possible with important partners like China on this issue,"" she said.Tillerson is scheduled to leave Tuesday for the trip that will take him to Tokyo on Wednesday, Seoul on Friday and Beijing on Saturday. While in Seoul, Tillerson is scheduled to meet with Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.The trip comes as the administration of President Donald Trump is putting together its North Korea policy.""The current administration, especially following on the missile launches that occurred a couple of weeks ago, is looking very actively at the issue of North Korea and reviewing its approach and what kinds of options it's considering. That process is still ongoing,"" Thornton said.She said the US is ""intent on keeping up the pressure on the North Korean regime and trying to change the calculus on the part of the North Korean leadership to come back to the negotiating table and discuss its illegal and very destabilizing weapons programs.""""Certainly discussing the elements of any new approach will be an important part of discussions,"" she said.","korean missile threats her exit ,new elections for president coming ,ousted from office for corruption ,tilleron upcoming trip to seoul ,north korean missile threats her","['the United States', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'State Department', 'Susan Thornton', 'Foreign Press Center', 'State', ""Rex Tilleron 's"", 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Thornton', 'Thornton', 'South Korea', 'US', ""South Korea 's"", 'Thornton', 'US', 'Park', 'US', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'China', 'Thornton', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Tillerson', 'Tillerson', 'North Korea', 'Thornton', '""The United States', 'north Korean', 'UN Security Council', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Tillerson', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Tillerson', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Thornton', 'US', 'north korean', 'north korean']",2,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.19965205  0.29987487

There could arise complex situations in terms of administrative affairs on the South Korean government side,"" Pellerin said of potential impact of the impeachment of Park Geun-hye on the Pyeongchang Olympics. ""But I think it will be successfully hosted as many people are working enthusiastically.

""Two years ago, Brazil was in the same situation, but hosted its Olympics successfully. Part of my mission is to contribute to the successfully holding of the PyeongChang Olympics,"" she said. In January, Pellerin was named as ""Grand Temoin"" for the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, an international association of 57 French-speaking countries, to oversee the use of the French language and represent the association during the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games.  A major part of her duties as Grand Temoin includes providing support for the translation of PyeongChang Olympics booklets and guidebooks into French as well as hosting cultural events to promote the francophonic society during the Olympics.It is the first time the OIF would sent its Grand Temoin to an Olympics event in South Korea since the organization was established in 2004.

""Kim Jong-un is at the top of this body, but in reality, Kim Sol-song is the person in charge.""She was born in 1974 to the late former leader Kim Jong-il and his second wife Kim Yong-suk. She has a different mother than Kim Jong-un, who was born to Ko Yong-hui, a Korean resident in Japan.Kim Sol-song's public activity has not been known amid conflicting views about her role in North Korea's leadership. Some experts said that she had long been shunned away from power.Kim Jong-un was recommended as the supreme commander of the KPA on Dec. 30, 2011, about two weeks after the death of his father Kim Jong-il.""She may be serving as chief vice chairperson of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea,"" Lee claimed, adding that Kim may be the first vice chairperson of the State Affairs Commission.Lee's claim has not been officially confirmed as the North's state media has not mentioned such a role in its reports.Currently, the WPK's central committee consists of chairman Kim Jong-un and nine vice chairmen, including Choe Ryong-hae.The SAC, a state apparatus, was set up in June last year, replacing the National Defense Commission, which played a key role under the Kim Jong-il regime. The organ is led by chairman Kim Jong-un and has three vice chairmen, including top military official Hwang Pyong-so.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, earlier claimed that Kim Sol-song is believed to be exerting huge influence on North Korea's policy-making process.He said that she may be the one who ordered the killing of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of Kim Jong-un who died at an airport in Malaysia after two Asian women allegedly smeared the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent on his face.Meanwhile, Rep. Ha Tae-keung told a radio program last month that Kim Sol-song may be the next assassination target by the North's leader. Lee at the think tank said that North Korea's 216 Institute under the SAC is handling the country's nuclear tests while a think tank under the WPK's central military committee is dealing with works on nuclear weapons' miniaturization and standardization.""Under the Kim Jong-un regime, the SAC and the party's military committee are handling nuclear weapons and strategic missile developments, respectively,"" Lee said.","sister of north korea leader ,half sister of north korea ,older half sister of north ,his second wife kim yong ,sister of north korea","[""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Sol - song', ""the Supreme Command of the Korean People 's Army"", 'Lee Yun - keol', 'the Sejong Institute', 'Kim Sol - song', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - il', 'Lee', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Sol - song', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Yong - suk', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Ko Yong - hui', 'korean', 'Japan', ""Kim Sol - song 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'KPA', 'Kim Jong - il', ""Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'Lee', 'Kim', 'the State Affairs Commission', 'Lee', 'WPK', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'SAC', 'the National Defense Commission', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'Kim Sol - song', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Malaysia', 'asian', 'VX', 'Ha Tae - keung', 'Kim Sol - song', ""North Korea 's"", '216 Institute', 'SAC', 'WPK', 'Kim Jong - un', 'SAC', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57795471  0.31056592

""He is too soft to cope with the dirty games in realpolitik.""According to conservative critics, Moon is also too soft towards North Korea.Nuclear-armed Pyongyang launched a flight of four missiles towards Japan this week in what it said was a drill for an attack on US bases in the country.But in December Moon said that if elected, he was willing to visit North Korea ahead of the United States, the South's security guarantor.Facing criticism, he said he meant defusing tensions with the North was an issue of utmost urgency.A US missile defence system, THAAD, is being deployed to the South in the face of threats from the North, infuriating Beijing, which has imposed a series of measures seen as economic retaliation.Moon was ambivalent about the issue this week, saying it needed to be carefully handled as it would bring the South ""both gains and losses"".But his military service as a paratrooper adds to his credentials. Moon was born in the southern island of Geoje in 1952 during the Korean War after his North Korean parents fled to the South.His father was a menial worker at a prisoner-of-war camp in Geoje while his mother peddled eggs in the nearby port city of Busan, with the baby Moon strapped to her back, the politician wrote in his autobiography.He entered law school in Seoul in 1972 but was arrested and expelled for leading a student protest against the authoritarian rule of dictator Park Chung-hee -- the ousted president's father.Moon returned to school in 1980 only to be arrested again.His close friendship with future president Roh began in 1982 when they opened a law firm in Busan focusing on human and civil rights issues.Both became leading figures in the pro-democracy protests that swept the country in 1987 and led to South Korea's first direct presidential elections the same year.When Roh entered politics, Moon continued with his legal practice in Busan, defending students and workers arrested for leading protests and labour strikes.""I was always happy due to the fact that I was able to help others with what I had been trained to do,"" he said in his autobiography.But a year after Roh's unexpected election victory in 2002, Moon joined the administration as a presidential  aide, tasked with weeding out official corruption and screening candidates for top government posts, before rising to become his chief of staff.Despite the scandal that led to his mentor killing himself by jumping off a cliff, said Kang Won-Taek, a political science professor at Seoul National University, Moon ""always remained untainted by corruption allegations and abuse of power.""","succeed south korea impeached president ,korea most beloved ex president ,south korea impeached president park ,south korea impeached president ,korea impeached president park geun","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun - Hye', 'the Democratic Party', 'Roh Moo - Hyun', 'Roh', ""South Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'Democratic Party', 'Park', 'Hwang Kyo - Ahn', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Japan', 'US', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'US', 'Beijing', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'north korean', 'Busan', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Busan', ""South Korea 's"", 'Roh', 'Moon', 'Busan', 'Roh', 'Moon', 'Kang Won - Taek', 'Seoul National University']",13,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.73951799  0.41536194

""Regardless of political state, we will just focus on making the Winter Games a success.""The POCOG has been suffering from a corruption scandal involving Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil. Suspicions have persisted that Choi and her relatives have sought to win lucrative contracts related to the Olympics by exploiting her close ties to the president. The scandal hasn't just affected PyeongChang's image. The business community has also been reluctant to open its collective wallet to support the Olympics, with the nation's major corporations also implicated in the scandal. However, as uncertainties clear away, POCOG hopes the new president to give a bump to the Olympics that will be staged in PyeongChang and its nearby sub-host cities, Gangneung and Jeongseon, in Gangwon Province from Feb. 9 to 25 next year. Under the law, South Korea must hold a presidential by-election within two months of the historic verdict, and many expect it to fall on May 9. The Winter Games will be the first major sporting event for the new president to greet sports leaders around the world. The new South Korean president can now take part in both the opening and closing ceremonies of the PyeongChang Olympics. If not impeached, Park could have declared the opening of the Winter Games, as her term ends on Feb. 24, 2018, but that honor will go to her successor. ""We believe that the country's next president will pay more attention to the PyeongChang Olympics,"" a POCOG official said. ""We also expect the PyeongChang Olympics to bring unity among South Koreans.""","winter olympic games said friday ,2018 olympic paralympic winter games ,olympic games said friday preparations ,olympic paralympic winter games said ,olympic games said friday","['PyeongChang', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangwon Province', 'the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for', 'Park', 'Choi', 'PyeongChang', 'PyeongChang', 'Gangneung', 'Jeongseon', 'Gangwon Province', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Park', 'South Koreans']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33103585  0.86299467

Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who took over after the impeachment, will continue to serve as acting president. Experts said the leadership absence would make it harder for the nation to navigate through complicated diplomatic challenges, with one serious ramification being the trouble South Korea will have in carrying out ""summit diplomacy.""""It will be hard to expect any breakthrough in the months to come in terms of diplomacy. Our counterparts in other countries won't make meaningful steps at a time when a new government and new president will take office in a few months,"" Woo Jung-yeop, a researcher at the Sejong Institute, said. ""Nor should we expect any meaningful outcome of negotiations under the acting president.""Park's ouster couldn't come at a worse time for South Korea given the bleak diplomatic landscape confronting the country right now. South Korea has been at odds with its two strong neighbors, Japan and China. Japan brought in its top envoy in Seoul in January in protest of the erection of a girl statue before its consulate that symbolizes the hardship of women it forced into sexual slavery during World War II. Japan's repeated territorial claims to South Korea's eastern islets of Dokdo have also added to the rift.What's more concerning is that tensions with China have been deepening ever since South Korea decided to host an advanced USmissile defense system called THAAD on its soil despite Beijing's strong objections. As the process to install THAAD picked up speed recently, Beijing has stepped up what appears to be retaliation against South Korean goods and companies as a way to apply more pressure. In addition, North Korea has continued with missile provocations at a time South Korea's frayed ties with China and Japan have undermined the cooperation needed to cope with the recalcitrant northern neighbor.All these are exacerbating worries over what could be done when a major diplomatic situation or even a serious provocation, say, from the North happens at a time with no clear decision-maker with a strong mandate at the top.""What could be problematic is when national security is at stake. What if the North carries out a major military provocation that requires an action from the government? Without the leader and ahead of the election that would make almost everything politicized, it would be hard to take swift and right action,"" Woo said.In this sense US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's visit to Korea next week is very important, as he could send a message to the North that the Seoul-Washington alliance is strong and steadfast, which could help stave off any military provocation by the North, he added. Tillerson's planned visit to Seoul is part of his first Asian tour since taking office as top diplomat under the Donald Trump administration. He is to visit Japan and China as well.Though many agree that Park's dismissal would make it harder to handle the already-tough diplomatic and security situations, some cautiously say that it could eventually help ease the overall uncertainty hanging over South Korea for months. They also say that the country will now be able to leave the legal battle for her fate behind and move forward with whoever will be chosen as head of state in the upcoming presidential election.""I don't think that things will be much different in the months to come from the past few in that there is no commander-in-chief with a mandate,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a researcher at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.""The final ruling on the president's impeachment, however, will help remove uncertainty to some extent and make people from home and abroad turn their attention now to major presidential candidates likely to run in the election and, accordingly, those candidates will further clarify their stance on major issues,"" he added.Experts agreed that the acting president-led government should try hard not to be swayed by political influence given that any action or policymaking will be closely scrutinized and politicized by those running for president and their parties seeking to better jockey for the election. They called for stable management until the presidential election is held and power is handed over to the next leader but cautioned against balking at any major government policy just because of its political ramifications either. ""Stable management is important but it shouldn't go so far as to postpone everything until the next government comes in. The government should do its duty until the end without being influenced by populism and political reasons,"" said Yang Wook, a senior researcher of the Korea Defense and Security Forum.","ruling to unseat president park ,court ruling to unseat president ,the president impeachment however ,impeachment of park in december ,ruling to unseat president","[""the Constitutional Court 's"", 'Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Park', 'Park', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'South Korea', 'Woo Jung - yeop', 'the Sejong Institute', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', ""South Korea 's"", 'China', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'Beijing', 'south korean', 'North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'China', 'Japan', 'US', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tillerson', 'Seoul', 'asian', 'Donald Trump', 'Japan', 'China', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Chang Yong - seok', ""Seoul National University 's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies"", 'Yang Wook', 'the Korea Defense and Security Forum']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11957505  0.20737666

In the last few months, many parts of Myeong-dong have been engulfed in the eerie atmosphere. At the height of the tourism boom, the district was filled with foreign tourists, many of whom came from China. The number of Chinese travelers, however, has dropped, stoking fear among shop owners in the posh shopping area, whose rents are the highest in the country. The business community in Myeong-dong and other popular tourist sites in Seoul are bracing for another blast, something worse than a mere drop in the number of Chinese tourists. In retaliation for the deployment of the THAAD system in Korea, the Chinese authorities ordered its travel agencies to stop offering packages to Seoul and other Korean destinations, and the ban is set to take effect on March 15. The staff of cosmetics stores stand idle at the shopping district in Myeong-dong, downtown Seoul. “I’m losing my job, completely out of the blue,” Uhm Sung-won, who worked as a tour guide for Chinese tour groups for five years, told The Korea Herald. “All reservations in March are already canceled. And I’m not prepared to leave.”The current woes in Myeong-dong, sparked by the THAAD deployment, are leaving shop owners with few options while Korea’s political and diplomatic leadership has been crippled with the impeachment trial of President Park Geun-hye over the influence-peddling scandal linked to her confidante Choi Soon-sil and the Samsung Group.The number of Chinese visitors to Korea began to increase in 2013, when it outnumbered visitors from Japan for the first time in history. A wide range of businesses rode the dramatic boom, serving Chinese tourists, encompassing street stalls, lodging facilities, apparel shops, cosmetic stores, restaurants and duty-free shops. But the bubble burst in the second half of 2016, and a severe downdraft is set to hit the district again in a week. “There is no alternative left for us,” said Yoo Ho-ja, who works at a guest house near Myeong-dong subway station. More than 70 percent of visitors to the lodging facility, established in 2014, came from China. Yoo pointed at an abandoned white building in the same block out of a window from her office and said a new hotel is about to appear in the worn-out building. “Although customers are on the decline , more and more hotels are sprouting up around this place,” Yoo said. “If this trend continues, it will be a big concern.”An owner of a Korean barbecue eatery stand, who declined to be identified, said that group travelers from China have been crucial for his business. “Seven out of 10 customers are from the Chinese tour groups,” he said. “And we are about to lose them.”A Lotte duty-free store in Myeong-dong appears emptier than usual. It is usually one of the most crowded spots in the central Seoul shopping zone. It is also feared that the travel ban will impact the duty-free shops in Myeong-dong. Some 70 percent of Lotte Duty Free’s income, the nation’s top duty-free shop operator, is estimated to come from Chinese travelers. Especially in the main branch in Myeong-dong, more than 80 percent of its 3.16 trillion won  of annual sales came from Chinese tourists.“We would have to watch the market for at least a month, since the travel ban has not been implemented yet,” Choi Ji-hyun, PR official of Lotte Duty Free, told The Korea Herald. “But we have to say that we are worried.”Some shop owners in Myeong-dong said their income halved over the past few months. Since mid-2016, the Korean government and the media have denounced China’s action to curb cultural exchanges between the two nations, calling it “retaliation” against the deployment of THAAD in Korea.Gwangjang Market, another spot frequented by Chinese tourists located in Dongdaemun, Seoul, is also bracing for a knock-on effect from China’s travel ban.“Since issues regarding THAAD deployment splashed the headline, things here were quite bad,” Kim Sun-ja, who has been running a Korean blood sausage restaurant for 30 years in Gwangjang Market. “We are losing daytime customers.”“Our sales dropped by half, but it is fair enough for now,” said Ji Young-joon, owner of a nut shop, 80 percent of whose customers are from China. “Still, I am concerned about the future.”Chinese visitors to South Korea at the tourist sites had mixed feelings about the THAAD row. Yi Ling, a Chinese student at Kyung Hee University spotted in Gwangjang Market, said that the THAAD deployment is a “sensitive issue,” but said that travels and the THAAD issue are separate matters.A Chinese part-time employee at a street stand in Myeong-dong, who identified himself only by his surname Liu, said China’s action is normal in terms of seeking national interest. “Every country seeks for its own interest,” Liu said. “China is imposing a travel ban to protect itself. Korea would do the same if it was the other way around.”Life-size figures of the members of boy band EXO are displayed at a shopping alley in Myeong-dong. As China ratchets up its retaliation against Korea over the missile defense system, uncertainty is likely to increase for shop operators. But some owners remain optimistic. “I hope the pain would not last long, because I believe the government will tackle this issue soon,” Yoo at the lodging facility said.Other shop operators said the bitter relationship between Korea and China would soon settle down, as the tourist attraction has weathered a series of troubles over the past decades.“We are not planning to lay off clerks speaking Chinese nor change business tactics,” said Lim Myeong-sun, a shop manager at clothing brand Teenie Weenie that suffered a 40 percent cut in sales recently in Myeong-dong. “Remember, here we are in Myeong-dong.”Kim Hong-chul, selling octopus barbecue at a snack stall in Myeong-dong, is one of those who seeks alternatives on their own. Kim said he began learning new languages to draw more tourists. “I’ve been recently studying languages from Southeastern Asia,” said the 40-something seller, who saw a rapid decline in the number of Chinese customers in the wake of the Lunar New Year’s Day this year. “Customers are changing, so I have to study to prepare for it.”Fewer people are using the information kiosks at the currency exchange desks in Myeong-dong these days, with the number of users dropping sharply. Korea’s central and regional governments vowed to reduce the local tourism industry’s overdependence on Chinese tourists by reaching out to neighboring Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In an emergency meeting held at Seoul City Hall on Tuesday, the Korea Tourism Organization and other tourism-affiliated industries discussed countermeasures against China’s ban on travel to Korea. At the meeting, officials discussed ways to increase the number of Japanese tourists, from 1.2 million last year to 3.5 million this year. In addition, they would focus on drawing in more individual Chinese tourists to fill in the void left by the absence of Chinese group tours. But whether individual Chinese tourists would come remains uncertain, and shop owners are well aware of such uncertainty. “It seems individual Chinese tourists would also refrain from visiting Seoul out of fear that they might be given a penalty,” the tour guide Uhm said.

In recent months, China has taken a number of unreasonable steps against South Korean businesses in apparent retaliation for Seoul's hosting of the system. Sen. John McCain  ""Unfortunately yet predictably, China responded to the arrival of THAAD with vague threats against the United States and South Korea. In recent months, China has waged a campaign of diplomatic bullying and economic coercion against South Korea in an attempt to stop the deployment of THAAD,"" Sen. John McCain  said in a statement.""But the reality is that this missile defense system is only necessary because China has aided and abetted North Korea for decades. If China has genuine concerns about the deployment of THAAD in South Korea, it should cease its attempts to undermine South Korea's sovereign ability to defend itself and use its considerable influence to pressure North Korea to stop its destabilizing behavior,"" he said.McCain also welcomed this week's arrival of THAAD elements, saying the North's missile launches earlier this week were a reminder of the grave threat North Korea poses and demonstrate the ""wisdom and necessity"" of the decision to deploy THAAD.Sen. Tom Cotton  said China shouldn't have a say over what the US does to protect itself.""Beijing does not dictate to the United States what we can and cannot do to protect ourselves and our allies,"" he said in a statement.

The conservative parties, including the ruling Liberty Korea Party, hailed the surprise move, while the liberal opposition strongly protested against it. “We welcome the quick decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here as North Korea has constantly threatened the security of South Korea and neighboring countries, with the latest such action being Monday’s test-firing of four ballistic missiles,” Rep. Kim Sung-won, the spokesperson for the Liberty Korea Party, said in a statement. Presidential hopefuls of the splinter conservative Bareun Party also praised the ministry’s bold decision. Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who has been advocating the anti-missile defense system, urged that the deployment be completed before the next presidential election, which may come as early as May. Another presidential hopeful, Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil of the same party, echoed Yoo’s view. The liberal parties and its presidential aspirants, on the other hand, cried foul over the move, stressing a prudent approach as it involves issues such as a possible breach of the Korean Constitution and economic retaliation from China. The leading presidential hopeful of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, Moon Jae-in, stressed that any plans related to the THAAD system should be made by the next administration. “I do not understand why the government is proceeding with the THAAD deployment now,” he told reporters after an election camp meeting. “The forthcoming administration could have used it as diplomatic leverage.” The entire deployment process would take more time to be finished before the upcoming presidential election, Moon added. South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung and Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung of the same party also denounced the government for quickly proceeding with the deployment without any discussion or explanation. The opposition parties also viewed it as a violation of the Constitution, saying acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who is substituting for President Park Geun-hye, “ignored the opinions in the National Assembly,” which is a constitutional institute. The Democratic Party added Hwang is abusing his power to decide on an important issue of national security, in the absence of the president. Park, who was impeached by the National Assembly on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal, is currently suspended of her presidential power and is awaiting the Constitutional Court’s decision on her ouster. If the court rules to remove her from office, the nation has to elect a new leader within 60 days.The missile defense system has long been a key political agenda in Korea, as parties across the aisle hold conflicting views on it. After President Park Geun-hye announced the deployment of the THAAD system last July, the administration was harshly hit by opponents who called it a “hasty decision.” In February, Defense Minister Han Min-koo and his US counterpart James Mattis agreed to complete the deployment “promptly” in a phone conversation.By Jo He-rim","upcoming presidential election moon ,korean constitution and economic retaliation ,anti missile system tuesday revealing ,presidential election moon added south ,the upcoming presidential election moon","['South Korea ’s', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'US', 'China', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Kim Sung - won', 'the Liberty Korea Party', 'Bareun Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Yoo', 'China', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'South Chungcheong', 'an Hee - jung', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'the Democratic Party', 'Hwang', 'the National Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'US', 'James Mattis', 'Jo He - rim']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2987715   0.46984056

Residents of Seoul, regardless of their nationality, are eligible to apply for the “Arts on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens” project, which will run from April through June. Participants of last year’s “Arts on Seoul’s streets Found by Citizens” project pose for a photo at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul. The selected 150 participants will undergo mandatory weekly education on public art theories before embarking on a mission to find and promote the hidden artistic gems of Seoul in groups of 10. Each group will be joined by field experts and art connoisseurs. Their discoveries will be shared via the city’s official social media channels.Once the field work is complete, the participants will vote for the most beautiful public art item and will be asked to make suggestions on ways to promote Seoul’s art scene. In its second year, the project is part of the municipal government’s efforts to enhance the city’s artistic appeal through a greater variety of culture, architecture and street art. “We hope Seoul will serve as an artistic city for tourists,” said Byun Tae-soon, Seoul City’s design policy division head. Compared to cities famous for iconic and popular landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty in Manhattan and the 3-ton bronze sculpture Charging Bull on Wall Street, Seoul lacks memorable art and landmarks, city officials say. In 2015, the Seoul Metropolitan Government allocated about 700 million won  to increase the city’s public art assets to make them on par with those around the world. It recently announced a plan to build more landmarks in Seoul, starting with the April opening of an urban sky garden dubbed “Seoul-lo 7017.”Those interested in the Arts on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens project can sign up at http://sculture.seoul.go.kr/archives/78014.

Lee was arrested earlier in the month for alleged bribery related to the merger of two of Samsung's affiliates involving impeached President Park Geun-hye. Lee was indicted Tuesday on a string of charges, including bribery and embezzlement. He has been in custody since last month. The special probe team suspects that Lee gave or promised some 43.3 billion won  in kickbacks to Park's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the government's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. The business merger was seen as critical to the smooth management succession of the group from ailing Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.Four other senior executives at Samsung -- Vice Chairman Choi Gee-sung and President Chang Choong-ki from the group's future planning headquarters and President Park Sang-jin and senior executive Hwang Sung-soo from the electronics giant -- will also undergo trial without detention.It is unclear whether the defendants will appear in court, as it is not mandatory for them to attend a preparatory hearing.","samsung affiliates involving impeached president ,hye lee was indicted tuesday ,corruption scandal involving president park ,involving impeached president park geun ,of samsung affiliates involving impeached","['Seoul', ""Samsung Group 's"", 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Samsung', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Samsung', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'Samsung', 'Choi Gee - sing', 'Chang Choong - ki', 'Park Sang - jin', 'Hwang Sung - soo']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.04370512 0.51257277 0.31624323]

The US side floated the idea at the talks of the chief nuclear negotiators of South Korea, the US and Japan in Washington, during which they reviewed and coordinated responses to the Feb. 13 assassination in Malaysia of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, as well as a recent test of a new mid-range ballistic missile. Kim Hong-kyun , South Korea's chief envoy on North Korea issues, poses for a photo with his US and Japanese counterparts, Joseph Yun  and Kenji Kanasugi , during a meeting in Washington on Feb. 27, 2017. The incident sparked global furor after Malaysian authorities announced VX, a nerve agent banned under international law, was used to kill him. “The US has been looking into the issue since it lifted North Korea from the list in 2008, but I’ve learned that it began considering relisting due to the assassination of Kim Jong-nam,” the official told reporters after the meeting. Calls have been growing for the redesignation as the communist state spurs its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of international resolutions. Washington blacklisted the North in 1988 following its midair bombing of a Korean Air passenger plane, killing all 115 aboard, but removed it from the list in 2008 as nuclear negotiations got under way. Any return to the list would make Pyongyang subject to further sanctions on trade, investment, assistance, financial transactions and other engagement with the outside world. A bipartisan bill calling for the blacklisting has already been proposed to the US House Foreign Affairs Committee. But the possibility remains slim, as it requires meticulous proof of a state’s terror-related activities. “Our side underscored the killing was a serious breach of international norms given a banned chemical weapon was employed, and the international community should respond strongly to this as it constituted a crime against humanity and human rights,“ said Kim Hong-kyun, special representative for the Korean Peninsula’s peace and security affairs at the Foreign Ministry here.VX is prohibited under the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. It is deemed one of the most lethal and fastest-acting substances in chemical warfare, far stronger than sarin.Since the murder, Seoul has been stepping up efforts to increase pressure on the Kim Jong-un regime and draw the international community’s stern responses, focusing on the suspected use of VX. South Korea’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, for his part, raised his voice on the issue at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, following his participation in the UN Human Rights Council meeting a day earlier. During the trilateral meeting, the nuclear envoys issued a statement lambasting Pyongyang’s “flagrant disregard” of UN Security Council resolutions warranting “strong international pressure on the regime.”While refraining from addressing the murder directly, they pointed to the North’s unabated violations of human rights and signaled the possibility for additional individual sanctions “The officials considered other possible measures under national authorities, including means to restrict further the revenue sources for North Korea’s weapons programs, particularly illicit activities,” the statement said.

Historians estimate there were up to 200,000 victims, mostly from Korea. This photo shows the girl statue outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. In April, the district council of Jongno will seek to pass an amendment to an ordinance to allow the district to designate monuments like the girl statue as public property. Under the amendment, local authorities will have direct control over managing the statue, including repairs.The revision is also expected to make it more difficult to remove the statue at a later date.""To relocate or remove the girl statue, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan will first have to be informed as the main group behind its construction, after which the district's urban space art committee will have to deliberate on it,"" an official said, referring to a civic group that advocates the rights and interests of Koreans victimized by Japan in the early half of the 20th century.Seoul and Tokyo have long locked horns over the sex slavery issue. In 2015, they struck a deal involving an apology from the Japanese government and monetary compensation for the victims, but it was widely rejected by the public.In January, Tokyo recalled its ambassador to Seoul in protest over another girl statue that was erected in front of the Japanese consulate in the southeastern city of Busan.

Upholding a lower court's decision, the Seoul High Court rejected Yoo's appeal and ruled in favor of the consulate's decision. The Seoul administrative court ruled in September 2016 that the singer's return and resumption of activities here could ""demoralize soldiers who are devoting themselves to serving the country and provoke youths into evading conscription.""""The visa issuance was rejected because there was already an entry ban levied on the plaintiff,"" the appeals court said. ""Unless the ban is nullified, we cannot say that there is a fault in rejecting the visa."" The 40-year-old singer's legal representative said they will review whether to again appeal the ruling.Yoo became a subject of intense public criticism after he was granted US citizenship in 2002, despite his previous promise to the public to fulfill his military duty. All able-bodied South Korean men must serve in the military for about two years. Attempts to avoid the conscription by young entertainers, as well as the offspring of the rich, are strongly criticized.Since being barred from entering South Korea, the singer has been active in China.","ban on korean american singer ,evade military conscription steve yoo ,korea after winning us citizenship ,thursday upheld the entry ban ,lawsuit against south korean consulate","['korean', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Steve Yoo', 'Yoo Seung - jun', 'south korean', 'the United States', ""South Korea 's"", 'Steve Yoo', 'Yoo Seung - jun', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Yoo', 'Seoul', 'US', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'China']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33497003  0.21118319

""The deal remains controversial, particularly in light of two statues of comfort women in South Korea, including one located in front of the Japanese Embassy,"" the CRS said in the report. ""The comfort women agreement and overall relations with Japan could become political flashpoints in the upcoming election in South Korea, a development that could hamper US-Japan-South Korea trilateral cooperation.""In the South's presidential election, ""more progressive candidates"" could target Park's outreach to Japan and reverse some of the initiatives that led to improved relations, including the signing of a bilateral military information sharing agreement, the CRS said.""A poor relationship between Seoul and Tokyo jeopardizes US interests by complicating trilateral cooperation on North Korea policy and on responding to China's rise,"" the report said. ""Tense relations also complicate Japan's desire to expand its military and diplomatic influence as well as the potential creation of an integrated US-Japan-South Korea ballistic missile defense system.""On security issues, the CRS report said that a lack of confidence in the US security guarantee could prod Japan to reconsider its own status as a non-nuclear weapons state and pursue nuclear weapons, which in turn could lead South Korea to follow suit.""As a presidential candidate Donald Trump in spring 2016 stated that he was open to Japan developing its own nuclear arsenal to counter the North Korean nuclear threat,"" the report said, adding that Japan would face a series of consequences, such as sanctions, if it decides to go nuclear.""If it were to develop its own nuclear weapons, including significant costs; reduced international standing in the campaign to denuclearize North Korea; the possible imposition of economic sanctions that would be triggered by leaving the global non-proliferation regime; and potentially encouraging South Korea to develop nuclear weapons capability,"" it said.Meanwhile, as in last year's report, this year's report continued to describe the body of water between South Korea and Japan as the ""Sea of Japan,"" rather than its original name the ""East Sea.""","impeachment of south korean president ,upcoming presidential election thus hampering ,presidential election thus hampering us ,seoul park impeachment threw into ,the south upcoming presidential election","[""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'US', 'the Congressional Research Service', 'Japan', 'US', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Busan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'CRS', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'Japan', 'CRS', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'US', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'US', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'CRS', 'US', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Donald Trump', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.56785673  0.22788195

In April 2015, Samsung reached an agreement with PyeongChang worth 100 billion won .Lee Hee-beom, head of the organizing committee for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, speaks at a press conference at Sapporo Convention Center in Sapporo, Japan, on the sidelines of the Asian Winter Games on Feb. 21, 2017. Samsung recently saw its de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, arrested over his alleged role in an influence-peddling scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. But Lee Hee-beom, the chief organizer for PyeongChang 2018, said the current situation at Samsung won't have any bearings on preparations for the Olympics.""Samsung has already committed to sponsoring the IOC and the PyeongChang organizing committee,"" Lee said at a press conference here in Sapporo, host of the Asian Winter Games. Lee led a PyeongChang delegation to the Japanese city this week to promote the first Winter Olympics in South Korea.""Even with the recent scandal, I don't think  will be affected,"" Lee Hee-beom continued. ""We already have the agreements, and Samsung has already donated and has agreed to sponsor . So I don't think it will be affected.""Lee Jae-yong has played a key role in the group's important business affairs since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalized in 2014.In addition to sponsoring PyeongChang, Samsung is the official Olympic partner in wireless communication equipment and computing equipment category. It became a TOP partner at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, and in August 2014, Samsung and the IOC extended their TOP partnership through the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games.With the PyeongChang Olympics under a year away, Lee Hee-beom said the city will accelerate its promotional efforts both at home and abroad.""I understand not many people are aware of PyeongChang,"" he said. ""Most Summer Olympics are hosted by metropolitan cities like Tokyo, Seoul and London. But most Winter Olympics are hosted by mountain clusters. But we're discussing with the IOC to have more international promotional activities from now on.""And since the next two Olympic Games will also stay in Asia -- the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing -- Lee said the organizing committees for the three cities have been actively discussing cooperation.""We've identified items to cooperate on and we'll produce a joint communique soon,"" Lee said. ""We're looking into exchanging information,  ambassadors and experts.

The city government said it was part of Seoul’s efforts to reduce the number of civil complaints about bad smells by 30 percent by 2018.In June last year, the city government vowed to inject 170 million won  to install malodor reduction devices.Malodor reduction devices, similar to air purification systems, work by injecting oxygen to prevent gas stored inside septic tanks from being released through manholes or inlets on streets. It costs approximately 2 million won to install such a device in a five-story building.By the end of last year, the city government completed installing the devices in areas frequented by visitors and tourists including Gwanghwamun and Myeong-dong.  YonhapMalodor is a major bugbear in metropolitan cities and considered a major form of pollution, along with light and noise.“We aim to continuously work on reducing bad smells in Seoul and create a pleasant living environment for all citizens,” said Kwon Ki-wook from Seoul City Hall’s Water Circulation Safety Bureau.The city will also create a so-called odor pollution city map to allow citizens to view the status of malodor complaints and installation of malodor reduction devices in the capital, Kwon added.In 2003, the government enacted the Malodor Prevention Act and defined malodor as “any odor that causes displeasure and disgust to people by stimulating their olfactory sense with hydrogen sulfide, mercaptane, amines, or other pungent substances.”Facilities that emit malodor can be legally required to pay for the cost of operating public malodor treatment facilities.","seoul metropolitan government said sunday ,reducing bad smells in seoul ,170 million won to install ,reduction devices in 10 more ,waste pipes the city government","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Myeong - dong', 'YonhapMalodor', 'Seoul', 'Kwon Ki - wook', 'Seoul City Hall ’s Water Circulation Safety Bureau', 'Kwon']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33940083  0.59098661

It is the first test-firing of a North Korean missile since Trump became US president on Jan. 20, and the country's first major provocation in 2017.""The missile launch is a clear violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. It is aimed at drawing attention from the international community, and showing off its nuclear and missile capabilities in protest against the new U.S. government,"" Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message. The JCS, however, said the latest missile did not appear to be an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U. mainland.The projectile, presumed to be an intermediate-range Musudan ballistic missile or a mid-range Rodong missile, flew about 500 kilometers before splashing into its eastern sea after being launched around 7:55 a.m. from Banghyon air base in the western province of North Pyongan Province, the JCS said. The relative short range has local experts speculating the projectile could be a Musudan or a similar rocket designed to test engines for an ICBM.""Seoul and Washington are conducting a joint analysis on additional information to determine if the missile is a modified Musudan missile or the shorter range Rodong missile,"" it said. The missile's flight distance of 500 km is shorter than the Musudan's estimated range of around 3,000 km.The Banghyon air base is the same place where North Korea test-fired Musudan missiles on Oct. 15 and 20. Last year, the North tested a total of eight Musudan missiles believed to be capable of reaching the US territory of Guam. In the one ""successful"" Musudan launch to date, the missile flew some 400 km, well short of its maximum range, but the flight distance was because the North fired the missile at a high angle in order to avoid breaching Japan's airspace. Back then, the Pentagon confirmed after the launch that the missile reached an altitude exceeding 1,000 kilometers.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his annual New Year's address that the country's preparations for launching an ICBM have ""reached the final stage."" The remark was seen as an apparent threat that Pyongyang was close to acquiring the know-how to strike the continental United States.In response to the ICBM threat, Trump pledged last month to stop the North from mastering such ICBM capabilities, saying that the North's development of a nuclear missile capable of striking the US ""won't happen,"" though he didn't say how he would prevent it. There were earlier reports that the North had placed two unidentified missiles on mobile launchers for apparent test-firing. Meanwhile, the Japanese government confirmed the North's missile test and South Korea's presidential office called a national security meeting. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reportedly said the missile launched by Pyongyang didn't hit Japanese waters.  South Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said at a meeting convened in Seoul that the country will make a ""corresponding"" response to punish Pyongyang for its latest missile launch in tandem with the international community.","korea on sunday fired ballistic ,north korean missile since trump ,north korea on sunday fired ,the icbm threat trump ,pyongyang for its latest missile","['North Korea', 'Donald Trump', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Trump', 'US', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'JCS', 'Musudan', 'Banghyon', 'North Pyongan Province', 'JCS', 'Musudan', 'ICBM.""Seoul', 'Washington', 'Musudan', 'Musudan', 'Banghyon', 'North Korea', 'Musudan', 'Musudan', 'US', 'Guam', 'Musudan', 'Japan', 'Pentagon', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'United States', 'icbm', 'Trump', 'US', 'japanese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'Yoshihide Suga', 'Pyongyang', 'japanese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang']",13,"[ 0.          2.          3.         ... -0.36477801  0.50489372

Ban was named Humanitarian of the Year by the Harvard Foundation in 2014 for his “remarkable leadership at the United Nations.” “ has not yet made up his mind, but the school suggested that he may join whenever he pleases,” Lee said.The school renewed its invitation in January, after Ban completed his two consecutive terms as UN chief officially on Dec. 31. The offer, however, was shelved, as Ban returned home to Korea to explore launching a presidential bid.After 20 days of a hectic schedule in what appeared to be the run-up to an election campaign, Ban suddenly declared he would not run on Feb. 1.His dropout came amid falling poll numbers, as well as his stance gap with conventional political power groups, especially the conservative camp that sought to recruit Ban as a presidential candidate.After some days out of public sight, the former top diplomat left for Kenya on Thursday to visit his second daughter, Hyun-hee, an employee at UNICEF, and son-in-law Siddharth Chatterjee, head of the United Nations Population Fund in Kenya.

North Korea carried out a string of provocations last year, including two nuclear tests and a number of ballistic missile launches. But the regime in Pyongyang has not carried out any such provocations since November's US presidential election.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's Day address that the country is close to test-firing an intercontinental ballistic missile apparently capable of striking the US and two ICBMs were later readied on mobile launchers, but they were ultimately put back into hiding.Many experts saw that as a sign that the regime might have opted to wait out until the Trump administration puts together its North Korea policy. Other experts say the North is exercising restraint to avoid galvanizing conservatives in South Korea ahead of a presidential election.","presidential election north korean leader ,premature to discuss trump policy ,korea ahead of presidential election ,us presidential election north korean ,thursday warned north korea not","['US', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Pyongyang', 'Trump', 'Reuters', 'the White House', 'North Korea', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'US', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'US', 'Trump', 'North Korea', 'South Korea']",13,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.74977177  0.83431166

That underscores the seriousness and urgency with which the retired Marine Corps general takes the threats from North Korea, as well as the importance of the alliances with South Korea and Japan in dealing with the provocative regime.US Secretary of Defense James Mattis More than anything else, the trip is aimed at reassuring the key allies unsettled by US President Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric accusing them of free-riding on US security commitments, though Trump has significantly toned it down since the election and has talked increasingly about the importance of alliances.""Considering the fact that North Korea could test a long-range missile in the very near future, Secretary Mattis must find a way to make it clear to his counterparts in South Korea that Washington will not only honor its treaty commitments, but that there is no daylight between Washington and Seoul,"" said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, formerly known as the Nixon Center.""Sending James Mattis certainly is a very clear signal that Washington is committed to South Korea's defense, now and in the future,"" he said.In Seoul, Mattis will hold talks with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo.Earlier this week, the two spoke by phone, during which Mattis reaffirmed the ""US commitment to defend the ROK and provide extended deterrence using the full range of US capabilities,""according to the Pentagon.Mattis also told Han that the US will ""stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the ROK forces"" and the two sides agreed to take steps to strengthen the alliance further to defend against the evolving North Korean threat,"" according to the Pentagon.According to officials in Seoul, Mattis and Han also reaffirmed the planned deployment of the US THAAD missile defense system in South Korea this year to defend against North Korean missile threats. China has denounced the upcoming deployment as detrimental to its security, despite repeated assurances from Washington and Seoul that the system is purely defensive.During his confirmation hearing last month, Mattis said the North's nuclear and missile development is ""a serious threat and we've got to do something about it."" Asked if ""necessary force should be on the table"" to deal with the threat, Mattis said, ""I don't think we should take anything off the table.""He is a strong advocate of alliances.In a message to Pentagon employees shortly after his confirmation, Mattis vowed to work closely with the State Department to strengthen our alliances, saying he recognizes ""no nation is secure without friends."" During the confirmation hearing, Mattis also said the US is ""stronger when we uphold our treaty obligations.""Other topics that could come up during Mattis' talks with Han include defense cost-sharing.Trump pledged on the campaign trail to have wealthy allies like South Korea and Japan shoulder more of the cost of American troops stationed in the countries, saying the US should prepared to withdraw the troops unless the allies agreed to pay more.Trump has toned down the campaign rhetoric since the election.Still, he spoke critically in his inauguration address of spending money to help defending allies, saying the US has ""subsidized the armies of other countries"" and ""defended other nations' borders.""Mattis also said during his confirmation hearing that while the US fulfills its treaty obligations, he expects ""our allies and partners to uphold their obligations as well."" Incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in his confirmation hearing that the US ""cannot look the other way at allies that do not meet their obligations."" About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Joseph Dunford that Washington deploy strategic assets, including nuclear-capable bombers and aircraft carriers, on the Korean Peninsula this year. “Gen. Lee stressed the need for enhanced US extensive deterrence to prevent North Korea’s provocation,” the JCS said in a statement, noting that Pyongyang would attempt provocations around Feb. 16, the birthday of late leader Kim Jong-il, or this March, when the allies conduct combined military exercises.Chairman of the JCS Gen. Lee Sun-jin is on the phone with US counterpart Gen. Joseph Dunford A permanent stationing of US strategic assets on the peninsula has been brought up by Seoul since Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests last year. Among the assets suggested are the B-1B strategic bomber and Nimitz-class supercarrier USS Carl Vinson Strike Group, which is expected to participate in the Key Resolve military exercise between the two countries next month. But the former Barack Obama administration appeared skeptical about the permanent deployment in the face of budget restrictions and possible strategic repercussions. The new Donald Trump administration is likely to be even more hesitant, given the president’s call for allies to pay a greater share of defense costs.With the South Korean military’s constant request for the assets’ stationing, Seoul and Washington instead launched a vice-ministerial consultative body last year, the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group, through which they will continue discussions over ways to better execute the US defense commitment. Earlier in the day, the US Pacific Air Forces Command said it will deploy 12 F-16 fighter planes to South Korea this month, a first routine deployment of strategic assets since the inauguration of Trump late last month. “About 200 airmen and 12 F-16 Fighting Falcons with the 119th Fighter Squadron from Atlantic City Air National Guard Base, New Jersey, are set to deploy in February to Osan Air Base,” the command said on its website.Since 2004, the US Pacific Air Forces has deployed a unit, such as of fighter jets, to the peninsula. Currently, there are about 60 F-16s stationed here. The deployment is part of its “theater security packages,” which help maintain a deterrent against threats to regional security and stability, said the command.

Vehicles will be banned in such areas and the city government can fine those who drive there -- a first in the country.Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon “ will not only restore the overpass, but become a catalyst for the revival and regeneration of neighboring regions through the high number of visitors,” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said. In 2012, Park pledged to transform the old overpass into a pedestrian park and create more pedestrian-friendly streets in the city, with the aim of boosting neighboring markets and preserving decades-old heritage. Since then, the city has so far established 20 crosswalks, 42 pedestrian-only streets and formed eight pedestrian-only zones, such as Yonsei-ro and Dehak-ro. Eight overpasses are awaiting removal starting this year. Touted as a rival to New York’s High Line Park, the green pedestrian park-turned-overpass Seoul-lo 7017 will stretch for about a kilometer and link seven surrounding areas including Seoul Station, Namdaemun Market and neighboring buildings to some 17 pedestrian walkways that feature 254 types of trees, shrubs and flowers from inside and outside Korea. There will also be performance stages, cafes, a library of plants, flower shops and street markets.The “70” in the name Seoul-lo 7017 refers to the year 1970 when the Seoul Station flyover was constructed, while 17 is a reference to the number of walkways connected to it and the year 2017 when its construction is to be completed.City officials also said it will complete construction in Jongno to extend bus-only lanes and reorganize walkways by the latter half of this year.When this is completed, nearly 2.8 kilometers of road in Jongno will have at least 10 meter-wide bus-only lanes. Ventilation openings and other installations will also be removed from the pedestrian zone.“By building more bus-only lanes and reorganizing the environment for crosswalks, it will be able to provide joy to people who walk in the area and keep traffic convenient for citizens, along with a cleaner townscape,” said Kim Jun-ki, an official from Seoul City’s public safety division.By Kim Da-sol","seoul metropolitan government announced wednesday ,pedestrian park turned overpass seoul ,the new garden dubbed seoul ,seoul mayor park won soon ,visitors seoul mayor park","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul Station', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'Jongno', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Park', 'Yonsei', 'New York ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Station , Namdaemun Market', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Jongno', 'Jongno', 'Kim Jun - ki', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44125432  0.29917857

Nearly half of all confirmed MERS cases were traced to the SMC. “We organized and presented our opinion to the ministry, but it does not mean that we agree or disagree with the ministry’s order,” the SMC official told the Korea Herald.President Park Geun-hye visits a medical facility during the MERS outbreak in May 2015 A ministry official, however, said a vast part of the documents appear to be intended at refuting the ministry’s view and defending the medical center’s response to the epidemic. The SMC was at the epicenter of the MERS outbreak in 2015. Out of a total of 186 MERS patients in South Korea that year, nearly half were infected either directly or indirectly via the SMC. Some 6,000 people were quarantined nationwide until the nation was declared MERS-free at the end of the year, almost eight months after the first case was reported.   According to the ministry, a patient, later found to be a “super-spreader” of the virus, transmitted the disease to at least 80 people at the SMC, before being diagnosed and quarantined. Critics, however, say both sides are to blame.  “The SMC, which detected the first case, made a serious mistake and failed to prevent the spread of the virus. But it was the ministry’s decision not to reveal to the public the list of hospitals with MERS cases,” said a medical industry insider who wished to be unnamed. During the early stages of the outbreak, the ministry blocked the Korean Hospital Association’s disclosure of a list of hospitals that treated MERS patients, including the SMC, for no clear reason. The ministry later explained that it was to prevent unnecessary public confusion. The SMC is known as one of the finest medical facilities in the country led by a former head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases.The Chairman of Samsung Group Lee Kun-hee has been hospitalized at the SMC, in a 20th-floor VIP room, since he suffered a heart attack in 2014.By Kim Da-sol","deadly virus in 2015 samsung ,virus in 2015 samsung medical ,suffered heart attack in 2014 ,ministry blocked the korean hospital ,of deadly virus in 2015","['South Korea ’s', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park Geun', 'SMC', 'South Korea', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'the Korean Hospital Association ’s', 'SMC', 'SMC', 'the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases', 'Samsung Group', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'SMC', 'Kim Da - sol']",17,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.11705971 0.48539925 0.06419946]

Kim Jong-un During the past three months, several of the access roads have been re-graded and laid with gravel, suggesting preparation to handle missiles heavier than the Musudan IRBM like an ICBM, and a small 11-by-11-meter pad has been graded and gravel laid, he said.In addition, the second launch position appears to have been regraded, although it remains unpaved, which when complete, would allow for simultaneous launches of ballistic missiles. New ground scarring a short distance from the firing positions suggests the intention to install two telemetry or camera positions, perhaps for monitoring a long-range missile test, he said.The site has been designed and previously used to test Musudan missiles, which is also a road-mobile missile like the ICBM the North is preparing to launch, and can easily be supported by the infrastructure of the nearby Kalma airport, the expert said.Moreover, like previous failed Musudan tests, a catastrophic failure of an ICBM would not impact North Korean soil, he said.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's Day address that the regime has entered the final stage of preparations to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile, an apparent threat the North is close to developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the continental US.Officials in Seoul said last week that South Korea and the United States have picked up signs that the North placed the two missiles, less than 15 meters long, on mobile launchers in an indication that Pyongyang could carry out a threatened ICBM test earlier than expected.","military expert recent commercial satellite ,north korea military expert recent ,launches of ballistic missiles new ,test fire an intercontinental ballistic ,korea military expert recent commercial","['North Korea', 'US', 'Kalma', 'Wonsan', 'Musudan', 'icbm', 'Joseph Bermudez', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'icbm', 'Bermudez', 'Kim Jong - un', 'musudan', 'Kalma', 'Musudan', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Pyongyang']",13,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.23494485  0.6086728

He stressed South Korea badly needs strategic thinking in its relations with allies and neighbors, and the country should avoid getting involved in unnecessary disputes to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. “We have to wait until this June or July to gauge Trump’s policy. Until then, there will be harsh rhetoric going back and forth. But I don’t think there would be landscape changes in terms of Trump’s policy toward North Korea and China,” said Choi, a professor in political science and international studies at Yonsei University, in an interview with The Korea Herald. “The conventional wisdom is that the US will press China over currency manipulation and unfair trade,” he said of Trump’s election pledge to fix US trade policies with China. “But after all, the US would need more money to boost the economy. To do that, they will issue more bonds and need China to purchase them.”   Some experts here expect that Trump, sworn into office Friday, will shift from his predecessor’s “strategic patience” policy and adopt a new initiative toward Pyeongyang, which has beefed up its nuclear capability despite US-led economic sanctions. “It will be pretty much the same as what  Obama did. People in Washington believe there will be no major breakthrough unless the North makes serious progress on denuclearization,” Choi said. The Trump administration is widely expected to seek renegotiation of the almost 5-year-old Korea-US Free Trade Agreement in their favor and demand more contributions from Seoul to the alliance’s defense spending during bilateral talks scheduled for 2018.  Choi said South Korea needs to take a quid pro quo approach to any possible renegotiation with the US, stressing that Seoul, too, can make certain demands -- enhanced transparency for example -- in return for any concession.  “I think we can take on a larger burden in defense spending. In return, we should ask for more transparency over the money coming from our taxpayers. After all, an alliance is interdependent and it is an agreement between two democracies,” Choi said. For South Korea to better position itself in its ties with the United States or any other country, the professor emphasized a “strategic mindset” among South Korean officials to be more pragmatic and flexible in finding ways to maximize national interestFurthermore, he advised South Korea to capitalize on its standing as a free trade agreement hub -- Seoul is the only economy in Northeast Asia that has signed free trade agreements with both China and the US -- and to stay away from maritime disputes in the South China Sea, an issue that he saw as unrelated to Seoul’s crucial interest. “The worst possible situation for us would be that we are stuck between the US and China and being presented with a question like ‘Which side are you on?’ The second-worst scenario is that we find ourselves being involved in an issue that hardly relates to us,” he said. The professor also noted that while the massive political scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye and her confidante has undermined Seoul’s diplomatic credibility, the reaction of the South Korean public to it has shown the world that the country is a resilient democracy able to fix dysfunctional politics. President Park was impeached in late December after weeks of massive street protests. “The scandal has sent a bad signal that Seoul’s foreign policy could have been influenced by an irrational actor. … But I think the candlelight protests  showed the resilience of Korea’s democracy. It showed the world that the Korean public can fix their problems in a peaceful and coherent manner,” he said.By Yeo Jun-suk","trump election pledge to fix ,fix dysfunctional politics president park ,political scandal surrounding president park ,july to gauge trump policy ,korea badly needs strategic thinking","['Trump', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North ’s', 'Choi Jong - kun', 'northeast asian', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Trump ’s', 'Trump ’s', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Choi', 'Yonsei University', 'the Korea Herald', 'US', 'China', 'Trump ’s', 'US', 'China', 'US', 'China', 'trump', 'Pyeongyang', 'US', 'Washington', 'Choi', 'Trump', 'Korea - US Free Trade Agreement', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'South Korea', 'US', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'China', 'US', 'Seoul', 'US', 'China', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27671257  0.59168589

Appointed by President Barack Obama as his top envoy in Seoul in October 2014, he was returning home in time for Donald Trump's inauguration slated for Friday .  US Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert ""Time is of the essence. This is a region where geopolitical, security and economic challenges are real and significant. The relationship and the alliance need to get stronger and stronger over time, and that would be my advice to anyone who manages this alliance between the two countries,"" he added.Lippert reaffirmed that the US and South Korea are maintaining very strong ties.""The alliance at this point of time is in the best shape it has been in history, and that gives you a very strong foundation. The alliance now has strong institutional mechanisms to drive dynamic change and to keep the alliance adaptable but also to manage differences of opinions,"" he said. ""There is also almost endless opportunity for our future cooperation in more traditional areas like security or the economy but new areas -- energy environment, cyberspace. So the cooperative opportunities are there for the taking ... and that gives me a reason for optimism,"" he added. Asked what will be the most memorable things during his stay here, he cited having two kids here and giving them Korean names.He also cherished ""little things"" that he could experience, including Korean food and people in traditional markets. Lippert has been credited with his efforts to actively engage with the South Korean people, which helped him earn the recognition of being one of the most beloved American ambassadors ever. His tenure here has also been marked by the surprise knife attack in 2015 during an early morning public gathering in Seoul.In response to a question about what advice he would give to his successor, he underlined the importance of getting close to Korean people to better understand their life besides carrying out his or her main obligation to strengthen alliance between the two countries. ""Advice for success?

A top standing executive of the Federation of Korean Industries -- Vice Chairman Lee Seung-cheol -- made the testimony, appearing as a witness at Choi’s trial at the Seoul District Court. Vice Chairman Lee Seung-cheol of the Federation of Korean Industries enters a courtroom in Seoul to testify as a witness at Choi Soon-sil's trial, Jan. 19, 2017. The FKI, which represents some 600 local businesses here, is suspected of assisting Choi in her fundraising for two nonprofit foundations -- K-Sports and Mir. The entities, believed to have been established and controlled by Choi, are suspected to be covers for channeling money and contracts to her private business interests. “We followed the instruction of An  who told me over the phone to help establish cultural and sport foundations of a 30 billion-won fund scale,” Lee said at the hearing. “An said it was the president’s order.” An Chong-bum is Park’s former secretary, and is standing trial with Choi for abuse of authority and extortion with regard to the donations, totaling 77.4 billion won, from over 50 local businesses to Choi’s foundations.  President Park has been named by state prosecutors as an accomplice to Choi and An, and has been suspended from work by the parliament on Dec. 9. She is now standing an impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court.The prosecutors allege that Lee Seung-cheol assisted Choi in creating the troubled foundations and funneling the funds from its member companies to the entities.  Special Counsel Park Young-soo, who is now investigating the alleged massive corruption surrounding the president and Choi, now suspects shady donation-for-favors arrangements between Park and the corporate contributors of Mir and K-Sports. The de facto chief of Samsung Group, Lee Jae-yong, is currently under investigation for the suspicion. The country’s largest conglomerate was the biggest of the 53 donors. FKI’s Lee stressed during the court hearing that his organization was under pressure from the presidential office, a victim rather than an accomplice to any crime. He also said that the lobby group was told to increase the fund amounts to 50 billion won and get more companies to donate, including South Korea’s largest internet service provider KT and leading cosmetics maker Amorepacific. The directive was also from Park, who saw the initial amount of 30 billion won as insufficient, Lee said. The FKI is now on the verge of collapsing.  Amid growing criticism, several key firms, including Samsung and LG have decided to end their membership of the group.  By Bak Se-hwan","courtroom in seoul to testify ,south korea largest business lobby ,corporate donations for choi soon ,korea largest business lobby group ,businesses to choi foundations president","['South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'Lee Seung - cheol', 'Choi ’s', 'Lee Seung - cheol', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'Seoul', 'FKI', 'Choi', 'K - Sports', 'Choi', 'Lee', 'Chong', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Park', 'Choi', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lee Seung - cheol', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Park', 'K - Sports', 'Samsung Group', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'FKI', 'Lee', 'South Korea ’s', 'KT', 'Amorepacific', 'Park', 'Lee', 'FKI', 'Samsung', 'LG', 'Bak Se - hwan']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01301927  0.37758774

The subjects of the survey -- the first of its kind here -- are 15-year-olds or 16-year-olds who enter eight science high schools here this year. The study will run through 2041 until they reach 40 or 41. “We have analyzed short-term data on the effect of special education for talented students, but have never conducted a follow-up survey for such a long period,” Cho Eui-jung, an administrative official of the Ministry of Education told The Korea Herald.  The Ministry of Education building in Sejong City, South KoreaWith the envisioned research, the ministry aims to analyze the effectiveness of the country’s specialized education programs and how their beneficiaries contribute to the society, she said. Korea introduced special education programs for talented students in 2002, amid growing calls to systematically train and nurture them from the early stage of education. In the first year, the number of students who qualified for special education was about 10,000, 1 percent of all primary, middle and high school students. But the figure had risen tenfold to 109,900 by 2015, according to the ministry data. The special education programs are also under scrutiny, with some saying it promotes private education spending on children by parents who wish to send their kids to the institutes. Others point out that many of the graduates from the programs end up pursuing lucrative jobs rather than further developing their respective special gifts, with many of them entering medical colleges. Among the eight schools subject to the government body’s upcoming long-term survey are the Seoul Science High School and Korea Science Academy of KAIST, an affiliate school of the country’s leading science and engineering university, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The participants of the research will be surveyed for the next 25 years under the consent of their parents, on the development process of their specific talents, external influences that affect the process, their academic achievements in higher education and their careers after college.

Critics have also said the deal fails to highlight Tokyo's ""legal"" -- not moral -- responsibility for the sexual slavery.Seoul, however, said that Tokyo's agreement to provide the funding for the foundation from its state coffers -- not from private donations as it did in the past -- means its acknowledgment of the legal responsibility.In the contribution, Park also proposed setting up an Asian human rights tribunal based on an international treaty to deal with the cases of human rights violations that go beyond the national boundary like the comfort women issue. Seoul has long claimed that the sexual slavery case must be viewed from a broader angle of wartime human rights violations rather than being limited to an issue between the two neighboring countries.","sexual slavery seoul however said ,south korea constitutional court president ,2015 deal between seoul ,month constitutional court president park ,korea constitutional court president park","[""South Korea 's"", 'Constitutional Court', 'Park Han', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Research Secretariat', 'the Association of Asian Constitutional Courts', 'Constitutional Court', 'Park Han', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'asian', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4127022   0.33065638

And it does not have to be expensive. For Kim Ji-hyon, a 29-year-old office worker, growing a small garden on a windowsill at home has become a crucial part of her life over the past year. “When I water the plants and take care of them, it gives my brain a time-out from stressful office life,” said Kim, who visits wholesale flower markets almost every weekend. “It gives me a sense of achievement and stability that I am successfully growing something.”But there are more practical reasons to turn to indoor gardening, as houseplants make a fantastic addition to almost any interior at affordable prices.“I first bought plants to decorate my house last year. There is nothing like using houseplants as quick decorating tools,” said Kim, who now has some 15 big and small houseplants at home. Health-conscious Koreans are seeking to grow houseplants amid mounting worries over air pollution inside and outside homes, eyeing those that can clean the air indoors, raise the humidity level or reduce harmful effects of radio waves emitted by electronic devices. Lee Sun-mi, a 38-year-old teacher, is one of them.She began to grow plants at home in 2008 after she moved into a house located in front of a garbage incineration facility. Instead of buying electronic air purifiers, she put houseplants in her house to cleanse the air of pollutants, dusts and allergen in sealed environments.The home of Lee Sun-mi “As I have gotten more plants at home, I am less worried about the sick building syndrome and my nasal inflammation got much better, too,” said Lee, who has spent more than 1 million won so far creating her own indoor garden. “By looking at the plants bud and bloom, I also get mentally more stable.”The sick building syndrome is a phenomenon that affects building occupants who claim to experience acute health effects apparently linked to time spent indoors. Air pollution indoors is also known to heighten the risks of heart diseases, cancer and breathing problems, and numerous studies show the benefits of growing plants for human health. According to a 1989 Clean Air Study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, plants are effective at removing toxins from the air and alleviating the sick building syndrome associated with new, energy-efficient buildings. “The plant root-soil zone appears to be the most effective area for removing volatile organic chemicals. Therefore, maximizing air exposure to the plant root-soil area should be considered when placing plants in buildings for best air filtration,” the study said. Reflecting the health-conscious trend, Sanseveria Stuckyi and tillandsia, known to remove indoor pollutants, have been best-selling items for the past year in the country, a flower shop owner said.  Namdaemun Flower Market in central Seoul “As many Koreans keep their doors shut and live with indoor pollutants, they come to buy plants that can clean the air without much effort,” said Bang Min-hwa, who is in her 50s and runs the shop in Namdaemun Flower Market in central Seoul. “The plants are popular particularly among the young generation. Most of them seek houseplants that are hard to kill, easy to grow indoors and are not in need of much sunlight or water,” she added. A culture critic, Ha Jae-keun, said the growing trend of indoor gardening is attributed to Koreans in search of relaxation from the competitive urban life and rising interest in pursuing an eco-friendly life. “South Koreans started to rediscover the value of nature in search of healing and consolation as they got busier and mentally exhausted,” he said. “The increasing number of single households also contributes to the trend as they take more interest in doing something inside their homes such as decorating their homes and sharing such tips with others online.”By Ock Hyun-ju","flower markets almost every weekend ,office worker growing small garden ,year old office worker growing ,indoor gardening connects city dwellers ,gardening as houseplants make fantastic","['Kim Ji - hyon', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Lee Sun - mi', 'Lee Sun - mi', 'Lee', 'the National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Stuckyi', 'Namdaemun Flower Market', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'Bang Min - hwa', 'Namdaemun Flower Market', 'Seoul', 'Ha Jae - keun', 'Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69342864  0.41607934

They are almost identical, risk-free to a degree that it is almost no fun and they are not as often used as they should be by their target audience -- kids. “Children not only have the right to learn. They also have right to play,” the 57-year-old play advocate stressed during an interview with The Korea Herald. Pyun Hae-moon sits on a giant slide created with wooden boards by his children in front of his house in Andong. Aside from the problems of playground design, Korean kids are too busy to play, spending more time being transported by yellow minibuses from one hagwon to another until their parents get home in the evening. They are also more interested in computer games and mobile phone chatting than outdoor play, Pyun lamented. Korean kids do lead a busy life, a recent survey showed. More than 83 percent of 5-year-olds and 36 percent of 2-year-olds in South Korea receive private education, either by going to a hagwon or home tutoring. In some cases, 5-year-olds receive up to four hours of extra classes a day after their regular kindergarten program, revealed data released earlier this week by the Korea Institute of Child Care. A children’s book author and child education expert, Pyun has studied for the past 20 years the importance of play for children’s development and to create an ideal playground for them. To look for ideas, he traveled to many cities including Berlin, London and Tokyo. In his opinion, a playground should be a place where children have fun, learn how to make friends and freely explore the world. “Adults, specifically public officials, design and construct playgrounds in towns without a single chance of hearing children’s opinions. Isn’t it ironical that the main users of playgrounds are not ever heard?” Pyun asked.He also pointed out the problem of playground standardization in Korea. “Playgrounds should be for all children from kindergarten age to elementary school age. But as you can see, playgrounds in Korea look like they are just for kindergarten kids,” he said.In May last year, he made the maiden step toward his long-held goal of presenting kids with an alternative playground.His first “Miracle Playground,” in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province, bears no similarity to the ones already existing. It has no swings, seesaws or slides. Instead of rubber turf, which has become almost a norm for Korean playgrounds, the ground is filled with sand or covered with grass. Tree trunks and stones resemble how they would look in the wild. Children can climb and jump on them, strip a bark off a tree or even just roll down a grassy hill.An artist’s rendering of the Miracle Playground in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province. Since its opening, an average of 2,000 children and parents have visited the playground each week. In October, it was given an award for the country’s best public construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, for its creative and eco-friendly design.“Miracle Playground serves to allow children to play creatively and nurture the spirit of adventure, unlike normal playgrounds which all look the same,” said Pyun.He plans to build 10 more of them over the next five years. No risk, no fun When Pyun visited Northern European countries, he found that playgrounds there not only had varying designs and different kinds and sizes of play equipment, but they are frequented by fathers who bring their children out to play.“These fathers are called ‘Latte Papa,’ as they bring a cup of coffee and just wait until their children are done with playing, unlike in South Korea where mothers stick to their kids to teach them how to use the slide and where to step on the climbing wall,” he said. Pyun criticized many Korean parents as overly protective. Without realizing it, they often block their kids from any chance of exploring their world freely and nurturing an adventurous spirit. “Korean parents are typically very worried about all sorts of potential risks outside. But public playgrounds are the best place for children to learn about risks, like how to detect and overcome risks,” he said, stressing that children grow by experiencing healthy risks. Risks are different from hazards, he went on. “Risks are like passing through a shaking bridge and hazards are broken glass pieces on the ground. But parents sometimes mistake the two.” By crossing shaky bridges at playgrounds, children can learn to ask themselves, “Will it be safe to cross this bridge?” and learn to hold onto something that is stable. In European countries, such as the UK, playgrounds are required to include pre-designed “risk items,” Pyun said. The boom in such playgrounds started in the mid-1940s in Europe and 1970s in Japan, while the number of adventurous playgrounds around the globe has surged to over 1,300, mostly in Europe.Following the trend growing outside Korea, the Seoul Metropolitan Government for the first time in Seoul began test operating a new type of public playground called Adventure Park -- filled with wooden poles and hills -- in a Northeastern town in Dobong-gu last week.Just let them play freely Korean parents also need to redefine children’s play, said Pyun who has authored books on the topic including “Play is Food for Children.” Quoting Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, he said that parents should not approach children’s play with a certain purpose. Letting children play is not about helping them release mental stress or becoming smarter, more creative or any certain type of person. “It is rather a concept of freedom for children,” said Pyun, who is himself a father of two children. Many young parents trying to be “good parents” feel obliged to take their kids out to fun places and allow them to have educational experiences, such as amusement parks, exhibition halls and aquariums. “Remember that children do not find it fun only when they visit amusement parks or theme parks. Parents do not need to visit or create special spaces for playing, as children simply mimicking their mother’s cooking in the kitchen could become a good play activity for them.” The No. 1 virtue for parents in Korea is a sense of balance, not to be easily tempted to buy expensive new toys for their kids or send them to hagwon, simply because many others parents do. “Children learn at each and every stage of life what joy is and what fun is. It is important for parents to let them fully experience all these stages through unstructured play, especially when they are young.” Pyun’s wife Park Bo-young, who was also present at the interview, added, “As a mother, I also find myself controlling my children from A to Z. I think it is partly because I never got to know the freedom of play when I was a child.” “Now I am a parent, but I am still learning how to communicate with children, nurture inner balance in them and help them experience freedom through play,” the cartoonist added.By Kim Da-sol","supply korean playgrounds have major ,many korean parents as overly ,in abundant supply korean playgrounds ,000 playgrounds for children twice ,abundant supply korean playgrounds have","['North Gyeongsang Province', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'Pyun hae - moon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Pyun hae - moon', 'Andong', 'korean', 'Pyun', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care', 'Pyun', 'Berlin', 'London', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Suncheon', 'South Jeolla Province', 'korean', 'Suncheon', 'South Jeolla Province', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Playground', 'Pyun', 'Pyun', 'northern european', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'european', 'UK', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'northeastern', 'Dobong - gu', 'korean', 'Pyun', 'austrian', 'Ludwig Wittgenstein', 'Pyun', 'Korea', 'Kim Da - sol']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55165333  0.14811538

A local district office had rejected the civic group's request to place the statue but later allowed its installment in the face of a strong public outcry. The statue, the second of its kind that stands near Japan's missions in Korea, has prompted a serious diplomatic row. Demanding its immediate removal, Tokyo recently recalled its ambassador and consul general in Busan, a rare move aimed at voicing its strong displeasure.  `Comfort women` statue in front of the Japanese Consulate building in Busan ""We hope that the government, municipality and civic officials gather wisdom on an appropriate site that can protect the diplomatic mission, reflect international courtesy and practices while at the same time making the comfort women issue a valuable historic lesson,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told reporters.  ""Our stance is that it's important to respect the purpose and spirit of the deal reached between the two countries late in 2015... and fully implement what was agreed upon. The government, for its part, is making efforts in that sense,"" he added.  Japan's enslavement of women in front-line brothels during World War II has been a major source of a long-standing diplomatic rift between the two neighboring countries. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops. In December 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a deal and promised to resolve the issue once and for all. Under the deal, Tokyo expressed an apology and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation aimed at supporting its surviving victims, euphemistically called comfort women. Tokyo has claimed that removing a comfort women statue standing in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul is part of the deal and that installing yet another in Busan is a violation of the agreement.  Seoul has said that it will make efforts to produce a ""proper resolution"" on the matter but noted that it doesn't have any authority to remove the statues, which were built by civic groups.  Some politicians, potential presidential candidates, civic groups and victims are demanding renegotiation of the deal as they see it as insufficient and lacking public consensus when it was reached.","south korea on tuesday urged ,opposition from tokyo last month ,girl statue symbolizing japan wartime ,tokyo last month civic group ,south korea on tuesday","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Busan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Busan', 'Busan', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Cho June - hyuck', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Seoul']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19162162  0.43295747

Yet as images and videos of authorities taking down the bronze, life-size sculpture of a girl in a traditional hanbok dress spread over social networks, the office was swamped with visits and calls from angry residents and other citizens across the country. Its website was paralyzed within a few hours.   Caving to pressure, District Mayor Park Sam-seok held a news conference two days later, allowing the monument’s reinstatement and apologizing for the withdrawal and aggressive dispersion of the activists. Youth Make Peace, a civic group that leads the campaign, put it back in place and held an official launch ceremony Saturday. “This is an affair between the two countries, but as head of a local government, it’s become too much for me to handle,” Park said. The consulate lodged a strong complaint and requested a removal to the Busan city government. In Tokyo, Vice Foreign Minister Shinsuke Sugiyama reportedly phoned South Korea’s Ambassador Lee Joon-gyu, calling the statue’s erection “extremely regrettable” and urging its immediate elimination. Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Yasumasa Nagamine also protested Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam. The girl statue has been a perennial source of contention between the two countries. The Busan memorial is the second to be installed in front of a Japanese diplomatic mission, following the one near the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, and there are 37 others around the country. Tokyo argues the statue’s erection breaches the 1961 Vienna Convention that defines the framework of diplomatic relations. It calls for host countries to take “all appropriate steps” to protect the premises of diplomatic missions “against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity.” Under the Dec. 28, 2015 settlement, Seoul promised to work to “properly resolve” the issue through consultations with related organizations. With the steadfast Busan district office and citizens, the Foreign Ministry is struggling to find a solution, prompting criticism for passing the buck to local governments. “This is basically an issue that should be dealt with by related institutions according to law,” ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said at a news briefing Tuesday. “However, our position is that it needs a prudent decision from the aspect of international protocol and customs regarding the protection of diplomatic relations.” The issue may have greater implications ahead of a presidential election in South Korea this year.  After years of historical tension, the two old foes have been mending their forces since the accord, building on momentum to clinch another sensitive pact on sharing military intelligence last month. Yet many citizens and opposition parties remain resistant to the sex slavery deal, due to the government’s failure to consult in advance with the victims and the controversial clause on the statue.Presidential contenders -- both from the conservative and opposition camps -- see the initiative as President Park Geun-hye’s legacy, seeking to overturn or renegotiate it in the new government. In a Dec. 28 poll by Realmeter, about 59 percent of the 525 respondents said the agreement should be revoked, whereas 25.5 percent said it needs to be sustained. “Given the Vienna Convention’s broad interpretations, it’s a matter of implementation, and depends more on domestic law and local government ordinances,” a ministry official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. “We’re not against the statue’s existence -- it is part of history that must be remembered and preserved -- but we see that it can stay in a better environment with greater access, such as at a park nearby. But with the unmoving district office, we are trying to come up with other solutions.”By Shin Hyon-hee","while tokyo stages strong protest ,citizens frenzied resistance while tokyo ,frenzied resistance while tokyo stages ,tokyo stages strong protest ,tokyo stages strong protest the","['Seoul', 'Busan', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Busan', 'Park Sam - seok', 'Park', 'Busan', 'Tokyo', 'Shinsuke Sugiyama', 'South Korea ’s', 'Lee Joon - gyu', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Yasumasa Nagamine', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'Busan', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Cho June - hyuck', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Realmeter', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46136066  0.19067992
