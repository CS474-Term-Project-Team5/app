0,0,Moon decries 2015 Korea-Japan ‘comfort women’ deal as flawed,President Moon Jae-in said Thursday that the 2015 South Korea-Japan agreement on Japan’s wartime enslavement of Korean women does not resolve the “comfort women” issue. He also stressed it was a “political agreement” that did not take the opinions of victims and citizens into account and urged the government to swiftly take follow-up measures.  (Yonhap)The accord pushes for both nations to “finally and irrever...,"President Moon Jae-in said Thursday that the 2015 South Korea-Japan agreement on Japan’s wartime enslavement of Korean women does not resolve the “comfort women” issue. He also stressed it was a “political agreement” that did not take the opinions of victims and citizens into account and urged the government to swiftly take follow-up measures.  The accord pushes for both nations to “finally and irreversibly” resolve the comfort women issue, and Tokyo made financial compensation of 1 billion yen  to the victims through a fund. “Comfort women” is a euphemism for women, mostly Koreans, who were forced into sexual slavery during World War II. “It has been confirmed that the negotiations on the comfort women issue between South Korea and Japan in 2015 had significant defects in terms of procedures and content. It is regrettable but something that we can’t evade,” Moon said in a statement.“This runs afoul of the established universal principle of the international community for settling history issues, and above all, it was a political agreement that excludes victims themselves and citizens,” he added.“Along with the citizens, I, as president, make it clear again that the comfort women issue can’t be settled through the deal.”Moon also said Korea would continue pursuing a two-track approach of separating diplomatic matters from historical issues in Korea-Japan relations. “Separately from the settlement of the historical issue, I will try, at the same time, to restore normal diplomatic relations for future-oriented cooperation between Korea and Japan,” he added.Moon’s announcement came a day after a Foreign Ministry task force announced the outcome of a monthslong investigation into the controversial deal. The task force’s report revealed that the previous Park Geun-hye administration kept parts of the bilateral deal secret from the public to avoid backlash and failed to communicate properly with the victims before reaching the agreement. Moon, upon taking office in May, vowed to revisit the deal saying that South Korean citizens are unable to “emotionally accept” the agreement. Cheong Wa Dae remained cautious, saying that the government has yet to decide its position on the deal. “The government will determine its position after sufficiently listening to opinions and views of former comfort women and other organizations ,” a Blue House official told reporters, requesting anonymity. In line with the task force’s report, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told a group of reporters Thursday that Seoul would start meetings with the victims and relevant civic groups. Kang previously said that the government would take a “victim-oriented approach” in reviewing the bilateral deal. Following the announcement by the task force, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in an official statement Wednesday that it would be “unacceptable” for Seoul to make any attempts to revise the agreement, and such a move would make Japan’s relations with South Korea “unmanageable.” Japan has been asking Korea to “faithfully” carry out the accord. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did not release a direct statement, but Japan’s Nihon Keizai Shinbun reported that he said Japan would not move even “one millimeter” regarding the agreement. Meanwhile, experts here are expressing concerns about Korea-Japan ties amid North Korea’s ongoing nuclear weapons development and provocations. “South Korea’s relationship with Japan is likely to face a rocky road from now on,” said Jin Chang-Soo, director of the Sejong Institute.“The South Korean government must maintain stable communication with Japan in order for the comfort women issue to not negatively affect bilateral ties,” he added. “The South Korea-Japan bilateral relations  in 2018, not just over the comfort women issue, but also with court rulings on victims of forced labor during World War II, the regular territorial claim over the islets of Dokdo, along with issues surrounding textbooks,” Lee Myon-woo, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said in the think tank’s 2018 forecast. “Resolving the comfort women issue is important as advancement in North Korea’s nuclear and missile program calls for improvement in South Korea-Japan ties.”By Jung Min-kyung","enslavement of korean women ,flawed president moon jae ,wartime enslavement of korean ,flawed president moon ,moon decries 2015 korea","['Moon Jae - in', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean']",27,"[ 1.          1.          2.         ... -0.3365522   0.30007836

This photo, taken on Oct. 24, 2017, shows President Moon Jae-in speaking during a Cabinet meeting at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul.

Some call for renegotiating or even scrapping the deal. The task force's negative review of the deal came as Washington strives to ramp up trilateral security cooperation with its two core Asian allies -- Seoul and Tokyo -- to counter the North's escalating threats.","defective 2015 deal president ,enslavement of korean women ,japan wartime sexual enslavement ,2015 deal president moon ,sexual enslavement of korean","['Moon Jae - in', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Moon', 'Park Geun']",27,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.18956949  0.37116921

Protesters sit on chairs while holding flowers in tribute to the deceased victims of Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II, at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul after staging this year‘s last weekly rally in front of the Japanese Embassy nearby, Wednesday. They also urged the Moon Jae-in administration to dissolve the state-run Reconciliation and Healing Foundation, which was established to support the victims as a result of the deal, and return the funds totaling 1 billion yen offered by Japanese government. “In any of the process and the result of the 2015 deal, there were no concerns for the victims and there were no efforts made by the Korean government to reflect victims’ positions,” the groups said at a press briefing in front of the Foreign Ministry building in Seoul.“The Moon Jae-in government must immediately accept the result of the task force’s probe and victims’ demands and must not delay the nullification of the 2015 agreement,” they said, criticizing the Moon administration for “remaining silent” on the issue. Announcing the result of its five-month investigation into the much-disputed deal earlier in the day, the Foreign Ministry task force said that the Park administration hid some of the details of the deal from the public to avoid a backlash over concessions it made to Tokyo. Among the secret agreements were the Korean government’s promise to “persuade” a civic group supporting the victims -- the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan -- to accept the deal, as well as its promise not to support the erection of statues symbolizing sex slavery victims. The rights groups for the victims have called for abolishment of the deal made on Dec. 28, 2015 between Seoul and Tokyo, saying that the deal failed to reflect the victims’ demands -- a sincere apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government. In the deal -- described by the two countries as “final and irreversible” -- Japan offered the funds to the foundation and an apology to the surviving victims in return for Seoul’s promise not to raise the issue again in international forums. At the time of the agreement, only 47 victims of the 238 registered with the government were still alive, with their average age at 90.4. Now, only 32 victims remain. “The government is said to maintain a reserved stance on the issue for a while, separating the investigation result from its official position, due to the possible impact it could have on the PyeongChang Olympics next year,” said Yoon Mi-hyang, president of the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. “The Moon government should take responsibility for the victims.”The civic group held this year’s last weekly rally, the 1,315th, in downtown Seoul earlier in the day, with some 500 people in attendance. They paid tribute to victims and demanded the Korea-Japan deal be annulled.“The presidential office and then-ruling Saenuri Party touted the deal as a diplomatic achievement that none of the previous government had made when the deal was struck. All of them should be held accountable,” said Park Jung-eun, secretary-general of the People‘s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy.A separate task force under the Gender Equality Ministry also unveiled a result of its probe into the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation. The foundation was established hastily following the bilateral deal and the ministry made aggressive efforts to persuade many of the reluctant victims to receive cash payments from the foundation, according to the internal probe. The ministry, however, said that it still has no immediate plan to disband the foundation. Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women remains one of the key points of diplomatic dispute between South Korea and Japan. According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, are estimated to have worked as comfort women at Japan’s front-line brothels during World War II. Japan colonized Korea from 1910-45.","enslavement of korean women ,activists demand scrapping ,government nullify the korea ,japan wartime sexual enslavement ,scrapping of sexual slavery","['south korean', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean']",27,"[ 0.          0.          4.         ... -0.31523243 -0.27818352

Any of their property within US jurisdiction is blocked and American citizens are generally banned from engaging in transactions with them.Kim is reportedly a key figure in the North's ballistic missile development, involved in efforts to switch from liquid to solid fuel, while Ri is a lead official in the country's development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Treasury said.""Treasury is targeting leaders of North Korea's ballistic missile programs, as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the DPRK and achieve a fully denuclearized Korean Peninsula,"" Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in the statement, referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In this Sept. 21, 2017, file photo, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaks at a news briefing at the Hilton Midtown hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. North Korea launched a new ICBM on Nov. 29, claiming it can carry a nuclear warhead to anywhere on the US mainland. The regime's latest nuclear test was in September, involving what it claimed to be a hydrogen bomb.""These actions follow Friday's United Nations Security Council Resolution, which imposed strong new sanctions on North Korea further shutting down its ability to raise illicit funds,"" Mnuchin added.The resolution, which came in response to the November test, seeks to slash exports of refined petroleum products to North Korea by 89 percent. It passed unanimously with backing from China and Russia, two veto-wielding council members that have traditionally been reluctant to increase sanctions on Pyongyang.In a phone call Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his US counterpart, Rex Tillerson, that it is ""necessary to move from the language of sanctions to the negotiating process as soon as possible,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement, according to AFP.Lavrov also ""highlighted that it is unacceptable to exacerbate tensions around the Korean peninsula with Washington's aggressive rhetoric toward Pyongyang and increasing military preparations in the region.""Tensions have run high as US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have engaged in a war of words. In the wake of the North's first two ICBM tests in July and its sixth nuclear test in September, Trump threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" and ""totally destroy"" the regime if necessary.Pyongyang has responded with various threats, including detonating a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.The UN Security Council adopted two sets of sanctions in response to the North's weapons tests in July and September.Friday's resolution requires UN member states to repatriate North Korean overseas workers within 24 months. Their income is believed to be extorted by Pyongyang to fund the nuclear and ballistic missile programs.It also bans imports of North Korean food, agricultural products, minerals, machinery and electrical equipment to deprive the regime of at least US$200 million in annual export revenues.Both Kim Jong-sik and Ri were blacklisted in the resolution.","regime illicit ballistic missile ,nk officials over missile ,two senior north korean ,us sanctions nk officials ,illicit ballistic missile program","['WASHINGTON', 'the United States', 'north korean', 'the Treasury Department', 'Kim Jong - sik', 'Ri Pyong - chol', 'the Munitions Industry Department', ""the North 's Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'US', 'American']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2090006   0.05679258

(Yonhap)...","The 2015 deal on Japan’s wartime sexual slavery of Korean women lacked a “victim-oriented approach” and Seoul will further communicate with the victims and civic groups before making a final decision, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said Tuesday.  South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha answers reporters during a press briefing held at the Central Government Complex in Seoul on Tuesday. “It is fundamentally a human rights issue,” Kang told a group of reporters. “There are victims whose human rights were directly affected and civic groups that have supported them for decades. “Regarding the outcome of the task force‘s review, I think it is right for us to reflect the voices of the victims and the civic groups through sufficient communication before making the government’s stance .”Kang noted during a press meeting in Seoul that the previous government‘s move should have been based on wider and more solid opinions of the “comfort women” here. The term “comfort women” is a euphemism for women who were forced into military sexual servitude by Japan during World War II. “The conclusion is that there was a significant lack of communication with the victims before the deal was made,” she said. “It is the result that we have expected but now we can say that with sufficient review and evidence.”Kang’s remarks came a day ahead of the announcement of the outcome of a five-month review of the controversial deal signed between Seoul and Tokyo two years ago. The deal agreed to resolve the comfort women issue “finally and irreversibly” and for Tokyo to provide compensation of 1 billion yen  to the victims. But President Moon Jae-in, upon taking office in May, said South Korean citizens could not “emotionally accept” the deal and pledged to revisit it. Victims and civic groups also questioned the “sincerity” of the agreement, with some calling for a renegotiation.Japan has been requesting the “faithful implementation” of the agreement. Addressing the sensitivity of the issue, the South Korean government said it would pursue a “two-track” approach in which such historical issues will be dealt with separately from diplomatic matters. Kang remained tight-lipped about the details of the task force’s report, but said all options should remain open for Seoul. The government will make all possible diplomatic efforts to improve bilateral relations with Japan despite several difficult issues existing between them, she added. The meeting came on the heels of Kang’s visit to Tokyo last week, where she met her Japanese counterpart Taro Kono and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Kono reportedly reiterated Tokyo’s stance on the deal, saying South Korea should stick to its agreement. Seoul said it would deliver an advance briefing to Tokyo before the result of the task force investigation is released.The South Korean government is likely to tread carefully on the issue with key events such as the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics fast-approaching, and may delay drawing up follow-up measures, according to Foreign Ministry sources. Experts advised the current government to display political leadership in resolving the issue under the current circumstances. “The comfort women issue, including the 2015 comfort women deal, is expected to be a key task for South Korea next year in maintaining and developing ties with Japan amid the rapid advances in North Korean nuclear and missile programs,” Lee Myon-woo, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute said in the think tank’s 2018 forecast. “There is a high possibility that South Korea will ask Japan for a renegotiation ... and it is important for the South Korean government to show political leadership in the process.” By Jung Min-kyung","in seoul on tuesday ,slavery of korean women ,said tuesday south korean ,seoul on tuesday yonhap ,tuesday south korean","['Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'south korean', 'Kang Kyung - wha', 'the Central Government Complex', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.38783848  0.44400978

Officials from the National Forensics Service and fire authorities conduct a forensic examination of the scene of a major blaze that broke out in an eight-story building in the southern city of Jecheon in North Chungcheong Province on Thursday. YonhapWhile the exact cause of the fire remains unclear, officials said a fire likely began from a vehicle in the parking lot at the ground floor. The building had several restaurants and leisure facilities, including a gym, a public bathhouse and an indoor golf practice facility. A special investigative unit consisting of at least 70 investigators has been formed to examine the scene of the fire.According to the authorities, at least 23 victims were found in the women’s bathhouse on the second floor. Among 29 survivors, many were rescued from the rooftop. Most had suffered smoke inhalation.Police are checking whether water sprinklers inside the building functioned properly. They will also check if there was a malfunctioning door at the public bath on the second floor following a report by a witness.Experts say the building was built with Dryvit insulation, which is highly flammable. Following a number of major fire-related incidents in recent decades, the government revised the construction law in 2015 to require construction firms to only use incombustible materials in buildings with six floors or more. But the revised law does not apply to buildings built before 2015. Officials from the National Forensics Service and fire authorities conduct a forensic examination of the scene of a major blaze that broke out in an eight-story building in the southern city of Jecheon in North Chungcheong Province on Thursday. YonhapThe Jecheon Fire Department said unusually heavy smoke and toxic fumes from the fire delayed the rescue operation, adding the toll could rise as rescuers continue to search. About 49 fire engines and trucks and 60 firefighters were sent to the scene, along with two firefighter helicopters. President Moon Jae-in visited the site of the fire Friday to offer his condolences to the families of those killed and injured.Moon expressed grief at the accident and instructed officials to ""make utmost efforts for speedy rescue and firefighting operations,"" according to Cheong Wa Dae.

The Australian Federal Police said 59-year-old naturalized Australian Chan Han Choi used encrypted communication to broker sales and discuss the supply of weapons of mass destruction. His actions contravened both United Nations and Australian sanctions against North Korea, police said. Police said the man was acting to generate income for Pyongyang by arranging the sale of computer software used for guiding ballistic missiles as well as expertise from North Korea to other ""international entities."" Police didn't elaborate. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had been briefed by AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin on the ""very, very serious matter"" and warned anyone thinking of assisting North Korea that ""the AFP will find you.""""North Korea is a dangerous, reckless, criminal regime threatening the peace of the region,"" Turnbull said. ""It supports itself by breaching UN sanctions, not simply by selling commodities like coal and other goods, but also by selling weapons, by selling drugs, by engaging in cybercrime.""He added: ""It is vitally important that all nations work relentlessly to enforce those sanctions because the more economic pressure that can be brought on North Korea, the sooner that regime will be brought to its senses.""Despite international sanctions, cash-strapped North Korea last month test-fired its most powerful missile that may be able to target the US mainland.Choi is facing six charges related to brokering the sale of missile componentry and expertise from North Korea to other international entities, and attempting to transfer coal from North Korea to entities in Indonesia and Vietnam. Choi didn't appear or apply for bail in a Sydney court Sunday, and bail was formally refused. Federal police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said the governments of Indonesia and Vietnam _ or authorities in those countries _ were not involved in the coal transfer attempt. Choi is the first person charged under Australia's Weapons of Mass Destruction Act and could face a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Gaughan said the charges related to his alleged activity over the past year, but that allegations dated back to 2008. Choi was arrested Saturday and charged over two transactions that were unsuccessful. ""But we estimate that if these trades were successful, we're talking tens of millions of dollars,"" Gaughan told reporters. He said investigations were continuing and that more charges could be filed against Choi. ""The AFP are saying this man was a loyal agent of North Korea, believing he was acting to serve some high patriotic purpose,"" Gaughan said. Police started investigating Choi after a tip-off from another international agency on another matter, he said. ""I know these charges sound alarming, but we are not suggesting that there are any weapons or missile componentry that came to Australian soil,"" he said. ""We're alleging all of the activity occurred offshore."" Choi's activities also involved commodities including oil and gemstones. ""This is black market 101. It's the same with the coal and oil and gemstones _ it's all about making money for North Korea,"" he said, adding the case was ""like nothing we have ever seen on Australian soil."" ""Any individual who attempts to fly in the face of sanctions cannot and will not go unnoticed in Australia,"" he said.","brokering north korea missile ,korean born sydney man ,ballistic missiles the australian ,missile sales south korean ,man was charged sunday","['south Korean', 'Sydney', 'North Korea', 'Australia', 'Pyongyang', 'the Australian Federal Police', 'Australian', 'Chan Han Choi']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12490372  0.43950772

But his body has offered some clues already. Receiving treatment for the critical gunshot wounds he suffered during his dash across the border at a South Korean hospital, his health and dietary condition have provided a window into the North’s current hygiene and living standards.On top of hepatitis B, doctors found parasites, coupled with kernels of corn, in the young soldier’s stomach. The majority of North Koreans are believed to be deprived of proper nutrition and health care, with the ruling party spending money on its weapons development program instead. Parasitic worms Surgeon Lee Cook-jong describes the parasites found inside the body of a North Korean soldier at Ajou University Medical Center in Suwon, South Korea in November. “In my 20 years as a surgeon, I have only seen something like this in a medical textbook,” Lee Cook-jong, Oh’s surgeon, told reporters on Nov. 15. Lee reportedly discovered several parasites up to 27 centimeters long in the soldier’s stomach.Such parasitic worms were common in South Korea as well 40 to 50 years ago, but based on recent governmental reports, the infection rate here dropped from 84.3 percent in 1971 to 2.6 percent in 2012. The worms in Oh’s stomach are believed to be categorized as “soil-transmitted helminthiasis” or parasites transmitted through human feces-based fertilizers. Various media reports have shed light on North Korea’s shortage of chemical fertilizers and North Korean defectors to the South whose stomachs were riddled with parasites that mirrored those of Oh’s. The little beasts are often linked to malnutrition in school-age children, as they absorb nutrients needed for mental and physical development, according to the World Health Organization. The parasitic infections can be used as a yardstick in determining whether a country has proper hygiene and health care, as the infections can be easily treated with medication. Malnutrition Three malnourished North Korean children, between the ages of four and five, sit on the floor of a nursery in North Korea in 1997. APEarlier this year, a United Nations report claimed 2 in 5 North Koreans were undernourished.“Amidst political tensions, an estimated 18 million people across  continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition, as well as a lack of access to basic services,” the UN report said.“Furthermore, 10.5 million people, or 41 percent of the total population, are undernourished.”From 1994 to 1998, North Korea endured a nationwide famine, known as the “March of Suffering,” which caused the deaths of between 500,000 and 2.5 million people there, historians say. The collapse of the Soviet Union, heavy drought and flooding are believed to have contributed to the famine. Today, average North Koreans continue to experience shortages of food and basic necessities from weak infrastructure to counter natural disasters. A series of international sanctions imposed on the isolated nation with an aim to curb its economic growth and the advancement of its nuclear technology is also viewed by some experts as factors that could hurt North Korean citizens in terms of well-being. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization earlier this year estimated the North’s early-season crop production to have dropped almost by one-third on-year. Tuberculosis A doctor with the Eugene Bell Foundation explains tuberculosis treatment to North Korean citizens. Eugene Bell FoundationIn 2014, about 5,000 North Koreans died due to tuberculosis, according to WHO. The disease caused 20 deaths per 100,000 tuberculosis patients in North Korea in 2014, a rate more than five times that of the South, noted the UN health agency. It estimated nearly 110,000 tuberculosis patients in the communist country in 2014.The Eugene Bell Foundation pointed out that 4,000 to 5,000 new multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases occur annually, in a recent press conference in Seoul. The organization, which focuses on providing tuberculosis treatment to North Korea, stressed regular checkups and aid supplies were necessary measures in combating the disease. Malaria  Malaria-infected mosquiotoes at a testing lab. The number of malaria patients in North Korea has been steadily declining for four straight years, but still remained at 4,890 in 2015, a WHO report released earlier this month showed. The number tallied 21,850 in 2012. The deadly disease spread through mosquito bites is common near the Demilitarized Zone that separates the North and the South. The number of victims infected with vivax malaria, which is common near the DMZ, spiked from May to October, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 601 cases were identified, with 294 among soldiers. Overall, in areas with high transmission of malaria, children under 5 years old are particularly vulnerable to infection, illness and death -- accounting for more than 70 percent of all malaria deaths.Although the exact number of fatalities is uncertain, malaria continues to pose a serious threat to North Korean children due to the isolated nation’s inability to arrange relevant health programs.

(Yonhap)“President Xi avoided directly referring to ...","The outcome of the latest summit between the leaders of South Korea and China embodies the two nations’ willingness to work on their differences over the deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system here and reaffirm their cooperation on North Korean issues, an expert said. From left: South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. “President Xi avoided directly referring to THAAD and was cautious in addressing the issue in meetings, which could indicate that China has taken a step towards recovering bilateral ties with South Korea,” Min Jeong-hun, a professor at Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul, told The Korea Herald on Friday. Min’s thoughts are in line with a senior Cheong Wa Dae official’s remarks released the same day saying that the summit between President Moon Jae-in and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping was a “good signal” that the two nations are getting off to a fresh start in their relationship. “During the expanded summit, President Xi referred to THAAD only as ‘an issue that we all know,’ rather than directly using the term ‘THAAD.’ The term was briefly mentioned only at the one-on-one meeting at the end,” the official said, comparing Xi’s subtle shift in tone from the previous summit on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last month. “I think it‘s a good signal,” the official added. Xi had brought up the issue of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system at the meeting in Danang, Vietnam, despite Cheong Wa Dae’s previous statements that the issue would not be discussed. Min also noted Xi’s refrain from pushing South Korea to respond to its “three no’s” policy -- no additional THAAD deployments, no joining of a broader US missile defense system and no military alliance among South Korea, the US and Japan.Moon’s state visit to Beijing came at a sensitive time with the two nations struggling to move past Seoul’s decision to install THAAD here and China’s economic retaliation that followed. China claims that THAAD’s powerful radar could be used to spy on its military facilities. Seoul has repeatedly stated that the system will only be used defend against North Korea’s threats. On North Korean issues, the new agreement drawn by the two leaders drew mixed reactions with the opposition parties claiming claimed that the move underscored the threat of North Korea’s nuclear program.“Although there is nothing really ‘new’ about the ‘four principles’ it is a reiteration of their previous vows to cooperate on North Korean issues,” Min said. The “four principles” in dealing with North Korea’s nuclear issues are -- no tolerance for war, a firm resolve to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, resolution of related issues through dialogue and negotiations and improving inter-Korean relations is beneficial to resolving issues on the peninsula. “The ‘four principles’ which is not a joint statement nor a joint conference, is an agreement that shows the current administration’s complacent view toward the threat of North Korea’s nuclear program,” said Chang Je-won, a spokesperson for the main opposition Liberty Korea Party. “When the North may already have nuclear arms, their mention of the principle of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, after all, amounts to pardoning the North for its possession of nuclear arms.”But Min highlighted the existing difference in South Korea and China’s thoughts on several issue including THAAD, saying it would be meaningless to release such a document under such circumstances. “A gap continues to exist between South Korea and China’s stances on several issues including THAAD, so the best option was to announce the results through separate statements,” he said.Min listed restoration of trust between Seoul and Beijing, North Korea’s nuclear issues and bilateral economic cooperation between the two nations as major keywords on President Moon’s agenda throughout his state visit.

In this July 18, 2004 file photo, former U.S. Army deserter to North Korea, Charles Jenkins, left, escorted by his wife Hitomi Soga, right, and their daughter Mika, center, arrives at Tokyo`s Haneda International Airport. Jenkins, who married Soga, a Japanese abductee and lived in Japan after their release in the 2000s, has died. He was 77.He deserted during a drunken night in 1965, crossing the heavily fortified border into North Korea from the South.He said later he was scared of being sent to Vietnam and thought North Korea would send him home.Instead, he spent 39 years in Pyongyang, where he taught English to spy cadets in his North Carolina drawl and played a Yankee villain in propaganda films.In 1980, he married Hitomi Soga, who was kidnapped by North Korean agents in the Cold-War era. She was allowed to leave North Korea for Japan in 2002 and Jenkins followed her two years later with their two Korean-born daughters.The Japanese government granted him permanent residency and he lived in Soga's hometown on Sado, a picturesque island in the Sea of Japan.Soga said in a statement released by the city government on Tuesday she was ""very surprised"" by his death and ""cannot think of anything"". Sado mayor Motohiro Miura expressed condolences in a statement, saying that Jenkins ""worked at a souvenir shop and contributed to local tourism"".After heading to Japan, Jenkins was court-martialled by the US military for deserting but given only a 30-day confinement.North Korean agents kidnapped Soga and a number of other ordinary Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s in order to train its spies in the Japanese language and culture.In 2002, North Korea admitted kidnapping 13 Japanese civilians but the government in Tokyo believes at least 17 were taken.A month later, five including Soga were allowed to return to Japan. Pyongyang insists the other eight are dead but has not produced cast-iron evidence.The issue sours already strained Japan-North Korea relations and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe often wears a blue ribbon to remind him of their abduction.Last month, during a trip to Tokyo, US President Donald Trump met Soga and the now elderly families of those abducted. There are strong suspicions in Japan that dozens of other citizens were also snatched by the North.James Joseph Dresnok, the only US soldier known still to have been living in North Korea after defecting more than five decades ago, died in November 2016, his sons confirmed in August.","daughter found him collapsed ,decades in korea dies ,married japanese woman abducted ,korea dies at 77 ,jenkins us army deserter","['Charles Jenkins', 'US Army', 'North Korea', 'japanese', 'Pyongyang', 'the Asahi Shimbun', 'Sado']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51092231  0.45784795

She claimed he has received no treatment for his pain and prison officers verbally abuse him dozens of times daily.""One day, a prison officer placed a centipede, as large as big as the palm of his hand, in the middle of the night into the cell where my son is in custody, and he had his arm bitten by it,"" she claimed. This file photo, dated Dec. 9, 2015, shows police officers standing guard in front of the Kojimachi Police Station in Tokyo`s Chiyoda Ward, where a South Korean man was in custody for a suspected bombing at a public restroom at Tokyo`s Yasukuni Shrine. The shrine is seen as a symbol of Japan`s militarist past by neighboring Asian countries. An official at the South Korean Justice Ministry said he was aware the mother had taken up the issue of the alleged human rights abuses with both the Japanese government and the South Korean Embassy in Tokyo. ""But we have yet to receive any information about the human rights abuse case from the embassy,"" the official said.The ministry is seeking the man's transfer to South Korean custody in accordance with an international prisoner transfer treaty, the official went on, adding, ""We will try to have him transferred from the Japanese prison as part of efforts to protect Korean nationals abroad.""In February, the Tokyo High Court upheld a lower court ruling that sentenced the man to four years in prison for the detonation of the bomb in a public restroom at the Yasukuni Shrine.The 29-year-old suspect, identified only by his surname Chon, was found guilty in July last year by the Tokyo District Court of breaking into the premises of the shrine on Nov. 23, 2015, and setting up the bomb in a public restroom. The incident, which resulted in no loss of life but damaged the restroom's ceiling, prompted a bomb disposal unit to be mobilized.He was arrested in December 2015 shortly after voluntarily returning to Tokyo by plane.In the February ruling, the court also found Chon guilty of violating laws on explosives control and tariffs.Chon and his legal representative have been demanding a suspended sentence, as he had no intention of hurting people and admitted to the wrongdoings. Prosecutors had originally sought a five-year sentence. South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine -- which honors over 2.4 million war dead, including 14 convicted Class-A war criminals -- as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism.Many South Koreans still harbor deep resentment against Japan over its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.","japanese prison for detonating ,korean man jailed for ,jailed for yasukuni bombing ,incarceration the man mother ,south korean man jailed","['JEONJU', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'Tokyo']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.2443867   0.00984297

It also said it could not confirm when the payment was made.  Reports said Polish labor standards officers investigated the death of a North Korean welder who was killed when his clothes caught fire at the shipyard.According to the report, the shipyard employed 45 North Korean workers through Korea Rungrado General Trading Corp. in 2013. In December 2016, the United States added the corporation to a sanctions list of 16 North Korean organizations as part of its ongoing efforts to cut off international funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.","korean worker report poland ,death of korean worker ,labor department said friday ,death of north korean ,2014 death of north","['Poland', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Voice of America', 'VOA', 'Korean Service', 'Poland', 'the Polish Labor Department', 'polish', 'Crist SA']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40416971  0.64028507

Truk was a heavily fortified base for Japanese operations against Allied forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, serving as the forward anchorage for the Japanese Imperial Fleet. Photos released by the Seoul National University Human Rights Centers shows former Korean sex slaves in Chuuk Islands, who are believed to have been coerced into sex slavery during the war in which Korea was under colonial rule by Japan. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government and Seoul National University Human Rights Center, at least 26 Koreans were forcibly taken to the islands, which they found by obtaining a list of the people onboard the Escort Ikino -- a vessel that carried 368 passengers in 1943 en route to the Chuuk Islands. They said records from daily logs written by American soldiers, articles and photos from the New York Times published on March 1946 also proved that there were Korean sex slaves on the Chuuk Islands.The SNU Human Rights Center, which has been searching for evidence on Japanese wartime sexual enslavement, said it was the first discovery that proves the testimony of Lee Bok-soon, a late sex-trafficking survivor who claimed to have been taken there. Lee, one of 239 government-registered survivors, died in 2011. Little had been known about Koreans on the Chuuk Islands at that time and many researchers have assumed that some Koreans might have been coerced into forced labor there to construct the Japanese base or work at military brothels, the center said. Professor Chung Jin-seong from the SNU Human Rights Center, who led the search, said they went through every certification of family register and interviewed family members and neighbors to confirm a photo of a woman presumed to be taken on the island was Lee. In addition, the city government said it discovered evidence of another sex slavery victim, Ha Bok-hyang, who had said she was coerced to the Japanese wartime brothel, but died before being recognized by the government as a victim. Sixteen years after her death, Ha has now been confirmed as a sex slavery victim following the center’s discovery of interrogation records of prisoners from the Japanese wartime base in the Philippines. The center also compared a photo, birthday, address and fingerprints to prove that Ha was a sex-trafficking survivor. Ha did not speak about her damage until 2001, when she shared her experience with the Korea Chongshindae’s Institute. She died 10 days later. A total 239 former sex slaves were registered based on available evidence, but many civic groups and researchers say the number is well above that.“We believe that there are still many other sex slavery victims, but not officially recognized in our society. The city government will join hands with experts and scholars to continue to search evidence on the Japanese wartime sexual enslavement,” said Eom Gyu-sook, head of the city government’s Women and Family Policy Affairs division.As of July 2017, 38 recognized former wartime sex slaves remain alive, according to government data. Up to 200,000 women, many from Korea, then a colony of Japan, are believed to have been coerced into sex slavery during the war.By Kim Da-sol","additional korean sex slaves ,sex slaves for japanese ,of japan brutal trafficking ,korean sex slaves ,slaves for japanese troops","['Koreans', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'the Chuuk Islands', 'Japan']",27,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.60964298  0.07125612

The Supreme Court delivered the judgment on Shin Young-ja, head of the Lotte Foundation. She stands accused of receiving at least 2.2 billion won  from various companies for over eight years in return for business favors related to Lotte's duty-free shops and department store. The 75-year-old defendant was found guilty of breach of duty, embezzlement and bribery by the two lower courts. But the appeals court in July commuted her sentence by one year to two years in jail as it cleared her of some of the bribery charges.   Shin Young-ja, the head of the Lotte Foundation who`s been charged with embezzlement and breach of trust, enters the courthouse for an appeals trial in Seoul on July 19, 2017. The Seoul High Court had agreed with the defense argument that some of the bribes that a local cosmetics firm paid to her son's company in exchange for business opportunities cannot be seen as the money Shin pocketed. But the top court stated in Thursday's ruling to the effect that such money is also part of the bribes she took, and that there are sufficient grounds to constitute her conviction for all of the charges.Shin is the eldest daughter of Shin Kyuk-ho, the founder of Lotte, the fifth-largest conglomerate in Korea. Her 95-year-old father and current group Chairman Shin Dong-bin are also currently standing trial without detention over a string of corruption charges.","court on thursday quashed ,daughter in graft trial ,thursday quashed an appellate ,quashed an appellate court ,graft trial south korea","[""South Korea 's"", ""Lotte Group 's"", 'the Supreme Court', 'Shin Young - ja', 'the Lotte Foundation']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.3489688  -0.29576474

She soon disappears, struggles through life as a single mom, and later by chance reunites with the man who, after finding out she didn’t give up the baby despite stigma and obstacles, falls back in love with her. All of this is as if abortion were a valid option for women in South Korea. Pro-choice activists hold up banners and images of female bodies carrying messages in favor of their right to self-determination at a protest in central Seoul on Nov. 9. YonhapBut, under the anti-abortion law introduced in 1953, the termination of pregnancy is only permissible when the mother faces serious health risks or in cases of rape, incest or hereditary disorders. Even in those cases, abortion is prohibited after the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.Yet, tens of thousands of abortions are estimated to be performed in the country each year, with an average of less than 10 prosecuted for the violations. Fewer actually face punishment. The gap between law and reality is putting women and doctors out in the cold. “I did not know much about the abortion law before. I thought you could get it done in the early stage of pregnancy,” Kim Eun-hee, who had her unwanted pregnancy terminated a couple of years ago, told The Korea Herald. Kim recalled how lonely she felt and the difficulty she faced in finding a clinic, because abortions were done secretly. The social stigma against the procedure has also been a hardship she has to face alone. “The law is there, but not everyone can adhere to it. They do not enforce it either. But then, it is still just too harsh on women,” Kim said. “I value life, and I also care about my life.”A highly polarizing topic in the West, South Korea has rarely debated the abortion issue. Abortion is a taboo here, as typically has been anything linked to one’s sex life. It is something only those experiencing an unwanted pregnancy have to deal with personally. No major politicians have expressed a pro-life or pro-choice stance publicly, as it has never become an election issue. Lifting the veil The issue, long hidden away, was brought to the fore last month when the presidential office responded to a petition calling for the abolishment of the abortion ban. The online petition, posted on the website of the presidential office on Sept. 30, called for decriminalization of abortion and legalization of abortion pills, citing women’s rights to their bodies. More than 230,000 people signed. In his response, Cho Kuk, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, acknowledged the glaring disparity between the strict law and actual practices and said the government would do fact-finding on the status quo and start gathering public opinions next year. Mentioning the need for change, Cho, formerly a law professor, cautiously added the debate should not run between the rights of the fetuses and the women. “The debate will not advance further with zero-sum thinking that we should choose between one of the rights. Both are precious values that society has to promote,” Cho said.As the rare and direct statement from Cheong Wa Dae hinted at the possible revision of the current law, more voices on the pros and cons began to arise. Religious and pro-life groups rose up to defend the law, as woman rights groups welcomed the stance.The Korean Catholic Church said it would start a campaign to gather 1 million signatures for its own petition to Cheong Wa Dae. Titled “We oppose lifting the ban on abortion,” the petition directly confronts the former that prompted Cho’s response. Women rights groups, seeing now as a pivotal time to confront Korean society’s hypocrisy on abortion, argue that if abortion is to be labeled a crime, men should be held accountable as well. Time for a reality check While exact data is not available on the number of abortions performed in Korea, various research shows the law is not acting to reduce it. The Health Ministry estimates that abortions contracted from 342,000 in 2005 to 168,000 in 2010. But a recent report published in a health journal estimates the number of abortions performed annually at 500,000. The Korean College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists puts the number at some 3,000 abortions performed daily -- which could be rounded to about 1 million such procedures per year. According to Statistics Korea, 406,300 babies were born here in 2016.Kim Dong-seok, chief of the Korean Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says the outdated law puts the responsibility on pregnant women and doctors, and that social conditions should improve to give support for healthy pregnancies. “The law has not been revised for 44 years, since it was introduced, and it is time to consider changing it to reflect popular opinion.”In a society where sons were traditionally preferred over daughters, methods of inducing “natural” miscarriages were handed down through generations, including drinking lye or falling down stairs. A history book on Korean culture by Kang Seong-hyun depicts the life of Koreans in the 1950s and introduces a statistic that more than 35 percent of women at the time had experienced at least one abortion, mainly attributed to concerns on poverty.“In my mom’s generation, I heard abortions were common among married couples. They did it because they wanted a son and it was a girl or they just wanted no more children,” said Lee Sun-mi, a Catholic, who is married and now facing difficulty conceiving. “It seems to me that we were a pro-choice society in the first place and the abortion ban is foreign.” Next year’s survey on abortion trends and the public opinion gathering process could affect the Constitutional Court’s decision on the anti-abortion law. A complaint was filed in February to the court to review the abortion ban’s constitutionality. In 2012, the top court ruled in favor of the current law, reasoning the fetus’s right to life is more important than a woman’s right to self-determination. Judges were evenly divided on the decision at that time, four against four. To rule a law unconstitutional, the typically nine-member court requires a majority decision of six judges. Regardless of if the ban is struck down or not, experts say it is time for society to talk about abortion as a social issue -- not the personal problem of a woman experiencing an unplanned, or unwanted, pregnancy. “Decriminalizing abortion may bring concerns on protecting the life of fetuses. But punishing abortion does not bring much benefit to society either,” Noh Dong-il, a professor at Kyung Hee University Law School, said. “Unofficial statistics show tens of thousands of abortions are performed every year, and it is important that we do talk about the issue now.”Sociology professor Lee Na-young from Chung-Ang University echoed the view. “Law exists not only to moderate conflicts occurring between individuals, but also to set the direction of a society. And it is crucial that the law is revised to fit the values of the era,” Lee added.By Jo He-rim","vicious and disapproving mother ,reality check on abortion ,single mom and later ,in korean soap operas ,disapproving mother",['korean'],27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45380017  0.46358681

YonhapIn a statement sent to The Korea Herald on Wednesday, the group’s head Mishana Hosseinioun said that “beyond the highly politicized nature of the trial and the arbitrary extension of her detention for a further six months, Park is too unwell to participate in the trial proceedings under the current conditions.”“If the court has deemed Park fit to stand trial then they should provide independently verifiable evidence to that effect,” Hosseinioun wrote.  The Seoul Central District Court on Tuesday decided on a trial in absentia for Park, who failed to show up at two scheduled hearings in a row, citing health reasons. Park earlier made clear her intention to boycott the trial in protest against the court’s decision last month to extend her detention by another six months. The court’s lead Judge Kim Se-yoon said the defendant “does not appear to have legitimate grounds for absence.” A Seoul-based official of MH Group confirmed to The Korea Herald that MH Group officials plan to visit Seoul from Dec. 17-20, but did not reveal other details. The official also declined to reveal whether it had scheduled a visit to the facility where the former president is detained. Earlier in October, the legal group sent the United Nations Human Rights Council a document concerning Park’s ill treatment in her cell, urging it to safeguard Park’s human rights. In the document, the group insisted that the 65-year-old former leader “is living in a cell that’s dirty, cold and constantly lit so she cannot sleep,” according to a report by CNN. The country’s National Human Rights Commission, however, concluded Park’s cell was in an overall good condition, based on an on-site inspection it carried out shortly after the report. Media reports say MH group has been hired by Park’s aides, including Kim Pyung-woo, who defended her at the Constitutional Court during the impeachment trial in February.By Bak Se-hwan","president park too unwell ,korean authorities of mistreating ,release former president park ,accused south korean authorities ,detention calling for her","['MH Group', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Korea Herald', 'Mishana Hosseinioun']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29272071  0.23095605

Japan is urging local authorities and fishermen to be on the alert after several boats thought to be from North Korea were found on its northern coast. ""The coast guard and police have to cooperate to step up sea patrols around Japan,” the chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said Tuesday when asked about reports that a boat carrying eight dead bodies was found on the coast of Akita prefecture, which faces North Korea across the Sea of Japan. “The government intends to improve this to ensure we can guard against suspicious boats or people arriving in Japan,” Suga said. He said local authorities, fishermen and residents should report if they spot any questionable boats or people.Last week, police rescued eight people thought to be North Korean fishermen who ended up stranded along with their squid catch. A week earlier, the coast guard rescued three North Korean men from a capsized fishing boat off Japan's northern coast. They were transferred hours later to another North Korean vessel that was to return them home. The coast guard later found three bodies of missing crew members from that boat, then four more bodies in another capsized boat believed to be North Korean. They were thought to have drowned.It is unclear if the people aboard the several dozen North Korean boats that drift near Japanese shores each year are intending to defect or simply unable to make their way back aboard their unseaworthy wooden boats. The boat recovered Monday was spotted on Saturday, but seas were too rough at the time for rescuers to approach it. It was unflagged and was reported to be “nationality unclear.” However, a coast guard official reached by phone in Akita said one of the bodies was holding a 1,000 won North Korean note, suggesting the boat was from there. Six bodies were found inside a storage room near the bow of the boat, below deck, and another two near the stern. All were men and partially decomposed, the official said. She spoke on condition of anonymity, following coast guard policy. The crude vessel with its very low gunwale had lost its propeller and rudder, and was similar to other poorly equipped boats often seen operating from North Korea. Autopsies of the dead men were underway.","being washed ashore japan ,korea some carrying dead ,alert after several boats ,after being washed ashore ,japan after being washed","['TOKYO', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Oga', 'Akita', 'Japan', 'Japan']",27,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.25735265  0.0708238

From a dictator’s covert hideout to infiltration tunnels dug by North Koreans near the Demilitarized Zone, some of these secret underground places are pieces of the country’s checkered history, although there are not many records that explain their mysterious existence. Late strongman Park Chung-hee’s secret shelter, or so believed by most people today, was discovered in 2005 during construction work for a bus transfer station in Yeouido. “It felt surreal. We checked every aerial photograph  and there was no trace of such a facility until 1977,” said Park Hyun-jeong, a Seoul City official in charge of urban development. Experts estimate that the bunker was constructed between late 1976 and early 1977 for the president’s hideout. The Cold War was at its peak globally at that time and military tensions between two Koreas were even higher. In August 1976, North Korean soldiers had butchered with axes two American officers who were trimming a poplar tree in the border zone. After the Yeouido discovery, officials suspect that there may be more secret facilities built for Park, who ruled from 1963 until his assassination in 1979, although their locations are unknown. The hostile North contributed to the diversity of South Korea’s hidden underground world, building several infiltration tunnels under the border into the South. Some of them have found new life here as tourism destinations. The history of some other bunkers goes as far as back as the Japanese colonial rule of South Korea . The hidden bunker found near Gyeonghuigung Palace -- spanning some 1,300 square meters -- was equipped with a communication facility, presumably to prepare for air raids, experts say. After undergoing precise inspections and safety reinforcements, the bunker has been turned into an exhibition hall. “These bunkers are living evidence of our history. They were once forgotten, but are symbols of Korean history since the cold war era,” said Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon at an event marking the public opening of the Yeouido bunker in October.

South and North Korean guards face each other at the truce village of Panmunjom in this file photo. After being hit five times, he was recovered by South Korean and UNC guards there and airlifted to a hospital south of Seoul. He's alive but unconscious.In press briefings, South Korean defense officials have called him a North Korean soldier, saying he was clad in a Korean People's Army uniform.But the UNC officially describes him as an ""individual"" presumed to be a KPA soldier.There's a heated controversy over whether the South's guards should have returned fire. They focused on rescuing the defector, refraining from using force in accordance with the JSA rules of engagement set by the UNC, according to the defense authorities. Also at issue is the possibility of at least a North Korean soldier having crossed the border line with no specific mark while running after the defector.The Armistice Agreement stipulates that ""No person, military or civilian, shall be permitted to cross the military demarcation line unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.""According to multiple sources who viewed related CCTV footage, one of the North Korean soldiers flinched apparently after recognizing the trespass.The UNC initially promised to make public a clip on Thursday showing what happened there at that time but it indefinitely postponed the release.The command said it will instead ""release additional details and material once that investigation is complete.""Even if the North's violation of the Armistice Agreement is confirmed, the UNC has no means to punish it.The first measure will be lodging a formal protest with the North but the problem is how amid a lack of communication channel.No talks between the KPA and the UNC have been held since March 2009.The UNC proposed consultations between general-grade officers after the North's deadly torpedo attack on a South Korean warship near the Yellow Sea border in 2010 but the KPA rejected it.An alternative is that a UNC official reads a protest message via loudspeaker or place a relevant statement along the MDL and wait for the North's guards to pick it up.Furthermore, Pyongyang declared the Armistice Agreement invalid in the wake of its third nuclear test in early 2013.It means the UNC has no realistic tool to use other than symbolic gestures.Established a month after the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War, the US-led UNC is a signatory to the agreement also signed by North Korea and China.It's tasked with overseeing the implementation of the agreement and deterring the North's aggression.","local soldier defection dash ,north korean soldiers ,korea armistice violation the ,north korean soldiers at ,firearms by north korean","['the United Nations Command', 'north korean', 'Panmunjom']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16595131  0.04409999

Four North Korean soldiers at the Joint Security Area inside the heavily fortified border zone fired about 40 rounds at the escaping solider. They shot southward. It is unclear whether they continued to shoot after the solider entered the South’s territory. South Korean soldiers rescued him only after the shooting ended.The soldier, whose rank and identity have not been disclosed, underwent a second surgery Wednesday at a hospital south of Seoul. The surgery was “successful,” but he is still in a critical condition, according to doctor Lee Cook-jong, who performed the operation. Military officials and analysts in Seoul said the military’s refrained response was the right move, given that the US commander assumes operational control in the JSA and any small-scale conflicts run the risk of escalating into an all-out war. “I think our soldiers did a pretty good job,” South Korea’s Defense Minister Song Young-moo told lawmakers on Tuesday. “They made a good judgment call to minimize the risk and deal with the North Korean soldier appropriately.” Joint Security Area. Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldLocated inside the 4-kilometer-wide Demilitarized Zone, the JSA is jointly overseen by the UN Command and by North Korea, with South Korean and North Korean border guards facing each other only meters apart. Although the South Korean Army took over the duty of keeping security inside the JSA from the US in 2004, the authority over the use of force falls under UNC commander Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, who doubles as the commander of USFK and US-led Combined Forces Command.Therefore, the South Korean soldiers inside the JSA are not allowed to use military force unless their action is justified under UNC rules of engagement applied to JSA, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The UNC commander considers two parts to determine whether such a response is appropriate: whether there is a direct threat to our guards and whether our response would escalate the situation,” JCS chief director of operations Gen. Suh Wook told lawmakers on Wednesday. Apart from UNC’s general rules of engagement, there is a separate rule of engagement applied to JSA, an UNC official said. Although specific information is classified, the rule focuses more on maintaining armistice condition than detailing military response to North Korea’s possible provocations, the official said. Some military officials here suggested South Korean armed forces’ own rule of engagement should be applied to the JSA, as they have assumed the major role of protecting the jointly controlled area for more than 10 years. The unit in charge of maintaining the security of the JSA is United Nations Command Security Battalion of Joint Security Area. US lieutenant colonel serves as its commander, while South Korea’s lieutenant colonel serves as his deputy.  The South Korean Army would consult with the US to apply the South Korean Army’s rules of engagement “in a flexible manner,” so that the Korean JSA battalion commander can take appropriate measures to North Korea’s military threat, an anonymous military official told Yonhap News Agency. “We’re going to consult with the UNC to allow South Korea to return fire immediately when there is a gunshot from North Korea and there is a sign that a North Korean solider would bring harm to our forces,” the official said. Doctor Lee Cook-jong. YonhapFaced with the controversy, the UNC said it would release surveillance camera footage on Thursday to determine whether North Korean bullets were flown into the UNC-controlled area and whether the chasing soldiers crossed Military Demarcation Line, de facto border between the two Koreas. If the North Korean soldiers were found to have crossed MDL and fire shots even after the fleeing solider crossed the border line, it would be a violation of armistice agreement between North Korea and the UNC, military officials said. Meanwhile, doctor Lee, who performed the three-and-a-half-hour surgery on the wounded soldier, said although the surgery was successful, the soldier is still in a “critical condition.” The second surgery started at 9:30 a.m.“Given the fact that the soldier was in shock for a long period of time from massive bleeding, we could see more serious complications than average patients. It’s a quite delicate situation,” the doctor said in a press briefing. The doctor also told the reporters that the soldier’s intestine was infected by dozens of “parasites,” which he said had thrived before the soldier was wounded from the gunshot. Some of them are as long as 27 centimeters, he added.By Yeo Jun-suk","four north korean soldiers ,gunshot wounds he suffered ,chasing defected soldier ,from multiple gunshot wounds ,nk chasing defected soldier","['north korean', 'South Koreans', 'south korean', 'north korean']",27,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.05239385 0.03092504 0.27004364],Yeo Jun-suk,Defense,11,2017,"disclosed underwent second surgery wednesday ,south korean soldiers rescued ,wounded from the gunshot ,surgery on the wounded soldier ,underwent second surgery wednesday","['north korean', 'South Koreans', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Lee Cook - jong', 'Seoul', 'US', 'JSA', 'South Korea ’s', 'Defense', 'Song Young', 'north korean', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'the Korea heraldlocate', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'JSA', 'the UN Command', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'the south korean Army', 'JSA', 'US', 'UNC', 'Vincent K.

Five bullets – including those from an AK-47 assault rifle – were found on his body, according to South Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff. North Korea has yet to comment on the incident, the first JSA defection to the South in 10 years. While being surrounded by military outposts and minefields, JSA is a sought-after tourist destination for foreign visitors. “Our assessment is that three North Korean soldiers and another from the North’s military outpost chased him as he fled, firing shots,” JCS top operational chief, Army Gen. Suh Wook, said during a meeting with lawmakers. Doctor Lee Kuk-jong tells reporters about the condition of the North Korean soldier hospitalized at Ajou University Medical Center in South Korea on Tuesday. The soldier drove a jeep toward the Military Demarcation Line, which bisects the two Koreas inside the JSA, until it became stuck in a ditch and could not move forward. The soldier jumped out of the vehicle and ran to the South, the JCS saidAlongside the United Nations Command, which assumes operational control inside the JSA, the South Korean military is investigating whether North Korea violated an armistice agreement in their response to the defection. When asked about whether North Korea fired shots into the UNC-controlled area, the JCS said they had yet to confirm such evidence. South Korea’s Defense Minster Song Young-moo, however, told lawmakers that “it was the first incident in which North Korean bullets had flown across the border inside the JSA.”“We have yet to find evidence of North Korean bullets south of the MDL,” said a JCS official under the condition of anonymity. “If we found any violation of the armistice agreement, we will file a complaint toward North Korea.”  The UNC, which also confirmed that fleeing soldier was fired upon by other North Korean soldiers, said they have notified North Korea that the soldier was medically treated following the gunshot and an investigation into the incident is underway. The soldier can be seen in surveillance footage being chased by North Korean soldiers at 3:14 p.m. on Monday, according to the JCS. Seventeen minutes later, the soldier was found collapsed in bushes 50 meters south of the MDL, bleeding heavily. A South Korean battalion commander crawled to the injured soldier and dragged him out of harm’s way at 3:56 p.m., the JCS said.The defector was then transported to Ajou University Medical Center and underwent surgery for about five hours, the JSA added. The soldier had been hit in the elbow and shoulders, along with two shots in his abdomen. “So far, five bullets have been removed from his body and we are paying attention to seven injured organs. After monitoring the developments for a couple of days, we will proceed with another surgery,” the JCS official told reporters. During the process, there was no exchange of fire between the two Koreas, as South Korea did not react. “I think our soldiers did a good job. They made a good judgment call to minimize the risk and deal with the North Korean soldier appropriately,” South Korea’s Defense Minister Song Yong-moo told the lawmakers Tuesday. JCS operational chief Gen. Seo wook told lawmakers that it is still unclear whether the North Korean soldiers fired shots toward the UNC-controlled southern portion of the MDL even after the defected solider crossed the border. Military officials said that if the North Korean soldiers were found to have fired shots inside the South, it would be a violation of the armistice agreement that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War.The rules of engagement inside the JSA largely consists of two parts: whether there was a direct threat to the South Korean and UNC forces and whether the situation runs the risk of escalation, Gen. Seo told the lawmakers. “Through the UNC armistice committee, we will demand appropriate measures by the North,” said the minister. “If North Korea rejects the offer, we have no choice but to take the necessary legal steps and announce a statement.”By Yeo Jun-suk","his injuries five bullets ,military around 40 gunshots ,korean soldier who defected ,ak 47 assault rifle ,injuries five bullets including","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'the Joint Security Area', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",27,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.17536701  0.17881952

All members of the group have been sentenced after admitting to conspiracy to cause criminal damage. Some of them have been jailed up to 14 months. The two vandals caught in Korea were involved in several offences of graffiti with the SMT tag in Manchester and London, with the total cost of damage amounting to 160,000 pounds. By Kim Da-sol","jail for vandalizing seoul ,for vandalizing seoul trains ,british graffiti duo sentenced ,vandalizing seoul trains local ,vandalizing seoul trains","['british', 'the Seoul Eastern District Court', 'SMT', 'english']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20200799 -0.06513283

""The decision was said to have been made against Kim's wishes.""Kim has allegedly been ostracized by other staff there after giving the interview. In the rare on-camera appearance, Kim alleged that Choi, who was at the center of a corruption scandal that led to the ousting of Park, recommended Jun Dae-joo as the South Korean ambassador to Vietnam in 2013. He also said she might have been involved in appointing Park Noh-wan in 2015 as consul general in Ho Chi Minh City.Jun left office in April 2016. Park Noh-wan worked with Jun at the Vietnamese Embassy before he was named consul general. Jun's appointment, in particular, raised eyebrows, since he had no background in diplomacy or public office. The foreign ministry explained at that time that he was chosen to bring in fresh blood.  South Korean Ambassador to Myanmar Yoo Jae-kyung None of the allegations surrounding the diplomats in Vietnam have been confirmed. The two in question also denied the claims. A foreign ministry official said that Kim's return is currently ""under consideration"" and the final decision will be made ""in the weeks to come."" Asked if the interview might have been a factor in the decision, the official declined to comment.Kim has worked in Vietnam for about 16 years and recently received an award from the Vietnamese government for his contributions to improving ties between South Korea and Vietnam, marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations this year.He was said to have been ordered to return home earlier this year but argued against it, citing unspecified personal reasons.The November interview drew keen attention as the country was in the midst of the snowballing scandal involving then-President Park and Choi, who are currently standing trial for extorting a large amount of money from businesses.In April, South Korean Ambassador to Myanmar Yoo Jae-kyung offered to resign after it was revealed that he had been recommended by Choi. Kim earlier claimed that Yoo had been mentioned as a potential ambassador to Vietnam. Kim In-sik, head of the Korea International Cooperation Agency, a state-run overseas aid agency, also delivered his intention to step down in the same month amid allegations that he was chosen by the same scandal-ridden figure for the post.","after controversial whistleblowing interview ,year after controversial interview ,home after controversial whistleblowing ,korean diplomat in vietnam ,controversial whistleblowing interview south","[""South Korea 's"", 'Vietnam', 'Kim Jae - cheon', 'south korean', 'Ho Chi Minh City']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.11217883  0.60953814

Seo Hae-soon, widow of late singer Kim Kwang-seok The case drew nationwide attention after a documentary film about the singer, produced by TV journalist Lee Sang-ho, raised such suspicions. Police began looking into the suspicions in September after Lee and a brother of the late singer filed complaints requesting an investigation.Police questioned the widow three times and Kim's brother twice. Forty-seven others were also interviewed as witnesses, including the doctor who treated Kim's daughter as well as TV journalist Lee.Officials said they determined there was no evidence that the widow intentionally neglected the daughter.Police have confirmed that the daughter was diagnosed with a simple cold and experts have also told police that her condition could have deteriorated rapidly because she was suffering from a rare disease known as Kabuki syndrome. Investigators also took into consideration the fact that an autopsy of her body at the time determined that she died of a lung disease and that no unusual elements other than cold medicine were found in her blood. The outcome is in line with the investigation 10 years ago.At that time, police also closed the daughter's case as accidental, based on the autopsy that concluded her death was caused by acute pneumonia, with no signs of external injuries. Kim the musician committed suicide in 1996, when he was 32. His death sent shock waves through fans and the public, who loved his plaintive yet captivating vocals and sentimental lyrics that critics say portrayed individuals' sorrow and frustration at a time when the society was struggling in its early stage of democracy following rapid industrialization.","death of daughter police ,late singer kim widow ,old die of pneumonia ,kim widow over death ,widow of late singer","['Kim Kwang - seok', 'Kim', 'Seo hae - soon']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29002395  0.12821683

The inspection came after an international lawyers' group claiming to represent Park accused the South Korean authorities in October of human rights violations. It said the former president is in a cell that is ""dirty, cold and constantly lit so she cannot sleep."" The NHRC said Park's cell has three windows -- two on the outer wall and one on the corridor side -- that enable enough air and sunlight to come through. The room is designed to heat up if the temperature falls below 18 C. ""The wall and floor were observed to be generally in clean conditions,"" the report said. ""However, the inspection failed to check the sanitary conditions in the toilet since entry was forbidden,"" it noted. The NHRC report said the authorities provided her with an extra mattress since she complained about severe back pain.

At a time when different interpretations of Islam -- from purist to reformist, and from Shiite to Sunni -- are engrossing Iranian domestic politics and the larger Middle East, the envoy conveyed his personal view that a true Muslim ought to live scrupulously in line with Islamic teachings and norms, and not enforce his or her belief on others.“I tell you that religion is an important aspect of humanity, particularly in the Middle East societies,” he told The Korea Herald at the embassy in Seoul. “Religion plays a crucial role in shaping the Iranian society’s morality and encouraging people to live good lives.” The Middle East powerhouse is an Islamic republic, where more than 90 percent of people associate themselves with the Shiite branch, the official religion of the state. Five to 10 percent of Iranians belong to the Sunni or Sufi denominations, and there are small minorities of Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians and others. Iran became an Islamic republic after the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Iranian Ambassador to Korea Hassan Taherian “I tell you that as a Muslim, regardless of your vocation, one of your duties is to practice Islam in a faithful way and encourage others to follow. This is an individual duty,” he said. “Government officials are also encouraged to promote Islamic teaching and views. But they do not in any way try to enforce their beliefs on others. By being a good example of a Muslim, living a pious, honest and socially oriented life, others will think Islam is a force for good.”Taherian agreed with the notion that moderate Islam is more compatible with globalization and integration with different cultures. He explained there are various stances on the Islamic ideological spectrum, with “purists” or “extremists” of the Salafi movement -- an ultraconservative branch of Sunni Islam -- on one hand, and “reformists” or “moderates” -- dedicated to engaging the world and developing their societies with modernity -- on the other hand. The fundamentalists aim to remake the world mirroring the teachings of Prophet Muhammad who lived 1,400 years ago, he explicated, while reformists try to see through Muhammad’s message and distill his essence in a rapidly progressing world.Both views exist in Iran on all levels of the society, government and institutions, he added, saying international cooperation would be easier for Muslims with a “flexible” attitude. A mosque and holy shrine in Bidgol, Iran Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia, a Sunni powerhouse, has also faced the exigencies of religious moderation. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman recently promised a return to “a more moderate Islam,” in a bid to refashion the kingdom as an attractive, stable destination for foreign business and investment. To pave the way for its “Vision 2030” strategic development plan, aimed at diversifying the petroleum-driven national economy for the post-oil era, the prince lifted several restrictions, including the one barring women from driving, set to fully go into effect next year. “Saudi was not like this before 1979. Saudi Arabia and the entire region went through a revival after 1979,” he said at the Riyadh’s Future Investment Initiative conference in late October, referring to the year the country strengthened its ties with Wahhabi ultraconservative establishments to compete for regional power against conservatizing Iran in the Islamic Revolution. Taherian said the Iranian constitution as well as various societal rules and regulations are based on Sharia, and although not all laws are based on Islamic law, they should not run counter to it. Analysts have said Iran’s constitution -- hammered out in the wake of the 1979 revolution -- is one of the sources of perennial conflicts between ultraconservatives and reformists, as it contains conflicting principles of democracy and theocracy. Iran’s Majlis parliament has 290 representatives and their legislations are checked by the Guardian Council, comprising 12 Islamic leaders, or imams. Mezquita Nasir al-Mulk in Shiraz, Iran On the question of cultural collaboration with Korea, the diplomat argued that both societies should focus on their commonalities rather than differences. He said Korean TV dramas are popular in Iran, and Iranian films are critically acclaimed worldwide and increasingly appreciated by cinema aficionados here. “Koreans in general don’t know much about Islam and its cultural subtleties and differences,” the ambassador said, adding that Korean media outlets tend to import and air the perspectives of Western channels, dominated by news of violence and terrorism. “So people understand Islam through the angle of Western cultures, not Korea’s own eyes. It takes time to understand the Middle East and its cultures and religion through your own perspective. It’s important for a journalist to have a firsthand observation and understanding of Islam.”By Joel Lee","faithfully practiced islam believing ,to modernization iranian ambassador ,moderate islam holds key ,has faithfully practiced islam ,faithfully practiced islam","['iranian', 'Korea Hassan Taherian', 'Islam', 'Muslim', 'Islam', 'Shiite', 'Sunni', 'iranian', 'Muslim']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41075796  0.53182262

The list was posted on the Seoul government's official gazette.""Those individuals have worked overseas, representing North Korean banks and getting involved in supplying money needed to develop weapons of mass destruction,"" a foreign ministry official said. The move comes after the North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear blast test on Sept. 3 and is in line with the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 2375 adopted days later which focused mostly on curbing the North's imports of oil products. The US and other major countries have announced their own sanctions against the North in line with the global body's resolution.The latest sanctions by Seoul will likely be symbolic as there will be no practical impact since all transactions have been banned for years between the two Koreas. The 18 people are already on the blacklist announced by the US Treasury Department in September.The government still expected that its unilateral sanctions will help squeeze money going into Pyongyang that could be used in advancing weapons of mass destruction programs and remind the world again of the danger of having any transactions with the blacklisted individuals.The individuals on the list include Kang Min, representative of Korea Daesong Bank in China; Ri Un-song, representative of Korea United Development Bank in Russia; and Ku Ja-hyong, chief representative of the Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It also hoped that the latest action will accelerate global efforts to implement existing sanctions that have been adopted against the North. Seoul's standalone sanctions were announced a day before US President Donald Trump is to arrive in South Korea on Tuesday for a two-day stay during which he will have a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. North Korea and its evolving nuclear threat will be high on the agenda during their talks.On Sunday, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and her US counterpart Rex Tillerson held a phone discussion to fine-tune preparations for the upcoming meeting between their leaders and expressed hope that it will demonstrate the ironclad alliance and highlight their close coordination to resolve North Korea's nuclear stalemate. South Korea's unification ministry said that Seoul's move is expected to help cut off sources of foreign currency that can assist North Korea's weapons development.""The sanctions are expected to help raise awareness about risks from trade with North Korea. They are also likely to encourage the international community to avert dubious business with the North and to be cautious about such a trade itself,"" Baik Tae-hyun, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.","unilateral sanctions south korea ,blacklists 18 nk banking ,korea blacklists 18 nk ,its latest unilateral sanctions ,korea blacklists 18","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'China', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.21952616  0.18927471

McMaster, national security adviser to President Donald Trump, said the regime appeared to fit the criteria for designation following its alleged murder of leader Kim Jong-un's half-brother early this year.""That is an option that's under consideration. And so the president's Cabinet is looking at this as part of the overall strategy on North Korea,"" he said during a White House press briefing that previewed Trump's upcoming trip to Asia. National security adviser H.R. McMaster gestures as he answers questions from members of the media during the daily briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017. ""A regime who murders someone in a public airport using nerve agent, and a despotic leader who murders his brother in that manner, I mean, that's clearly an act of terrorism that fits in with a range of other actions,"" he added. ""So this is something that's under consideration. And you'll hear more about that soon, I think.""Under a law enacted Aug. 2, the State Department had 90 days to determine whether North Korea should be relisted. That deadline fell around Thursday.The communist regime was put on the list in 1988 for an airliner bombing that killed all 115 people aboard. In 2008, it was taken off in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.The US left North Korea off its latest list of state sponsors of terrorism in July.State sponsors of terrorism face restrictions on US foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and financial and other sanctions. But relisting North Korea is largely seen as symbolic because it is already under extensive sanctions for its nuclear and missile programs.""Though North Korea is under a set of UN sanctions, Washington's possible redesignation is expected to have a symbolic impact as the move would mean tougher pressure,"" Lee Eugene, vice spokesperson at Seoul's unification ministry, told a press briefing Friday.","terrorism mcmaster washington seoul ,considering relisting north korea ,sponsor of terrorism mcmaster ,of terrorism mcmaster washington ,murder of leader kim","['WASHINGTON', 'SEOUL', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'US', 'H.R.

Thae Yong-ho speaks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington on Oct. 31, 2017. ""Before any military action is taken, I think it is necessary to meet Kim Jong-un at least once to understand his thinking and to try to convince him that he would be destroyed if he continues his current direction.""The North Korean leader does not have a full grasp of the strength and might of US military power, Thae said, leading him to believe that if he can get Washington to accept Pyongyang's possession of ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US, all sanctions against his regime will be lifted.The former diplomat is in Washington at a time of heightened tension over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile testing. US President Donald Trump is set to travel to Asia on Friday in part to rally further support behind his administration's sanctions and pressure campaign.But Thae appeared to question the US policy.""We can educate the North Korean population to stand up by disseminating outside information,"" he said. ""However, is the United States really doing enough in this regard? The US is spending billions of dollars to cope with the military threat. Yet how much does the US spend each year on information activities involving North Korea in a year? Unfortunately, it may be a tiny fraction.""Thae defected to South Korea last year with his wife and two sons.

42,42,[Herald Interview] Looking beyond national interests with Turkey,"Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal was a third grader in elementary school in Mainz, West Germany, when his father suddenly passed away in 1963. Left with his bereaved mother and two younger brothers, Okcal would not forget the help his family received from a Turkish consul during their arduous time away from home.“My mother used to say, ‘You should become a patriotic diplomat like the consul,’” the envoy told...","Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal was a third grader in elementary school in Mainz, West Germany, when his father suddenly passed away in 1963. Left with his bereaved mother and two younger brothers, Okcal would not forget the help his family received from a Turkish consul during their arduous time away from home.“My mother used to say, ‘You should become a patriotic diplomat like the consul,’” the envoy told The Korea Herald last week at the recently reopened Turkish Embassy in Seoul. “That motivated me to become a diplomat. Over the next 40 years, with a career spanning Europe, Africa and Asia, I would not have a single idle day.”Wrapping up four years of his last ambassadorship in Korea, Okcal said he wished to go into teaching and public service after retirement. The 63-year-old diplomat plans to return home this year and retire in a year.“The Turkish-Korea relations are moving brightly forward,” he said. “We are rising middle powers with increasing influence in regional and global arenas, and cooperate closely bilaterally and through the United Nations, G-20 and MIKTA, among others.”Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal poses at the recently reopened Turkish Embassy in Seoul. The embassy, which was previously in Yongsan-gu, relocated to Jangchoong-dong, Jung-gu last month, on the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Turkey and Korea. The diplomatic mission now has a niftily repurposed five-story building overlooking Namsan and downtown Seoul, 60 years after the two nations opened their embassies in Ankara and Seoul on Sept. 30, 1957. “Last year was a difficult year due to terrorist attacks and the failed coup attempt, but this year opened a new chapter in our relations. Turkey is embracing law and order again, and a sense of normalcy has returned,” according to the envoy. Recent major collaborative infrastructure projects include the Eurasian Tunnel, bridging Europe and Asia beneath the Bosporus, which was built by a Turkish-Korean consortium and opened on Dec. 20. Another Turkish-Korean partnership is constructing the 1915 Canakkale Bridge, which will be the world’s longest suspension bridge when it is completed in 2023, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the Turkish republic.Hyundai, Samsung and LG have made large investments in Turkey, and the two governments are spurring investments by small and medium-sized enterprises, according to Turkey’s Foreign Economic Relations Board. Okcal pointed to recent large investments in entertainment and renewable energy in Turkey, including CJ-CGV’s $800 million acquisition of Turkey’s Mars Cinema Group in April last year; and a joint venture between Korea’s Hanwha Q Cells and Turkey’s Kalyon Energy for 1-gigawatt solar panel manufacturing plants in Karapinar, Konya Province, as well as capital Ankara. Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal poses at the recently reopened Turkish Embassy in Seoul. One key pillar of Okcal’s diplomacy in Korea has centered on Turkish veterans’ affairs. Turkey sent 21,000 troops to defend South Korea from North Korea’s invasion during the 1950-53 Korean War, during which 1,000 Turkish soldiers lost their lives and 1,400 sustained injuries. Some 3,000 Turkish veterans are still alive and a select number of them come to Korea on a rotational basis annually through the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs. The soldiers established the Ankara School and Orphanage in 1952 in Suwon, a sanctuary for orphans taken into custody by Turkish troops from ravaged battlefields. After their numbers swelled to over 100, the orphans were housed at the newly instituted Ankara school, with over 800 graduates between 1952 and 1967, when the school closed. The embassy and the city government of Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, inaugurated a new park in memory of the orphanage in 2013. Two-way trade turnover has hovered at $7 billion-$8 billion over the last two years, and cumulative bilateral investment topped $2 billion last year. Some 320 Korean firms operate in the Turkish market of $906 billion, while over 80 Turkish companies have launched businesses in Asia’s fourth-largest economy of $1.5 trillion.The two countries’ free trade agreement entered into force on May 1, 2013. Under Okcal’s tenure, Turkey and Korea also held numerous meetings and consultations through G-20 and MIKTA, an informal alliance of middle powers Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Australia, led by their Foreign Ministers and dedicated to enhancing global governance. “MIKTA doesn’t focus on specific or concrete issues, but raises larger issues of regional and global significance based on each country’s own set of concerns,” noted the diplomat. As examples, he explained that Korea is largely concerned with nuclear nonproliferation and countering the threat of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations, while Turkey has concentrated its efforts on containing crises in the Middle East and resultant instabilities from refugee migration and terrorist attacks. The 10th MIKTA Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New York on Sept. 22, 2017 “We don’t have much larger stakes in these issues like the superpowers US or China, therefore it’s easier to raise our concerns and search for solutions together. It’s more like supporting a good friend,” he said. Okcal also stressed the need to reform the United Nations system, a leviathan often criticized for its willful ignorance of the world’s most critical problems. Analysts point to the Security Council’s structure -- comprised of permanent members and nuclear power states of the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France -- as the source of diplomatic gridlocks. “Because of the way the UNSC works, the other 188 countries have less say in international affairs compared to these five permanent members,” Okcal said. However, citing broader problems engulfing the Middle East, Europe, Asia and beyond -- related to matters of security, mass migration and global warming -- he also said the international community cannot do without the UN. “MIKTA countries can raise awareness for reforming the UN for more equitable governance and effective decision-making.”Regarding the future of international cooperation, the envoy said he remained hopeful, noting that younger generations of diplomats, intellectuals and citizens progressively engage and communicate with each other. “There is cause for optimism. They are better educated, well-traveled and technologically savvy. When I started my diplomatic service during the Cold War, we didn’t know anything about the other side, nor what was going on the other side of the ideological sphere. Hierarchy was also very stiff.”Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal  poses with his spouse Mrs. Pinar Okcal , diplomats and defense attaches of the Turkish Embassy at a reception marking the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Turkey and Korea at Lottel Hotel on Monday. On the question of the Middle East’s future, he said the region, where terrorist group Daesh has left abominable deaths and destruction in its wake, has much potential for rebirth.“The long-term solution to the Middle East has to be sustainable development,” the diplomat asserted. “The destroyed cities of Syria and Iraq, such as Aleppo, Raqqa, Tal Afar and Mosul, need to be rebuilt. Turkish and Korean companies can join hands to reconstruct these former ‘jewels’ of ancient civilizations. But the funding has to come from affluent countries and institutions with stakes in the region.”Okcal also touched on recent instabilities arising out of Iraqi Kurdistan’s desire to break free as a new nation-state. “Breaking up is not a solution,” he said. Such “unilateral declaration of independence cannot bring desirable outcomes for anybody.”Analysts say the dream of an independent Kurdistan remains distant and unlikely, as all regional countries Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey, where Kurds live as minorities, fear the secession could trigger separatist movements within their own borders.“The Middle East has been embroiled in wars and conflicts over last several decades, so let’s not start another crisis,” the ambassador advised. “What we need is more stability, cooperation and dialogue.”By Joel Lee","germany when his father ,his bereaved mother ,two younger brothers okcal ,family received from turkish ,third grader in elementary","['turkish', 'Arslan Hakan Okcal', 'Mainz', 'West Germany', 'turkish']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72888207  0.79106158

All South Korean churches in Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, were closed as of early this month.The Chinese authorities have offered no clear reasons for the measures taken against South Korean religious people and churches. A worship service at a Chinese church. A source said the Chinese side strongly recommended South Korean religious people return home as they believed South Korean pastors in the region close to the border with North Korea were involved in activities supporting North Korean defectors. ""As they were sent back home, churches were closed automatically,"" the source said. The authorities' action is also interpreted as a pre-emptive measure before China implements the new ordinance on religious affairs, which will take effect Feb. 1 of next year. The endorsement in September of the ordinance by the State Council, China's Cabinet, is aimed at strengthening controls to ""eradicate extremism.""Under the ordinance, organizers of unapproved religious activities in China will face fines of up to 300,000 yuan  and anybody providing a venue for ""illegal religious events"" will face fines of between 20,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan. The new rules, which apply to all religions ranging from Christianity to Buddhism, also allow lower-level authorities to take care of affairs relating to unsanctioned religious activities, which will bring religious groups in China under tighter scrutiny.","hundreds of korean religious ,churches closed as china ,governments in northeastern china ,their churches closed as ,china three local governments","['China', 'China', 'south korean', 'China']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44114345  0.40275997

A South Korean man , identified only by his family name Kim, appears at North Shore District Court in Auckland, New Zealand, on Oct. 29, 2017. South Korean police earlier sought cooperation from New Zealand authorities in determining Kim's whereabouts, his custody and extradition. South Korea has an extradition treaty with New Zealand.The result of the trial for Kim on the theft charge, the details of which are not known, is expected to determine when he will be extradited, the official said.New Zealand has also signed a treaty with South Korea to facilitate mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, increasing the prospect of bringing Kim to justice here. South Korean prosecutors have asked the court to extend his detainment until he would be extradited to South Korea, as the man, who holds New Zealand citizenship, is feared to be released prior to his extradition given that his charge is believed to be subject to trial without detention. The New Zealand authorities have remained cautious about the procedures for Kim's extradition. A spokesman for New Zealand police was quoted by a local newspaper as saying, ""Extradition proceedings have not been received, for that reason, police cannot add anything further at this stage.""The spokesman also said New Zealand Police are continuing to interrogate the suspect and liaise with Korean authorities through Interpol.Kim is accused of killing his mother and half-brother on Oct. 23 in the city of Yongin, south of Seoul, before murdering his stepfather the same day in Pyeongchang in northeastern South Korea.","south korean fugitive extradited ,killing his mother stepfather ,korean fugitive extradited at ,murderer extradited yongin south ,korean fugitive extradited","['YONGIN', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'New Zealand', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'New Zealand']",27,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.53553116  0.31692213

Among the debtors, only North Korea has never implemented a debt repayment, it said. The North's debt to Sweden arose after it never came through with payment for 1,000 Volvo 144 model cars and several orders with other Swedish companies in 1974. The debt, originally amounting to SEK 600 million, has swollen to SEK 2.7 billion due to the accumulated interest.Roslund told the service that the publicly funded Swedish Export Credit Agency, a government agency serving as a credit insurer for company's trade deals, takes charges of the North's debt and reminds the North twice every year about them.An official at the Swedish carmaker said the North's failure to honor the debts has prompted EKN to be involved in the case and Volvo has suffered no financial damage, the report said.Volvo manufactured the four-door Volvo 144 model from 1966 to 1974 as one of an entirely new car series. A total of 1.25 million units of the model were produced and more than 1 million units were sold, marking the first time in the company's history that more than 1 million units of a car model were sold.","volvo cars bought 43 ,korea still using volvo ,using volvo cars bought ,korean service said volvo ,volvo 133 model cars","['North Korea', 'Volvo', 'Pyongyang', 'Sweden', 'Voice of America', 'swedish', 'Katarina Roslund', 'VOA', 'Korean Service', 'Volvo', 'Pyongyang', 'Volvo', 'VOA']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71179026  0.27246037

""Our government is working on the listing with the basic attitude that a lesson should be learned from the comfort women issue,"" foreign ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk told reporters during a regular press briefing.Deliberation will get under way this week in Paris on a possible listing of the documents related to the atrocities by Japan on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. The spokesman made the remarks in response to a question seeking comments on Japan's protest against the Seoul government's push. The Japanese said that pushing for UNESCO listing of related documents might run counter to the spirit of a controversial deal reached between the two countries to address grievances on wartime atrocities committed by Japan. In December 2015, the two countries reached the deal under which they agreed to ""finally and irreversibly"" resolve the comfort women issue. Tokyo gave an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.According to historians, more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were coerced into sexual servitude in front-line Japanese brothels during World War II, when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony. Those sex slaves were euphemistically called ""comfort women."" Japan has long attempted to whitewash the dark history.Saying that the deal lacks a public consensus, the Moon Jae-in government is currently reviewing the process by which it was reached under the previous administration, hinting that it could be scrapped or revised. Japan says that both countries have to faithfully enforce what was agreed upon by their governments.","women forced into japanese ,japanese wartime brothels ,women issue foreign ministry ,into japanese wartime brothels ,women south korea foreign","[""South Korea 's"", 'japanese', 'UNESCO', 'Noh Kyu - duk']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.71360016 -0.13392231

DPRK is the abbreviation of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Choe reiterated that the North made the ""strategic decision"" to possess nuclear weapons to deter the military threat from the US, saying that it is the only way to maintain its security and peace both on the Korean Peninsula and the Northeast Asian region, he added. Asked what steps the US should take to give up its hostile policy, Choe cited US President Donald Trump's recent threatening tweets against the North, saying that it is the reason why the North cannot come to the negotiating table. Choe also said that the North is ""not committed"" to the Sept. 19 joint statement under which the North promised to give up its nuclear programs in exchange for diplomatic and economic concessions, and that it will not be going back to the long-suspended six-party denuclearization talks, the official said. ""For a diplomatic and peaceful resolution, the correct atmosphere should be created, but at a time when there are daily threatening tweets from President Trump, the North cannot sit down for talks,"" she was quoted as saying.Choe didn't dismiss the importance of multilateral efforts altogether, but as the US is leading efforts to crush the North to death, she said that the North doesn't see how other countries could play any role, according to the official. ""North Korea will not be moving an inch,"" she said, if the US keeps up its push to lead the North toward collapse.The six-party talks involving the two Koreas, the US, China, Russia and Japan started in 2003 to persuade the North to give up its nuclear aspirations. However, discussions have not been held since late 2008, when the North walked away from the negotiating table.Choe joined the conference amid tensions that have heightened since the North defiantly conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last month. It was attended by diplomats, former government officials and private-sector experts from around 40 countries. As South Korea sent its deputy nuclear envoy to the event, it raised expectations that there could be contact of some kind between the two Koreas, but nothing meaningful was arranged.","official north korean diplomat ,way out seoul official ,korean diplomat who recently ,north korean diplomat ,north korean diplomat who","['north korean', 'Moscow', 'the United States', 'north american', ""North Korea 's""]",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6360448   0.75878084

A woman identified in court as Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong approaches Kim and clasps both hands on his face from behind before fleeing. The second suspect, Indonesian Siti Aisyah, can’t be seen during the alleged attack but police officer Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz testified that he identified her as a person seen running away in a different direction. Wan Azirul told the court that Huong’s manner was “aggressive” and she didn’t apologize to Kim, like she did to another person she approached at the airport two days earlier. A video of that encounter, which was described as a practice session for smearing Kim’s face with VX nerve agent, was also shown to the court. Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong The women are seen in other videos hurrying to separate restrooms, holding their hands away from their bodies as if to avoid contact. Wan Azirul testified that their hands were in normal positions after they left the restrooms. He said there were restrooms on the floor where the attack took place, but the women went to restrooms one floor down. Prosecutors contend the women knew they were handling poison, and a chemical weapons expert who testified earlier said VX could be removed safely by careful hand-washing within 15 minutes of exposure. The expert, a government chemist, detected traces of VX on Huong’s fingernail clippings and on both women’s clothing, and testified that the amount of VX detected on Kim’s face exceeded a fatal dose. “She seemed to be anxious,” Wan Azirul told the court. “From my observation, Doan has been informed and knew what needed to be done. Even though she seemed to be in a panic, she knew what to do.” Their defense lawyers have said Huong and Aisyah were duped by suspected North Korean agents into believing they were playing a harmless prank for a TV show. Wan Azirul testified that Kim was carrying $100,000 in cash in his backpack. Security videos shown later in the day traced Kim’s movements after he was attacked. He gestured to his eyes and face while meeting with police officers, and he appeared to stagger as he walked with one officer to the airport medical clinic. An unconscious Kim was later seen being pushed on a gurney and pumped with oxygen by medical staff. Videos of the women show they went to the airport taxi stand after leaving the restrooms. One showed Huong, wearing a white long-sleeve top emblazoned with the letters “LOL” -- the acronym for laughing out loud -- and a blue skirt, waiting at the taxi stand. Aisyah, dressed in a gray sleeveless top, jeans and a scarf, then arrived and got into a taxi that appeared to be waiting for her while Huong was still in the taxi line. Wan Azirul said Aisyah removed her scarf during the attack on Kim and put it back on after she came out of the restroom. Huong and Aisyah have pleaded not guilty to murder charges that carry a mandatory death sentence if they are convicted. The videos, including some that had already been released by news media, were captured from security cameras around the airport. The two women appeared to be on their own and there was no indication that they knew each other. Earlier, the court was shown a video of Huong buying a taxi voucher at the airport two hours before the attack on Kim. Aisyah, meanwhile, was seen in another security video meeting with an unidentified man at a cafe near the attack area 45 minutes before the assault on Kim. The video showed the man, wearing a black baseball cap and glasses, arriving at the cafe holding a white plastic bag. He then set up his cellphone on a selfie stick on a table just before Aisyah arrived. They chatted and had a drink, and the man handed a ticket to Aisyah before she left. Wan Azirul later identified the ticket as a taxi voucher. The judge, lawyers and the two suspects are expected to visit the crime scene next week.","murder trial on wednesday ,at their murder trial ,women trial shah alam ,attacked at malaysian airport ,their murder trial","['shah alam', 'Malaysia', 'North Korea ’s', 'malaysian', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Viet']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4165892   0.17231578

His crime was revealed afterwards when the victim’s family reported his suspicious behavior to the police.

According to Rep. Rhee Chul-hee of the ruling Democratic Party, a trove of operational schemes drafted by the South Korea and the US militaries were leaked by hackers of North Korean origin, who breached South Korea’s military intranet and internet server in September last year. Among the secrets stolen were the OPLAN 5015, which includes the so-called decapitation plan of the regime’s leader Kim Jong-un, and the OPLAN 3100, which deals with the North’s small-scale provocations such as its artillery attack on a South Korean island of Yeongpyong in 2010, Rhee said. “It was confirmed that suspected North Korean hackers hacked into the Defense Integrated Data Center and caused a massive leak of classified military documents,” Rep. Rhee said Tuesday, referring to the military network system managed by the Defense Ministry. The ministry’s spokesman Moon San-gyun declined to comment on Rhee’s claim, citing security concerns. Combined Forces Commander Gen. Vincent K. Brooks inspects his units at CFC headquarter in Yongsan, Seoul. YonhapThe leak of operational plans was reported in December last year for the first time. At the time, the ministry acknowledged that some classified information had been leaked, but said the breach was “not serious” because most operational plans were updated.  Rep. Rhee, citing an undisclosed ministry report that he had obtained, claimed a total of 235 gigabytes of data containing classified documents were stolen by the hackers. Only 20 percent of them had been identified by the ministry. The leaked data included 295 classified documents, with 226 designated as “secret,” 42 as “confidential” and 27 for “official use only.” More than 80 percent of 226 secrets were related to the allies’ special warfare operation inside North Korea in the event of a war, according to Rhee. “Some of the leaked documents include nonclassified military information about South Korea’s missile defense operational concept, such as Kill-Chain,” an aide from Rhee’s office was quoted as saying by local daily Chosun Ilbo. Among the leaked documents about the decapitation plan were detailed procedures to monitor the movement of the North Korean leadership, contain their shelter and escape routes, conduct an air assault on facilities and destroy the leadership or secure their whereabouts. Earlier this month, Defense Minister Song Young-moo revealed a plan to establish a “decapitation unit” by Dec. 1. Although specific task organization has remained confidential, analysts suspect it would be a brigade-level unit consisting of US-type special warfare forces. Meeting minutes about the joint military exercise Ulchi Freedom Guardian, military documents about the protection of military units and civilian structures, and even reports to the allies’ senior commanders were also leaked, the lawmaker said. North Korea has been suspected of launching a series of cyberattacks targeting South Korea’s military network, financial system and government infrastructure. The communist regime has also been blamed for the outbreak of ransomware in May that affected hundreds of thousands of computers around the world.If the latest version of operational plans has fallen into the hands of North Korea, Pyongyang would be better able to cope with the allies’ pre-emptive strike, leaving the allies more vulnerable to North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile capabilities, an analyst said.“An operational plan details our military maneuvers down to the specific level. It means that Kim Jong-un is able to keep track of every movement and can respond to it,” said Shin In-gyun, president of Korea Defense Network, a Seoul-based think tank. By Yeo Jun-suk","alleged north korean hacking ,tuesday after lawmaker revealed ,south korea on tuesday ,korea on tuesday after ,korean hacking of south","['South Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Rhee Chul - hee', 'Democratic Party', 'the South Kor']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.07468376  0.33919436

Park Han-shik, a professor emeritus at the University of Georgia, said Sunday  that Carter wants to play a role in resolving the serious situation, just as he did in 1994 during the Bill Clinton administration. Park said he met Carter last month at the 93-year-old American's residence in Georgia.  In this Sept. 15, 2016, file photo taken by the Associated Press, former US President Jimmy Carter speaks at a Baptist conference in Atlanta. ""To raise the credibility of his intentions, we talked about Carter sending his opinion on the current situation to the newspapers,"" Park said. ""He did write an editorial, and his intention to visit Pyongyang has already been delivered to North Korean officials. We have yet to get answers from the North Koreans, but I'm sure they're giving it deep consideration.""In his editorial published by the Washington Post on Oct. 4, Carter warned of another possible Korean war, and he wrote that the US should consider sending a ""high-level delegation"" to North Korea for peace talks. Park said Carter offered to help to current US President Donald Trump several times, but did not get a positive response. According to Park, Trump told Carter that North Korea issue should be handled by the current administration, not by a former president. Trump also reportedly told Carter to leave him alone, Park added. The Georgia University professor said Carter doesn't specifically want to be a special envoy, although visiting North Korea with such position can give him more authority. ""We still have to watch North Korea's reaction,"" he said. ""We might be able talk with Trump again if North Korea sends an official invitation. Should Trump steadfastly oppose the idea then we have to think about what we'll do next.""","south korea born professor ,president jimmy carter wishes ,washington former us president ,pyongyang recent nuclear ,korea born professor","['WASHINGTON', 'US', 'Jimmy Carter', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Han', 'the University of Georgia', 'Carter']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.68688935  0.62871128

59,59,Seoul irked by NK’s secret use of joint factory complex,"Revelations that North Korea has been secretly operating South Korea-invested factories in a joint industrial park shuttered in 2016 have angered South Korean officials, politicians and businesspeople. But there seems to be no practical way to stop the North’s “illegal use” of South Korean properties.  The Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint industrial park in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. (Yonhap)On F...","Revelations that North Korea has been secretly operating South Korea-invested factories in a joint industrial park shuttered in 2016 have angered South Korean officials, politicians and businesspeople. But there seems to be no practical way to stop the North’s “illegal use” of South Korean properties.  The Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint industrial park in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. On Friday, North Korea’s propaganda outlet Uriminzokkiri claimed that “it’s nobody’s business” what it does at Kaesong Industrial Complex, where its “sovereignty is exercised.” It also vowed to run the factories more actively and to show how its citizens are currently working “with confidence” there. The factory park, established as a symbol of inter-Korean economic cooperation in 2004, was closed in 2016 following a flare-up of tensions. The 124 South Korean firms, which had hired North Korean workers to produce clothes, shoes and watches there, had to leave everything behind after an abrupt eviction order. Radio Free Asia reported last week that the North has been running at last 19 textile factories there for months now. Seoul’s Unification Ministry denounced the North, saying it should refrain from infringing on the property rights of South Korean companies. However, it stopped short of mentioning countermeasures, saying it needs to first check relevant details.The South’s opposition parties strongly condemned the North and urged the Moon Jae-in administration to respond in a swift manner. “Kaesong industrial park, which was shut down in February 2016, must be operated under the joint consent of two Koreas and cannot be revived on the North’s decision alone,” Jeong Tae-ok, the floor spokesperson for the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, said in a statement released Saturday. Jeong added that North Korea has infringed South Korea’s property rights by resuming operation of the complex and expressed worries over the South Korean government’s capability to control the situation amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. “The current administration continues to say that it has yet to check on the matter. How will it respond to North Korea which seems to be ?” Jeong added. Lee Jong-chul, spokesperson for the minor opposition Bareun Party, echoed Jeong by labeling North Korea’s decision “an illegal act which can never be tolerated.”“It is a violation of the agreement for the normalization of Kaesong industrial park, which protects corporate assets and guarantees corporate activity at a global level,” said Lee on Saturday.The inter-Korean agreement for normalization of Kaesong industrial complex was signed by both Koreas in 2013 after Pyongyang removed 53,000 North Korean workers from the park, which led to a temporary shutdown. Clause 2 under the agreement guarantees protection of South Korean corporate assets and personnel within the complex regardless of the situation on the peninsula, which North Korea seemingly refused to uphold. Meanwhile, the South Korean operators behind the firms will hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss Pyongyang’s decision to use their property.“North Korea cannot just resume operation  without consulting with us and water and power supply was cut-off before the shutdown ,” said an unnamed Kaesong businessman Sunday. “They have seen us manage the complex for more than a decade, so it is possible they may know how to operate ,” he added, calling the North’s resumption of the complex as an unprecedented move. Suspicions over North Korea’s secretive operation of the complex have been mounting since its official shutdown in 2016, on the back of foreign media reports that suggested there were activities within the area. On top of the recent Radio Free Asia report, Voice of America on Aug. 21 said that about 100 South Korean vehicles in Kaesong had mysteriously disappeared in June. A secured satellite image showed the vehicles, which had been untouched as of the end of 2016, were gone, indicating North Korea had moved them elsewhere.The joint industrial complex in the border city of Kaesong was shuttered in 2016, under suspicions that the revenue generated from the business was funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program development.

61,61,Chemist says VX byproduct was on Kim murder suspect's shirt,A Malaysian government chemist testified Thursday he found a byproduct of VX nerve agent on the shirt of the Indonesian woman on trial for the murder of the half brother of North Korea's leader.   The testimony was the first evidence linking VX to either of the two suspects accused of smearing the nerve agent on Kim Jong Nam's face in a crowded Kuala Lumpur airport terminal in February.  Government chemist Raja S...,"A Malaysian government chemist testified Thursday he found a byproduct of VX nerve agent on the shirt of the Indonesian woman on trial for the murder of the half brother of North Korea's leader.   The testimony was the first evidence linking VX to either of the two suspects accused of smearing the nerve agent on Kim Jong Nam's face in a crowded Kuala Lumpur airport terminal in February.  Government chemist Raja Subramaniam told the court he found VX acid, a byproduct of the banned chemical weapon, on Siti Aisyah's sleeveless T-shirt. Indonesian Siti Aisyah  and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong Raja said VX will degrade when it reacts with water, leaving the detectable byproducts, and a person can fully decontaminate their hands by washing and scrubbing within 15 minutes.   Witnesses who testified earlier in the trial that started on Monday said VX was found on Kim's body and belongings and acute VX poisoning caused his death.   Aisyah and the Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong have pleaded not guilty to murder charges that could bring the death penalty if they are convicted. They have not testified but their defense has said the women believed they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and were tricked by men suspected of being North Korean agents. On Wednesday, the judge and court officials wore face masks and surgical gloves as VX-tainted evidence was presented in court.   A pathologist said VX, its precursors and its byproducts were detected in Kim's eyes, on his face, in his blood and urine, and on his clothing. Mohamad Shah Mahmood testified that the fastest absorption would have been through the eye mucus and that once VX entered the bloodstream, ``there is a very slim chance of survival.''    Prosecutors and defense lawyers examined the VX-tainted samples, which were sealed in transparent plastic bags, during a court break. Most of them wore gloves and masks as a safety precaution, and later, Judge Azmi Ariffin also covered himself as the samples were officially admitted as evidence.   Prosecutors also Wednesday sought to show VX was the sole cause of death. Mohamad Shah testified that drugs used to treat diabetes, hypertension and gout were in Kim's blood, but those drugs and those conditions would not have caused his swift death. Earlier testimony showed Kim died within two hours of being attacked, not within 20 minutes as earlier stated by Malaysia's health ministry. Gooi Soon Seng, defense lawyer for Aisyah, had disputed the VX findings on Wednesday, before the chemist testified a byproduct was found on his client's shirt.   VX is banned by an international treaty as a weapon of mass destruction but is believed to be part of North Korea's chemical weapons arsenal. Kim was the eldest son in the current generation of North Korea's dynastic rulers but was believed to have been cast out by his father and had lived abroad for years. He reportedly never met current leader Kim Jong Un, who is widely believed to have perceived his older sibling as a threat and targeted him for assassination.   The trial is being closely watched by the Indonesian and Vietnamese governments, which hired the defense lawyers for both women.","government chemist testified thursday ,murder suspect shirt malaysian ,indonesian woman on trial ,on kim murder suspect ,kim murder suspect","['malaysian', 'VX', 'indonesian', ""North Korea 's"", ""Kim Jong Nam 's"", 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Raja S']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13841048  0.30277672

62,62,[Feature] Ethnic Korean-Chinese fight ‘criminal’ stigma in Korea,"Outside Exit 12 of Daerim Station, the main street is lined with restaurants bearing Chinese signs and street food stalls.

They lure Chinese of Korean descent living and working here with the taste of home -- northeastern China.  The Daerim-dong area is the largest enclave of the ethnic Korean-Chinese community, or joseong-jok, in Seoul, but this vibrant neighborhood has become a place that many South Koreans avoid at night. Daerim-dong “I wouldn’t go there at night, to be honest,” said a 31-year-old man, who only gave his surname Seo and has never been to Daerim-dong. “Based on what I saw in movies and heard from others, the image that springs to mind when I think of Joseon-jok is that they are scary people and Daerim-dong is a scary place,” he said. Despite their vast number here -- some say there are up to 700,000 -- ethnic Korean-Chinese people are one of the most stigmatized minorities, often associated with heinous crimes as depicted in local media. According to a 2015 survey on 248 Koreans in their 20s and 30s by Korea Research Center, 59 percent of the respondents had negative perceptions about them. Some 70 percent admitted that Korean society discriminated against Joseon-jok. Ethnic Korean-Chinese fighting prejudice Joseon-jok’s anger and frustration about their image recently reached a boiling point, following the release of the film “Midnight Runners.”The action-comedy flick triggered outrage among Joseon-jok, who say it spreads the long-standing stigma labeling them as potential criminals and depicting Daerim-dong as an unsafe place.   Daerim-dong Some 70 ethnic Korean-Chinese people held a protest on Aug. 28 against the film’s producer and distributor in Daerim-dong, demanding the suspension of the movie’s screening, an official apology and financial compensation. In the film, Daerim-dong is depicted as a lawless district where “even police cannot enter” and “undocumented Chinese wield knives.” It also shows Joseon-jok gangsters kidnapping runaway teens to sell their organs. The movie garnered more than 5.6 million viewers as of Sept. 19 since its release in August. “I know films are fictional, but such a film has an adverse impact on us. When this kind of film is out, Koreans treat us like criminals who they should avoid,” said Kim Suk-za, the head of Ethnic Korean-Chinese Association. “We have tried to shed the image for decades by abiding by local law, patrolling our neighborhood and picking up trash, but I am so sad that it seems like all of our efforts are in vain.” Poster of the flim ""Midnight Runners""It is not the first time that ethnic Korean-Chinese people have been portrayed as criminals. In the flick “Yellow Sea” , the main character is an ethnic Korean-Chinese contract killer. In the movie “China Town” , a Joseon-jok gang is depicted as selling human organs. “We try to earn money and form a family while abiding by the law so as not to be kicked out. Why should I be treated like a potential criminal? It is humiliating,” said a 46-year-old Chinese man of Korean ethnicity, who only gave his surname Choi. Descendants of Koreans who migrated to China centuries ago began to move back to South Korea in 1992 when the country opened diplomatic relations with China. They came here mostly to seek economic opportunities as speaking the same language and sharing the same ethnicity made it easier for them to get a job here. Joseon-jok largely settled in Daerim-dong and Garibong-dong, where there were many factories and affordable housing. Yang Soon-young 46, who runs a Chinese restaurant selling lamb skewers, says that the film has taken a toll on her business. “Some 30 percent of my customers used to be Koreans. I get almost no Korean customers now,” said Yang. “I think it might be because of the image that Daerim-dong is a breeding ground for crimes.”“I worked hard, did jobs Koreans were reluctant to do and paid taxes. But this is still how Koreans see us,” she said. “My life in Korea is difficult enough, but such a prejudice makes it even more miserable.” The growing anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea amid a diplomatic row with China over the deployment of a US anti-missile system here further deals a blow to the ethnic Korean-Chinese community. Since South Korea decided to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here last year to defend against the North’s missile threats, China has taken what appears to be retaliatory measures, such as a ban on the sale of package tours to South Korea. China has strongly opposed the missile defense system, saying it is a threat to its own security. “The decision to deploy THAAD took a toll on our businesses. Many Joseon-jok heavily rely on businesses with Chinese. We can earn money when Chinese tourists and traders come to Korea,” said Baik Soon-ok, a staff member at a travel agency for Chinese tourists. “I used to arrange 100 tours for groups of Chinese, let’s say, now I only see one tour group coming to Korea.”Reality behind prejudice The stigma against joseok-jok is largely based on some highly publicized crime cases involving ethnic Korean-Chinese over the past decade. In 2012, Oh Woon-choon, a Korean-Chinese man, was sentenced to life in prison for abducting and murdering a 28-year-old woman and dismembering her body in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. His cruelty shocked the public, as the victim’s body was chopped into more than 300 pieces. Daerim-dong In another high-profile murder case, Korean-Chinese Park Chun-pung brutally butchered his girlfriend, also a Korean-Chinese, in Suwon in 2014. He also received a life sentence in jail. But on average, foreign residents are less likely to commit crimes than Koreans, government data shows. According to a 2014 crime analysis by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, there were 28,456 crimes committed by foreigners, putting their crime rate at 1.6 percent. As for Koreans, 1.87 million crimes were committed, placing the crime rate at 3.7 percent. The study, however, did not look specifically at Chinese nationals. In Daerim-dong, where 1 in 4 residents are ethnic Korean-Chinese, 471 severe crimes, including murder and rape, took place in the first half of this year, down 25 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. “The reality in Daerim-dong is completely different from how it was depicted in the film,” said a police officer working in the area, who declined to be named. “The public safety in this area is not particularly worse than other areas.” Daerim-dong at night To shed the “criminal” image stuck in many Koreans’ minds, some 70 Korean-Chinese residents have voluntarily patrolled the neighborhood in turns to boost public safety since 2010.“I have rarely seen violence or murder in recent years in Daerim-dong. Things have changed a lot, compared to 20 years ago. We feel safe,” said Kim, the head of Ethnic Korean-Chinese Association. How prejudice was shaped The way ethnic Korean-Chinese are depicted in films is a reflection of how ordinary Koreans perceive them and such a perception has been formed over decades, an expert said. “Many of the Koreans who say Joseon-jok are scary have not even met them in person,” said Lee Jean-young, a politics professor at Inha University. “In the early years of their settlement, many Chinese of Korean descent, who mostly came from rural areas and had a low level of education, did not follow the rules of public etiquette, for example, spitting on streets and littering anywhere, which was not appropriate by Korean standards,” said Lee. Some 70 ethnic Korean-Chinese people held a protest on Aug. 28 against the film’s producer and distributor in Daerim-dong, demanding the suspension of the movie’s screening, an official apology and financial compensation. Furthermore, media reports about crimes by ethnic Korean-Chinese people and the depiction of them as criminals on TV worsened the “distrust and hatred” toward them, he explained. In addition, there is a large number of ethnic Korean-Chinese here. “As Koreans are faced with them more often than other foreigners, it is easier to spot Joseon-jok behavior that makes them feel uncomfortable,” said Oh Jung-eun, a senior researcher for IOM Migration Research and Training Centre. As of the end of 2016, the number of foreigners in Korea was 2.04 million, with the majority, or 49.6 percent, holding Chinese nationality. The ethnic Korean-Chinese community believes that there are about 700,000 ethnic Korean-Chinese residents settled in Korea, the biggest group of ethnic Korean-Chinese outside their enclave in Northeast China. There are an estimated 1.8 million ethnic Korean-Chinese around the world. Many are descendants of Korean refugees and independent movement fighters who fled Korea to escape Japanese colonial rule. Ethnic Korean-Chinese people’s low social and economic statuses are also behind Koreans’ largely unfavorable feelings toward them, Oh said. “South Koreans encounter Chinese of Korean descent in their everyday lives as low-skilled workers who moved to Korea to do blue-collar jobs. That likely led to Koreans looking down on them and treating them as a lower class in society.” Most Chinese of Korean ethnicity come here on C-3, F-4 and H-2 visas, which are given to overseas Koreans. Men usually work at construction sites and women find jobs as caretakers, nannies and restaurant servers, with most of them at the bottom of the income scale. Shin Hae-ran, a geography professor at Seoul National University, said that ethnic Korean-Chinese people publicly protesting against the stigma could be a positive step for society. “Existing prejudice against women, children and animals have been eroding little by little while going through conflicts in society, which has not acknowledged them as equal citizens,” Shin said. “Ethnic Korean-Chinese are taking collective action, so people are taking interest in the reality , which is one of the ways to respond to ”By Ock Hyun-ju","korean chinese fight criminal ,ethnic korean chinese fight ,korean chinese fight ,many south koreans avoid ,criminal stigma in korea","['chinese', 'chinese', 'korean', 'China', 'Daerim - dong', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'South Koreans']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39251241  0.21755685

The council plans to hold similar meetings with officials of the German and Canadian embassies set for next month.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.

He also said the plan is tantamount to ""pouring cold water"" on bilateral efforts to develop the relationship in a forward-looking manner.""The South Korean government's position is that efforts to commemorate the comfort women issue as a historical lesson will continue regardless of the comfort women deal,"" foreign ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said.""Under this position, our side has told Japan that the construction of the memorial monument does not run counter to the comfort women deal,"" he noted. South Korea's previous Park Geun-hye government signed the deal in December 2015 to settle the grievances of Korean women mobilized to serve at front-line brothels for Japanese troops while the Korean Peninsula was under Japan's colonial rule from 1910 to 1945.The new administration of President Moon Jae-in is currently reviewing the legitimacy of the deal, however, after declaring that it was signed without public support.","south korean gender ministry ,korean gender ministry plan ,japanese chief cabinet secretary ,korean gender ministry ,for women sexually enslaved","[""South Korea 's"", 'japanese', 'Japan', 'japanese', ""Yoshihide Suga 's"", 'south korean']",27,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.36521336  0.15614995

Exact figures for the demand of such products on local e-commerce sites under E-Bay Korea were unavailable, but another online shopping mall Auction said earlier this month that the demand for combat rations had increased 77 percent while portable radios jumped 46 percent between Sept. 2 and Sept. 5. Pyongyang conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3. A shipping company headquartered in Gangnam, Seoul, delivered special survival kits to its employees on Sept. 22, Yonhap News Agency reported Monday. The company posted an official announcement asking its workers to pick up their packages containing “emergency survival products necessary in the current situation in and out of our nation.”The kit contains a total of 15 wartime necessities such as combat rations, a lightweight sleeping bag, a hand-cranked radio, a first-aid kit and other products for survival. “I was confused  at first, but I thought it wouldn’t be bad to have a war survival kit at home after watching recent news,” an unnamed employee at the firm told Yonhap. A growing number of South Koreans are also uploading photos of self-prepared survival kits on social media, according to recent reports. Korean media has labeled such people as a new generation of “preppers” -- a modern interpretation of the “doomsday preppers” during the Cold War.Seoul’s Interior and Safety Ministry also recommends citizens to prepare at least one “go-bag” per family. It suggests packing products that can sustain a family for at least 72 hours. North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday threatened to take “merciless preventive action,” if the US displays any sign of an “decapitating operation” toward the rogue state. This follows Ri’s separate comment to reporters, saying that the North is considering the detonation of a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific. US President Donald Trump claimed the US could “totally destroy” North Korea if it decided to attack the US, during his maiden speech to the UN General Assembly on Sept. 19. North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan on Sept. 15 closely following its sixth nuclear experiment, in clear defiance of Trump’s latest rhetoric and the United Nation Security Council’s fresh set of sanctions against its regime.

The remains will be laid to rest at the UN Memorial Park in Busan on Wednesday after being provisionally laid in state at the National Cemetery in Seoul, according to the ministry.Aldewereld came to Korea as a private first class in August 1951, when the Korean War was at its peak.  Johan Theodoor Aldewereld He returned home to be discharged in July 1952 after engaging in fierce battles, including a hand-to-hand fight against North Korean soldiers in Gangwon Province. He revisited South Korea for the first time in decades in May last year at the ministry's invitation. For many years, the ministry has run a program to invite foreign Korean War veterans to visit the nation again as a token of the country's thanks for their sacrifices. After returning home from the trip, the Dutchman sent his nation's ambassador to South Korea, Lody Embrechts, a letter containing his appreciation for the Korean government, as he was deeply touched by the immense economic development of South Korea from the ruins of war and the government's respectful treatment of foreign veterans. He died in February at 88, leaving a will that stipulated his ashes be ""buried in the Republic of Korea where my comrades lie in eternal sleep.""

Overall, the situation seems extremely vague and it really keeps us on edge,” he said. Shin’s Corporate Association of Kaesong Industrial Complex represents the entire 123 Kaesong tenant companies, which were once an embodiment of the South’s “sunshine” engagement policy toward the communist regime. However, Seoul’s decision to evacuate the complex, which closely followed North Korea’s fourth nuclear test in January 2016, left many of the businessmen jobless and debt-ridden.“We continue to hear rumors of our properties in Kaesong allegedly being stolen by North Korea,” said Lee Jong-duk, CEO of Young Inner Foam, a textile manufacturer, with evident frustration in his voice. Like other tenants, Lee had to leave almost everything behind in Kaesong industrial park, when the abrupt eviction order arrived: factory equipment, raw materials, food, vehicles and other basic supplies, as well as products all set for shipment. “After we abandoned the industrial park on an extremely short notice last year, we haven’t been able to go back -- it scarred our businesses and lives,” he said. His concerns are in line with the Voice of America report on Aug. 21 which found that about 100 South Korean vehicles in Kaesong had mysteriously disappeared in June. A secured satellite image showed the vehicles, which had been untouched as of the end of 2016, were gone, indicating North Korea had moved them elsewhere.Lee and other tenant businessmen wanted to visit the abandoned industrial zone to recover some of their assets, but were denied permission as inter-Korean tensions increased. “Frankly, I personally got the impression that the government didn’t want us to talk about the visitation rights ,” Lee added. Kaesong industrial park housed mostly small- and medium-sized manufacturers of shoes and clothing that sought to tap cheap labor in the North. According to local reports, the shutdown dealt a devastating blow. Some 32 out of 51 firms that depended entirely on production at Kaesong had to re-establish factories and businesses in Southeast Asia, while eight had to hire contract manufacturers, as of 2017. The rest are believed to be technically defunct. Instead of offering a solid promise for the reopening, the previous Park Geun-hye administration, which decided on the withdrawal, handed a 501.7 billion won  state fund to the Kaesong firms last year which aims to cover about 63.8 percent of an estimated total loss of 780 billion won. But the association claims the amount is insufficient, saying it does not cover the losses in Kaesong nor the total investment in re-establishing new facilities. The Unification Ministry, under the new Moon Jae-in administration, vowed to make additional compensation in July, but specific guidelines including an exact figure and a deadline were not revealed. Unification Ministry spokesperson Baik Tae-hyun said Wednesday that they are currently working on it in cooperation with the Office for Government Policy Coordination. “Although we can’t confirm anything at the moment , we have been consistently talking with the Kaesong firms to bring about a long-term solution,” a ministry official told The Korea Herald. “We believe Kaesong industrial park is part of the function that drives toward a peaceful reunification.”The official added there are no specific updates to the compensation guidelines yet, following the latest adoption of UNSC sanctions. “Our businesses within the shuttered complex are worth more than the financial compensation offered to us by the government,” Lee said. “Kaesong industrial park holds the advantage of smoother communication, domestic manufacturing, and low distribution cost -- it was a very rewarding business in many ways.” Before taking office, it was Moon’s goal to revive stalled inter-Korean economic projects and reopen and further develop the Kaesong industrial park, as he aims to carry on the legacy of the previous liberal administrations’ sunshine policy. Moon’s vision, however, has been heavily burdened by Pyongyang’s refusal to abandon its nuclear and missile development. Military tensions have dramatically risen on the Korean Peninsula as the North accelerated its push to develop a long-range missile and nuclear warhead capable of striking the US mainland. By Jung Min-kyung","casualties of korean crisis ,crisis south korean business ,korean government is late ,forgotten casualties of korean ,casualties of korean","['south korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kaesong', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41889781  0.1757524

Over 1,300 women and children, all foreign nationals and relatives of Islamic State militants, are reportedly being kept in this camp. The ministry first learned the news via foreign media on Sept. 10, but said they are experiencing difficulties with the identification process as many of the detainees lack official documents.About 1,333 women and children are reportedly being held in a camp under Iraqi authorities after the jihadist group surrendered territory last month. The northern town of Tal Afar, near Mosul, was considered one of the last remaining IS group strongholds in Iraq. The suspected Koreans were spotted among the detainees, although the vast majority of the group were seemingly from Central Asia, Russia and Turkey, the Associated Press reported Sunday, citing anonymous Iraqi officials. It is unclear whether they were forced to commit or joined of their own volition. The officials stressed that the women and children would not be charged with crimes and are likely to be repatriated to their home countries. Meanwhile, some of the captured fighters are being questioned while others had been shot on attack attempts after false surrender, an Iraqi military commander told the AP. Iraqi intelligence is in the process of verifying the nationalities of detainees while its government is eyeing to negotiate with embassies for their return, according to Reuters. The exact number of Korean nationals involved in the extremist group is unknown. Seoul’s National Intelligence Service has previously admitted it is technically impossible to confirm an exact figure. In 2015, a then-17-year-old South Korean teenager surnamed Kim made headlines as police here said he embarked to Syria via Turkey to join the militant group. Kim had reportedly maintained contact with a group member and displayed pro-IS group tendencies online. Over the years, South Korea has been relatively out of reach from IS group threats and attacks in both geographical and diplomatic terms, compared to other nations in North America, Europe and the Middle East. In spite of this, the spy agency here said in June 2016 that the extremist group had designated several US Air Force installations and nationals here as potential targets for attacks. Seoul’s long-standing alliance with Washington is perceived as the main catalyst behind such threats made against Korea. By Jung Min-kyung","fighters detained in iraq ,family members the korean ,000 wives and children ,working to identify koreans ,detained in iraq","['korean', 'Islamic State', 'Iraq', 'iraqi', 'United Nations', 'the Red Cross', 'Iraq', 'the Foreign Ministry']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5560354   0.35647589

He met with four surviving victims, all in their 90s, including Lee Ok-sun and Lee Yong-soo. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder visits surviving South Korean victims of sexual slavery during World War II. Some 200,000 young women are estimated to have been taken to the front-line brothels to serve Japanese soldiers in the war that ended in 1945. There are only 35 surviving South Korean victims. ""It's regrettable Japan hasn't taken courage to speak of the violence  or talk to those who were sacrificed by the brutality of the war,"" the veteran politician said. The former head of the European country offered words of consolation on the rare occasion, holding his hands tight with the victims as he embraced each one of them. ""The undeserved violence inflicted on these ladies is irreversible. I am saddened to meet with such people. The world needs to know the painful history,"" he said. He also called on Japan to admit to its guilt and apologize over what it did, as is the last wish from the victims who have said they are not asking for it out of revenge or hatred, but in acknowledgement of what it did in the past. ""I, too, earnestly want it to happen in my lifetime."" The 73-year-old, who led his country from 1998-2005, expressed full support for the Seoul government's move to push for recommending the victims as candidates for the Noble Peace Prize, saying ""they are more than eligible."" He also paid his respects to the memorial monument for the comfort women, a euphemistic term for the sexual slavery victims, and visited the museum established for the victims. Earlier in the day, Schroeder delivered a speech at the National Assembly, in which he backed South Korean President Moon Jae-in's policy principle toward resuming talks with North Korea. He said Moon should adhere to his stance ""even though it may be a tough road,"" despite the heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula following the North's nuclear test on Sept. 3 deemed to be the most powerful.","slavery former german chancellor ,sexual slavery former german ,leader consoles korean victims ,german leader consoles korean ,monday surviving south korean","['german', 'Gerhard Schroeder', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'the House of share', 'Seoul', 'japanese']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.50382107  0.45769981

Judge Kim Jin-wook of the Seoul South District Court cleared two Jehovah’s Witnesses of violating the Military Service Act, in the latest addition to a string of court rulings in favor of conscientious objectors. The men, both aged 23 years old, were charged with disobeying the government’s order to enlist in the military in 2014 because of their faith. The judge said their noncompliance had “justifiable reasons” and it was due to the government’s “negligence” to provide alternative ways to serve the country. Under a universal conscription system, South Korea requires all able-bodied men to serve in the military for at least 21 months. It is a core part of the country’s defense against North Korea. The two Koreas are still technically at war, as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with a cease-fire, not a peace treaty. There are about 20,000 conscientious objectors in South Korea who have gone to jail for refusing to serve in the armed forces on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience or religion since military service became compulsory for all able-bodied men during the 1950-1953 Korean War. Conscientious objectors have been uniformly sentenced to 18 months in prison. “Korea was presented with specific measures to adopt an alternative military program in 2007 and five relevant legislative bills, but all of them were discarded without being discussed,” the judge said. “If they were sufficiently reviewed, the country could have enacted a law  and implemented it, but that didn’t happen, because of the country’s negligence,” he said, addressing the need to solve the “unconstitutional state” by establishing an alternative military program.This year alone, more than 30 conscientious objectors have been acquitted. But the Supreme Court maintained that conscientious objection is illegal, overturning the acquittals on 16 cases this year.Still, there are rising hopes for a change. Both nominees for chief justices at the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court signaled at their support for adopting an alternative military service program in the country. The Constitutional Court ruled against conscientious objection twice, in 2004 and 2011, prioritizing national defense over individual rights. A decision has been pending with the court since a petition was filed in 2011.By Ock Hyun-ju","judge says government negligent ,south korean government failure ,court cleared two jehovah ,korean government failure ,jehovah witnesses of violating","['south korean', 'Kim Jin - wook', 'Jehovah ’s']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.08942063  0.42299354

Korean immigrants groups in the US have expressed their concerns and regret after the Trump administration on Tuesday rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, in a move that could affect some 800,000 beneficiaries in the country. “Koreans here appear to stay relatively calm. I am not saying they were not surprised, but they have prepared themselves for the possible scrapping of DACA, as it has been widely expected under the Trump administration,” a Korean immigrant based in the US told The Korea Herald, declining to be named. “Even if their DACA expires, it is not likely they will be immediately deported because it takes a long process to deport those who have no criminal records,” she said. President Trump scrapped DACA, calling the program enacted under previous President Barack Obama in 2012 “unconstitutional.” In a statement, he said he did not “favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.” The “Dreamers” scheme enabled young migrants who were brought to the US illegally as children to apply for work and study without fear of deportation. According to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the number of beneficiaries of DACA was 1.54 million as of March, with some 80 percent of them from Mexico. South Koreans were the sixth biggest group of beneficiaries, totaling 17,625. Another Korean immigrant, who has lived in Chicago for more than five years, said that the scrapping of DACA has a limited impact on Koreans in general, because most of the unregistered immigrants in the US are not subject to the scheme. “I don’t think Koreans are greatly affected. Because many unregistered Koreans here do not qualify for DACA in the first place,” said Simon Yang, 33, who said he has a few friends granted DACA. To qualify for DACA, applications should be under the age of 30, have a clean criminal record, and either be in school or have recently graduated. In return, the US government allowed them a temporary immigration status to stay in the US for a period of two years, which was extendable. “I personally think that those who will stay in the US illegally will do so and those who will return to Korea will do so, regardless of the lifting of DACA,” yang said. While existing recipients will not be affected for at least six months, the period of time allocated for the US Congress to deliver on legislative solutions, no new applications can be made. People holding DACA status will be able to keep it until it expires and people whose permits expire in less than six months can renew it before Oct. 1 for another two years. Politicians, civic organizations and business executives including Obama, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook slammed Trump’s move. In a lengthy post on Facebook, Obama blasted the decision, saying “To target these young people is wrong -- because they have done nothing wrong. Ultimately, this is about basic decency.”“We are so much more than a country that defines our neighbors by who they are on paper. The Korean American Coalition will continue to stand with our Dreamers and work with community partners to advocate on their behalf,” said Joon Bang, Korean American Coalition executive director. “Members of the House  and Senate have the opportunity now to act with urgency and pass legislation to support DACA recipients.”It is now up to the US Congress to decide whether to safeguard DACA recipients. Several proposals have been put forward, including the Bridge Act, a bipartisan bill with 25 co-sponsors that would extend DACA protections for three years to give the US Congress time to enact legislation.","migrants from deportation korean ,regret after the trump ,young south koreans illegally ,south koreans illegally residing ,from deportation korean immigrants","['South Koreans', 'the United States', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'korean', 'US', 'Trump', 'the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6870656   0.39444178

It was very shocking  back then.”Based on this and other anecdotes, Nam said he was able to draw some clues about Kim Jong-un’s personality despite his meager public exposure back then. “ I thought that he had extremely rough manners and characteristics -- that he was definitely going to complicate things when he comes to power,” added Nam.“I had hoped my predictions wouldn’t become true, but it is unfortunately taking shape.” Nam stressed that although it is crucial not to cultivate fear against the current North Korean leader, Kim must not be underestimated and assessed in a simple manner. He was referring to the South Korean media’s approach toward Kim when he ascended to the head of North Korea in 2011. Nam said that most of the media outlets here had the view: “What could a young fellow like him do?”The expert also pointed out that Kim Jong-un likes to demonstrate his power and his position more publically compared to his late father and former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, which could be why he released photos that showed him signing orders for the latest nuclear test. According to Nam, Kim Jong-un was tapped by his father to lead North Korea after Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke in August 2008. He was chosen, despite being the late North Korean leader’s youngest offspring, because the eldest Kim Jong-nam had spent most of his life overseas. Kim Jong-il also ruled out his middle child Kim Jong-chul, who reportedly suffers from hormone imbalance. Kim Jong-nam was killed in Malaysia earlier this year in what appears to be an assassination organized by North Korean agents. By Jung Min-kyung","ex south korean spy ,eliminated if north korea ,provocations expert north korean ,korea threat to global ,korean spy agency official","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Nam Sung - wook', 'Korea University ’s', 'south korean', 'Liberty Korea Party']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36519811  0.29298416

Nam introduced an anecdote about the then 15-year-old Kim who was studying in Bern. “I was very shocked to find out how Kim swore at his girlfriend over the phone when she asked him to quit smoking,” he recalled. “This rough manner he displayed made me think things would get complicated once he becomes the ‘king’ of the nation.” Nam claimed Kim’s uncontrollable temper has to do with the North’s recent provocations, warning that hostile acts will continue unless Kim is removed from his seat.Professor Nam Seong-wook is speaking at the Liberty Korea Party general meeting Wednesday.","temper north korean leader ,party general meeting wednesday ,real temper north korean ,provocations north korea expert ,temper through his teenage","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Switzerland', 'North ’s', 'North Korea', 'Nam Seong - wook', 'Korean Unification', 'Korea University', 'Kim', 'the Liberty Korea Party']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77032065  0.6571427

The National Police Agency said it has detained the four suspects, including a 29-year-old man, only identified by his last name Cho, and sent the case to the prosecution. They are suspected of buying some 238,000 pieces of private information from a broker, selling them here and abroad, and making transactions or taking out loans using the cloned credit cards. The amount of damage from the scheme roughly stands at 102.6 million won , according to the police.  A police officer demonstrates the process of copying a credit card during a press briefing on the ATM hacking case in Seoul on Sept. 6, 2017. In March, the police launched a probe into the case after the servers of over 60 ATMs operated by a local ATM service provider were attacked from an unidentified source.The investigation found out the traces of malware used in the hacking were similar to those revealed in the series of cyberattacks on government websites by North Korean hackers last year. The police said one of the suspects stated he obtained the private financial data from a middle man who claimed he got the information from a North Korean. But the exact amount of money they paid to the alleged North Korean hacker is yet to be determined given the evidence secured so far, the police added. The police said they plan to track down the broker and another Korean man involved in the scheme by requesting joint efforts from international law enforcement agencies.","arrested in atm hackings ,arrested three south koreans ,wednesday they arrested three ,atm hackings allegedly aided ,korean hacker the national","['South Koreans', 'korean', 'north korean', 'the National Police Agency', 'Cho']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23063594  0.60430533

Kim Hun was found dead inside an underground military outpost along the border with North Korea. A gunshot wound was found on the right side of his head and a 9mm Beretta pistol was near his body. The South Korean military determined that the then-25-year-old Army officer had committed suicide. But questions and doubts have mushroomed that he may have been murdered because of no apparent motive for suicide and evidence of a physical fight inside the outpost.Eight years later, the Supreme Court challenged the ministry’s decision, saying there was not enough evidence to determine Kim took his own life. Over the years, Kim’s father, a retired lieutenant general, demanded Kim’s death be treated as one related to military duty, not as a suicide case. The Ministry of National Defense had refused to heed the plea. After a decade of legal battles and civil petitions, however, the Defense Ministry on Friday changed its stance and recognized Kim’s case as a death in the line of duty, raising hopes the Army might reinvestigate what happened to Kim 19 years ago.   1st Lt. Kim Hun and his father. Yonhap“We are sincerely hoping that our decision gives consolation to the victim’s family, who has suffered for a long period of time. We will do our utmost to find out the cause of those losing their lives for mysterious reasons,” the ministry said in a statement. Including Kim’s case, five cases were recognized as deaths in the line of duty. Among them were Lim Yin-sik, who was found shot dead in 1969 when he served as a warrant officer at an Army division in Gangwon Province. The military determined that Lim committed suicide, but Lim’s wife questioned the result, saying he might have been killed for attempting to reveal wrongdoings in his unit. Kim and Lim were among soldiers who lost their lives for an unknown reason while serving in the military. According to the Defense Ministry, there are about 600 cases of “mysterious deaths” in the military, and only half of them have been properly investigated.   Most of the mysterious deaths have been classified as suicides by the Army, but surviving family members and human right activists have expressed doubt that the military might have reduced the scale of the investigation or even tried to cover up the cases. “When the military investigates suicide cases, their probe only focuses on who pulled the trigger and who tied the rope. Our argument is that we need to find out why they did it,” said Ko Sang-man, a former investigator dealing with mysterious deaths in the Army. Ko, who now serves as a human rights activist, asserted the military should overhaul the way it investigates suicide cases, saying military tribunals should grant investigation rights to civil courts unless the nation is at war. While suicide is the most common cause of death among service members, finding out the reason behind the suicide has often proved difficult in the military, which is reluctant to reveal its inner workings to the public. According to government statistics released by the Defense Ministry, since 2007 suicides constitute about two-thirds of military deaths. For example, among 81 soldiers who died in 2016, 54 took their own life. Faced with mounting calls for the overhaul, the ministry on Friday launched an internal organization dedicated to investigating mysterious deaths in the military. The ad-hoc agency will operate until August next year.“The military must play a proactive role in solving mysterious deaths in the military. In doing so, we are able to regain public trust and bring honor to the victims and their families,” Vice Defense Minister Seo Joo-seok said.

In the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, up to 6,000 Koreans were killed by Japanese people agitated after the government spread a rumor that Koreans planned a riot, according to historians.Seven victims' families launched the first association devoted to the incident which has not received much attention, even in Korea, compared to other atrocities by imperial Japan. ""It is deplorable that after this long time passed, the Korean government cannot even announce the identity of any single family of the victims,"" Oh Choong-kong, a Korean-Japanese producer of a documentary film about the tragedy, said during the ceremony at the state-run National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation in the southeastern city of Busan. He lamented that there is no government body to investigate the incident. In 2014, 103 South Korean lawmakers proposed a bill to establish a committee to investigate the incident, but it was not passed.The bereaved families will campaign to urge the two governments to investigate the incident and find out who the victims were. They are also demanding that Japan send the remains of the victims home and compensate their families for their deaths.The organizers held a memorial service to pay tribute to the victims at a former port in the city where they left for Japan after Korea fell under Japan's colonial rule in 1910. On Sept. 1, 1923, the magnitude 7.9 earthquake flattened Tokyo, Yokohama and surrounding prefectures, leaving some 400,000 dead or missing. A spree of killings erupted when the Japanese government spread a rumor about a planned riot by Koreans in order to calm public anger.    ""With the formation of the association, we will make efforts to have South Korea and Japan jointly bring light to the incident,"" Sumiko Yamamoto, who heads an executive committee to pay tribute to the massacre's victims in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture, said during the ceremony.","families of koreans killed ,earthquake massacre in japan ,1923 massacre in japan ,000 koreans were killed ,that koreans planned riot","['Koreans', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Koreans']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.3542783  -0.00560303

""The court should have considered that  did not have criminal intention, but wanted to avoid trouble if it refused the government's request,"" an official from a local business group said.Another official from a South Korean conglomerate said it is disappointing that the ruling came at challenging times when the country is facing diplomatic tension with China coupled with Washington's move towards protectionism.""Samsung Electronics takes up 11.9 percent of South Korea's manufacturing segment, and 30.7 percent of the combined operating profits,"" another official from a local biz group pointed out. ""The prolonged absence of Lee is expected to lead to side-effects.""South Korea's ruling party, on the other hand, cheered the decision.""The ruling targets the back-scratching alliance of government and businesses,"" said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the head of the Democratic Party. ""A company must be transparent to receive trust from the global community and beef up competitiveness.""The party chief expressed hope that the case may act as an opportunity for Samsung to become a socially responsible company.The minor opposition People's Party also said the business community should become more aware that South Korea is no longer tolerant to conglomerates' wrongdoings as seen by the case.Pro-Park lawmakers from the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, meanwhile, declined to deliver a comment on the verdict.Labor activists also welcomed the court's acknowledgment of Lee's corruption.""Lee has personally used state authority to facilitate its power succession, resulting in massive losses to the state pension,"" unionized workers of Samsung Electronics Service said.Prosecutors earlier sought 12 years against Lee, claiming Samsung's de facto leader offered or pledged 43.3 billion won  to win the state pension's approval for a merger between two affiliates under terms designed to increase his control over the entire business empire. The court ruled that Lee provided 7.2 billion won in bribes.The union also claimed Lee should have received a jail term beyond 10 years if the court had considered him an ordinary criminal, rather than the head of a conglomerate.""Lee provided Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil with bribes, which was the money that could have been spent on victims suffering from work-related diseases at Samsung,"" said Hwang Sang-gi an activist from the Protector of Health and Human Rights of Semiconductor Workers .

A family member weeps in front of an urn containing the remains of a former commando trained to infiltrate North Korea during a memorial service to enshrine the soldiers` remains at an Army facility in Byeokje near Seoul on Aug. 23, 2017. The former commandos belonged to a 31-member military unit that South Korea set up in April 1968 to carry out a mission to assassinate then North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un. With the camp established on Silmido, a barren islet off Incheon, west of Seoul, the ""684"" unit was launched following a botched attempt by North Korea the same year to assassinate then South Korean President Park Chung-hee.Seven of the 31 agents either died or were killed by fellow unit members during the training. On Aug. 23, 1971, the remaining 24 agents escaped from the islet after learning their mission was called off amid a thaw in inter-Korean relations.Feeling betrayed by the government and angry, the would-be assassins rebelled against the authorities to call the public's attention to their harsh training and unfair treatment.The heavily armed commandos, riding in a bus they had hijacked, were stopped at Yeongdeungpo in southern Seoul. After a gun battle with South Korean special forces troops, they blew themselves up with grenades. Four surviving commandos were court-martialed and sentenced to death in 1972, but their bodies have yet to be found.A Defense Ministry committee tasked with investigating the incident unearthed the remains of the 20 commandos, who were killed in the street battle, in December 2005. The ministry agreed with the bereaved families to install a separate facility where their remains will be enshrined and articles left behind by them will be on display.","former south korean commandos ,ex commandos from 684 ,seoul the soldiers families ,south korean commandos who ,south korean commandos","['the Ministry of National Defense', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Army', 'Byeokje', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54411477  0.17017493

It marks the first time for an association of bereaved families of the massacre to be established, although there are associations of bereaved families of victims of Japan's wartime sex slavery and forced labor, and the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. People carry a traditional Korean wooden bier, called ""sangyeo,"" and march down a street in downtown Seoul in this file photo dated Aug. 20, 2016, as they take part in a memorial service to mourn Koreans killed in the turmoil after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. In the 1923 massacre that followed the Great Kanto Earthquake, which flattened Tokyo, Yokohama and surrounding prefectures, more than 105,000 people died or went missing with 1-7 percent of them believed to have been killed. Koreans topped the list of people killed. While Chinese and Japanese people were also killed, their numbers were much smaller.Historians say up to 6,000 Koreans were killed in the aftermath of the magnitude 7.9 earthquake. The massacre began when the Japanese government spread rumors of a planned riot by Koreans in a scheme to divert public attention from social unrest. In the morning of Aug. 30, the families will also hold a memorial service to pay tribute to the victims at a former port in the city where they left for Japan after Korea was under Japan's colonial rule in 1910. The bereaved family group comprises only seven families of the victims, as most of families of them are not believed to know about their involvement in the incident due to the lack of research and proper investigation into the incident.Prior to the association's launch, a South Korea-Japan civic group will hold a memorial service in Seoul on Friday, where a preview of ""The 1923 Genocide: The Silence of 93 Years,"" the third documentary on the issue being made by Oh, will be shown.Kim Jong-soo, a pastor who leads the civic group, called for the government to set up a body tasked with investigating the massacre or cooperating with civic bodies in a probe into it.In 2014, 103 ruling and opposition lawmakers proposed a bill on the establishment of a committee to shine light on the massacre, but the bill was not passed.","1923 massacre of koreans ,japanese filmmaker said monday ,documentaries on the massacre ,massacre in japan more ,association about 1923 massacre","['Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Choong - kong']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.42267853  0.39614293

In February, South Korean police arrested eight other suspects and rescued several Thai victims.Thailand is a notorious source, destination and transit hub for human trafficking operations that shift vulnerable women, men and children into sex work and other forms of forced labor. In May, US authorities charged 21 people, including 10 Thai nationals, for running an international criminal enterprise that trafficked hundreds of Thai women into brothels across America.","gang funnelling thai women ,korean arrested for duping ,sex trade south korean ,women into forced prostitution ,arrested for duping thais","['south korean', 'thai', 'Bangkok', 'Kim', 'thai', 'South Korea', 'Bangkok', 'Seoul', 'thai', 'Kim']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.27853125  0.05415546

South Kore...","A Chinese sign that read ""Hanguocheng,"" meaning South Korean food court, on the building of a restaurant mall in Wangjing, the once prosperous Koreatown in northeastern Beijing, has been replaced by ""Meishijie,"" or Gourmet food street.The change reflects an ever-rising anti-South Korean sentiment in China amid the current diplomatic row that is souring diplomatic ties between the two neighboring countries. South Korea and China have been at odds over the deployment of a US missile shield called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  system, which is being installed in South Korea.Beijing claims it could harm its strategic interest.Back in 2010, many South Korean businesspeople and their families began to settle in Wangjing joining the bandwagon of ""hallyu,"" or Korean Wave, in China.According to data released by the South Korean Embassy in Beijing, the number of South Koreans who stayed more than six months in China last year reached about 300,000. About 95,000 South Koreans reside in Beijing and Tianjin, northeastern China; 60,000 in Shanghai and the Huadong region; and65,000 in Qingdao and the Shandong region.The Koreatown in Wangjing is home to about 10,000 South Koreans, an exemplification of ""Little Korea in China"" that boasts of well-established infrastructure. Once a rural village in the vicinity of Beijing, Wangjing saw South Korean supermarkets, churches, hair salons and markets spring up following the settlement of South Korean residents and businesspeople.Living in Wangjing gives South Koreans a sense of home as popular Korean foods including boiled pig trotter ""jokbal"" and fried chicken and beer, or ""chimaek,"" are available, sometimes faster than back home.  ""Wangjing was the countryside with an empty field just 15 years ago,"" said the owner of a supermarket in Wangjing's Xiyuan Sanqu district, who declined to be named. ""As many South Koreans got to live together and various amenities were introduced, Chinese people also came in with the idea of Wangjing being a good place to live in spreading by word of mouth.""In Wangjing, South Korean companies and vendors benefited from a business boom on the crest of the South Korean culture wave.Since 2010, however, they were battered by decreasing competitiveness and increasing manpower costs, losing out to local counterparts. Chinese customers browse products at an outlet of the South Korean discount store chain Lotte Mart in Beijing`s Wangjing district, also known as Koreatown, in this file photo taken on March 2, 2017. The South Korean community, including Wangjing, has found itself at the center of the ongoing THAAD row since July last year, when Seoul announced that the country would host the defense system.The decision has caused its relations with China to plunge to their lowest level in many years, with South Korean businesses in China struggling under what Seoul sees as retaliatory measures.Many South Koreans closed their restaurants and removed any mention of South Korea from signs in the face of moves to boycott South Korean products and eateries coupled with growing anti-South Korean sentiment.Apartments and houses evacuated by South Korean businesspeople have been taken up by the Chinese middle class and Chinese young people working for foreign-invested companies.The phenomenon of hollowing out is seen in not only Wangjing but other areas where a large population of South Korea residents live.Choi Chung-gwang, a South Korean businessman who started a Korean restaurant in 1993, just one year after the establishment of diplomatic ties between Seoul and Beijing, said the hallyu boom in the 2000s helped raise the popularity of South Korean restaurants and products. ""But South Korean companies have lost their competitiveness due to China's continued development and the THAAD row drove the South Korean community to a level seen as the worst ever,"" he said.Choi has switched his business to an artificial intelligence-based catering service for pet dogs. ""It's about time we ought to explore more technological and creative business sectors in which Chinese people cannot catch up with us,"" he added.","rising anti south korean ,south korean food court ,korean sentiment in china ,koreatown in northeastern beijing ,anti south korean sentiment","['chinese', 'south korean', 'Wangjing', 'Koreatown', 'Beijing', 'Meishijie', 'Gourmet', 'anti - south korean', 'China', 'South Kore']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26568151  0.4922339

The diplomat, known to be in his 50s, serves as a military attache here. The woman in her 30s filed a complaint to Seoul police late last month, claiming he groped her body on three occasions between June 2016 and January 2017. But the man, who has diplomatic immunity, failed to show up at the Jongno police station in downtown Seoul on the appointed date of Aug. 3, flying back to his home country instead. “We’ve summoned the charge d‘affaires of the embassy to lodge a complaint, and heard that the attache went back home for a temporary stay to undergo some kind of administrative procedure unrelated to this case and would return no later than late August,” a ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “The Mexican Foreign Ministry has not yet officially mentioned it would exert diplomatic immunity, and we expect him to keep his word.” Jongno Police Station The official said his agency acknowledged the incident in mid-July and advised the woman to report to the police, which would facilitate follow-up diplomatic action, while seeking assistance from the Embassy of Paraguay given her current citizenship. The ministry has also been grappling with a series of sexual abuse cases over the past several months, which resulted in the sacking of at least two diplomats stationed overseas and the initiation of prosecutorial criminal investigations. “We recommended a proactive response to the perceived victim in line with our policy that we will deal with sexual misconducts in a sterner manner,” the official said. “Most other countries, too, are hardly generous about the wrongdoings of their public officials working abroad. … As the diplomat failed to keep his promise once, we would demand  take due steps if he doesn’t come back based on initial police findings.”By Shin Hyon-hee","harassing korean paraguayan woman ,sexual abuse mexican diplomat ,sexually harassing korean paraguayan ,her 30s filed complaint ,abuse mexican diplomat","['mexican', 'korean', 'the Mexican Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46771327  0.2370124

Before and during the war, Japan placed the peninsula under its colonial rule from 1910-45 and forced many Korean people to fight for the country.Located about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Tokyo, the hospital specialized in the treatment of mental illness has kept stacks of the records in a warehouse on its grounds. Toshio Asai, the deceased former chief of the hospital, had them in his custody after working as a psychiatrist at the Japanese Army's Konodai Hospital in the city of Ichikawa, Chiba, that was designated as a military medical facility for soldiers hit by mental illness. This photo, taken on Aug. 14, 2017, shows a book of copies of the medical records of soldiers hit by mental illness during World War II at Asai Hospital in the city of Togane in Japan`s Chiba Prefecture. Asai had hidden the records, a collection of 1,000 books classified by the years when the patients were evacuated to be treated for illness, defying an Army order to have them burned following Japan's defeat in the war.According to the copies, the agony of a Korean conscript surnamed Kim suffering mental illness included a description of the extent of the war's terrible situation and his unwanted participation in the conflict inflicted on him.Born in 1924, the native of Gyeonggi Province near Seoul was conscripted in April 1945 before being diagnosed with a case of mental illness in October the same year. ""He got up all of a sudden at night and began to cry, saying 'Aigo,' and sometimes he beat his head with both of his hands,"" the records said.Kim also went on the rampage and broke panes of glass in a bathroom before the hospital took measures to restrain him.Even though the war ended in 1945, his illness continued to plague him until he died at the hospital in 2000 at the age of 76.Hiroshi Shimizu, an 81-year-old honorary professor at Japan's Saitama University who carried out research on the clinical records along with Asai, has delivered the records of Kim's case to his younger brother living in South Korea.Learning about Kim's death four years later, the younger brother contacted Shimizu for the medical records on Kim.""His mother passed away without knowing about his son's fate,""Shimizu said, adding that he sent Kim's bereaved family a report based on his sickbed records.Shimizu lamented, ""I can't imagine how miserable the family members were when they read the report.""","illness hit korean conscripts ,army during wwii clinical ,000 former soldiers ,copies of japanese hospital ,about 000 former soldiers","['TOGANE', 'Japan', 'korean', 'the Japanese Imperial Army', 'japanese', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Asai Hospital', 'Togane', 'Japan', 'Chiba Prefecture']",27,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.30356073  0.1032189

Bang Tae-hyun has been accused of taking a bribe of 100 million won  from match-fixing brokers in exchange for throwing a bout at the Ultimate Fighting Championship event in South Korea in 2015. He will face a trial without detention. According to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Bang agreed to lose the contest against Leo Kuntz at UFC Fight Night 79 in Seoul. The scam, however, didn't succeed as the lightweight fighter apparently changed his mind at the last moment and went on to beat Kuntz with a split decision. In this file photo, taken on Nov. 28, 2015, South Korean mixed martial arts fighter Bang Tae-hyun  lands a punch on Leo Kuntz of the United States during their lightweight bout at the UFC Fight Night 79 at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. Bang reportedly decided not to throw the match after UFC officials warned him about fight fixing following a sudden shift in betting patterns on gambling websites. The 34-year-old was first listed as the slight favorite against Kuntz, but just hours before the fight the UFC officials caught drastic changes in odds that made him the underdog and his American opponent the overwhelming favorite. Bang is no longer with the UFC, the world's largest MMA promotion. After the UFC event in Seoul, Bang fought once more in Germany at the UFC Fight Night 93, where he lost to Nick Hein by unanimous decision. Bang was the seventh South Korean to enter the Octagon after he signed with the UFC in late 2013.The prosecutors also indicted fight-fixing brokers and those who helped them, adding that one of them was former MMA fighter Kim Dae-won. Kim, who previously completed in Japan-based MMA promotions like DEEP and Pride, told his acquaintances that he can fix the UFC bout by persuading Bang and later consulted with the brokers for fixing, according to the prosecutors.","korean mma fighter indicted ,ultimate fighting championship event ,mma fighter indicted for ,scam south korean prosecutors ,the ultimate fighting championship","['south korean', 'Bang Tae - hyun', 'the Ultimate Fighting Championship', 'South Korea', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecu']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.11666173  0.53589129

Lim Hyeon-soo was released on “sick bail” Wednesday with the North Korean Central Court citing “humanitarian reasons,” according to the Korean Central News Agency. The 62-year-old South Korean-born Canadian was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2015 on charges of conspiring against the regime. Lim Hyeon-soo, who pastors the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto, is escorted to his sentencing in Pyongyang on Dec. 16, 2015. YonhapLim’s release comes at a sensitive time for the Korean Peninsula with the North threatening to create an “enveloping fire” in areas surrounding Guam, a key US military outpost in the Pacific Ocean, dismissing President Donald Trump’s warning of “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”The timing has shifted public concerns to six South Korean citizens now held captive in the North in which Pyongyang has been keeping mum about their whereabouts and condition. North Korea has been overall turning a deaf ear to the Moon Jae-in government’s offer to resume inter-Korean dialogue. The Unification Ministry here has been continuously vowing to step up its efforts to retrieve the prisoners, but doubts are being raised after a prolonged failure to do so. Experts are expressing skepticism over connecting the release of Lim with other South Korean detainees. “North Korea is maintaining an affable diplomatic relationship with Canada and probably wants to keep it that way,” said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul.“Even though they are perceived as reckless in many ways, it seems they took Otto Warmbier’s death  into consideration. Unlike Lim, it would be a lot more difficult for South Korean detainees to return home because we are in a different diplomatic relationship ,” Koh said. “We suspect there are six South Koreans currently detained in North Korea,” a ministry official said Thursday. Among the six, one is a Christian missionary while three are North Korean defectors allegedly abducted by the state’s agents, according to reports. “We have been consistently requesting the North Korean government to release and return our citizens held captive there. We will continue to make a full effort by cooperating with the international community,” the official said. The official added it has no plans at this time to dispatch a special delegation for such purpose. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry echoed the Unification Ministry’s statement saying that it is glad to hear the news of Lim’s release and hopes North Korea will quickly return its South Korean captives back to the arms of their respective families here. The US has been voicing its concerns over its citizens imprisoned in the North after US college student Warmbier’s death in June.US Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs spokesperson Grace Choi told Voice Of America on Thursday that Washington would like to see US detainees in the North back home as soon as possible. North Korea is currently holding three US Korean-Americans by force. Warmbier was transported back to his homeland in a state of “unresponsive wakefulness” after spending 17 months in the North Korean prison for trying to steal a political banner.North Korean authorities claimed Warmbier’s coma was a result of botulism and a sleeping pill, which drew global ire since it did not correspond with his US medical records. His death triggered the US State Department to impose a travel ban, which aims to block its citizens from visiting North Korea. The bill will take effect next month.

The ministry will try to notify the North of the repatriation plan through the South Korea-based United Nations Command after its first call directly to North Korea was not returned earlier in the day, according to the ministry.A total of 43 astray North Koreans have been rescued on the southern sides of the East and Yellow Sea. Thirty-six of them have been sent back home in accordance with their will, while the seven others were allowed to stay and live in the South. Any trip across the inter-Korean border requires government approval since the two Koreas technically remain at war since their 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.","send home korean rescued ,he was picking clams ,rescued last week ,south korea will repatriate ,rescued in yellow sea","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'the Ministry of Unification', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.40688783  0.01929536

The poster titled ""Do you know?"" also claimed Japan's territorial sovereignty over the Kuril Islands under Russia's control, and the Senkaku  Islands which are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China. It also carried photos of those islands.Seo said the poster can also be found in monorail trains on the island of Okinawa.The poster is similar in design to the one that was put on walls of subway train stations in Tokyo last year, but is more colorful and carries a more detailed explanation about the country's claims to Dokdo than last year's, the professor said. Seo said he will make and distribute an online poster debunking the Japanese claims.South Korea has rejected Japan's claims as nonsense because the country regained independence from the 1910-45 colonial rule after the war and reclaimed sovereignty over its territory, including Dokdo and many other islands around the Korean Peninsula.The country has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since 1954.Japan's claim has long frayed relations between the two countries, along with its attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities, including its enslavement of Korean women as sex slaves during World War II.","speed train poster japan ,korean activist said wednesday ,professor at seoul sungshin ,train poster japan government ,japan native territory illegally","['Japan', ""South Korea 's"", 'Kyushu Shinkansen', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Seo Kyoung - duk', 'Seoul', 'Sungshin']",27,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.44042057  0.34847954

Jikai Taketomi, an official from a private war archive in Japan, offered some 30 photos, letters and other articles from World War II to the state-run National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation in Busan.  Jikai Taketomi, vice head of the War Archives on Soldiers and Ordinary People in the southwestern Japanese prefecture of Fukuoka, shows a photo of a Korean woman victimized by Japan's wartime sexual slavery during a ceremony at the National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Occupation in the largest port city of Busan on Tuesday. They include an original photo of a Korean woman who worked at a military brothel. Taketomi said it was possessed by a fellow solder of his father stationed in Myanmar. She hailed from the southeastern Korean city and it is not known how his father’s friend got the photo, he added.Taketomi is vice head of the War Archives on Soldiers and Ordinary People in the southwestern Japanese prefecture of Fukuoka.The Busan museum withheld the figure’s name and did not make the photo public, saying the revelation of her identity could encroach on her human rights. It is unknown whether she is still alive, it added.Taketomi also said he is administering the will of the soldier who asked his father to relay his apology to the woman for his wrongdoings.On behalf of his father, Taketomi also took an opportunity to atone for Japan’s war crimes. “I would like to offer my sincere apology for  inhuman acts in the name of war,” he said.“Those who turn away from the past cannot see the present, and those who fail to reflect on the past could fall into another risk.”After attending a ceremony marking the donation, Taketomi offered his apology once again in front of a statue of a girl symbolizing the victims of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery near the Japanese Consulate in South Korea’s largest port city of Busan.","japan wartime sex slavery ,local museum on tuesday ,japanese man donated photo ,photo of korean victim ,museum busan japanese man","['japanese', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Jikai Taketomi', 'Japan', 'National Memorial Museum of Forced Mobilization', 'Busan']",27,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.24748607  0.09306851

It was when Korea was under Japan's harsh colonial rule from 1910-1945.""It is difficult to see that individual rights to damages are included in the Korea-Japan reparations treaty,"" the court said, referring to the 1965 agreement between Seoul and Tokyo on resolving colonial-era issues. Japan has claimed that all colonial-era issues, including individual compensation, were resolved with the treaty.""In cooperation with the Japanese government, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries forced young women to toil under dangerous and poor working conditions without giving pay,"" the court said in the verdict. ""The plaintiffs  either lost their lives or sustained severe burns and lived concerned about being mistaken for military comfort women.""The court said that the amount of compensation for Choe's family member, who is an in-law of the victim, was determined according to the relative's inheritance share based on the total compensation  the victim was supposed to receive. Mitsubishi is expected to appeal the ruling.Mitsubishi is one of the most representative Japanese firms involved in forced labor during the war. The company is also featured in a recently released South Korean box-office hit, ""The Battleship Island,"" which tells the story of hundreds of Korean forced laborers who risk their lives to escape.Tuesday's ruling is the first such case since President Moon Jae-in took office in May. It is one of a total of 14 such cases that South Korean victims have filed against Mitsubishi and other Japanese firms over forced labor.The same court is also scheduled to hand down a verdict in a similar case Friday. Three surviving victims and one bereaved family member filed the suit in 2014, demanding Mitsubishi pay them a total of 600 million won. It took 3 1/2 years for the court to deliver its first trial verdict. The plaintiffs have accused the Japanese firm of foot dragging.Japan's harsh colonial rule left deep scars on the hearts of Koreans. During that period, Koreans were banned from using their own language at schools and forced to adopt Japanese names.Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were also mobilized as forced laborers and sex slaves.","mitsubishi must pay compensation ,korean court ruled tuesday ,japanese company must pay ,rules mitsubishi must pay ,ordering the japanese firm","['south korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Mitsubishi Heavy Industries', 'the Gwangju District Court', 'japanese', 'Kim Young - ok ,']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2831665   0.65483415

""Laborers trust and venerate Marshal Kim Jong Un.'' And as hundreds of students dance behind her in a choreographed display of loyalty, she is adamant about one thing: North Korea, she insists, has no generation gap.  ``The spirit of the youth has remained the same as ever!'' Ryu Hye Gyong says.  But look more closely _ look beyond her words, beyond the propaganda posters on every street, and the radios playing hymns to the ruling family _ and the unspoken reality is far more complicated.  A 19-year-old university student with a confident handshake and carefully styled hair, Ryu lives in a city that today feels awash in change. There are rich people now in Pyongyang, chauffeured in Mercedes and Audis even as most citizens of the police state remain mired in poverty. There's a supermarket selling imported apples and disposable diapers. On sidewalks where everyone once dressed in drab Maoist conformity, there are young women in not-quite miniskirts and teenage boys with baseball caps cocked sideways, K-pop style.   In this profoundly isolated country, a place that can still sometimes appear frozen in a Stalinist netherworld, a generational divide is quietly growing behind the relentless propaganda.  Here, where rulers have long been worshiped as all-powerful providers, young people have grown to adulthood expecting nothing from the regime. Their lives, from professional aspirations to dating habits, are increasingly shaped by a growing market economy and a quietly thriving underground trade in smuggled TV shows and music. Political fervor, genuinely felt by many in earlier generations, is being pushed aside by something else: A fierce belief in the power of money.  It's a complex divide, where some 20-year-olds remain fierce ideologues and plenty of 50-year-olds have no loyalty to the increasingly worried regime. But conversations with more than two dozen North Korean refugees, along with scholars, former government officials and activists, make it clear that young people are increasingly unmoored from the powerful state ideology.  ``When Kim Jong Un speaks, young people don't listen,'' says Han Song Yi, 24, who left the North in 2014, dreaming of pop-music stardom in the South. ``They just pretend to be listening.''  In her tight jeans and gold-speckled eye shadow, Han revels in Seoul's frenetic glitz and unembarrassed consumerism. She loves talking about fashion and the K-pop bands she and her friends secretly listened to back home.  But she also talks about her homeland with the thoughtfulness of someone who is constantly watching, constantly looking for explanations. Han can deconstruct the sudden emergence of short skirts in her hometown in the autumn of 2012, and how that mirrored not just the ascension of Kim Jong Un, the new leader often photographed with his glamorous, well-dressed wife, but also the political cynicism growing around her.  ``North Korea in the past, and North Korea today are so different,'' she says.  Nobody in North Korea will talk to an outsider about this, and it's easy to see why.  Stand at nearly any Pyongyang street corner and reminders of the state's immense power are everywhere. Mounted portraits show the country's first two rulers: Kim Il Sung, who shaped the North into one of the world's most repressive states, and his son, Kim Jong Il, who created the personality cults that now dominate public life. Immense rooftop signs spell out praise for grandson Kim Jong Un, the ruling party and the military. On the radio, the song ``We Will Defend Gen. Kim Jong Un With Our Lives'' booms out again and again.  The message is unmistakable: ``People are always careful about what they say,'' says Han.  ___  For generations, propaganda about the Kim family was all that most North Koreans knew, a mythology of powerful but tender-hearted rulers who protect their people against a hostile world. It still suffuses everything from children's stories to university literature departments, from TV shows to opera.  ``When I was younger I believed all of this,'' says a former North Korean policeman in his mid-40s, who now lives in Seoul and who spoke on condition his name not be used, fearing retribution against relatives still in the North. He's a powerfully built man with a gravelly voice who remains conflicted about the North, critical of the dictatorship but also scornful of a younger generation that doesn't understand the emotional tug of loyalty. So his voice is dismissive when he adds: ``But the younger people, many of them never believed.''  Many older North Koreans feel that emotional tug.  In part that's because they remember the days of relative prosperity, when the state provided people with nearly everything: food, apartments, clothing, children's holiday gifts. North Korea's economy was larger than the South's well into the 1970s.  An economic shift began in the mid-1990s, when the end of Soviet aid and a series of devastating floods caused widespread famine. The food ration system, which had fed nearly everyone for decades, collapsed. The power of the police state weakened amid the hunger, allowing smuggling to flourish across the Chinese border.  While the state tightened its hold again when the famine ended, private enterprise grew, as the government realized it was the only way to keep the economy functioning.  To people who came of age after the famine, when it had become clear the regime was neither all-powerful nor all-providing, the propaganda is often just background noise. It isn't that they hate the regime, but simply that their focus has turned to earning a living, or buying the latest smuggled TV show.  ``After a while, I stopped paying attention,'' says Lee Ga Yeon, who grew up amid the mud and poverty of an isolated communal farm and began helping support her family as a teenager during the famine, pedaling her bicycle through nearby villages, selling food door to door. ``I didn't even think about the regime anymore.''  That lack of interest frightens the regime, whose legitimacy depends on its ability to remain at the center of North Korean life.  ``They know that young people are where you get revolutions,'' says Hazel Smith, a North Korea scholar at SOAS, University of London and former aid worker in North Korea. ``This is the cleavage that the government is worried about.''  Kim Jong Un, who wasn't even 30 years old when he came to power after his father's 2011 death, now faces the challenge of his own generation, with a little over one-third of North Koreans believed to be under the age of 25.  On his gentler days, Kim has reached out to young people: ``I am one of you, and we are the future,'' he said in one speech. There was an increase in youth-oriented mass rallies after Kim's ascension, and public pledges of youth loyalty. Earlier this year, the regime held the first national gathering in 23 years of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth league, a mass organization for all North Koreans ages 14 to 30. There's also propaganda now clearly aimed at young people, like the all-woman Moranbong Band, which performs pop-political anthems in tight skirts and high heels.  But fear has a long history in North Korea, where at least 80,000 people are believed to be held in an archipelago of political prison camps, some for simply being related to someone suspected of disloyalty. Despite his youth and his schooling in Switzerland, Kim understands the tools that his father and grandfather used. He has purged dozens of powerful members of his inner circle, including his uncle, who ``did serious harm to the youth movement in our country.''  Kim also has blasted outside movies and music as ``poisonous weeds'' and in 2015, researchers say, his regime announced that people caught with South Korean videos could face 10 years of imprisonment at hard labor.  Most young people have grown up with at least some access to smuggled DVDs or flash drives, whether Chinese TV shows , American movies  or a buffet of digitized South Korean entertainment choices   In the North, South Korean soap operas are far more than just weepy sagas of thwarted love. To many young Northerners they are windows onto a modern world, nurturing middle-class aspirations while helping change everything from fashion to romance.  Today, young women can be seen on the streets of Pyongyang in tight-fitting blouses and short skirts  above the knee, Han notes, or party workers can demand you change or pay a fine). Couples can occasionally be spotted holding hands in the parks along the Taedong River. In a culture where arranged marriages were the norm until very recently, young people now date openly and choose their own spouses.  Some things, though, have barely changed at all.  The power of the police state, for instance, with its web of agencies and legions of informers, remains immense.  So while the generational divide has grown, there have been no signs of youthful anger: no university protests, no political graffiti, no anonymous leaflets. Even among themselves, young people say politics is almost always avoided, with honest conversations saved only for immediate family and the closest friends.  Plus, politics is not at the heart of the generation gap.  ``It's not about the regime,'' says Lee, the former door-to-door food saleswoman, who now studies literature at one of South Korea's top universities. ``It's about money.''  ___  Officially, North Korea remains rigidly socialist, a country where private property is illegal and bureaucrats control the economy.  Then there's the reality.  ``Everybody wants money now,'' says Han, whose father ran a successful timber business. In her hometown, where squat houses and small factories line the Yalu River border with China, her family counted as wealthy. ``I grew up like a princess,'' she says happily, ticking off the family's possessions: a TV, two laptop computers, easy access to the latest South Korean K-pop videos.  Money now courses through North Korea, shaking a world that earlier generations thought would never change. Experts believe the private sector, a web of businesses ranging from neighborhood traders to textile factories, accounts for as much as half of the North Korean economy, with most people depending on it financially, at least in part.  Young North Koreans ``were all brought up in a market economy. For them, Kim Il Sung is history,'' says Smith. ``They've got different norms, different hopes.''  Major markets are off-limits to most outsiders, but refugee descriptions and satellite imagery show more than 400 across the country, warehouse-size buildings filled with traders selling everything from moonshine to Chinese car parts.  ``In the past, everybody wanted to be a government official, that was the number-one dream,'' says Lee. ``But more and more, people know that money can solve everything. More and more, people are interested in the markets, in buying and selling, in money.''  The markets also mean there's much more to buy: battery-powered bicycles to ride on rutted roads, cheap Chinese electronics, imported fabrics, solar panels for electricity outages.  If North Korea remains very poor, with malnutrition rates similar to those in Zimbabwe and Syria, it is no longer an economic basket case. And consumerism, once derided as a capitalist disease, has rippled through the culture.  ``Young women don't want to stay on tiny farms anymore,'' says Lee. ``They want to move to cities, to fall in love with some big-city rich guy, just like in South Korea.''  Or at least just like in South Korean soap operas.  In Pyongyang they say none of this. Not openly. And definitely not to a foreign reporter shadowed everywhere by government minders.  On a sunny spring afternoon, by a three-story obelisk celebrating North Korea's love for its leaders, a math student at the country's top university talks about how life has changed since her mother was young.  ``There is one difference,'' says 19-year-old Jang Sol Hyang. ``My mother lived under the wise leadership of Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and I live in the great era of Marshal Kim Jong Un.''  As she talks, a well-dressed, sour-looking man walks up to listen, standing only a couple feet away.  Maybe he's a party official. Maybe he's secret police. Maybe he's just a nosy passerby.  But no one asks.  Instead, Jang continues talking about the glories of her country, and the young leader shepherding his people into the future.","north koreans to die ,she dances beneath 10 ,north korea ruling family ,dictators modern young woman ,woman in central pyongyang","['Pyongyang', 'North Koreans', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Il']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68195331  0.49281925

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office sent investigators to the headquarters of the Korea Aerospace Industries Co. in Sacheon, 437 km south of Seoul, and its offices in the capital earlier in the day, it said. They mainly searched KAI's development division this time, based on the evidence obtained so far that revealed its possible involvement in the malpractice. This is a second time that prosecutors have raided both KAI's main and Seoul offices, after it carried one out two weeks ago. The prosecutors already conducted two separate raids on KAI headquarters and its subcontractors on July 14 and 18.The defense company is accused of inflating expenses for the development of a utility helicopter known as the Surion and pocketing unfair profits worth some 24 billion won . The prosecution also suspects that key KAI officials offered business favors to subcontractors that took part in the price manipulation, while also taking bribes from them. KAI has been involved in high-profile defense projects to develop the Surion utility helicopter, T-50 supersonic trainer jet and FA-50 light attack fighter.From the two previous searches, prosecutors have secured evidence that possibly implicates KAI officials in inflating the cost price of equipment for the development projects.  On Monday, prosecutors put a KAI official suspected of being a key man in the case on their wanted list and released his face photo to the public.","corruption at south korea ,manufacturer as they raided ,prosecutors zeroing in on ,they raided its headquarters ,seoul central district prosecutors","[""South Korea 's"", ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'the Korea Aerospace Industries Co.', 'Sacheon', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.57283986  0.38903561

She had attempted to take her own life on seven occasions while serving as a sex slave for three years. After Korea was freed from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, she returned home, briefly lived with a man she promised to marry before being sent to the military brothel and lived the rest of her life alone. The last words she made in public came when newly named Gender, Equality and Family Minister Chung Hyun-back visited her at the shelter on July 10. Kim Gun-ja died at the age of 91 at a shelter south of Seoul, Sunday. “My honor was not restored 70 years after the nation’s liberation ,” she said.Kim was at the forefront of efforts to reveal Japan’s wartime atrocities. “I was beaten almost to death and I had to serve 40 men every day. I returned to my country after walking for 38 days,” Kim testified of the horrors of being a comfort woman during a hearing hosted by then-US Rep. Mike Honda in February 2007. Following her testimony, the US Congress passed a resolution urging Japan to admit its wrongdoings and apologize to the victims.  There were originally 238 victims of sex slavery by Japanese soldiers registered with the government. Only 37 are still alive, all of whom are aged over 85. This year alone, three victims died. Gender Minister Chung and Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa visited the deceased’s mortuary in the evening to offer their condolences. “The Ministry of Gender, Equality and Family will push for projects to restore the honor and dignity of the victims and do its best to stabilize their livelihoods for them to spend the rest of their life at ease,” Chung said in a statement.The ruling Democratic Party of Korea, centrist People’s Party and minor conservative Bareun Party all released statements calling for Japan’s sincere apology. Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women has remained one of the key sources of diplomatic dispute between South Korea and Japan. According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, are estimated to have worked as comfort women at Japan‘s front-line brothels during World War II. Japan colonized Korea from 1910-45.The countries reached a historic deal defined as “final and irreversible” in late 2015 in which Japan offered funds and an apology to the surviving victims in return for Seoul’s promise not to raise the issue again in international forums. But some of the comfort women and their rights groups have protested the deal, calling for a sincere apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government. Kim was one of them.

The scam, however, didn't work as Bang apparently changed his mind at the last moment and went on to beat Kuntz via split decision. In this file photo taken on Nov. 28, 2015, South Korean mixed martial arts  fighter Bang Tae-hyun  lands a punch on Leo Kuntz of the United States during their lightweight bout at the UFC Fight Night 79 at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. Bang reportedly decided not to throw the match after UFC officials warned him about fight fixing following a sudden shift in betting patterns on gambling websites. Bang was first listed as the slight favorite against Kuntz but just hours before the fight, the UFC officials caught drastic changes in odds that made him the underdog and his American opponent the overwhelming favorite.After the fixing went unsuccessful, Yang, who lost 190 million won, threatened Kim and Bang to give back his money and later took 10 million won from each of them. The prosecutors said they added racketeering charges against Yang.The prosecutors said Kim also violated the foreign exchange transaction act by sending 450 million won to Las Vegas. Aside from the match-fixing attempt, the prosecutors said Kim is charged with fraud and illegal gambling on Chinese football league matches.Bang is also expected to face criminal penalties for his involvement in the scam. Sources here said Bang's contract with the UFC has been terminated after the incident was reported.The UFC has yet to make a statement on the incident.","bribing south korean ufc ,south korean ufc fighter ,fixing attempts at ufc ,korean ufc fighter bang ,ufc event in seoul","['south korean', 'Kim', 'Yang', 'south korean', 'Bang Tae - hyun']",27,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01648695 0.26994887 0.15227501],Catherine Chung,Social affairs,7,2017,"bribing south korean ufc fighter ,at an ultimate fighting championship ,south korean ufc fighter bang ,korean ufc fighter bang tae ,fight the ufc officials caught","['south korean', 'Kim', 'Yang', 'south korean', 'Bang Tae - hyun', 'South Korea', 'Bang', 'Leo Kuntz', 'Bang', 'Kuntz', 'south korean', 'Bang Tae - hyun', 'Leo Kuntz', 'the United States', 'Seoul', 'Bang', 'UFC', 'Bang', 'Kuntz', 'UFC', 'american', 'Yang', 'Kim', 'Bang', 'Yang', 'Kim', 'Las Vegas', 'Kim', 'chinese', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'UFC', 'UFC']",17,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01648695 0.26994887 0.15227501]

He left for Russia the following day, prompting South Korean police to put him on the Interpol wanted list. Following the man's arrest in Russia in June last year, South Korea's justice ministry requested his extradition, but the Russian prosecution refused.Instead of extradition, Russian prosecutors opened their own investigation into the murder under a bilateral agreement with Seoul and indicted the suspect in October last year based on evidence provided by South Korea.A local court in the Russian city of Khabarovsk recently gave him a life sentence for murder and other charges, according to the ministry.""We hope the recent Russian court ruling would help heal the wounds of the bereaved family a little bit,"" said a ministry official.""As the Russian man has appealed the life sentence, we'll continue to cooperate with the Russian prosecution to ensure that he receives punishment commensurate with his crime.""In a similar case, two Uzbek men, who fled to their home country after killing a South Korean farm owner in September 2015, were sentenced to 19 years in jail in May this year.

Moon and Abe met in their first bilateral summit on the sidelines of the 12th annual Group of 20 summit taking place in Hamburg.South Korean President Moon Jae-in  greets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prior to summit talks in Hamburg in Germany on Friday. “Korea and Japan share fundamental values and strategic interests and have long been the closest friends in both geographic and cultural terms,” Moon said.“I hope to overcome our historic scars and to move on to a mature, future-oriented partnership.”The two leaders agreed to resume active shuttle diplomacy between the two countries. The Japanese prime minister invited Moon to visit Japan in the near future, while Moon asked Abe to attend the Pyongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018. Both of them also agreed to make joint efforts so that a trilateral summit involving China may take place as soon as possible on key regional issues.But when it came to the settlement on wartime sex slaves under Japanese colonial rule, the two once again faced a divide over the issue.Abe underlined that the settlement needs to be abided by, but Moon argued that the disputed deal is keeping the two states apart.“There is something that is stopping Korea and Japan from getting closer to each other,” Moon said.“We have to acknowledge the fact that the majority of our people find it emotionally difficult to accept .”Urging for joint efforts and wisdom, Moon stressed that the issue should not act as an obstacle to bilateral relations.The deal in question was signed in late 2015 by Moon’s conservative predecessor Park Geun-hye but came under fire for failing to reflect victims’ stance.The Korea-Japan summit came as a run-up to the G-20 summit during which Moon made his debut in multinational diplomacy. It also took place in the wake of a trilateral summit involving US counterpart Donald Trump on the previous night.“It was a highly significant meeting which came at a good time,” said Moon, referring to the trilateral meeting.Abe agreed, calling for the two countries’ cooperation on a variety of issues including the North Korea nuclear threat. During the bilateral and multilateral meetings, Moon set forth plans to have the international society issue an official statement denouncing North Korea and its escalating military threats.Among them was the idea of including a warning message in the final communique which would be designed to put political pressure on Pyongyang, despite the lack of binding force. During her summit with Moon in Berlin on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany as president of the event would consider the suggestion.German Chancellor Angela Merkel meets Korean President Moon Jae-in during the G-20 summit talks in Hamburg on Friday. The North Korean issue also came up during a morning session on the theme of counterterrorism.While calling for the global society’s joint efforts to stand against terrorist attacks, Moon added that the communist regime’s provocations also require keen attention.“The establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula will contribute to the peace and stability of not only the Northeast Asian region but of the entire world,” he said.Moon was one of the seven summits to deliver a speech during this morning session to address the rising threats of terrorism.Heads of state gather during the G-20 leaders retreat as part of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on Friday. While continuing his efforts to form an international consensus on North Korea, the South Korean president also spoke on free trade, the economic growth paradigm and fair distribution of wealth.“ new government is seeking to shift toward a people-centered economy, upon the awareness that conventional policies may no longer solve problems of low growth and economic polarization,” Moon said in his lead speech delivered at a luncheon summit discussion.He also expressed support for the G-20’s move to restore resilience in the global economy, as well as its slogan of free trade and multilateral trade.Other issues of global significance closely linked with the economic agenda were brought to the table, such as climate change, development policy, the labor market, employment policy and counterterrorism.In an afternoon session on sustainable development, climate change and energy, Moon shared his recent announcement to drive South Korea’s energy paradigm toward eco-friendly and renewable sources. He also reiterated his plan to abide by the Paris climate deal. In between the sessions and official dining events, Moon is to meet with his counterparts from key states, including Russia, Vietnam, India, France, Australia and Indonesia, as well as with chiefs of international organizations including the World Bank and the United Nations.By Bae Hyun-jungKorea Herald correspondent","hamburg south korean president ,sex slavery deal hamburg ,germany president moon jae ,deal hamburg germany president ,wartime sex slavery deal","['HAMBURG', 'Germany', 'Moon Jae - in', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'North Korea', 'Moon', 'Abe', 'Group of 20', 'Hamburg', 'south korean', 'Moon Jae - in']",27,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.31354707  0.55096006

It is the first time a Korean first lady has visited the site, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said. Kim said she knew Yun’s music well.“The destruction of tone in his music was unfamiliar, but I took much interest in it. He inspired me a lot when I was studying music,” she said. Yun, who has penned about 150 works, is recognized for bridging the music of the East and West. Many of his works are still widely performed around the world, such as “Cello Concerto” and “Seven Etudes for Violoncello solo” . Born in 1917, when the Korean Peninsula was under Japanese colonial rule, the musician was imprisoned for his participation in the resistance movement against Japan in 1943. Yun enjoyed success in his musical career in France and in Germany in the 1950s and 1960s. But his life turned upside down in 1967, when he was abducted by Korean intelligence agents from his apartment in West Berlin to Seoul. He had visited North Korea four years earlier and had criticized the Park Chung-hee dictatorship.

The investigation came a day after the child’s parents filed the complaint against the Korean unit of the global fast-food giant for violating food safety rules, claiming that their daughter developed a hemolytic-uremic syndrome and had lost 90 percent of her kidney function after eating a burger from a McDonald’s outlet.  A photo showing the 4-year-old victim who was hospitalized after she ate McDonald’s burger in September 2016.On the same day, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety notified 11 fast-food chains operating in South Korea, including McDonald’s, to cook patties properly to prevent food poisoning, its official said.According to the parents, their daughter started expressing pain in her stomach a few hours after she consumed the burger in September 2016 at a McDonald’s in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. Her pain kept worsening until she was admitted to an intensive care in a hospital for two months. The parents said their daughter now spends 8 to 10 hours a day at home receiving peritoneal dialysis due to permanent damage to her kidneys. “McDonald’s failed to inform customers of risks , especially when HUS can severely affect children,” victim’s attorney told reporters Wednesday after filing the complaint to the prosecution’s office. “It’s been found that some McDonald’s stores accidentally put the grill on a wrong setting and fail to cook patties fully,” the attorney claimed.

The women in the photo are the so-called “comfort women,” it claimed. “Their appearance, such as the bare feet, suggest they were enslaved,” said SungKongHoe University professor Kang Sung-hyun, who participated in the study, in a press conference in Seoul. There have been numerous photos and documented testimonies of surviving victims of the sexual slavery, but this is the first discovery of a moving image, the center said. The women and the place captured in the clip match those shown in a set of photos released in 2000, he said. In the photos, four women are standing in front of a bunker with a Chinese guard after they were captured by the allied forces. In other photos, women are seen being interrogated or receiving medical treatments.It is highly likely that Sergeant Edwards C. Fay, a photographer from the allied forces, had taken the photo as well as the video, researchers said. Screen capture of a video released by the Seoul National University Human Rights Centers shows former Korean sex slaves in Songshan, China, who are believed to have been coerced into sex slavery during the war in which Korea was under colonial rule by Japan. Kang explained that a dozen wartime sex slaves were captured in Songshan by the allied forces in September 1944, as the Asia-Pacific War was nearing the end with Japan’s surrender in 1945. Captives were released and sent back to Korea in 1946. Former sex slave Park Young-shim, who died in 2006, confirmed in 2000 that the pregnant women in the pictures is her. Researchers said that it is highly probable that the names of the women who appeared in the video are on the list of the former Korean sex slaves who were interrogated as captives in China. Park’s name also appeared in a 1944 Chinese document detailing the interrogation of captives from the Songshan area. The research team discovered the video from some hundreds of film reels stored at the National Archives and Records Administration in the US. The video had been kept there for 70 years.“Due to a long-standing dispute over Japan’s wartime sexual slavery, it became crucial to come up with evidence. This video clip will strengthen the admissibility of evidence behind wartime sex slavery,” said professor Kang. As of July 2017, 38 former wartime sex slaves are alive, according to the government data. Up to 200,000 women, many from Korea, then a colony of Japan, are believed to have been coerced into sex slavery during the war. By Kim Da-sol","korean sex slaves unveiled ,former korean sex slaves ,footage showing seven koreans ,of japan brutal trafficking ,korean sex slaves","['Koreans', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'asian', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'the Seoul National University Human Rights Center']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.32242358  0.5768916

The Treasury Department declared the Bank of Dandong a “primary money-laundering concern,” proposing to sever it entirely from the US financial system, pending a 60-day review period. Although Trump’s treasury secretary said the move didn‘t target China, it comes a week after the president lamented that China’s promise to help with North Korea “has not worked out.”  Trump had been leaning on President Xi Jinping to help stop the North‘s development of nuclear weapons before they can threaten the US homeland. A main focus of the coordination has been getting China to fully enforce international sanctions intended to starve North Korea of revenue for its nuclear and missile programs. The US action is likely to anger China, which handles about 90 percent of North Korea’s external trade, and whose banks and companies are said to provide Pyongyang access to the US-dominated international financial system.  The sanctions bar Americans from doing business with Bank of Dandong, which is based in a northeastern Chinese city on the North Korean border that serves as a gateway for trade with the isolated nation. The US also slapped sanctions Thursday on a Chinese shipping company and two Chinese people that it said have facilitated illegal activities by North Korea. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the US still wants to work with Beijing on combating the North Korean threat.“We are in no way targeting China with these actions,” Mnuchin told a White House news briefing.The punitive steps were presaged by a tweet from Trump last week reflecting dissatisfaction with Beijing‘s efforts.“While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!” Trump tweeted on June 20.The Trump administration may be struggling to maintain international pressure on Pyongyang.The president was to meet for the first time Thursday with South Korea’s new leader, President Moon Jae-in, who has long advocated outreach to North Korea. His predecessor had staunchly backed Trump‘s harder line. Mnuchin said the Bank of Dandong has facilitated millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert and former Treasury Department official, described it as a small Chinese bank “sitting at the heart” of trade between North Korea and China.“This is a strong message to Chinese leaders that the Trump administration will act against North Korea‘s sanctions evasion in China,” he said.The other targeted Chinese entities are:Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co., which Treasury accused of transporting 700,000 tons of freight annually, including coal and steel products, between China and North Korea. It cited a UN expert panel as saying the company has violated a ban on trade in luxury goods with the North.Chinese national Sun Wei, said to have been running a cover company for North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank, which is already subject to US sanctions.Chinese national Li Hong Ri, said to have established several front companies that end up benefiting Koryo Bank, a US-sanctioned conduct for financial transactions on behalf of North Korea.","blacklists china bank revving ,frustration among president donald ,us blacklists china bank ,frustration among president ,blacklisted small chinese bank","['WASHINGTON', 'AP', 'the United States', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'Donald Trump', 'China‘s', 'the Treasury Department', 'the Bank of Dandong']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47441423  0.43971381

The Financial Action Task Force, at its annual meeting of 37 members in Spain last week, also called on member countries to apply effective countermeasures against North Korea's attempts to finance illicit weapons programs, Seoul's Financial Services Commission said in a statement. North Korea has been under United Nations sanctions because of its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.  UN experts have said North Korea continues to evade sanctions using airlines, ships and the international financial system to purchase prohibited items for its weapons program.

DPRK is an acronym of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

122,122,[Eye] An Ethiopian journalist's journey to find life in South Korea,"In 2010, Surafel Assefa Hailesilassie, a young TV producer in Ethiopia, witnessed election observers rigging ballots in favor of the ruling party during a parliamentary vote in the nation’s capital Addis Ababa. “The cameraman who was with me filmed the scenes and I interviewed six people exposing the election fraud,” Hailesilassie, now living in South Korea as a refugee, told The Korea Herald.  Just two years int...","In 2010, Surafel Assefa Hailesilassie, a young TV producer in Ethiopia, witnessed election observers rigging ballots in favor of the ruling party during a parliamentary vote in the nation’s capital Addis Ababa. “The cameraman who was with me filmed the scenes and I interviewed six people exposing the election fraud,” Hailesilassie, now living in South Korea as a refugee, told The Korea Herald.  Just two years into his career, Hailesilassie was a fierce journalist, believing in his role as “the eyes and the ears of the society for the public.” “As I insisted it must be aired, a deputy mayor of Addis Ababa pointed a gun at my head. He said he would kill me if I don’t keep quiet. He took away my video recording,” he said. Since then, Hailesilassie’s professional conscience was continuously suppressed, compromised and even muted as the political situation in press freedom in his home country became worse. “I was scared. I received many tip-offs on corruption involving ranking officials, but I had to stay away from them,” he recalled. Then in August 2011, covering the World Championships in Athletics in Daegu he decided to flee from the political oppression back home. He applied for asylum here. Surafel Assefa Hailesilassie But life in South Korea was far from easy.  “I didn’t know anybody. I had no shelter, no money. I was hungry and lived on water and sugar to survive while the refugee application was underway,” he recalled. “I worked part-time illegally mostly at factories in Seoul and Ansan.”At the time, the South Korean government provided no livelihood support to asylum seekers. The country introduced the Refugee Act only in 2015, which stipulates provision of a minimum level of humanitarian protection for asylum seekers and refugees. Among other things, it offers asylum seekers legitimate work permits.  Discrimination was just something he had to live with every day. “My bosses and co-workers called me a ‘son of bitch’ many times. I asked them to call my name, but I was refused,” he said. “I had to put up with it because I could not afford to be in trouble.”The refugee screening process was also not without problems. What he wanted to say was lost in translation, he said. “The immigration officer in charge of my case was hostile to me. He treated me like a criminal, suspecting my former career and credentials.” His first application was rejected by the Justice Ministry. He appealed, and was finally grated refugee status on Dec. 26 in 2013. If the appeal process was unsuccessful, he might have had to fight for refugee status through court proceedings, which usually take up to three years.  Surafel Hailesilassie , his sister Mekdes Hailesilassie and brother Benyam Hailesilassie While expressing gratitude for the recognition, Hailesilassie said: “I hope that the refugee application system here could be quicker. Trapped in the long process, asylum seekers kill their time, youth and hope.” As one of the lucky ones living in a free and safe land, the Ethiopian said he had a job to do. For him, getting refugee status is not only about saving his life; it is about extending the fight for a better future for his country and people. He now has a younger brother and sister living with him in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province. They are seeking asylum here as both of them were under threat and detained in Ethiopia on charges of helping their elder brother leave the country.“No one is actually free and safe until all of us are free and safe,” he said. As a member of Solidarity Movement for a New Ethiopia, he has raised awareness of the brutality of his country’s ruling regime by running social media campaigns and holding rallies here. “We want to share the problems facing Ethiopia -- mass killings, torture, genocide, restriction of press freedom and civic movement -- and expose the situation there to foreign donor nations,” he said. “We want to be the voice of the voiceless in Ethiopia.”“Also, we are targeting Ethiopians within Ethiopia. They are usually uneducated and unaware of why they are hungry and how to fix it.” During the US Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to Korea on April 17, they staged a protest in front of the National Assembly building to call on the US to stop offering foreign aid to the Ethiopian government. The ruling government -- a US ally in its fight against terrorist group Al-Shabab in Somalia -- has received significant financial assistance from the US and European countries, with its economy heavily dependent on foreign aid. “Foreign powers should stop financing the authoritarian government to save Ethiopian people because the money goes into the pockets of high-ranking officials,” he said. Many foreign donors to Ethiopia have been criticized by human rights activists for being silent about Ethiopia’s human rights abuses for the sake of protecting their strategic partnerships on peacekeeping and security with the ruling regime.The European Parliament issued in January 2016 a resolution on the situation in Ethiopia. One of its pledges was to keep a close eye on the use of funds from European development assistance “to make sure that none of it trickles off to the central government to be used to prolong the suppression of its own people.” Recalling the peaceful candlelight vigils that continued for several months in South Korea against President Park Geun-hye, Hailessilassie said, “That is the democracy and freedom I want to bring back home.”“When I see you guys holding protests freely and peacefully, it was just so amazing for me. We would be shot by police if we raise our voices against the government in public,” he said.“If we could get freedom today, I would go back to my country right now. I like my job as a journalist. I like to speak my own language. I want to live with my family and pursue my culture in my land,” he said.

The result of its examination may define the Moon administration's future stance on the comfort women agreement as the administration remains undecided over whether it should finally be revoked or respected.    Since the inauguration of Moon, the foreign ministry has said, ""Both South Korea and Japan should make efforts to settle the deal in recognition of the reality that the majority of South Korean people and the victims don't approve of the deal.""","enslavement of korean women ,review sex slavery deal ,sexual enslavement of korean ,japanese army forced mobilization ,korean women ministry official","['Japan', 'korean', 'Moon Jae -', 'japanese', 'korean']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.14719392  0.37364307

Fourteen Canadian teachers at the Canadian British Columbia International School in eastern Seoul were the first to receive departure orders in April, after the authorities concluded the teachers should have obtained the E-7 visa, not E-2, to work as school teachers. The decision led to the shutdown of the institution, which had 160 students. The CBIS, certified by Canada’s British Columbia, had run the same curriculum as public schools in the Canadian province. Students were to receive a diploma accredited by the province to enter other schools or universities in Canada. However, it was authorized as a hagwon, or private academy, not school, by the Korean education office. There are a total of 11 such alternative schools certified by other Canadian provinces and jurisdictions in the United States.An image of Canadian British Columbia International School The Korea Immigration Service, when contacted by The Korea Herald, declined to confirm or deny a further crackdown on E-2 visa holders at such institutions. “We’re still in discussion of the matter,” an official said, adding the office will hold a meeting Monday to finalize its stance.Meanwhile, CBIS teachers cried foul. “When we desperately and very emotionally asked for help , we were given silence,” Margaret Hwu, who taught grade six at the CBIS, told local news outlets of Canada after being ordered to leave South Korea within 30 days, despite holding a government-endorsed E-2 visa.“And we actually didn’t get all our money ,” Hwu added. Another teacher argued that E-2 visa holders teaching subjects like math in English is a common practice at regular English academies. “All teachers do that even at hagwons. We teach students not only English but math and science. That’s what we do to teach a foreign language,” the teacher recently deported to the United States said in a YouTube video. She taught English literature and composition to grades 9, 10 and 12, in addition to AP English.The CBIS was not able to sponsor E-7 visas for its teachers, she insisted. “Under hagwon licenses, you are not allowed to be issued with anything but E-2 visas. That’s what they have been doing for the past five years at the school, and now they say we should be deported,” she added. As of April 30, 15,189 foreigners were working as language instructors under E-2 visas, according to the immigration watchdog. It is unclear how many of them are at risk for deportation for unauthorized teaching. Some critics say the target of the crackdown is not individual E-2 visa holders, but the private educational institutions. With relatively expensive tuition fees of between 12 million won  and 16 million won a year, elite private institutions have become a favored choice among parents not satisfied with the country’s education program at regular schools.President Moon Jae-in, who took office in May, also has vowed to get rid of elite private high schools, emphasizing “equal opportunity” and the negative impact such institutions have on the nation‘s current competition-driven education system. “The problem is under the current education system, students who excel in a foreign language or have studied abroad at an early age have few options to choose schools of their best interest,” Lim Sung-ho, CEO of Jongro Haneul Education, told The Korea Herald, pointing to a lack of options for high-performing students. “The new administration could face backlash from parents by blocking the English alternative schools without offering other options,” Lim added.By Bak Se-hwan","visa violations foreigners teaching ,schools fourteen canadian teachers ,foreign teachers left stranded ,crackdown on visa violations ,eviction from south korea","['South Korea', 'canadian', 'canadian', 'British Columbia International School', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.16361175  0.12203468

128,128,Moon denounces N. Korea over Warmbier’s death,"President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday held North Korea accountable for the death of an American student who died shortly after his release from detention in the communist state, calling the regime “irrational.”“We can make speculations that there were many unjust and cruel treatments to Mr. Warmbier and I strongly condemn such cruel actions by North Korea,” the South Korea president said in his exclusive interview wi...","President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday held North Korea accountable for the death of an American student who died shortly after his release from detention in the communist state, calling the regime “irrational.”“We can make speculations that there were many unjust and cruel treatments to Mr. Warmbier and I strongly condemn such cruel actions by North Korea,” the South Korea president said in his exclusive interview with US news outlet CBS.“We cannot know for sure that North Korea killed Mr. Warmbier, but I believe it is quite clear that they have a heavy responsibility in the process that led to his death.”Moon’s first interview as president with a US media outlet was pre-recorded in the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday morning with Norah O’Donnell, co-anchor of news program “This Morning.” President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday morning attends a pre-recorded televised interview with US news outlet CBS. The South Korean state chief’s remark seemed to agree, though indirectly, with US Sen. John McCain, who said the US citizen was “murdered” by the Kim Jong-un regime.Warmbier, a 22-year-old student at the University of Virginia, returned to his home Ohio last week in a comatose state after over 17 months of detention in North Korea, where he had been arrested for trying to steal a political propaganda sign. He died Monday.The series of events took place just before President Moon was due to visit Washington for the first-ever summit with US counterpart Donald Trump on June 29-30, adding to elevating disputes on North Korea’s nuclear program and an advanced US anti-missile shield to be deployed here.President Moon nevertheless stated that dialogue with Pyongyang is necessary to take a step towards denuclearization.“We must now have the perception that NK is an irrational regime, and dialogue is necessary as we were unable to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through sanctions and pressure only,” he said.President Moon Jae-in walks with Norah O’Donnell, co-anchor and interviewer for This Morning by CBS. Further tension mounted as the two moved on to the disparity between Seoul and Washington over the idea of holding talks with Pyongyang before it is fully denuclearized.“I believe that my position is not at odds with the policy of the United States or that of President Trump,” Moon said.His comment came in answer to the anchor‘s suggestion that Moon’s plan to hold a dialogue with North Korea stood against US policy and that it could create an issue in the upcoming summit.When asked whether the US president would “allow” such inter-Korean talks without concessions, Moon claimed it was not his plan to “give in” to the communist regime.“I have never mentioned a dialogue with no preconditions whatsoever,” he said, calling for a gradual approach towards denuclearizing the North.“I believe  first we must vie for a freeze of North Korea’s nuke and missile programs. And then, as a second phase, try to achieve the complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program.”After broadcasting the interview scene, anchor O‘connell suggested that Moon was hoping to visit Pyongyang and meet with Kim Jong-un in person, so as to make him believe through talks that the North Korean regime may be sustained without nuclear armament.By Bae Hyun-jung","moon denounces korea over ,death president moon jae ,korea over warmbier death ,moon denounces korea ,american student who died","['Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea', 'american', 'Warmbier', 'North Korea', 'South Korea']",27,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.17296667  0.74642736

It was only last week that the South’s intelligence agency revealed that six South Koreans are currently detained in the North -- three pastors for engaging in religious activities and three for defecting from the North. Despite increased public attention on their safety, following Warmbier’s comatose return home last week and death on Monday, as of Tuesday, very little is known about the six South Korean prisoners.Kim Kook-ki  and Choi Chun-gil are believed to be detained in North Korea. Officials in Seoul have struggled to figure out exactly where the detainees are located and how they are being treated, as North Korea rejects any request for dialogue on the matter, amid strained inter-Korean ties.  “If we restore dialogue with the North, the first thing we should do is to make sure of the safety of our people detained in the North,” an official from the Unification Ministry in Seoul said under the condition of anonymity on Tuesday. The inter-Korean dialogue channel was cut off early last year.Among the three detained pastors, the longest-serving is Kim Jong-wook, a missionary sentenced to hard labor for life in 2014 for allegedly spying and trying to set up underground churches. The other two -- Kim Kook-ki and Choi Chun-gil -- were also missionaries sentenced to life in prison in 2015 for espionage charges. Besides the six South Korean detainees, North Korea has also detained three Korean-Americans and one Korean-Canadian, according to the NIS. Among them are Kim Dong-chul, a naturalized US citizen born in South Korea, who was sentenced to hard labor for 10 years in 2016 after he admitted to “stealing” North Korean secrets during a press conference in Pyongyang. The government has tried to use international organizations to reach out to the detainees, but to no avail, the official said. The ministry made such requests to the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN committee on Enforced Disappearance. Pastor Kim Kook-ki was in bad condition with diabetes and high blood pressure when he was detained by the North in 2014, according to Lee Han-byeol, a director of Improving North Korean Human Rights Center, a Seoul-based human right civic group. Kim‘s current health status is yet to be verified, the ministry official said Tuesday. The three pastors -- who had engaged in religious activities in a city near the border between North Korea and China -- were accused of working with the South Korean spy agency to overthrow the Kim Jong-un regime. “Working under the instruction of the US government and its puppet spy agencies, they are frantic terrorists trying to overthrow our supreme leadership with dubious assassination attempts,” said the North Korean government at a press conference in 2015, where the pastors showed up before the reporters. Earlier this month, Peter Jung, the president of North Korea Justice Solidarity, held a press conference to call for the government’s swift action to bring back the detainees, denouncing North Korea for “prosecuting religion.”By Yeo Jun-suk","six south koreans imprisoned ,about six south koreans ,koreans are currently detained ,koreans imprisoned in north ,south koreans imprisoned","['american', 'North Korea', 'Otto Warmbier', 'South Korea', 'South Koreans']",27,"[ 0.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 ... -4.56866294e-01

Joseph Yun, held secret meetings with North Korean diplomats in Oslo and New York before flying to Pyongyang to bring home a long-detained comatose American college student, a news report said Wednesday.The Olso meeting took place last month after Yun, special representative for North Korea policy, persuaded Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to approve the rare contact by assuring him that the agenda would focus only on the status of Americans detained in the North, the Washington Post reported.Joseph Yun, US special representative for North Korea policy. During the meeting, North Korean diplomats agreed to allow Swedish diplomats in the North, who serve as the protecting power for American citizens, to visit US detainees, including Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old University of Virginia student held since January last year, the report said.After the North allowed Swedish officials to visit only one of the four American detainees, the US pressed hard for access to the others and the North requested an urgent meeting with Yun in New York and informed him that Warmbier had fallen into a coma due to food poisoning, according to the report.Following the meeting, Yun and two American physicians flew to Pyongyang on a US plane Monday under orders from President Donald Trump to demand to ""see Warmbier immediately, and, 'if he was in bad shape, to demand his immediate release,'"" the report cited an unidentified official as saying.While in Pyongyang, Yun also visited the three other American detainees, the report said.The Oslo meeting is believed to be the first time officials of the two countries have met face-to-face in a long time. It came as tensions are running high between the two countries with the North carrying out a series of ballistic missile tests and the US working hard to drive up pressure on Pyongyang.The secret meetings might lead to resumption of broader talks between the two sides. The paper said that whether the back-channel diplomacy leads to the resumption of nuclear negotiations could depend on Warmbier's condition. But it also cited a congressional aide familiar with the process as saying that Tillerson was ""adamant that Yun participate in the meetings only under the precondition that the detained Americans be the focus of the agenda.""""It was not for broader diplomacy or engagement,"" the aide was quoted as saying.","korean diplomats in oslo ,bringing detained college student ,comatose american college student ,detained comatose american college ,college student news report","['WASHINGTON', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Amb', 'Joseph Yun', 'north korean', 'Oslo', 'New York', 'Pyongyang', 'american', 'Olso', 'Yun', 'North Korea', 'State', 'Rex Tillerson']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08687535  0.2897194

His parents later told the Washington Post that their son was being transported on a US military plane in a coma. The parents were also quoted as saying that North Korean officials informed them via US envoys that Warmbier fell ill from botulism sometime after his trial in March last year and fell into a coma after taking a sleeping pill.Earlier, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced Warmbier's release, but made no mention of his condition.""At the direction of the President, the Department of State has secured the release of Otto Warmbier from North Korea. Mr. Warmbier is en route to the United States, where he will be reunited with his family,"" Tillerson said in a statement. ""The Department of State continues to have discussions with the DPRK regarding three other US citizens reported detained. Out of respect for the privacy of Mr. Warmbier and his family, we have no further comment on Mr. Warmbier,"" he said.The North first informed the US Monday last week that Warmbier is in a coma, and President Donald Trump was immediately informed of the fact and ordered his medical evacuation, according to the Washington Post. The US special representative for North Korea policy, Joseph Yun, traveled with doctors to Pyongyang on a military medical plane to bring Warmbier home, the report said.On Tuesday morning, Tillerson reported to Trump that Warmbier is on the way home, and the last instruction Trump gave was: ""Take care of Otto,"" the paper quoted a senior administration official as saying. In this Feb. 29, 2016 file photo, American student Otto Warmbier speaks to reporters in Pyongyang, North Korea. Secretary of State Tillerson said Tuesday, June 13, 2017, that North Korea released the jailed U.S. university student. It was unclear if the North's claim was credible and why the regime held Warmbier for more than a year even after he fell into a coma. But the development is sure to significantly deteriorate the already bad relations between Washington and Pyongyang.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US is pleased to have Warmbier back home. But she declined to talk about his health conditions, saying it goes against State Department guidelines.Warmbier's release coincided with a visit to the North by NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman, but Nauert said that the two cases have nothing to do with each other.She also urged Americans not to visit the North.Warmbier was arrested in January 2016 for stealing a political propaganda sign from a hotel and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. His release brought to three the number of Americans held in the North.The three other detainees are all Korean-American men. Two of them, Kim Hak-song and Kim Sang-dok, were detained earlier this year, while the third, Kim Dong-chul, was arrested in October 2015 and sentenced to 10 years of hard labor on charges of espionage and subversion.American visitors have often been detained in North Korea on charges of anti-state and other unspecified crimes. The widespread views are that the communist nation has used the detentions as bargaining chips in its negotiations with Washington.Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary, served two years of detention in the North before being released in November 2014 when then-US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a secret trip to Pyongyang to win his release and that of another US detainee.","in coma his parents ,korea is in coma ,17 months of detention ,college student just freed ,freed from long detention","['WASHINGTON', 'american', 'North Korea', 'Otto Warmbier', 'University of Virginia', 'the Washington Post']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50222075  0.22968683

This was in response to controversial remarks by Toshihiro Nikai, secretary-general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. In his meeting with South Korean lawmakers on Saturday, he called for efforts to ""eradicate"" those seeking any tricks. Toshihiro Nikai , special envoy for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and other Japanese officials visit the Seoul National Cemetery on June 12, 2017. He didn't mention any specific issue but his remarks as special envoy for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe were interpreted by critics as pointing to those demanding renegotiation of a 2015 deal signed between the two neighbors on the so-called comfort women issue.""It is necessary to be careful in making any comments on bilateral relations between the two countries such as the comfort women matter,"" a foreign ministry official said on condition of anonymity.He added that the government stance has been relayed to Tokyo recently.The comfort women, who refer to those forced into frontline brothels for Japanese troops during World War II, have been a thorny diplomatic issue between Seoul and Japan. Though the two signed a deal in December 2015 to resolve the issue once and for all, critics have called for its renegotiation, saying that it was hastily arranged without seeking public consensus and securing a heart-felt apology from Japan.President Moon Jae-in said in his telephone conversation with Abe following his inauguration on May 10 that many South Koreans cannot accept the deal ""emotionally,"" hinting that his government might be in pursuit of changes to it. Nikai is to meet with President Moon on Monday and deliver Abe's letter to him. His visit to South Korea is a return for Moon's special envoy to Japan who earlier delivered his personal letter to the Japanese leader.","slavery of korean women ,with south korean lawmakers ,korean lawmakers on satu ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,south korean lawmakers","[""South Korea 's"", 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Toshihiro Nikai', 'Japan', 'Liberal Democratic Party', 'south korean', 'Satu']",27,"[ 0.          1.          3.         ... -0.24699356  0.3387222

137,137,South Korea’s energy industry at crossroads,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s approach toward energy production is raising hopes for the end of coal and nuclear power plants in the country.The liberal leader -- an advocate of nuclear-zero Korea -- and his administration have unveiled a roadmap to reduce reliance on nuclear and coal energy, citing public concerns over air pollution and nuclear safety.At present, 25 reactors are in service and the Moon admin...","South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s approach toward energy production is raising hopes for the end of coal and nuclear power plants in the country.The liberal leader -- an advocate of nuclear-zero Korea -- and his administration have unveiled a roadmap to reduce reliance on nuclear and coal energy, citing public concerns over air pollution and nuclear safety.At present, 25 reactors are in service and the Moon administration aims to begin by shutting down aged facilities and eventually phasing out the rest over the next 40 years.Moon’s strategy includes moving toward green sources playing a bigger role in energy production for South Korea. He aims for liquefied natural gas to meet 37 percent of the country’s energy needs by 2030, while raising the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources to around 20 percent.Gori nuclear power plant in northern Busan Nuclear power plants are responsible for about one-third of the country’s power supply, as nuclear energy was preferred to traditional sources like coal power over the past decades, due to lower greenhouse gas emissions.“No single country on Earth would use nuclear energy because they like it,” said Lee Kwan-seob, chief of Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., in a recent interview with a local newspaper.“Korea has no option but to use it simply because it is the cheapest source,” Lee said.‘One-dimensional’ approachThe KHNP’s building of two more nuclear reactors, Shin Kori No. 5 and No. 6, slated for 2022 completion may come to a halt, following President Moon’s promise to review the move, as part of his plans to put an end to the nuclear energy industry here. The KHNP has already put in 1.5 trillion won  and completed 28 percent of the construction.Experts, however, voice concern over the country’s energy needs.“Whether or not Moon actually halts construction on coal and nuclear plants will depend on whether or not South Korea can meet its energy needs without them,” said Choi Ki-ryun a professor of energy engineering from Ajou University.“The government’s one-dimensional approach to simply close down nuclear reactors is overlooking the crucial need for financial assistance for electricity production,” he said.Instead, Korea should keep a “minimum number of nuclear reactors,” he added.“Korea should keep the reliance on nuclear reactors at a 20 percent level, about 10 percent less than the current level, as a ‘small module’ can keep the nuclear industry at a safer status in energy production.”A minimum number of nuclear reactors must be operated to support energy needs and meet projected electricity demand, as well as to maintain “energy security,” according to the professor. Industry insiders also echoed his view. “Thanks to nuclear reactors built and operated since 1978, Korea could keep electricity at low prices and become a country with a developed economy,” said Noh Dong-seok, a researcher at the Korea Energy Economic Institute during a symposium held Thursday to celebrate the operation completion of Kori No. 1. “The government’s pledges are not feasible because such a transition will be unable to meet projected electricity demand at a reasonable price,” he said.“Also, there’s no guarantee that prices for gas and renewables will fall quickly enough to allow a significant rate hike to be avoided.”According to data from the KEEI, if the government replaces all 25 nuclear reactors with renewable energy generators, the public will pay prices that are at least 79 percent higher than current electricity prices. Weak renewable energy infrastructureKorea does not have enough technological knowledge to increase its energy reliance on renewable sources, other experts said.“The supply of renewable energy remains precarious, because humans cannot control such sources,” said Kim Seung-rae, a professor of economics from Hallym University.“Nuclear-zero or coal-zero policies have a very low feasibility,” he argued, adding that Korea needs more research and development in energy storage systems in order to increase its proportion of green energy reliance. According to scholars, a nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1,400 kilowatts is equivalent to a total of 1,700 wind power generators that each generate 3 megawatts. They highlight Korea’s lack of large sites to build winder generators, each the size of a 33-storey apartment building, making it difficult to build more.Last summer, the Energy Ministry disapproved of North Jeolla Province’s plan to create a wind power generator cluster, due to strong opposition from nearby residents and civic groups for similar reasons. The efficiency of solar power generators is also in question, considering the massive amount of fine dust it creates and short inverter span.Experts say that such conditions would push up electricity prices.The Korea Power Exchange currently controls the price of electricity generated from nuclear reactors at 62.69 won  per kilowatt per hour, far cheaper than those produced by coal-power plants , liquefied natural gas  and renewable energy .“Experts view that renewable sources generating 10 percent of total electricity production by 2030 is a ‘dream,’ as the current administration is overlooking plans to transport and store the renewable energy sources,” said Seo Kyun-reol, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University, during a debate in April. Civic groups stage protest in Busan demanding the government to order halt on construction of Shin Kori No.5 and No.6. Meanwhile, environmental activists still hope to see a paradigm shift in the energy industry here. “Putting a halt to the construction of new nuclear reactors is certainly not enough,” Kim Mi-kyung, a campaigner at Green Peace, told the Korea Herald. “Authorities should invest more time and money in figuring out the safest way to operate or build more radioactive waste management facilities if necessary, since the follow-up management of nuclear power plants is more important,” Kim stressed.She called for the establishment of an independent green energy committee in charge of thorough research and development of eco-power.“What is urgent for now is not to stop constructing new reactors, but rather to completely suspend the operation of the No. 1 to 4 reactors,” the Korean Federation of Environmental Movement said in a statement.Urging the Moon administration to make good on the president’s election pledges, members of the KFEM demanded the president provide a clear roadmap for the future of the nuclear industry before June 18, when the Kori 1 reactor will be permanently suspended. Kori No. 1, the country’s first nuclear reactor, began operating in 1978 and completed its designed life in 2007. But its operation was extended to generate more electricity, pushing for electricity production of 40 years. Environmental groups and local residents expect the Wolsung No.1 reactor in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, to shut down as well, as they won a court injunction on the government’s approval for the extended operation of another 10 years of the reactor that had already completed its 30-year run in 2012. The reactor, still in operation as of June 8, has been at the center of safety concerns over old nuclear plants due to a series of breakdowns caused by power outages. “Taiwan even stopped a nuclear reactor with 98 percent of its construction completed. Taiwanese lawmakers decided to become a nuclear-zero country by 2025. The process for Taiwan was certainly not easy, as the country continuously went back and forth from operation and suspension of the nuclear power plants,” said Yang Yi-wonyoung, head of the KFEM.“A bumpy road is also ahead for Korea. But small steps starting from closing older nuclear reactors and investing in green energy will help Korea change.”By Kim Da-sol","south korean president moon ,crossroads south korean president ,advocate of nuclear zero ,korean president moon jae ,south korean president","['south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Korea', 'Moon']",27,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40254056  0.79679698

Kim Yong-chol, a senior official in the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Unification of Korea told the AFP in Pyongyang that the South Korean government should repatriate the 12 former restaurant workers and another citizen named Kim Ryon-hui who requested to return to her homeland in 2015. “At the moment another issue is more important and more urgent,” Kim said, saying the 13 people were “being detained by force in South Korea.” “They should be returned immediately.” Kim added. “Unless Kim Ryon-hui and 12 other female workers are returned immediately there can never be any kind of humanitarian cooperation. And this is our principled stand.”This photo taken on June 2, 2017, shows members of a South Korean civic group calling on the government to expand civilian inter-Korean exchanges. The father of Ri Ji-ye, one of the 12, he said, “died with his eyes open and cursing the conservative elements who have detained his daughter.” The escape of the 12 waitresses in their 20s in April 2016 gained international traction due chiefly to the mass defection and their highly clandestine journey from the Chinese city of Ningbo to Seoul. Since their release from custody in August, they have reportedly entered universities in Korea, but never made public appearances, living under strict government protection required for high-profile defectors. Most defectors flee their homeland in pursuit of a freer, more prosperous life in the South. But Pyongyang has persistently made claims the 12 were kidnapped by Seoul’s spy agency and called for their return. Kim Ryon-hui, a dressmaker, held a news conference in August 2015 to plead for her return, saying she had been deceived by a defector broker in China, and expressed her wish to return upon her landing here in September 2011. But Seoul has virtually brushed off her request because Kim has already become a South Korean, and under the law all South Koreans are mandated to secure government approval to visit the North, with only the possibility for a temporary stay. A Ministry of Unification official dismissed the North’s demand again, saying family reunions and defectors are separate issues. The government has already verified the 12 waitresses’ intentions to stay here and its position on the dressmaker’s return remains unchanged, the official added. “The families were forcibly split by the two Koreas’ history and different systems, and it’s an issue that could not be solved if too much time passes,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity, stressing that nearly 4,000 family members have died.“We had given  our nationality through  procedures. She came here by her own, voluntary decision, but now says she’s changed her mind and wants to go back, that’s beyond the law.” Pyongyang’s unusual linkage of the separated families and defector issues came days after the ruling Democratic Party of Korea and three minor opposition parties agreed to push for what would be a first round of family gatherings under Moon, in time for the Aug. 15 Liberation Day holiday, celebrated in both the North and South. The prospects for the plan, however, remain bleak, given the main opposition Liberty Korea Party’s skepticism, as well as the Kim Jong-un regime’s ongoing nuclear development and missile provocations. Despite the liberal president’s resolve to restart civilian humanitarian aid, the communist state recently rejected a proposal from a Seoul-based civic group. “Kim Jong-un has eyes set on the 12 female defectors here, so he could use them as leverage and pressure on the new government here. It can be also viewed as a test for the Moon administration,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul said. “With North Korea’s current human rights issue at the center of global attention, Kim Ryon-hui can also be used as propaganda to magnify the South’s human rights issue as well.”By Jung Min-kyung","restaurant in china last ,reunions nk north korea ,return no family reunions ,korean war in another ,demanded south korea return","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Yong - chol', 'the North ’s Committee', 'AFP']",27,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.58677864  0.28680205

She refused to answer reporters' questions.  Yoo Sum-na The 51-year-old was transferred to the prosecutors' office in Incheon to face questioning for financial irregularities related to the operator of the ill-fated Sewol ferry.""I have never attempted to flee South Korea,"" the younger Yoo told reporters before entering the prosecution office, denying allegations brought against her.The 6,800-ton ship sank off the country's southwestern coast on April 16, 2014, killing more than 300 passengers, mostly high school students on a field trip.  ""I feel so sad and am aware that no kind words could heal the tragedy,"" Yoo said. However, she also denied that her father was the de facto owner of the Sewol ferry company.French police took Yoo into custody at her home near the Champs-Elysees in Paris and escorted her to the South Korean prosecution officials, they said. She is the first extradition case since the extradition treaty between the two countries took effect in 2008.As the prosecution launched an investigation into the elder Yoo's finances in relation to the disaster, she was put on Interpol's wanted list at the South Korean prosecution's request. But she fled the country that year after refusing to be summoned for suspected embezzlement worth some 49 billion won  from Cheonghaejin Marine Co. While she was in France, Yoo filed for an appeal with Conseil d'Etat, the highest administrative court in France, on the extradition order handed down by a lower court. The court has dismissed her appeal.","france extradited her three ,daughter of late businessman ,paris incheon the daughter ,plane bound for incheon ,arrest on embezzlement charges","['PARIS', 'INCHEON', 'France', ""the Incheon District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Yoo Sum - na', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Korean Airlines', 'Incheon', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3914288   0.44886455

Security Council voted unanimously to sanction more North Korean officials and entities, including a military unit handling ballistic missiles, after the North carried out a series of missile tests.   North Korea also rebuffed a plan by a South Korean association of seven religions to visit Pyongyang.   ""North Korea sent a message via fax which says it is inappropriate for the two Koreas to talk about peace when South Korea supported the UNSC sanctions against the North last week,"" said an official at the Korean Conference of Religions for Peace.   North Korea's response is likely to dampen President Moon's move to seek engagement with the reclusive country.   If the North accepted the Korean Sharing Movement's shipments, it could have become the first local civic group to provide humanitarian assistance to the North since January 2016.   The government under former President Park Geun-hye has suspended almost all civilian exchanges with North Korea since the country's fourth nuclear test early last year.   On May 22, Seoul's unification ministry said that it will sternly respond to North Korea's provocative acts, but plans to resume civilian inter-Korean exchanges to an extent that the move would not hamper the international sanctions regime.   The government has approved a total of 15 requests by civic groups to contact North Koreans over inter-Korean exchanges since Moon took office in May.   A ministry official said the government has no comment on North Korea's latest rejection.   Meanwhile, a local civic group said it has accepted North Korea's proposal to hold a joint summit anniversary event in Pyongyang this month.   The South's part hoped to hold the event on June 15 in the North Korean border city of Kaesong, but the North's side insisted that it should be held in Pyongyang.   ""We plan to ask the government to approve our plan to visit North Korea after discussing details of the event such as a delegation,"" the group said.   South and North Korea held their first summit in June 2000, which produced key agreements on inter-Korean reconciliation.   The ministry cast a prudent stance over whether it will approve the South group's visit, saying that it will take into account the event's purpose, inter-Korean relations and the international environment.","rejects korean civilian offers ,nk rejects korean civilian ,rejected south korean civic ,rejects korean civilian ,in protest of seoul","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'the Korean Sharing Movement', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17592579 -0.19252162

Known for her expertise on human rights at the United Nations for the past decade, Kang was recently tapped to lead the country's foreign ministry. A confirmation hearing for her is scheduled for next week.  The remarks are seen as her critical stance on a 2015 deal reached with Japan aimed at putting an end to the decades-old rift over the issue of the so-called comfort women, a term referring to those forced into front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II.Under the deal, Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the surviving victims of sexual slavery.

Those who have traveled to affected regions in the past two months are advised to avoid any sexual contact or use contraceptives.The virus, first discovered in Africa, is not life-threatening but may be linked to thousands of birth defects in newborn babies like abnormally small heads and improperly developed brains.","20th zika virus infection ,year old korean woman ,confirms 20th zika virus ,virus infection south korea ,zika virus infection south","['South Korea', 'korean', 'maldive', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.42989224  0.17604056

Kim was also convicted of abandoning the bodies and siphoning off 2.4 million won  from the victims. Prosecutors accused Kim of stealing another 720 million won from their account, but the court acquitted him of the charges, citing a lack of evidence. ""Taking away a person's life is a crime that cannot be tolerated under any reason,"" the court said. ""The bereaved families of the victims are expected to live the rest of their lives suffering from huge losses, but the defendant did not take any action that could cure their suffering or sadness.""

Yoo Sum-na, the daughter of Yoo Byung-eun, has been on the Interpol's wanted list at the South Korean prosecution's request. She faces embezzlement charges. ""The French justice ministry notified us on Tuesday that Yoo Sum-na's appeal on the extradition order was dismissed at its highest administrative court Conseil d'Etat and that all the necessary procedures have been completed in France,"" South Korea's Ministry of Justice said in a statement.The ministry is discussing with its French counterpart extraditing her on Tuesday, it said.The 6,800-ton ferry sank off the country's southwestern coast on April 16, 2014, killing more than 300 passengers, mostly high school students on a school trip.The French police said they will hold her at a detention center until she takes an Incheon-bound flight on June 6. The prosecutors from Seoul will arrest her aboard the plane. The 51-year-old is accused of embezzling 49.2 billion won  from subsidiaries of her father's company, Cheonghaejin Marine Co.According to French authorities, the top administrative court Conseil d'Etat has dismissed Yoo's appeal she filed against the ruling that approved her extradition. She fled to France three years ago when the South Korean prosecution summoned her for questioning soon after the ferry disaster. In May of that year, she was arrested by the French police in Paris but asked to be investigated without detention on grounds that she had a teenage son to look after. She served 13 months in jail, until she was released in June 2015, on condition that she needs to report her whereabouts to the police regularly.","paris seoul the daughter ,daughter of late businessman ,request she faces embezzlement ,korean prosecution request she ,ferry disaster in 2014","['PARIS / SEOUL', 'South Korea', 'french', 'Yoo Sum - na', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Interpol', 'south korean', 'french', 'Tu']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.65615982  0.22954632

Vice Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, who returned from India where he served as the country's ambassador, made the remarks during a meeting with reporters. He was chosen to be a second vice foreign minister late last month.Vice Foreign Minister Cho Hyun Asked what diplomatic decisions made under the previous government fell short of people's expectations, he cited the deal reached in December 2015. Under the deal, Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen  to a foundation dedicated to supporting the surviving victims of sexual slavery. The organization was launched last year.Critics doubt the sincerity of the apology as Japan refused to recognize its legal responsibility for the forced mobilization of the women. They also criticized that the deal was hastily arranged without sufficiently seeking the opinions of victims.""When the deal was announced, I was traveling on business with a colleague. I told him that it is highly wrong and would cause a problem. It turned out I was right,"" he said.Cho said that the decision was a representative case of a ""top-down"" decision-making process.The diplomat said public opinion should also be collected over the controversial issue of deploying the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system.""We should strategically build up plans and accept practical limits and public opinions to build a road map for negotiations rather than reacting every time there are  suggestions like this one,"" he said, referring to remarks by US Senator of Illinois Dick Durbin who is visiting there.Durbin earlier said the US could divert the $923 million of THAAD deployment budget to some other place if Seoul does not want the defense system. He said such a stance was communicated to President Moon Jae-in during a meeting with him. ""The senator could represent or not represent the US,"" he said. On the same day during Jeju Forum, an annual global forum on peace and prosperity on the resort island of Jeju, Japanese Amb. to South Korea Yasumasa Nagamine said Japan will maintain its position to stick to the deal, but continue to discuss the bilateral issue with the new Moon Jae-in administration in South Korea."" was a historic agreement which was announced by Japan and Korea together in front of the international community and very much welcomed by the international community,"" the ambassador said in a round-table discussion on East Asian cooperation. ""So the agreement should be honored and then faithfully implemented. That is a position led by Japan. We continue to keep this position and then discuss with the new government with this position, according to Nagamine. Asked whether the deal could be modified by any degree, he said ""the new Korean government's policy is now developing, so we are going to have full picture of the new policies not only this issue but also foreign policy issues. So we look forward to engaging with the ne government under such circumstances."" The both sides basically shared the common understanding that ""any thorny issues shouldn't stand in the way to advancing overall bilateral relationship,"" the ambassador added.","thursday denounced 2015 deal ,enslavement of korean women ,korea on thursday denounced ,last month vice foreign ,japan wartime sexual enslavement","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Cho Hyun', 'India', 'Cho Hyun']",27,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.16457668  0.35889113

Over 1.8 million police officers and investigators pushed to solve the case with 3,000 suspects, but the case eventually went nowhere due to the lack of forensic knowledge and technology back then.  Composite sketch of the murder suspect in the Hwaseong serial killings.Material evidence, such as semen samples from victims, hair and cigarette butts, were collected, but all failed to pinpoint the identity of the killer. It is now legally impossible to bring the uncaught killer to justice since the statute of limitations has already passed on the case. According to Kwon, a case turns cold either because it was investigated during a time when the nation lacked profiling skills or the investigation process is prolonged to prevent wrongful conviction. “Cases like the Hwaseong serial killings went cold because of dated forensic technology,” said Kwon. The late 1980s and early 1990s were when a sharp shift in crime motivations occurred, as fast changes in society and the economy left behind people at the margins of society, but the authorities failed to adapt to the times, he noted. More than a decade after the Hwaseong case, renowned director Bong Joon-ho made a film loosely based on the sequence of events. “Memories of Murder”  attracted 5.3 million moviegoers nationwide and added more notoriety to the controversial case.Recent hit South Korean dramas, such as tvN’s “Signal” and OCN’s “Tunnel,” have also brought back nauseating memories from times when the nation has been shocked by horrendous questions that remain unanswered to this day. Both have time traveling as their main plot device, which seems to reflect the desire of many to solve cases that remain frozen in time. Recently, cold case teams within police departments have been focusing on reopening files that have been buried in dust. Unsolved cases from the early 2000s were brought back with the hope of discovering new evidence through advanced technology.Another mysterious rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl that happened in South Jeolla Province in 2001, called the “Dedeul River case,” is an example of a case that was reopened with successful results. Police focused on reanalyzing DNA data extracted from retained semen samples along with new evidence found in the archives. A 40-year-old man surnamed Kim, who was already serving in prison on charges of robbery and murder, was resentenced to life in prison for his past wrongdoing. Kwon said that it is crucial to keep an open mind when reinvestigating a case and recommended minimized exposure to outdated records which can distract one from producing fresh theories. “The original files could hold errors which can sidetrack investigators from seeing the truth.”He added that modern-day cold cases sometimes derive from complacent attitudes such as the police not taking disappearance reports seriously. Kwon also emphasized the importance of patience and heading in the right direction when pursuing a reopened cold case. “Solving a cold case is not only about the results, but the process itself,” said Kwon. “When a case is finally solved after a period of stagnation, then there is nothing better than that.”By Jung Min-kyung","devastating cold case south ,south korea first criminal ,most devastating cold case ,murders series of rapes ,the most devastating cold","['south korean', 'Hwaseong', 'Hwaseong', 'South Korea', 'Kwon Il - yong', 'South Korea ’s']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.60395265 -0.04341033

According to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency on Wednesday, the 40-year-old man surnamed Choi, who was once a bar employee, got the idea from apps that filter out spam calls and had an unidentified app professional create it for 3.5 million won  in July 2015.According to the police, the app, named Golden Bell, identifies whether the caller is a guest or a police officer based on information shared by its users. Brothel operators who were busted by undercover policemen provide the phone numbers of the officers to the app’s database to help other business operators avoid crackdowns. The database had about 5 million phone numbers of guests and policemen collected this way, police said.It also showed information about callers with unregistered number by retrieving data from internet and social media such as Facebook, Google and Naver.Choi sold the app to 448 sex workers nationwide for a monthly fee of 50,000 won. The money he earned through it from Nov. 4, 2015, to March 13 amounts to 120 million won.“Prostitution is evolving into a high-tech crime,” a police official said. “I was surprised to see all the phone numbers I use in the office entered into the app.” Along with Kim, police arrested 44 others on suspicion of offenses related to the illegal sex trade, including 17 Thai prostitutes and 21 brothel staff.By Byun Hee-jin","police crackdowns south korean ,calls from undercover policemen ,crackdowns south korean authorities ,brothel owners to filter ,man arrested on suspicion","['south korean', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Choi']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43881217  0.28998345

A lawyer for the captain said her client was being punished for having consensual sex with his partner in a private space. She said the captain was briefly treated at a hospital for shock following his conviction. ""It's a ridiculous ruling,"" said lawyer Kim In-sook. She said the military penal code, which makes homosexual activity punishable by up to two years in prison, was unconstitutional because it tramples on basic human rights and dignity.  South Korea's military, which doesn't reveal how often it pursues cases against soldiers suspected of being gay, didn't immediately make a statement.Kim said it's unclear whether her client would appeal his six month prison sentence that was suspended by a year because he felt tormented by the legal process. He will be dishonorably discharged if the ruling stays.The captain was arrested last month amid allegations by a watchdog that South Korea's military was hunting down and prosecuting gay servicemen. South Korea's army has denied such claims, saying it was conducting a criminal investigation of soldiers who posted a video on the internet of two male soldiers having sex earlier this year. Lim Tae-hoon, who heads the Military Human Rights Center for Korea, which complained about the crackdown, said in an earlier interview with The Associated Press that neither the captain nor his partner had anything to do with the soldiers involved with the video leak. According to Lim, military investigators used the information gained from their inquiry into the video case to track down other gay soldiers. Investigators threatened soldiers to out their gay peers, confiscated cellphones to check communication records, and even used dating apps to dupe soldiers into revealing their sexual identity, Lim said. Lim's group released a statement denouncing Wednesday's ruling, saying that it ""turned the clock of history backward.""  ""Sexual minorities who are always living in danger of being outed by others now must live in fear that they could be tracked down at any time and interrogated over their private lives,"" the group said. Roseann Rife, East Asia research sirector at Amnesty International, called for the ""unjust conviction"" to be immediately overturned. In conservative South Korea, gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people are harshly stigmatized and struggle to be politically visible, while a powerful Christian lobby immobilizes politicians seeking to pass anti-discrimination laws. That stigma is amplified in the military, where most able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve about two years as the country maintains a large force in the face of potential conflict with North Korea. Gay men are not exempt from conscription but are banned from engaging in homosexual activity while serving, leading to an environment in which they serve without revealing their sexual identity for fear of discrimination and reprisals.","soldier over gay sex ,convicts soldier over gay ,soldier over gay ,korean military court convicts ,wednesday sentenced an army",['south korean'],27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39511266  0.40461719

The Malaysian government never issued an instruction not to hire the last batch of 35 North Korean workers whose work permits expired in May, and yet no employers applied for the renewal of their work permits, The Borneo Post quoted Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Datuk Masir Kujat as saying in an interview the previous day. A photo capture from the homepage of The Borneo Post of Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Datuk Masir Kujat. ""Since there is no directive not to recruit North Korean workers, why their employers did not continue the contracts, I am also not sure. The fact remains that no one applied for the renewal of their work permits. So upon expiry, these 35 North Korean workers with valid permits just left the state,"" Masir said. After these workers left, there is no more of them left in the state, he said.Sarawak has been the sole Malaysian province that has recruited North Korean workers since the 1980s, with hundreds of North Koreans working especially in coal mines and the construction sector until recently.The North Koreans usually stayed at their workplace and did not mix with the locals. As they were reclusive and preferred to lay low, their presence was hardly known to the public, the daily said.""Their presence in Sarawak, however, has been brought into the limelight especially during the recent strenuous situation between Malaysia and North Korea following disagreements over the investigation of the murder of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13,"" the daily added.","no north korean workers ,jakarta all north korean ,decades as no employers ,the malaysian government never ,monday the malaysian government","['north korean', 'malaysian', 'malaysian', 'north korean']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72438806  0.61761993

A group of family members of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War participate in the Korea Revisit program hosted by the South Korean government in 2015. The US dispatched 1.79 million service members and more than 33,000 of them were killed in action with nearly 8,200 others missing in action, according to official data.The ministry said 53 children, siblings and other relatives of 27 victims will participate in the program to run from next Monday through Saturday.It's meant to express sympathy for the families who suffered the loss of their loved ones, commemorate their sacrifice and show how it has helped South Korea develop, said the ministry.""We hope the participants will realize that their families' sacrifices were not in vain and they can be proud of that,"" it said.They are scheduled to visit the Agency for KIA Recovery and Identification at the Ministry of National Defense, attend an honor and tribute ceremony for US soldiers killed in the Korean War, and tour Panmunjom, a truce village in the demilitarized zone.Those who will join the event include Michael Bruce Bliss, a son of Clarence Bruce Bliss who went missing in action at the age of 29.He was quoted as saying that the loss of his father was a ""terrible blow"" to his whole family, which still hopes that he will return home some day.""Visiting Korea will be a meaningful and almost sacred experience for me. It will be where my father gave his life. The chance to touch the soil where he died will somehow connect me closer to him and I am appreciative to the people in the US and Korea who are making this possible,"" Bliss said, according to the ministry.A South Korean veterans association launched the Korea Revisit program in 1975.

However, he fell from 3 meters above ground as there were no balcony or emergency stairs installed outside the exit door.An emergency exit door is not installed without an emergency staircase or ladder. Families of victims said it does not make sense that the emergency exits in a four-story building were unequipped with stairways or ladders connecting to the ground, making it impossible for people to escape if an accident happens.“If there was at least a handrail or balcony outside the emergency exit door, my husband would not have just fallen off and died,” said Kim’s wife. “How can public officials approve the safety of this kind of building? This is nonsense.” According to current law, it is not mandatory for building constructors to attach an emergency staircase or guardrail outside of emergency exits.Under the Special Act on the Safety Control of Publicly Used Establishments, a building meets safety standards if its occupants have access to “safety facilities such as fire-fighting facilities, emergency exits and evacuation passageways inside a place of business.” Although these emergency exits could pose a threat, those who lock emergency exit doors will be fined up to 3 million won . “Those emergency exits are no different to doorways to cliff. Safety and construction laws should be revised accordingly to make sure people inside a building can use exits practically when they need to escape,” said Lee Young-ju a professor of fire emergency management at University of Seoul.An emergency exit door is not installed without an emergency staircase or ladder. There has been a number of accidents caused by unsafe emergency exits.In 2015, two men in their 20s fell from an emergency exit on the fourth floor of a building, as they thought there was a balcony outside the exit. The incident left one dead and the other severely injured. Last June, a 22-year-old woman walked into the fire exit on the second floor of a building and fell 3.8 meters to the ground. She reportedly said that she opened the exit door and walked in to look for a toilet. A foldable ladder had been placed in the hallway, but not installed outside the emergency exit, the police later found. Following a series of accidents, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security moved to revise the related law.Last October, the ministry required the owners of buildings -- those constructed after October 2016 -- to install alarms that sound when an emergency exit door opens. To prevent falls, owners must place a safety rope outside fire exit doors and put prevention signs on the doors.By Kim Da-sol","death in chuncheon gangwon ,his death in chuncheon ,man accidentally fell ,gangwon province the accident ,death in chuncheon","['Chuncheon', 'Gangwon Province', 'Kim']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27513769 -0.01254406

Moon Hee-Sang of the president’s governing Democratic Party of Korea. “I’m just a special envoy. I’ll deliver  the president’s message and the  peoples’ perception.”Moon Hee-sang , a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Party, speaks to reporters at Seoul's Gimpo International Airport before heading to Tokyo as South Korean President Moon Jae-in's special envoy on May 17, 2017. In an interview with Yonhap News Agency on Sunday, Rep. Moon indicated that as relations have continued to worsen between South Korea and Japan over the sex slavery deal, Seoul would seek a different approach rather than a renegotiation or annulment of the bilateral agreement. President Moon told his counterpart Shinzo Abe during their first phone call that most South Koreans rejected the agreement, but the envoy said the president did not specifically mention “renegotiation or annulment” of the deal, a move that the president had promised during the campaign trail.The envoy added that he would discuss with Japan over when to hold a summit, saying it should take place “as soon as possible.” The two countries’ leaders had met almost annually since 2000, but this was halted since 2012 when bilateral relations worsened over territorial and historical disputes.“It is hard to hammer out a specific schedule right now. We need to exchange our views over the issue. ... Our basic position is that we need to meet as much as possible and as soon as possible,” said Rep. Moon after arriving at Tokyo in the afternoon.During the four-day visit, Rep. Moon is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Kishida Fumio, Defense Minister Yoshihide Suga and Toshihiro Nikai, secretary-general of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. On his campaign trail, President Moon vowed to scrap the sex slavery agreement struck by former President Park Geun-hye in 2015, claiming that the deal was hastily arranged without reaching out to the public including the surviving victims of sex slavery.

The North has withdrawn its workers from the restaurant located in Kuala Lumpur and the closure has to do with a drop in customers and revenue, the sources told Yonhap News Agency. It is one of around 10 North Korean restaurants in Southeast Asia, which are known as sources of hard currency for the Kim Jong-un regime. The North is suspected of using the money to bankroll its nuclear and missile programs. ""The restaurant, the only one that the North has been operating in Malaysia, recently went out of business, and the North seemed to have withdrawn its workers,"" a source said on condition of anonymity. The latest closure seems to be the result of the ramped-up sanctions against the North and increased awareness that the money earned there has ended up in the hands of its rulers, another source said. It also comes after North was at odds with Malaysia after Pyongyang was suspected of masterminding the murder of the North Korean leader's half brother, Kim Jong-nam, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13. Eight North Koreans were named suspects in the case, though North Korea has denied any involvement and claimed that Malaysia colluded with South Korea on the investigation into the case.","korea closes restaurant in ,closes restaurant in malaysia ,korea closes restaurant ,malaysia has recently closed ,only north korean restaurant","['north korean', 'Malaysia', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Yonhap News Agency']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60523629  0.77394086

Yonhap News Agency reported that the high number of casualties could be attributed to the door of the bus that could not be opened, citing a tip. Video footage purportedly taken by an eyewitness shows the door side of the burning bus obstructed by the tunnel wall.  Reader contribution Shortly after the crash, then acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn expressed “deep regret,” instructing the foreign and justice ministries to make the utmost efforts to handle the aftermath and assist the bereaved families residing there. Meanwhile, criticism is rising in China after allegations surfaced that no other motorists offered to help, with some even taking pictures of the burning bus before driving from the scene. Online news media outlet Phoenix reported video clips showed the tunnel filled with smoke and the bus left in a blaze, while other cars passed by. Multiple fire trucks were also seen struggling to get into the tunnel. Yonhap News Agency also said the trucks took more than 10 minutes to arrive and begin fighting the fire, citing Chinese police authorities, embassy officials and witness testimony. The blaze was extinguished some 27 minutes after the accident, it said, adding at least a few more lives may have been saved if others helped to open the door from outside.

The report will be officially published Thursday, and distributed to central and local government agencies. It will also be put online for public view, the ministry said.The report details historical facts, testimonies by victims and witnesses, government stances of South Korea and Japan on the matter and international awareness of wartime brutality. It, in particular, reaffirmed South Korea's view on the ""comfort women"" issue and the need for the Japanese government to take legal responsibility for having been involved in forcing the Korean women into sexual slavery.Citing previously published data showing that many of the victims were mobilized by private agencies, the report still emphasized that the mobilization was made at Tokyo's request and that the state should be held accountable for it.With regard to a 2015 deal reached between the two counties to resolve the long-running rift over the comfort women issue, the report said that the deal has a limit since it failed to clearly state Japan's legal responsibility. South Korea and Japan agreed to the deal in December 2015 under which Japan provided 1 billion yen  to help and support the lives of South Korean victims. But critics have accused the deal of lacking any prior consultation with the victims, as well as Japan's sincere apology and acknowledgment of its legal responsibility. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels during World War II. Around 40 surviving South Korean victims are mostly in their late 80s.","slavery of korean women ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,korean women forced into ,suffering of korean women ,of korean women yonhap","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'korean', 'japanese']",27,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.34602275 -0.13957268

About 53 percent of those on the list have passed away as of end-March, the data showed.Since 1988, the government has tallied the number of separated family members, based on figures of those who apply for family reunions.The data showed that 62 percent of the 61,322 surviving family members are aged over 80, indicating that more could die before meetings with relatives in North Korea take place.Those aged between 80 and 89 accounted for 43 percent while those aged over 90 came in at 19.4 percent, it said.The two Koreas remain technically at war as the Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Nearly eight out of 10 South Korean separated families said top priority should be placed on confirming whether their family members in North Korea are alive, showed a 2016 survey conducted by Seoul's unification ministry.Holding family reunions on a regular basis ranked second with 10.3 percent, followed by exchanges of letters with 4 percent, the poll said.South and North Korea have held 20 rounds of such reunions so far, but there are still many family members waiting their turn.","200 korean separated family ,family reunions in october ,53 korean war died ,held last family reunions ,korean separated family members","['south korean', 'Koreas', 'Mount Kumgang', ""North Korea 's"", 'inter - korean']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47474062  0.49121839

Japan raised strong objections and recently asked the Seoul government to take appropriate action. South Korean foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck ""It is not desirable to build sculptures near diplomatic missions in view of international courtesy and customs related to their security,"" Cho June-hyuck, foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.His remark is in line with Seoul's stance on a controversial girl statue erected last year in front of the consulate in Busan that symbolizes Korean women forced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II. Tokyo has strongly protested the placement of the status and demanded its removal.South Korea has tried not to get directly involved in the statue issue, saying that it was built by a civic group but underlined the need for it to be relocated to a ""proper"" site. The approach, however, was viewed by critics as too submissive.Japan brought in its ambassador to Seoul in protest. The ambassador returned to work in early April after a nearly three-month-long absence.Last week, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called the civic group's move to install the statue for forced labor a ""big problem,"" saying that Tokyo has expressed a strong objection and called on Seoul to take necessary action through diplomatic channels. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 during which historians say that millions of Koreans were coerced into labor.They also estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II.","labor statues near japan ,reservations about civic activists ,statues symbolizing korean victims ,japan raised strong objections ,japan missions not desirable","[""South Korea 's"", 'korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Japan', 'Se']",27,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.1989795   0.13732164

The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead a day after the incident took place.This file photo taken on Feb. 16, 2017, shows Chinese murder suspect Chen Guorui arriving at the Jeju District Court for a sentencing hearing on suspicions of killing a South Korean woman who was praying at a Catholic church the previous year. The Jeju Branch of the Gwangju High Court overturned a 25-year sentence handed down to the defendant earlier in February, saying the original sentence was too light.""The crime was very brutal and premeditated,"" the court said. ""The defendant does not show any signs of remorse and the bereaved family has also asked for a strict punishment."" The Jeju District Court of first instance had earlier said it took into consideration that the defendant has been mentally feeble for the past five to six years. During a police investigation, Chen said he killed Kim because she reminded him of his former wives who ran away after having extramarital affairs.But during questioning by the prosecution, he changed his statement and said he committed the crime to be jailed here and to not go back to China. Chen entered the country through a visa-free program for Chinese tourists less than a week before he committed the crime and was scheduled to leave a few days later. The case sparked a public outcry along with a series of other crimes committed by Chinese tourists on the island.","years for murdering korean ,for murdering korean woman ,murdering korean woman ,30 years for murdering ,murdering korean woman in","['JEJU', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'Jeju', 'Chen Guorui', 'Kim', 'catholic']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4027136   0.33490443

The Seoul Central District Court on Tuesday ordered the 46-year-old doctor, surnamed Kang, to pay some 1.6 billion won  in damages to Shin’s wife and two children.South Korean rock singer Shin Hae-chul Shin’s family filed a lawsuit in May 2015, claiming that Kang did stomach reduction surgery on Shin without the patient’s consent and neglected his duty to give proper medical care despite Shin complaining of pain. They demanded 2.3 billion won in damages, but increased the amount to 4.5 billion won in litigation.In October 2014, Shin visited a hospital for abdominal pain and received surgery from Kang. After the surgery, he fell into a coma and died of a heart attack 10 days later. The prosecution concluded that Shin died of Kang’s medical malpractice after an autopsy. Kang’s criminal trial is currently pending at the Seoul High Court. A lower court in November sentenced him to a 10-month jail term suspended for two years. Kang has been claiming that he was not obliged to explain the surgery procedure because he did a surgery that strengthened the stomach rather than reduced it. He also argued that Shin did not follow the doctor’s orders and left the hospital on his own accord.By Byun Hee-jin","korean legendary rock singer ,korean rock singer shin ,legendary rock singer shin ,south korean rock singer ,won million in damages","['south korean', 'Shin Hae - chul', 'Shin ’s', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Kang', 'Shin ’s', 'south korean', 'Shin Hae - chul', 'Yonhap)Shin ’s']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40928614  0.34294251

Malaysian police did not immediately respond to calls for comment, but they have said in recent weeks that the deal with North Korea did not affect the investigation. The Feb. 13 killing of Kim Jong-nam sparked a fierce diplomatic battle between two countries that once had warm relations. Aisyah and another woman, from Vietnam, have been charged with murder for allegedly smearing Kim's face with VX nerve agent at a bustling airport terminal. Although Malaysia never directly accused North Korea of carrying out the attack, speculation is rampant that Pyongyang orchestrated a hit on a long-exiled member of its ruling elite.The countries ended a tense standoff on March 31 with a deal that gave North Korea custody of Kim's body and allowed Malaysia to question three North Korean men who had been hiding in their country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian police then allowed the men to fly home, saying they found no grounds to hold them. It was an abrupt turnaround in the investigation. Earlier, Malaysia's national police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, had hinted that the men had valuable intelligence, saying he would wait to question them, ""even if it takes five years."" One of the men identified by police is Ri Ji U, known by his nickname James.Gooi said James should not have been allowed to leave because he was key to Aisyah's defense. He said James had recruited Aisyah in early January to star in his video prank shows. Over the course of several days, he had her rub oil or pepper sauce on a victim's face, ""from forehead downwards,"" which he would film on his phone, the lawyer said.They practiced at malls, hotels and airports, Gooi said, speaking ahead of a court appearance Thursday by the two defendants in which prosecutors are expected to ask for the case to be moved to a higher court for the trial.Aisyah was paid about $100-$200 for each prank and hoped the income would allow her to stop working as a social escort, Gooi said. ""She was giving up that part of her life after meeting James and being given a role in the prank show. She was quite excited,"" he said. ""She was quite well remunerated and she was telling her friends about the fact she doesn't want to live the life of a social escort anymore.""Gooi said that in January, Aisyah flew to Cambodia, where James introduced her to a man known as Chang. He said that Chang identified himself as a Chinese who produces video prank shows for the China market, and that Aisyah did three pranks at the airport in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital. Chang was later identified by Aisyah as Hong Song Hac, one of four North Korean suspects who fled Malaysia on the same day Kim was killed.Gooi said Hong asked Aisyah to do several more pranks at the Kuala Lumpur airport a few days before Kim was attacked. He said Aisyah met Hong at the airport on the day of the killing, and that Hong identified Kim to Aisyah and allegedly put the poison on her hand.

Moon was the senior secretary for civil affairs at the time.Moon Joon-yong -- with another applicant -- was hired by the KEIS in December 2006. The public company then said the volume of recruitment was two, and the number of applicants was also only two.Another allegation is that the company’s employment notice period was short, compared to past cases.Moon’s camp has maintained the position that the allegations have already been resolved. It argued the Board of Audit and Inspection during the Lee Myung-bak administration  did not reprimand the KEIS concerning the issue.However, a lawmaker from the conservative Bareun Party recently claimed that several workers were punished for being implicated in the allegedly irregular employment.Kwon is currently the chief of the Korea Employment Welfare Center. He was quoted by media outlets in 2012 as saying that there was just an administrative mistake in the employment process, but he dismissed allegations involving favors given to Moon’s son.As a counterattack, Moon’s camp has demanded Ahn make public the wealth of his daughter Ahn Seol-hee.Some online commenters have alleged that the wealthy Ahn might have donated some of his property to his daughter in an improper manner to dodge taxes.The People’s Party, which formerly took the stance of rejecting such calls, publicized her wealth Tuesday.“Though Ahn has presently no obligation to make it public, we have decided to reveal it for citizens’ ,” said a party spokesman. He said Ahn Seol-hee’s assets including deposits and insurance came to 112 million won  as of this year, adding that she has a car worth about $20,000. Meanwhile, the People’s Party on Monday filed a complaint with the prosecution against some online commenters for spreading “groundless” speculations that Ahn’s daughter has dual nationality in Korea and the US.Some alleged that Ahn Seol-hee had conducted a maternity trip in a bid for her child to gain US citizenship.Moon has a daughter in addition to his son, while Ahn has just one daughter.By Kim Yon-se","children their mutual accusations ,korea and the daughter ,families dragged into moon ,families dragged ,democratic party of korea","['the Democratic Party of Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'People ’s Party']",27,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.48091143  0.21139698

A 19-year-old girl was arrested without a warrant for allegedly helping the 17-year-old suspected murderer to abandon the victim’s dismembered body. She is accused of leaving part of the body at a subway station at the request of Kim, who was arrested on March 29 for allegedly kidnapping and killing the 8-year-old girl in Incheon.During the investigation of Kim last week, the police had secured the statement that she gave a paper bag containing some parts of the dead body to a girl she used to know.According to the police, Kim left her apartment in Incheon at 4:09 p.m., after murdering the victim, and met her accomplice at a subway station in Seoul at 4:30 p.m. She abandoned parts of the damaged corpse on the rooftop of her apartment and gave the rest wrapped in plastic bags to an accomplice in a brown paper bag.The two had walked through the streets of Seoul for three hours, eating snacks. Kim returned to the subway station near her home in Incheon from Seoul at 9:47 p.m.Kim and her accomplice got to know each other through social media in February.“The accomplice was not found to be at the scene of the murder when Kim killed the victim and damaged the body.

As they spotted a Korean boy about to be hit by a car in the parking lot, his Korean wife Shin Jin-young instinctively screamed to stop the vehicle, which prevented an accident. The child’s grandparents, who were not paying attention when this happened, started to yell at Mendoza and his wife for startling the boy. The incident soon turned into a quarrel involving racist slurs and physical confrontation.Leo Mendoza is knocked down to the ground by a Korean man at a shopping mall parking lot in Busan on March 30. “I called the police. I expected them to prevent the man from further insulting and attacking me and my wife,” the 44-year-old Busan resident told The Korea Herald. “But they allowed the verbal abuse to continue. This part was the most hurtful to me and my wife.”The Korean man even called him “a Polish son of bitch” in front of police officers, but they didn’t do anything, Shin said. After learning that Mendoza was from Colombia, the man said, “Colombia? It is a lower quality country than Poland. Colombian son of bitch,’” she said. “I was also called a bitch numerous times.”The police’s indifference to the couple being subject to racist remarks and swear words and their unwillingness to handle the case continued throughout the investigation process, Mendoza said. “The senior officer kept telling us to go home and not to waste time. The officer tried to encourage us to drop the case. He even said, ‘I don’t believe that you were pushed down. You are so fat!” he said. “The entire time at the police station was horrifying.”The Korean man, whose identity is withheld and couldn’t be reached for comment, claims that he was the one assaulted, according to an official at the Busan Yonje Police Station. Both men have been booked and the investigation is still underway, he said. “Our police officers tried to stop him from making racist remarks seven to eight times. But we cannot forcibly shut his mouth. We should respect both sides,” the officer said, in response to Mendoza’s claim that police showed no willingness to stop racist slurs. After Mendoza shared his experience publicly, which received attention from the expat community here, the Busan Metropolitan Police Agency said it had been a misunderstanding caused by cultural differences. “In Korean culture, we try to appease each side and help them reconcile before things get inconvenient for both sides,” an official from Busan Metropolitan Police Agency said. “Busan police will be more careful and better respond to cases involving foreigners from now on.” Local experts said cultural differences do exist in the way police handle complaints. South Korean police is known to shun active intervention in “trivial” offenses, often encouraging involved parties to settle. Many citizens, too, expect the police to mediate, rather than pursue their case as a real crime when they report it, they said.Nevertheless, when Mendoza shared his story on his Facebook page, warning that South Korean police “never side with a foreigner against a fellow Korean,” many expats sympathized with him. Some shared their own memories of being “mistreated” by police or discriminated against in Korea only because they are foreigners. Riza Yomey, a university student from the Philippines who has lived in Korea for seven years, also said she could not rely on Korean police. In 2015, she said she got into an argument with a Korean owner of a food stall in Seoul over payment for food she purchased. After the man called her “liar” and publicly humiliated her, she headed to the police station to report the man. “Police advised me to forget about it. The senior policeman even looked irritated that we would not let it go. They told us to just give up because it will get complicated,” she said. “That experience made me realize that police don’t care about foreigners.”“I would never report a crime or ask for help from the police again. I don’t expect them to help a foreigner like me. They always side with Koreans,” she said.A US national, who has lived in South Korea for 10 years, said he now considers moving back to his country because of the racism and xenophobia he and his family have suffered here. “It is not just from the police. Although Korea has made headway, the idea of Korea exceptionalism is still alive and well,” said the man, who asked not to be named. “In everyday life, there are school children commenting at my 3-year-old son’s looks, people coming up to my wife on the street and saying ‘oh the babies’ dad is a foreigner right?’” he said. “I’ve been spit at, been called a dirty foreigner more times than I can count.” South Korea, one of the most homogenous countries in Asia, lags behind in international standards in terms of racism and diversity, experts say. There is still no law banning discrimination based on race, religion or sexuality. The country has seen a notable rise in the number of multicultural families only in the past decade. As of the end of January, 1.52 million foreign nationals reside in Korea, about 3 percent of the entire population of 52 million. According to a 2015 survey on 4,000 adults by the Ministry of Gender and Family Affairs, 25.7 percent of the respondents said that they didn’t want people of different races as neighbors. In his visit to South Korea in 2014, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on racism, Mutuma Ruteere, urged South Korea to enact an antidiscrimination law to curb racism and xenophobia, given the country’s history of ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Efforts to enact a bill aimed at rooting out discrimination on such grounds as gender, disability, age, race, marital status and religion have all failed for the past decade, in the face of fierce resistance from conservative and Christian groups opposing equal rights for sexual minorities. Koreans in general seem to have a relatively low understanding of racial issues, although the country has joined the international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1978, a human rights campaigner said. “So law enforcement agencies and government officials should have a better understanding of human rights and racism than anyone else to curb racial discrimination in the country,” said Yang Eun-sun, public engagement manager at the Korea office of Amnesty International. “There should be more education, systems and domestic law to raise awareness.”Mendoza agreed with Yang. “No country can stop racism and hate. But every country can make a legal system that protects the victims of racism and hate,” he said. The chief of the Yonje Police Station later called Mendoza and offered an apology, which Mendoza accepted and described as “understanding and professional.""By Ock Hyun-ju","colombian police debacle ,his korean wife shin ,colombian police debacle resonates ,feature colombian police debacle ,parking lot his korean","['Leo Mendoza', 'Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'Shin Jin - young']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53053254  0.62196302

Kim Young-jae, the 55-year-old owner of a luxury anti-aging clinic in southern Seoul who was indicted for performing illegal anti-aging treatments to the then-president and lying under oath, has entered Cheong Wa Dae at least 17 times, the investigators claimed during the first hearing of his trial Wednesday, based on his wife’s Timeline records. Kim has earlier confessed that his wife accompanied him during his visits to Cheong Wa Dae.Kim Young-jae, who runs an anti-aging clinic in southern Seoul, was indicted on suspicions of performing illegal anti-aging treatments on former President Park Geun-hye. The prosecutors, seeking for solid evidence to prove their unofficial visits to the presidential palace, discovered that Google Map’s “Your Timeline” feature saves records of past locations visited by its user. The feature keeps tabs on whereabouts of its user once GPS is agreed to be provided.The data extracted from the mobile phone of Kim’s wife Park Chae-yoon showed she entered Cheong Wa Dae a total of 17 times. Kim’s Timeline did not hold any record before December 2014. “It wasn’t difficult to spot her visits to Cheong Wa Dae  due to the exclusiveness of the location,” said the prosecutors. Kim is suspected of treating then-President Park with anti-aging and anti-fatigue treatments, including Botox injections, without leaving official records. He reportedly entered the presidential premises without going through security checks based on his personal ties with the impeached president’s now-jailed friend Choi Soon-sil. The former president has also been arrested for corruption. Kim is considered as a key personnel that could point lead to the president’s whereabouts during the “missing seven hours” on the day of the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014. But his wife’s Timeline didn’t have any record of a visit to Cheong Wa Dae on April 16, 2014, the day of the Sewol ferry disaster. It is speculated that the president may have been up to something other than work for the seven hours, with many suspecting cosmetic surgery. Kim’s 46-year-old wife runs a medical device manufacturing company called Y. Jacobs Medical and is accused of bribing the wife of a former presidential secretary with luxury bags and free cosmetic treatments to pull government strings.By Jung Min-kyung","korean prosecutors investigating ousted ,surgeon tracked through google ,prosecutors investigating ousted president ,south korean prosecutors investigating ,park former plastic surgeon","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Google ’s Timeline', 'Kim Young - jae', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14983152  0.56012487

Haruki Wada, an emeritus professor at Tokyo University and expert in Korean history, made the proposal during a forum in Seoul as a follow-up on a 2015 bilateral agreement to settle the long-standing dispute between the two neighbors. ""I think installing a memorial monument will be meaningful given the purpose of the project to recover the honor and heal the scars of victims, led by the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation,"" he said during the conference at Kookmin University in Seoul. ""If that's done, it will leave  in the memories of both countries' peoples.""With an aim to end their decades-long feud over the wartime atrocity, Seoul and Tokyo reached a landmark agreement on Dec. 28, 2015, under which Seoul launched the foundation with a 1 billion yen  contribution from Japan.The professor proposed the countries also include the next South Korean president's position in the engraving. South Korea is set to hold an election to pick a new president on May 9 and the current front-runner Moon Jae-in has hinted at renegotiating the deal.Critics in Seoul demand the cancellation of the accord, saying that the Japanese government still refuses to recognize its legal responsibility and denied the women were forcefully recruited to the front-line military brothels. The deal was reached even without consultation with the victims, they said. Wada lauded the deal for its drawing of the 1-billion-yen fund from the Japanese government's budget and inclusion of an apology from Abe, but also criticized it for lacking an apology that could resonate with the victims. It also did not properly accept factual details of the wartime atrocity, he noted. ""But they are not defects  enough to wholly negate Japan's apology and the fund contribution as a show of the apology,"" he said. ""I hope South Koreans can accept the agreement.""If the deal is canceled in the end, he said, it will ""inflict a psychological impact on Japanese people."" Demanding a new agreement with the Abe administration and calling on him to change his attitude toward history will be ""meaningless,"" he also said, adding that rather, it will be more useful to leave the apology he has said on the monument.","latest apology over japan ,enslavement of korean women ,japanese scholar on thursday ,sex slaves japanese scholar ,japanese historian proposes installing","['japanese', ""Shinzo Abe 's"", 'Japan', 'korean', 'Haruki Wada', 'Tokyo University', 'korean', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.29804692  0.45911691

Seven senators co-sponsored the resolution, including Marco Rubio  and Cory Gardner .Sneddon, then a college student from Utah, disappeared in China in 2004.

A year later, or months after Japan formally annexed Korea, he was executed at a Japanese prison in the northern Chinese district of Ryojun, now called Lushun in Dalian. South Korean children offer a silent prayer in front of independence fighter Ahn Jung-geun's torso at the memorial hall for him during a ceremony in the city of Dailian, northeastern China, to mark the 107th anniversary of the execution by the Japanese of Ahn, who assassinated a top Japanese official more than a century ago. The memorial was held at the memorial hall for Ahn Jung-geun inside the Lushun Russian-Japanese Prison Museum and organized by the association of Korean residents and a group seeking friendly ties between South Korea and China.Sunday’s memorial brought together 200 people including Lee Sei-kee, chief of the South Korea-China Friendship Association.“Martyr Ahn brought to the head a list of 15 charges against Ito, including Japan’s assassination of Joseon Dynasty Empress Myeongseong , at a trial in Lushun, making headlines at that time,” Lee said at the ceremony.He also said, “We have been worried about soured relations between South Korea and China as the two countries are set to celebrate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year,” referring to China‘s ongoing economic retaliations over South Korea’s deployment of the missile defense system, known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, in South Korea.China has repeatedly prodded South Korea and the United States to stop the deployment and has taken retaliatory measures, including a ban on sales of tour packages to South Korea in early March.South Korea has hosted a similar ceremony at the same place since 2015, but it was switched to a civic one this year due to the row over the missile system‘s deployment aimed at North Korea’s possible missile attacks on the South.The participants observed a moment of silence and laid flowers at Ahn‘s memorial hall before looking around the cell where Ahn was held and his execution site at the museum.Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.","killed the korean penin ,assassinated top japanese official ,and killed the korean ,northeastern china on sunday ,national hero who assassinated","['south korean', 'Dalian', 'China', 'Japanese', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'US', 'Ahn Jung - geun', 'the Korean Penin']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4835048   0.45592842

The remains belong to Chinese soldiers who died fighting against South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. China fought alongside North Korea, while the South was backed by UN forces including US troops.""Historically, the repatriation of soldiers' remains between former war adversaries carries a peaceful message to heal the wounds of the past and develop their relations,"" Hwang In-moo, South Korea's vice defense minister, said in a speech at the event.Seoul and Beijing struck an agreement in 2014 on the return of Chinese soldiers' remains excavated from graves in South Korea on the basis of the humanitarian spirit specified in the Geneva Conventions.Hwang called it ""proof of trust"" between the two sides. China expressed its gratitude to the South Korean government and its people."" appreciate the friendship and good will that South Korean people and media have shown regarding the repatriation of Chinese soldiers' remains,"" said Sun Shaocheng, China's vice minister of civil affairs, leading his country's delegation.More than 180,000 Chinese soldiers are estimated to have died in the war.A total of 541 remains were sent back in three batches as of last year.There had been some doubts about the implementation of the deal, with the two sides at odds over the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to South Korea.China believes the US is seeking to position the advanced missile defense system on the peninsula not only to help ward off North Korea's threats but also to counter Beijing's growing military influence in the region.The allies, however, stress the need for the THAAD unit here is solely to cope with the North's possible missile attack more effectively.""Although there is a difficulty in South Korea-China relations in the process of resolving the North Korean nuclear and missile issue, we pushed for the repatriation of the remains of Chinese soldiers this year from the humanitarian perspective,"" the ministry said in a separate statement.It vowed to continue the program and efforts to improve bilateral ties.Both Hwang and Sun did not mention the THAAD issue in their brief public remarks.","of chinese soldiers killed ,korea on wednesday repatriated ,china in repatriation ceremony ,chinese soldiers killed in ,chinese soldiers killed during","['South Korea', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'US', 'China', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41692916  0.32212308

""The first appeals trial will be held at 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday,"" the official said. The Korean thieves stole the statue from Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island in Japan in October 2012, and smuggled it into the country that year. They were arrested a few months later.

A Busan-based animal rights group filed a complaint with the prosecution Monday, asking it to investigate Park’s alleged violation of the Animal Protection Law.The family of dogs consists of a male-female pair, which Park had received as a gift from her neighbors when she moved into the presidential residence in 2013, and seven puppies that were born in January. In photos, including one posted on the Blue House’s Facebook page, the former president was seen playing with the dogs.The presidential office said Friday that it had found a home for four of the nine dogs. A male-female pair and their two puppies were given to a private organization that raises Jindo dogs and preserve their blood purity. The other five other puppies will be soon sent to two other similar organization, it added.By Ock Hyun-ju","dogs that ousted president ,park for abandoning dogs ,korean government on thursday ,ousted president park geun ,nine dogs that ousted","['US', 'south korean', 'Park Geun']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39746627  0.27789727

Kim is known to have two sons including Kim Han-sol, 22, and one daughter. The official did not specify how the DNA sample was obtained, Reuters said.Kim Jong-nam was killed at an airport in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13 after two Asian women allegedly smeared banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent on his face.On March 10, Malaysian police officially confirmed that the identify of the killed North Korean was Kim Jong-nam, the first son of late former leader Kim Jong-il.Malaysian police have said that Kim's next of kin should come forward to identify and claim his body, but no one has publicly shown up to do so.Kim Han-sol, Kim Jong-nam's second son, appeared on an online video clip on YouTube last week, saying that his father was killed, amid concerns about the safety of the bereaved family.South Korea's intelligence authorities confirmed that the man in the footage is Kim Han-sol.Seoul has said that North Korea is behind the killing, saying that the North's leader has issued a standing order to kill his brother since he assumed power in 2011.Malaysian police said that eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in the killing, along with the two women.Four North Korean suspects fled Malaysia on the day of the murder and Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old suspect, was released from custody in early March due to a lack of evidence.They are chasing three others including Hyon Kwang-song, the second secretary of the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur.North Korea rejected Malaysia's probe, saying that it has colluded with South Korea to manipulate the results of the investigation.Pyongyang claimed that the dead man is Kim Chol, the name on a passport held by Kim Jong-nam.

Qunitana said a probe into Kim's assassination in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13 should be conducted in a transparent, independent and fair manner through cooperation among all parties concerned, according to the broadcaster. He also stressed the need to work out steps to protect other potential targets for assassination, saying those who are responsible for Kim's murder must be identified, the broadcaster said. His remarks are construed as a message to Pyongyang which is uncooperative in the probe, only demanding that Malaysia hand over Kim's body.  If a state actor is found to have been behind the murder through investigation, Kim Jong-nam will become the victim of an extrajudicial killing, Quintana said. An extrajudicial killing refers to the execution of a person by governmental authorities without legal process.The rapporteur also expressed concerns about the North's recent test of four ballistic missiles, the broadcaster said.

North Korea is widely believed to have orchestrated the killing of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of the rogue regime's leader Kim Jong-un, last month in Malaysia by agents using deadly VX nerve agent. N. Korea leader Kim Jong-un ""That could be something that may allow the UN Security Council or even the ICC to hold him up, if, again if, you can show that they were behind it because of the nature of, type of substance used in that,"" the lawyer was quoted by Voice of America as saying. ""With the ICC, it always ... it goes up the ladder, you find the person who was ultimately responsible. You don't actually go and charge the people at the bottom. So there is a precedent for ... ultimately you go for the leader who ordered even if you were not involved in actual planning. If you ordered, sanctioned the killing, that makes you liable.""In 2014, the UN General Assembly voted to refer North Korea to the ICC for crimes against humanity, after a Commission of Inquiry report documented ongoing atrocities in North Korea that included incarcerating over 120,000 people in political prisons, as well as systematic abuses that included torture, enslavement, rape and murder, according to the VOA report. The measure has since stalled in the UN Security Council, where Pyongyang's allies -- China and Russia -- are believed to be preventing it from coming to a vote, it said.","killing lawyer legal adviser ,killing of kim jong ,behind killing lawyer legal ,be behind killing lawyer ,killing lawyer legal","['the International Criminal Court', 'North Korea', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Malaysia', 'VX']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43811664  0.21907547

""Kim Jong-nam's acceptance of foreign media interviews increased the possibility of his presence being known inside North Korea, burdening Kim Jong-un."" Kim Han-sol, the 22-year-old son of Kim Jong-nam, too, ""is a being that cannot be tolerated from the perspective of Kim Jong-un,"" Thae said. ""It remains to be seen how possible his survival would be.""Thae's comments were reported one day after Kim Han-sol appeared online from an unidentified location. In the 40-second YouTube video, the black-clad young man said he is currently with his mother and sister, without disclosing their whereabouts. South Korea's spy agency verified him as Kim Jong-nam's son. The Malaysian government has called on the family of Kim Jong-nam to come forward and retrieve his body, now kept in Kuala Lumpur, but no one has claimed the body, apparently because of assassination fears. Referring to North Korea's multiple missile launches on Monday that targeted American bases in Japan, Thae said they seemed to have been designed to solicit military aid from China.North Korea wants to secure tangible military assistance from China in order to prepare against possible Japanese attacks that could be launched in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula, he said. ""China will automatically step in if South Korea, the U.S. and Japan join the war. North Korea is now trying to get solid military support  as they did during the Korean War,"" he noted.  He also added that North Korea will not be able to survive another two or three years if China closes its borders with the North and halts trade. However, China is more interested in maintaining political stability in North Korea, a buffer zone, than in taking away  nuclear weapons.","recently assassinated half brother ,brother of north korean ,assassinated half brother ,nam the recently assassinated ,assassination ex nk diplomat","['Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'japanese', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'japanese', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'the north Korean Embassy', 'London']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51134998  0.43947712

The erection ceremony of the ""comfort women"" statue was held at the Nepal Himalaya Pavillon, a park in Wiesent, which is part of the district of Resenburg. It was attended by some 100 local German officials and representatives from the Suwon City government and civic groups from South Korea. A South Korean citizen offers a flower to the statue of a girl, symbolizing the hundreds of thousands of Korean women who were mobilized as sex slaves for Japan's World War II soldiers, in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Jan. 9, 2016. Some 200,000 Asian women, mostly Korean, are estimated to have been forcibly taken to front-line brothels for the Japanese army during the war. They are euphemistically called comfort women. The city of Suwon, south of Seoul, reached an agreement with the German municipality to erect the statue, a replica of a life-size bronze statue that was first introduced in December 2011 in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul.The statue in Seoul was produced to mark a local civic group's 1,000th weekly rally against the Japanese government. Participants of the on-going rallies demand an apology and compensation over the wartime atrocities committed by the neighboring country. There are currently over 40 comfort women statues erected in and outside of South Korea, including in the US, Canada, Australia and China. Ahn Jeom-soon, a 90-year old former South Korean comfort women, made a meaningful visit to Wiesent to witness the first comfort women statue set up in Europe. Suwon city had initially struck a deal with the German city of Freiburg last July to set up a comfort woman statue in that city.The agreed setup was scuttled because of apparent strong obstruction and pressure by Japan.","germany statue of girl ,women erected in germany ,100 local german offici ,korea comfort women erected ,erected in germany statue","['japanese', 'Germany', 'Wiesent', 'Resenburg', 'german']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51410621  0.13726325

The report came shortly after the North's ambassador to Malaysia was heading home after being expelled from the Southeast Asian country over his criticism against Malaysia's probe into the death of Kim Jong-nam.

Kuala Lumpur decided last week to expel Kang, ordering him to leave the country by March 6, 2017, amid a deepening diplomatic row over the two countries following the death of the half brother of North Korea's leader. Before boarding a flight for Beijing, the main transit point toward Pyongyang, on Monday, Kang Chol, the North Korean envoy, voiced strong regrets over his expulsion, repeating that the probe was biased. Kang described his expulsion as an ""extreme measure"" that could undermine bilateral ties between North Korea and Malaysia, while arguing that his criticism over Malaysia's investigation into the killing of Kim Jong-nam was ""fair.""Earlier last week Malaysia canceled a visa-free travel deal with Pyongyang in response to the North's criticism that Malaysia colluded with South Korea for its probe into the killing of Kim Jong-nam.Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak told reporters on Monday that his country has decided to expel Kang in a bid to defend its sovereignty and national pride, according to Malaysia's New Straits Times.The prime minister said Kang should have apologized for making baseless allegations against Malaysia, but has yet to do so, the report added.Kim Jong-nam died on Feb. 13 at an airport in Kuala Lumpur after two Asian women allegedly smeared the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent on his face.Malaysian police said that eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in the death, along with the two women.Ri Jong-chol, who was taken into custody, was released and deported last week due to a lack of evidence.Four North Korean suspects are believed to have fled Malaysia to Pyongyang on the day of Kim's death. Police are looking for three others including Hyon Kwang-song, the second secretary at the North's embassy in Malaysia.There is speculation that Malaysia is considering cutting off its diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, which have been maintained for more than 40 years.","airport killing north korea ,korea to expel malaysian ,killing north korea ,row over airport killing ,killing north korea said","['North Korea', 'malaysian', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'KCNA news agency', 'Pyongyang', 'malaysian']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24722289  0.32654703

Kuala Lumpur decided last week to expel Kang, ordering him to leave the country by March 6, 2017, amid a deepening diplomatic row over the two countries following the death of the half brother of North Korea's leader. Kang was told to show up for a meeting with a Malaysian foreign ministry official on Saturday evening, but neither he nor the North Korean Embassy responded, the Malaysian foreign ministry said in its statement. The ministry also referred to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as backing up its decision to declare Kang persona non grata and force him out of the country.The ministry stressed the latest decision marks the strongest expression of complaint any country could voice to a foreign ambassador, calling on Kang to revisit his previous criticisms heaped on Malaysia. After the Malaysian police concluded that eight North Koreans are suspects in the case, North Korea vehemently denied its involvement in the murder and accused South Korea and Malaysia of cooking up the story against Pyongyang. Kang has been at the forefront of North Korea's claims.Meanwhile, Malaysian reports said Sunday that Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar dismissed as ""nonsense"" one of the North Korean suspects' claim that he was treated unfairly during a police investigation in Malaysia. Ri Jong-chol, one of the suspects, was interrogated in custody for his alleged involvement in the assassination, but was released and deported from Malaysia on Friday after the Malaysian police failed to prove his role.   En route to North Korea, Ri argued that the Malaysian police investigation was unfair and that they had threatened to kill his wife and children.Ri was treated by the police in the same manner as other suspects, the Malaysia police chief was quoted as saying. The police strictly stuck to the standard investigation procedures in dealing with the North Koren suspect, he said.Later in the day, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told reporters that the expulsion of Kang carries a clear and strong message from Malaysia to North Korea that the country should not misrepresent the case.The deputy prime minister emphasized again that the Malaysian police investigation into the murder was executed in a very professional manner, brushing off North Korea's accusations.  He also said the North Korean government should be aware of the international implications of the recent assassination, a rebuttal of the North's previous stance that the issue is solely an internal North Korean matter.","cites korean envoy dismissal ,korean envoy dismissal ,korean envoy dismissal of ,on saturday malaysia ministry ,to expulsion the malaysian","['malaysian', 'north korean', ""Kang Chol 's"", 'Malaysia', 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs', ""North Korea 's"", 'Malaysia']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45518184  0.47643617

He assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father.For him, this is seen as an Achilles‘ heel in terms of the legitimacy of his leadership, along with uncertainty over the background of his late mother. Korean residents in Japan are viewed as “low class” in the North.“For Kim Jong-un, it would be important to remove Kim Jong-nam, as North Korea seeks to bolster the personality cult , named the Mount Paektu bloodline,” Thae added.The North‘s leader is seen as strengthening his reign of terror by executing more than 100 officials. Seoul’s spy agency claimed that that the incumbent leader issued a “standing order” to kill his half brother since taking office.Kim Jong-nam, once viewed as heir apparent, was killed on Feb.13 at an airport in Malaysia after two Asian women allegedly smeared the lethal VX nerve agent on his face.He too was born from his father‘s non-marital relationship with Song Hye-rim, a South Korean-born actress who died in Moscow in 2002. She had divorced her husband to live with Kim Jong-il.Kim Jong-nam, who was critical of the power succession, had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.“North Korea has no hesitation in removing any threat to the one-man leadership,” Thae stressed.Malaysian police probing into Kim’s death said eight North Koreans including a diplomat are suspected of being involved in the killing, along with the two Asian women.Pyongyang has flatly denied the allegation, saying that Malaysia colluded with Seoul in the probe.South Korea‘s spy agency told lawmakers last month that Pyongyang’s foreign ministry and spy agency were behind Kim‘s killing.Thae claimed that the Ministry of State Security, the North’s intelligence body, is presumed to have masterminded the latest murder.“Terrorist attacks against foreigners or South Koreans in overseas countries are usually committed by the North‘s reconnaissance bureau,” he said. “But the Ministry of State Security handles incidents involving its nationals when they take place in foreign countries.”Touching on North Korea’s provocation, Thae said that Pyongyang may conduct a nuclear test or test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile around the birthday of late founder Kim Il-sung next month.North Korea will mark the 105th birthday of the late leader, which falls on April 15.“North Korea is being cornered because of Kim‘s killing and use of the banned chemical weapon as Seoul and Washington carry out joint military drills,” Thae said. “Pyongyang could make provocative acts on a large scale around the key anniversary.”Thae also said Pyongyang is presumed to be behind the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010.“I think North Korea was behind the sinking of the Cheonan,” he said.On March 26, 2010, the 1,200-ton warship Cheonan sank near the western maritime border with North Korea, killing 46 sailors.A South Korean-led investigation, including experts from the U.S., Australia, Britain and Sweden, concluded that the corvette was downed by a North Korean torpedo, but Pyongyang has denied any responsibility.“There was the perception in the North that Pyongyang is no match for South Korea in terms of navy and air force,” Thae said, adding North Korea gained confidence in its naval force after the incident.","latest killing of kim ,killed his half brother ,blood defector north korean ,leader ordered the murder ,killing of kim jong","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Kim Jong - il', 'VX', 'north‘s']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40205815  0.2828562

Kim has apparently viewed Jong-nam as a potential obstacle to his pursuit of a life-time authoritarian rule, according to North Korea watchers.Yun took issue of the North's worsening human rights record, calling it a potential threat to peace and security of the whole world.He added that more than 100 senior North Korean officials have been executed without proper trials over the past five years.Besides that, 80,000-120,000 people remain held at concentration camps in the communist nation.""The entire country of North Korea has become a vast concentration camp,"" he said.He emphasized that the member states of the council should take ""independent and collective"" steps to address the North's human rights abuse before it's too late and triggers a bigger catastrophe.He welcomed a group of experts' recommendation that the UN bring the human rights issue to the International Criminal Court.","punish north korean leader ,citing recent murder case ,to punish korean leader ,punish korean leader south ,recent murder case","[""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Yun Byung - se', 'the UN Human']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33331874  0.44714534

VX is a chemical agent listed as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations and its use is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention.Eight North Koreans have been named as suspects, but the North has denied its involvement.""Our side emphasized that Kim Jong-nam's killing is a serious violation of international norms in that a banned chemical weapon was used, and the international community respond strongly to this in light of the fact that it is an inhumane and anti-human rights crime,"" Kim said.It was unclear how the US and Japanese officials characterized the killing.Monday's meeting was a focus of attention as it could reveal for the first time how the US views the death of Kim Jong-nam.Despite the mounting evidence pointing to North Korea's responsibility, the US has refrained from any reaction to the killing.The talks also came after the North test-fired a newly developed intermediate-range ballistic missile powered by solid fuel. Weapons experts say solid-fuel missiles pose greater threats as they require less launch preparation time than liquid-fueled rockets, and can be fired from mobile launchers easy to move around.The missile adds to the already massive arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles the communist nation boasts after conducting five nuclear tests and a number of ballistic missile launches under its ultimate goal of developing a nuclear missile capable of striking the US.Kim said that the three countries agreed to warn North Korea strongly against additional provocations, sharing the view that the missile launch could be a ""precursor"" to the North firing an intercontinental ballistic missile that leader Kim threatened to test-fire. The sides also discussed ways to ensure full implementation of sanctions on the North, Kim said.The latest missile launch, coupled with the killing, has raised fresh calls in the US Congress for putting the communist regime back on the list of states sponsoring terrorism. The State Department has reportedly launched a review of the possibility.Monday's meeting marks the first such talks since the Trump administration came into office. The three countries have often held such trilateral strategy sessions to fine-tune and coordinate their North Korean policies. The last such meeting took place in December.","nam killing south korea ,agreed monday to work ,kim jong nam killing ,killing south korea the ,brother of north korean","['South Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Hong - kyun', ""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'US', 'japanese', 'Joseph Yun', 'Kenji Kanasugi', 'Pyongyang']",27,"[ 0.          2.          1.         ... -0.31961793  0.68477112

Kim Dong-sik, a former North Korean spy who defected to the South after being captured in 1995, said the apparent assassination case bears a hallmark he had rarely seen in the North, which has boasted a long history of terror tactics ranging from poisoned needles to disguised car accidents. “The  case is different from previous ones. I think it is the first of its kind,” Kim said at a seminar at the National Assembly. He now works as a researcher of Institute for National Security Strategy, an affiliate of Seoul‘s National Intelligence Service. Unlike other assassins recruited by North Korea, he added, the two women who swiped Kim Jong-nam’s face with VX and left the scene quickly might have undergone rigorous training to make it look like a “natural incident,” not an assassination attempt.“I think the suspects rehearsed the killing dozens of time. ... It was conducted so naturally,” said the former North Korean agent, adding the two suspects -- one Vietnamese and one Indonesian -- might not have acknowledged they were participating in the killing of someone.Deadly even in minute amounts, VX is banned under the Chemical Weapons Conventions of 1997 and 2005, to which North Korea is not a party. After attacking Kim Jong-nam, the suspects walked away and quickly washed their hands, according to Malaysian police. At the same conference, Yoo Dong-ryul, head of the Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy, a Seoul-based national security think tank, claimed that Kim Jong-nam suffered from financial troubles and asked his younger brother Kim Jong-un for living expenses. Some analysts claimed the elder Kim, known for his gambling, extravagant spending and flamboyant lifestyle, was unable to enjoy such a lifestyle following the demise of his uncle Jang Song-thaek, the second-most powerful man in the North before being executed by Kim Jong-un in 2013. South Korea’s top spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, earlier said Kim Jong-nam had faced murder attempts over the past five years, prompting him to send a letter to his younger brother to spare his life and the lives of his family.

The eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il died on Feb. 13 in Kuala Lumpur after apparently being poisoned with VX nerve agent at a busy airport.The intelligence body said although North Korea remains silent over the death, a growing number of high-ranking and overseas officials are becoming aware of the news. The spy agency also provided lawmakers with various updates on developments taking place in Pyongyang.The NIS said North Korea is prepared to conduct nuclear tests at anytime, claiming such facilities are well managed even during the winter season. It said the No. 2 tunnel at the North's nuclear test site in Punggye-ri has been maintained throughout the winter, and that the No. 3 tunnel can be used to conduct a nuke test if the country's leadership gives the order.The agency also said that the communist state produced 10kg of plutonium at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor last year, and that it is expected to be able to reprocess additional spent fuel rods to produce more fissile material from the end of this year.The spy agency also said the latest import ban of coal from China will leave 300,000 North Koreans unemployed, making its gross-domestic product contract by 2.5 percentage points.Specifically, the agency said the China's decision will reduce North Korea's gain of foreign currency by 23 percent, or $78 million.The NIS also said Kim Won-hong, the former head of Pyongyang's spy agency, has been placed under confinement while around five other senior officials are presumed to have been recently executed by the regime.The dismissed Kim, 72, was fired as head of the Ministry of State Security in mid-January after the probe by the Workers' Party of Korea found the agency had abused its authority, according to Seoul's unification ministry. His military rank was also demoted to major general from full general, it said.The NIS then said following the purge, the North Korean leader ordered the relocation of the statute of Kim Jong-il from the agency's headquarters, claiming the organization ""does not deserve"" the honor.Seoul's intelligence officer then said there are estimated to be 439 markets in the North, with the penetration of the market system similar to those of Hungary or Poland right before they shifted to a capitalist system.","pyongyang gov behind murder ,murder worked for pyongyang ,gov behind murder ,south korea spy agency ,eight suspects behind the","[""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Pyongyang', 'Ministry of State Security']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37887582  0.43770808

Police revealed Friday that the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent was used to kill Kim, raising the stakes in the case.Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam said the dose of VX given to Kim was so high that he showed symptoms within minutes. Kim fainted at the airport clinic and died in the ambulance while en route to a hospital, he said.""VX only requires 10 milligrams to be absorbed into the system to be lethal, so I presume that the amount of dose that went in is more than that,"" he said at a news conference. ""The doses were so high and it did it so fast and all over the body, so it would have affected his heart, it would have affected his lungs, it would have affected everything.""Asked how long it took for Kim to die after he was attacked, Subramaniam said, ""I would think it was about, from the time of onset, from the time of application, 15-20 minutes.""Malaysia hasn't directly accused the North Korean government of being behind the attack, but officials have said four North Korean men provided two women with poison to carry it out. The four men fled Malaysia on the same day as the killing, while the women -- one from Indonesia and the other Vietnamese -- were arrested.Experts say the nerve agent used to kill Kim was almost certainly produced in a sophisticated state weapons laboratory and is banned under an international treaty. But North Korea never signed the treaty, and has spent decades developing a complex chemical weapons program.Kim was not an obvious political threat to his estranged half brother, Kim Jong Un. But he may have been seen as a potential rival in North Korea's dynastic dictatorship, even though he had lived in exile for years.North Korea has denied any role in the attack.Earlier Sunday, Subramaniam said the state chemistry department's finding of the VX toxin confirmed the hospital's autopsy result that suggested a ""chemical agent caused very serious paralysis"" that led to death ""in a very short period of time."" The VX agent can lead to death very quickly in high doses, he said.He said the final autopsy report would be submitted to police soon.Subramaniam also said that there have been no reports of anyone else being sickened by the toxin, but that medical workers who attended to Kim would remain under observation for possible delayed effects.Tens of thousands of passengers have passed through the airport since the apparent assassination was carried out. No areas were cordoned off and protective measures were not taken.Early Sunday, more than a dozen officers in protective gear swept the budget terminal where Kim was attacked and said they found no traces of VX.Abdul Samah Mat, the police official leading the investigation, said the terminal was ""free from any form of contamination of hazardous material"" and declared it a ""safe zone"" after a two-hour sweep.He also said a condominium on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur that was raided by police last week had been rented by the four North Korean suspects who left the country. He said police were still testing a seized substance for traces of any chemicals.Abdul Samah said the Indonesian woman who was arrested, Siti Aisyah, vomited in a taxi on the way from the airport after the attack but is fine now. He said that more tests were needed to determine if the two arrested suspects were given antidotes so the nerve agent wouldn't kill them.An antidote, atropine, can be injected after exposure and is carried by medics in war zones where weapons of mass destruction are suspected.On Saturday, representatives from the Indonesian and Vietnamese embassies met with the two arrested women, who both said they thought they were part of a prank show. Aisyah said she was paid the equivalent of $90, according to Andriano Erwin, Indonesia's deputy ambassador to Malaysia.","caused paralysis quick death ,kim caused paralysis quick ,paralysis quick death kuala ,quick death kuala lumpur ,caused very serious paralysis","['KUALA', 'AP', 'Malaysia', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong Un 's"", 'Jong Nam', ""Kuala Lumpur 's"", 'malaysian', 'Kim']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50844413  0.26160941

The screening was conducted in the early hours of the day as the Southeast Asian country confirmed that the autopsy of Kim Jong-nam found traces of the VX agent.Special personnel wearing protective clothes and masks operate equipment at the departure lobby of Kuala Lumpur International Airport Terminal 2 in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 26, 2017, to find any trace of poison. The detection operation was made after VX nerve agent, a lethal chemical weapon, was found on the body of Kim Jong-nam, the murdered half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The deceased, the eldest son of former late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was killed shortly after two women smeared the lethal substance all over his face on Feb. 13. He was rushed to a nearby hospital but died en route. The Malay government has implicated Pyongyang for the murder, although the reclusive regime has denied all involvement causing a diplomatic row between the two countries.Local authorities also said that people who came into contact with Kim Jong-nam have all been checked and none have become sick, and that there has been no reported cases of nerve agent poisoning at the busy airport.One of the women who has been detained for smearing the nerve agent on Kim's face did vomit while riding a taxi right after the attack but has since shown no signs of illness.VX, one of the most toxic chemical substances in the world, is an oily, amber-colored liquid that is tasteless and odorless, according to the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Malay law enforcement and health authorities have taken flak for conducting a sweep of the airport 13 days after the murder, which could have exposed innocent bystanders to the nerve agent.Related to the ongoing investigation, local police said later in the day that they raided a condo that was rented by the four North Koreans being sought in connection to the high-profile murder.Police said in the course of the search they identified chemical substances that could be linked to VX. They said that no definitive announcement can be made regarding what has been found at the condo since they have been sent to a lab for thorough testing.The latest announcement may indicate that the North Koreans, who have all fled the country, could have made VX in Malaysia, although it may be more likely that the banned nerve agent was secretly brought in from abroad.","international airport second terminal ,killed kim jong nam ,sunday the country police ,agent that killed kim ,killed kim jong","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Malay', ""Kuala Lumpur International Airport 's""]",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29604077  0.56214648

Citing preliminary analysis from the nation’s Chemistry Department, Malaysia’s police chief said the nerve agent was detected on the eyes and face of Kim Jong-nam, who died last week after being attacked by two women who approached him from behind and wiped his face with an unverified substance. Deadly even in minute amounts, VX has been classified by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction. The substance is banned under the Chemical Weapons Conventions of 1997 and 2005, to which North Korea is not a party.The two attackers rubbed a liquid on Kim Jong Nam‘s face before walking away and quickly washing their hands, police had said earlier. “Our preliminary finding of the chemical that caused the death of Kim Chol was VX nerve ,” Malaysia‘s Police Inspector General Khalid Abu Bakar said in a written statement, referring to the victim as “Kim Chol,” the name Kim Jong-nam is believed to have used when traveling on a diplomatic passport. The revelation that a banned chemical weapon was used in the high-profile murder case is expected to add speculation that North Korea might have orchestrated the attack after obtaining the substance themselves or from another country. Hong Sae-yong, a prominent toxicologist in South Korea who works as a professor of nephrology at Soonchunhyang University Hospital in Seoul, said it is “not difficult” for North Korea to manufacture or export VX. “A country with a certain science level can make the material,” said Hong in an interview with a local broadcaster, noting that even a religious cult -- such as Japan’s Aum Shinrikyo -- had manufactured 100 to 200 grams of VX gas that it used to attack innocent civilians in 1994 and 1995.Last Thursday, Japanese broadcaster NHK quoted unidentified South Korean officials as saying that North Korea could have used VX to assassinate Kim Jong-nam and that the regime had done so in the past in similar operations. VX is one of the most toxic and quickly acting chemical warfare agents, about 100 times deadlier than sarin, which has also been used as a chemical weapon, according to toxicologists. VX is believed to have been used by Iraq’s then leader Saddam Hussein on Kurds during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. South Korea’s Defense Ministry told lawmakers Monday that one of five toxic substances, such as VX gas, cyanide or hydrocyanic acid, could have been used in what he described as the “assassination” of Kim Jong-nam. Members of the United Malays National Organization hold up a banner in front of the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, criticizing North Korea’s handling of Kim Jong-nam’s death. Earlier in the day, Seoul’s Ministry of Unification urged Pyongyang to admit their responsibility for the attack and cooperate with Malaysia’s investigation into the case, which the ministry said has hurt the regime’s international reputation. “It’s better for the North to admit  and cooperate with the investigation,” said Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, at a regular press briefing. “North Korea should take into account that the more they act in this way, the worse their image will get.” Since the death of Kim Jong-nam on Feb. 13, North Korea has lashed out at the Malaysian government’s investigation into the case, accusing the Southeast Asian country of having a “sinister purpose” to conspire with South Korea to sabotage the regime.Pyongyang’s state-run KCNA news agency claimed Thursday that Malaysia had initially told them that the victim died of a supposed “heart stroke,” but changed its position after “false reports” surfaced in South Korea that he had been assassinated with poison. So far, the Malaysian police have identified a total of eight North Koreans suspected of being linked to the killing. Having taken one into custody, they are searching for the other seven, although four are believed to have fled Kuala Lumpur shortly after the attack and are now believed to be in Pyongyang.It would not be the first time the North used a toxic chemical to try to murder its defectors. In 2011, a North Korean agent was jailed in South Korea for a plan to use a poison-tipped needle to assassinate Park Sang-hak, a human rights activist from North Korea who defected to the South in 1999. North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons for a typical year and 12,000 tons for a period of crisis. The weapons reportedly include mustard gas, phosgene and sarin gas, a United States Congressional Research Service report said last year.By Yeo Jun-suk  By Yeo Jun-suk","kim jong nam murder ,jong nam murder malaysia ,half brother was killed ,malaysian police announced friday ,jong nam murder","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'VX', 'malaysian', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Chemistry Department', 'Malaysia', 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36127406  0.54734182

In its first official reports since the death of Kim Jong-nam, the state-run KCNA news agency claimed Malaysia had initially told them that the victim died of a supposed “heart stroke,” but changed its position after “false reports” surfaced in South Korea that he had been poisoned to death in an apparent assassination. A United Malays National Organization Youth activists poses with a placard during a protest outside the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. South Korea, in response, pledged to seek tougher measures against North Korea -- such as a plan to demand the US put Pyongyang back on a list for state sponsors of terrorism -- and warned the regime would attempt military provocation as a distraction. “What merits more serious attention is the fact that the unjust acts of the Malaysian side are timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket launched by the South Korean authorities,” the KCNA said, citing a spokesman at the reclusive regime’s jurists committee. “The biggest responsibility rests with the government of Malaysia as a citizen of the DPRK died in its land,” the report added, referring to the victim only as “a citizen of the DPRK,” using North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and not mentioning the person’s name. Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam on Thursday told lawmakers that the government would negotiate with Washington over a plan to add Pyongyang to the list as a terrorism state. Washington took the regime off the list in 2008 as a goodwill gesture on efforts being made for the North to resolve its nuclear issues.In the wake of Pyongyang’s latest ballistic missile test last month, however, calls are emerging in the US Congress to add the regime to the terrorism list. Rep. Ted Poe introduced a bill calling for the measure in January and the legislation was referred to congressional subcommittees last week. “We will negotiate with Washington and, if necessary, play our parts” to designate the North as a state sponsor of terrorism, Lim told the lawmakers, saying the murder of Kim would offer “impetus” to the effort. During the same meeting with lawmakers, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo repeated the government’s claim that North Korea would plot terrorism attacks against South Korea to distract attention away from what Seoul viewed as assassination of a member of Pyongyang’s ruling family. A day earlier, acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn also alerted cabinet members of Pyongyang’s terrorism attacks against South Korea and North Korean defectors in Seoul. The National Intelligence Service has reportedly beefed up security for high-profile defectors. Kim Jong-nam, 46, died last week after being attacked by two women who coated their hands with toxic liquid then rubbed it on Kim’s face, according to the Malaysian police. The two women were arrested days after Kim’s death and told the police they thought the attack was a part of a “comedy prank.”So far, the police have identified a total of eight North Koreans suspected of being linked to the killing. Having taken one into custody, they are searching for the seven others, although four are believed to have fled Kuala Lumpur shortly after the attack and are now believed to be back in Pyongyang. Among the remaining three are a senior diplomat at the North Korean Embassy and an employee of North Korean state-owned airline Air Koryo, according to the Malaysian police. Both officials were in Malaysia, but they could not confirm if they were at the North Korean Embassy, the police said. The death of Kim Jong-nam has escalated into a diplomatic row between North Korea and Malaysia, with the Southeast Asian country recalling its ambassador from Pyongyang after the regime’s ambassador in Kula Lumpur questioned the impartiality of the investigation into Kim. Earlier in the day, an unidentified official at the North Korean Embassy told reporters they would reject the Malaysian police’s investigation results, saying that it was “all lies and slander.” They were scheduled to hold a press conference on the same day, but canceled at the last minute.Describing Kim Jong-nam as “a citizen of the DPRK” who was travelling on a diplomatic passport, the KCNA criticized the Malaysian government for conducting a postmortem without its permission, saying it was “a wanton human rights abuse and an act contrary to human ethics and morality.”The regime also denounced Malaysia’s refusal to hand the body back to North Korean officials, saying the decision “proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicize the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality and therefore serve a sinister purpose.”By Yeo Jun-suk","jong nam death conspiracy ,korea on thursday dismissed ,death conspiracy korea ,nam death conspiracy korea ,thursday dismissed the malaysian","['North Korea', 'malaysian', 'North ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'southeast asian', 'South Korea', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'KCNA news agency', 'Malaysia']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38325536  0.58273709

He was waiting for a flight to Macau where he lived.Malaysian police said that four suspects who fled Malaysia on the day of Kim's death are believed to have escaped to Pyongyang. This picture compiled with photos released by European news photo agency EPA on Feb. 22, 2017, shows three North Korean suspects who are at large in Malaysia in connection to the death of the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Hyon Kwang-song ,44, is the second secretary of the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. The next photos show a 30-year-old man identified as Ri Ji-u  and Kim Uk-il , a 37-year-old employee at Air Koryo, the North's flag carrier. They arrested a North Korean man last week while looking for three others including diplomat Hyon Kwang-song and Kim Uk-il, an employee at Air Koryo, the North's flag carrier.Malaysia has called on the North Korean Embassy to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.The Telegraph of Britain reported that the two newly identified suspects -- Song and Kim -- are believed to be ""hiding"" inside Pyongyang's embassy in Malaysia. It said Hyon is ""the supervisor of the whole plot,"" citing a Malaysian security source.It is high likely that North Korea will not respond to Malaysia's request, given that a diplomat is usually granted immunity from prosecution in their host country.A source said that Hyon, the second secretary at the embassy, could be a disguised agent dispatched by North Korea's ministry of state security which is in charge of secret policing and surveillance.""North Korea is believed to give the title of second secretary to an agent in overseas missions sent by its security ministry,"" said a former South Korean diplomat.Hyon, 44, was caught on CCTV sending off the four suspects who escaped to North Korea at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Singapore's Channel NewsAsia reported, citing a police source. It said there was also the staff from Air Koryo at the airport.","kim death diplomatic row ,killing of kim jong ,deepening over kim death ,over kim death diplomatic ,the killing of kim","['North Korea', 'Malaysia', 'Pyongyang', 'southeast asian', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'Malaysia', 'South Korea', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Seoul', 'anti - north Korea']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.25582603  0.30861917

Pyongyang even refused to confirm if the man who died was indeed the leader's estranged sibling, only saying that his name was Kim Chol. Despite the North's denial, the assassination apparently took place at the order of Kim Jong-un, the researcher said.""Kim Jong-un is the only person in North Korea who has reason to order the assassination of Kim Jong-nam,"" he said, indicating that no one except the leader could have planned to murder the leader's blood-related brother for fear of serious punishment.""Therefore the final decision maker would have been Kim Jong-un given that the assassination would have needed an order, or at least approval, from him.""For the regime, the assassination was a pressing assignment that must be accomplished even at the cost of international criticism and sanctions that could follow the murder, the researcher noted.""Kim Jong-nam and his son Han-sol's singling out of Kim Jong-un as a dictator and their objection to the three-generation power inheritance may have been the biggest cause of the assassination,"" he said, speculating on the motive of the murder.

Kim died later after telling airport personnel that he had been sprayed in the face with a liquid.Huong and a female suspect from Indonesia have been arrested by Malaysian authorities, along with two men carrying identity documents from North Korea and Malaysia. Speaking at their simply furnished house in a farming village in Nam Dinh province, Doan Van Thanh, 63, confirmed that Huong is his daughter but said he couldn't believe she would commit such a crime. “How could she have dared to do such an earth-shaking thing?” Thanh said. “She was scared of rats and toads, she would not have dared to do it.”Huong's niece, 18-year-old Dinh Thi Quyen, said she believes Huong was fooled into taking part.“My aunt is a very nice and kind person, but she easily trusted other people,” Quyen said. “I believe that my aunt was duped into doing it.”Indonesia's police chief has also said that the other female suspect, Indonesian Siti Aisyah, had been fooled into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank that involved spraying men in the face with water.Thanh, a Vietnam War veteran who lost his right foot in a land mine explosion, said police visited him after Huong was arrested to check her identity and offered to help protect her rights.Thanh said his daughter left the village about 10 years ago to study at a pharmacy school in Hanoi, about 130 kilometers  away, and only occasionally returned home, where she had few friends.The last time the family saw her was during the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, when she spent five days at home. Her niece, Quyen, said Huong called her on Feb. 14, one day after Kim's death, and asked her to buy a prepaid cellphone card so Huong could transfer the card's cash value to a shop in Hanoi to pay for a deposit on a dress she liked. Quyen said she purchased the card and sent its identifying number to Huong, but it wasn't clear whether it was then sent to the shop. Quyen said after the family heard that Huong was arrested in Malaysia, they tried to call her, but could not get through.Vietnam's state media have reported extensively on Kim's death, but didn't mention the arrest of a Vietnamese citizen until Monday.The government has said it is still working with Malaysian officials to confirm Huong's identity.","airport kim died later ,family of vietnamese woman ,family believes vietnamese suspect ,malaysian airport kim died ,the killing doan thi","['vietnamese', ""North Korea 's"", 'Thi Huong', 'Kim Jong Nam', 'malaysian', 'Kim']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5890131   0.628488

He was waiting for a flight to his home in Macau.North Korea has claimed that the dead man is Kim Chol, the name on a passport held by Kim Jong-nam. The KCNA said that a North Korean citizen carrying a diplomatic passport fell into a state of ""shock,"" without mentioning Kim Jong-nam.Malaysian police said that eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in Kim's killing. Four of them who fled Malaysia on the day of his death appeared to have already returned to Pyongyang.They arrested Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old North Korean man, and are looking for three others, including a diplomat and an airline employee, who are at large in Malaysia.Pyongyang blamed Malaysia for pressing ahead with conducting an ""illegal and immoral"" autopsy, claiming it constitutes an infringement on North Korea's sovereignty and human rights violation.It also condemned Malaysia for not handing over his body to North Korea.""This proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicize the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality,"" the KCNA said.South Korea said that it is highly likely that North Korea is behind the latest killing, given that Pyongyang has a track record of committing terrorist attacks and inhumane acts.North Korea said that Seoul has shown an ""excessive response"" to the death by linking it to security concerns.""This proves that the South Korean authorities have long expected the case since it worked out a scenario for it,"" it said.The incident has developed into a diplomatic row between Malaysia and North Korea, which have maintained a close diplomatic relationship for more than 40 years.North Korea's top envoy to Malaysia Kang Chol has claimed Malaysia colluded with Seoul in investigating the case.Malaysia denounced his comment as ""diplomatically rude,"" stressing that the investigation is fair.North Korea said that it is ready to send a delegation of jurists for a joint probe, but Malaysia rejected it.South Korea's unification ministry dismissed North Korea's claim as preposterous, saying that it is not even worth countering.Experts said that North Korea is maneuvering to leave Kim's mysterious death unresolved as it apparently moves to handle the issue from a legal perspective.""As Kim's death has made international headlines, North Korea could not continue to shun the issue,"" said Kim Keun-sik, a professor at Kyungnam University.""Pyongyang seeks to deny allegations linking to its leader while blaming South Korea and the international community for staging what it called an anti-North Korea conspiracy,"" he said.Kim Jong-nam had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.North Korean defectors said that ordinary North Koreans are not aware of Kim's existence as the regime has tightened control over information about the Kim family.In a patriarchal society like North Korea, the first son is widely viewed as the successor, but the power was given to Kim Jong-un, who is the third son. He assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father. Seoul's spy agency said that the incumbent leader has issued a ""standing order"" to kill his half brother since he took power.","korea on thursday rebuffed ,death as anti pyongyang ,thursday rebuffed the results ,half brother calling seoul ,anti pyongyang conspiracy north","['North Korea', 'Malaysia', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Malaysia', 'South Korea', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41889262  0.34085304

From the front pages of newspapers to talks on radio, “Kim Jong-nam” now strikes a chord, with people expressing a slight sense of insecurity and indignation at the brazen poison attack that took place in broad daylight at a busy airport, widely believed to have been ordered by the regime in Pyongyang. “The incident was quite shocking, because it was a foreign conflict that had been perpetrated on our homeland,” said Nurul Nabillah Aamad Hijazu, a student at the University of Malaya. “It showed that people’s security cannot be guaranteed. The rustling thought of the assassination makes me feel edgy in places like the airport.”For the thousands of local and foreign journalists and media personnel who have flocked to Kuala Lumpur, it has been a taxing week tracing the latest breaking stories. Journalists and media personnel from around the world stand in front of the auditorium of the General Hospital of Kuala Lumpur, where the autopsy of the late Kim Jong-nam was carried out on Feb. 15. “All of us have been on standby for new developments on the issue over the past one week. We have rested very little,” said Farik Zolkepli, a staff reporter for the Star newspaper, over the telephone. “It is big news here because of the victim’s high profile as the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and also because it was an assassination of a foreigner on our home soil. The focus of the world is on us at the moment.”Police have so far arrested four suspects carrying identity documents from North Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. It said four others, all believed to be North Korean nationals, have fled the country. Zolkepli said the reporters are taking a “wait-and-see” approach, carefully judging how events unfold.“In the end the police will get to the truth of the matter so that there is no room for speculations,” the journalist said. “The investigation will take shape following the postmortem and toxicology results from the autopsy, which will shed more light on the issue.”The auditorium of the General Hospital of Kuala Lumpur, where the autopsy of the late Kim Jong-nam was held on Feb. 15. At the General Hospital of Kuala Lumpur, a big crowd of journalists have been waiting anxiously for press briefings on Kim Jong-nam’s autopsy, which was conducted on Feb. 15 but offered little concrete details about his death. On Tuesday, officials from the Ministry of Health Malaysia told reporters that medicolegal specimens from the victim’s body were sent to accredited laboratories for further analyses “to confirm the identity of the deceased person and the cause of death, both of which are still pending at the moment.”The attack spiraled into a diplomatic row when Malaysia rejected North Korea’s request to hand over Kim Jong-nam’s body. Since then, the two countries have exchanged a war of words, prompting many in Kuala Lumpur to rethink the country’s ties with the reclusive communist state ruled by a ruthless young tyrant. At the University of Malaya campus, Korean exchange student Kim Min-sung said his Malaysian friends were chagrined by the charade of Pyongyang, as North Korean Ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol denounced the country’s handling of the investigation and alleged there was “collusion” with Pyongyang’s enemies. The auditorium of the General Hospital of Kuala Lumpur, where the autopsy of the late Kim Jong-nam was held on Feb. 15. “My friends who are interested in politics told me that they cannot understand North Korea,” Kim said. “Malaysia is one of the few nations with diplomatic relations with the North.

The researcher also said that a reign of terror alone could not fully account for the characteristics of the current Kim Jong-un regime because his ruling style is now displaying many different aspects.The leader is friendly to the public as his grandfather and North Korean founder Kim Il-sung was, but on the other hand, he terrorizes officials and orders unconditional obedience from all North Koreans, Cheong stressed.""Following the death of Ki Jong-il, many experts in South Korea and abroad predicted the Kim Jong-un regime would not last long, but Kim has succeeded in solidifying his position as the highest leader in and outside of the country,"" according to Cheong.","il purged more officials ,ranking north korean officials ,his late father kim ,said wednesday many experts ,purged more officials","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Jong - il', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', ""Kim Jong - il 's"", 'Cheong Seong - chang']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65893459  0.75554872

Investigators have put five North Koreans in the frame for last week's brazen killing of Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and have said they are seeking three more for questioning. They include the embassy's second secretary, Hyon Kwang-song, as well as a North Korean airline employee called Kim Uk-il, Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters.Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar, left, speaks as Selangor Police Chief Abdul Samah Mat listens during a press conference at the Bukit Aman national police headquarters ""We have written to the ambassador to allow us to interview both of them. We hope that the Korean embassy will cooperate with us and allow us to interview them quickly. If not, we will compel them to come to us,"" he said.Jong-Nam died last Monday after being attacked as he waited for a plane to Macau.Leaked CCTV footage from the airport shows the chubby 45-year-old being approached by two women, one of whom grabs him from behind and appears to shove a cloth in his face.Moments later Jong Nam is seen seeking help from airport staff, who direct him to a clinic, where he apparently slumped in a chair.Malaysian police say he suffered a seizure and died before he reached hospital, seemingly from the effects of some kind of toxin.Seoul has said from the start that Pyongyang was behind the murder, citing a ""standing order"" from Jong-Un to kill his elder sibling, and a failed assassination bid in 2012.Asked whether the five North Korean suspects had masterminded the attack, Khalid said he believed they were ""heavily involved"" in the murder. Four of the men fled the country on the day of the killing and returned to Pyongyang, he said, while one remains in custody in Malaysia.The police chief dismissed claims the two women had believed the attack was a made-for-TV prank.

She was very aware that it was toxic and that she needed to wash her hands.""Khalid said Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong, 28, and Indonesian Siti Aishah, 25, had been trained to swab the man's face, practising in Kuala Lumpur before the attack at the airport. Aishah wiped a toxic substance in his face first, followed by Huong, the Malaysian police chief said. Khalid said investigators had been ""very fair"" and the North Korean embassy now had a duty to assist them.Pyongyang and Kuala Lumpur have been at diplomatic daggers drawn over the attack, with North Korea's envoy insisting Jong-Nam's body be returned and objecting to an autopsy.Malaysia rejected the request, saying the remains must stay in the morgue until a family member identifies them and submits a DNA sample. No next-of-kin have come forward, Khalid said, adding rumours that Jong-Nam's son Kim Han-Sol was in Malaysia were not true.","killing malaysia detectives probing ,kim killing malaysia detectives ,detectives probing the assassination ,killing malaysia detectives ,policeman said wednesday investigators","[""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'north korean', 'Malaysia', 'North Koreans', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Hyon Kwang - song']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33930638  0.75402731

If not, we will compel them to come to us,"" the report said.A total of eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in the death. Police arrested Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old North Korean man, on Friday following the arrest of the two women.Authorities here said that four North Koreans fled Malaysia on the day of Kim's death and are now believed to be in Pyongyang.Three others, including the diplomat, are thought to be still in the Southeast Asian country.Malaysia has asked Pyongyang to cooperate with its probe and return the four suspects, the police chief added.He said that the two female suspects -- one from Vietnam and the other from Indonesia -- were aware that they took part in the attack and used their bare hands to wipe the toxic substance on his face.""Yes, the two female suspects knew that the substance they had was toxic. We don't know what kind of chemical was used,"" the chief of police quoted as saying by Reuter, adding that there were instructed to wash their hands afterwards.The female suspects claimed that they were deceived into thinking they were part of a comedy TV show.Khalid said that no family member of the murdered Kim has yet come forward to claim his body. There were rumors that Kim Han-sol, Kim's son, probably arrived in Malaysia on Monday from Macau where his mother and sister are presumed to be hiding under China's protection. Previously, Malaysia gave two weeks for Kim's next-of-kin to come to claim his body.Meanwhile, Doan Thi Huong, the Vietnamese suspect, visited South Korea in November last year, intelligence sources said.""Her visit did not seem to be related to Kim's murder, but we are investigating the purpose of her trip and what she did in the country,"" an official said.The latest incident has developed into a diplomatic row between Malaysia and North Korea, which have maintained a good diplomatic relationship for more than 40 years.North Korean top envoy to Malaysia Kang Chol denounced Malaysia's probe results, claiming that Malaysia colluded with Seoul in investigating the case.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak denounced Kang's comment, stressing that the investigation would be fair.""The statement by the ambassador was totally uncalled for. It was diplomatically rude. But Malaysia will stand firm,"" the prime minister was quoted as saying by Reuters.South Korea's spy agency claimed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un had issued a ""standing order"" to kill his estranged sibling since assuming power in late 2011.Seoul said it is highly likely that North Korea is behind the death, adding that Pyongyang has a track record of committing terrorist attacks and inhumane acts.Pyongyang, meanwhile, appears to have closely kept tabs on military officials regardless of their ranks since the 2011 death of former leader Kim Jong-il, according to a report by a group of North Korean defectors.The report showed the repressive regime has monitored even the facial expression of military officials in what could be a move to glean evidence to carry out purges and even executions.","murder malaysia malaysian police ,suspects in kim murder ,in kim murder malaysia ,kim murder malaysia malaysian ,kim murder malaysia","['malaysian', 'North Koreans', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Hyon Kwang - song', 'Kim Uk - il', 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29351771  0.42630151

South Korea’s spy agency said Tuesday that it has heightened security for Thae, Pyongyang’s former deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom who defected to Seoul last August, following the killing last week of Kim Jong-nam. This photo taken on Feb. 9, 2017, shows Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat stationed in London who defected to South Korea last year. The National Intelligence Service is also reportedly seeking to limit Thae’s public appearances out of concerns that the high-profile defector may be the North’s next target. “Such a decision is made when the intelligence agency detects a specific sign of a possible assassination attempt,” Yonhap News Agency quoted an anonymous source working with Thae at the Institute for National Security Strategy as saying. Thae, however, vowed to continue his efforts to shed light on the reclusive communist regime. “I am in a position to continue my work to bring forward the unification of the two Koreas, whatever threat I might face,” said Thae during an interview with local broadcaster YTN on Tuesday. In an earlier interview with US broadcaster CBS, the defector said that Kim Jong-un would “do anything” to prevent more defections from North Korea. Asked whether the young tyrant would try to assassinate him, he responded, “Why not?” Rising concerns about the safety of Thae come as Pyongyang is seen tightening its grip on dissenting voices with the apparent murder of Kim Jong-nam, who often spoke out against his younger brother Kim Jong-un. “What worries North Korea the most is hurting Kim Jong-un’s reputation,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn also warned that North Korea may plot another terror attack to distract the international community from the death of Kim Jong-nam.“We have to do our utmost to give protection to North Korean defectors,” said Hwang during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. “Counterterrorism agencies must ensure their readiness posture against potential terror attacks.” Rep. Ha Tae-Keung of the Bareun Party said Monday that there was a terrorism attempt against a high-profile North Korean defector. The lawmakers did not reveal who the target was and where the intelligence came from. Last week, he said Thae would be the No. 1 target. “There was a terrorism attempt against a high-profile North Korean defector living in South Korea,” said Ha, a former activist who campaigned against North Korea’s human rights violations. “An assassin from a third country, sent by the North, attempted an attack on the defector but it failed.” North Korea has a history of assassinating high-profile defectors who speak out against the regime and its dismal human rights condition, although the communist state has neither claimed responsibility nor admitted involvement in such cases. In 1997, Yi Han-yong, a cousin of Kim Jong-nam, was shot in the head by North Korean assassins outside his apartment in Bundang, just south of Seoul. Yi had defected to South Korea in 1982 when he was studying in Switzerland. He was the highest-level North Korean to flee at that time.Pyongyang also allegedly ordered the killing of the all-time highest-level North Korean defector: Hwang Jang-yop, who had been the secretary of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party until he defected in 1997. Three South Koreans were arrested in 2010 for plotting the assassination of Hwang after being recruited by North Korean agents posing as defectors.

Noor Hisham Abdullah, the Malaysian director general of health Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il, died last week in an airport in Malaysia after being attacked by two Asian women with what appears to be poisonous substances. He was waiting for a flight to Macau where his home is located.""We have to confirm with the lab report before we can make any conclusive remark,"" he was quoted as saying by AP, asked if there was any sign that he had been poisoned.Malaysian police said Sunday they would give two weeks to Kim's next of kin to claim the body. No family members have come forward to identify his body, the report said.Malaysian police arrested Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old North Korean man, in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam on Friday following the arrest of three others, including the two women who seemingly attacked the deceased.The police said they are searching for four more North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the same day of Kim's death.North Korean top envoy to Malaysia Kang Chol denounced Malaysia's probe results showing that at least five North Korean suspects were allegedly involved in last week's death of Kim Jong-nam.He accused Malaysia of ""colluding and playing into the gallery of external forces,"" in its probe, referring to South Korea.South Korea's unification ministry on Tuesday rejected North Korea's claim, calling it ""preposterous and sophistic.""""The envoy's comment on South Korea is a preposterous claim that is not even worth countering,"" a ministry official said.A diplomatic row is deepening between North Korea and Malaysia over the death of Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il and the estranged half brother of Kim Jong-un.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak denounced Kang's comment, stressing that the probe would be fair.""The statement by the ambassador was totally uncalled for. It was diplomatically rude. But Malaysia will stand firm,"" the prime minister was quoted as saying by Reuters.Malaysia's foreign ministry said in a statement Monday that its government viewed the criticism by Kang as ""baseless.""South Korea said that it is highly likely that the North Korean regime is behind the latest killing, given Pyongyang's track record of committing terrorist attacks and inhumane acts.Foreign media reports said that Kim Han-sol, the son of the murdered Kim, may have arrived in Malaysia on Monday from Macau, where Kim's mother and his sister Kim Sol-hui were hiding presumably under China's protection.Remarks by Malaysian officials, however, hinted that Kim Han-sol might have not arrived in the country.","death for north korean ,media reports showed tuesday ,wounds foreign media reports ,kim jong nam death ,jong un half brother","['north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", ""Kim Jong - nam 's"", 'the Associated Press', 'Noor Hisham Abdullah', 'malaysian', 'Noor Hisham']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42635855  0.6229493

This photo taken on Feb. 9, 2017, shows Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat stationed in London who defected to South Korea last year. ""If it is confirmed, this would be the result of Kim Jong-un's paranoia against Kim Jong-nam,"" he said. ""In the early 1990s, North Korea had started efforts to make Kim Jong-nam nobody.""Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il, died last week at an airport in Malaysia after being attacked by two Asian women with what appeared to be a poisonous substance.""Even if North Korea denies any allegation, the North elite would think 100 percent that the  was ordered by Kim Jong-un,"" Thae claimed.He said that the incident will likely deal a heavy blow to the North Korean regime over the long term as it serves as material evidence to back up North Korea's crimes against humanity.Thae's remark came as Malaysian police said Sunday that at least five North Korean suspects are involved in the incident.Seoul said that it is highly likely that North Korea is behind the killing, given that Pyongyang has a track record of committing terrorist attacks and inhumane acts.Kim Jong-nam had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.In a patriarchal society like North Korea, the first son is widely viewed as the successor, but the power succession was given to Kim Jong-un, who is the third son. He assumed power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father. For the current leader, this is seen as an Achilles' heel in terms of the legitimacy of his leadership, along with the uncertainty over the background of his late mother Ko Yong-hui, who was a Korean resident in Japan. Korean residents in Japan are viewed as having a low societal status in the North.""The existence of Kim Jong-nam is a hindrance in making North Koreans recognize Kim Jong-un's legitimacy as royal blood,"" Thae said.The latest killing has also raised safety concerns for North Korean defectors, making the government beef up security for high-profile defectors including Thae.Rep. Ha Tae-Keung of the splinter Bareun Party claimed last week that two North Korean spies have entered South Korea to attack defectors, warning that Thae would be the No. 1 target. He did not reveal where he obtained the intelligence.Thae, a former North Korean diplomat in London who escaped to Seoul with his family in late July, has actively conducted public activities by meeting with the press and attending a forum as a panelist since late December.A government source said South Korea's spy agency has decided to put on hold Thae's public activities, including media interviews, on concerns that he could be a target of North Korean agents.But Thae said that he will continue to conduct public activities to reveal the brutality of the North Korean regime.""Even if I face threats, I will not stop activities that can bring forward inter-Korean unification,"" Thae said on the TV program.In 1997, Lee Han-young, nephew of Song Hye-rim, was shot in front of his apartment outside Seoul, 15 years after he defected to the capitalist South. Song is the mother of Kim Jong-nam.Investigators suspected that Lee was the target of an assassination by North Korea.","brother defector north korean ,killing of half brother ,half brother defector north ,defector north korean leader ,ordered the murder","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'north korean', 'YTN', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41731724  0.18938203

He was at the airport for a flight to Macau to return home.Malaysian police arrested Ri Jong-chol, a 46-year-old North Korean man, on Friday night following the arrest of three others, including the two women. They said they are looking for four more North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of Kim's death.""North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has focused on strengthening the reign of terror to consolidate his power,"" Hong said. ""I believe this is a key yardstick with which we can analyze  North Korea's latest behavior.""The minister said that North Korea may have succeeded in maintaining its dictatorship for three generations, but history shows that any regime based on a reign of terror has quickly failed.""I hope that the incident could serve as an occasion to reveal the problems of the North Korean regime and prod the international community into mustering the will to push Pyongyang into changing its course for the better,"" Hong said.Meanwhile, the minister said that there are no talks underway between the United States and North Korea, but he added that unofficial talks between both sides could be held.The Washington Post reported that talks are under way to bring North Korean officials to New York in the coming weeks for unofficial ""Track 1.5"" talks with former US officials. Choe Son-hui, a senior North Korean diplomat, could lead the North's delegation if talks take place, it said.""The 'Track 1.5' or 'Track 2' talks have taken place at the civilian level. I think those meetings could be held,"" Hong added.Touching on China's suspension of coal imports from North Korea, Hong said that the move will likely have huge impacts on North Korea's economy as coal exports account for large sums of foreign currency earnings for Pyongyang.

Malaysia’s deputy national police chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim said in the press conference that the authorities identified all four suspects, who he said had left the country on Feb. 13 -- the same day when Kim Jong-nam died after being attacked with poison by two women at Kuala Lumpur airport.Malaysia's deputy national police chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim The suspects were named Ri Ji-hyon, 32, Hong Song-hac, 34, O Jong-gil, 55, and Ri Jae-nam, 57, the police chief added. He also identified a fifth person of interest, named as 50-year-old Ri Ji-u, and showed pictures of two North Koreans wanted by the government but not identified by name. The revelation came amid the speculation that Kim Jong-nam was assassinated by North Korean agents under the instruction of Kim Jong-un who has long viewed his flamboyant, outspoken elder brother as a threat to his dictatorial power. When asked by the reporters whether the communist regime was behind the killing, the deputy chief said “the suspects are all North Korean,” indicating that Pyongyang played a significant role in what South Korean officials described as “assassination.”“We believe North Korea is behind the murder of Kim Jong-nam,” Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at Seoul’s Ministry of the Unification, said on Sunday after the press conference. ““North Korea has conducted criminal, terrorism activity against humanity.”Earlier in the day, The New Straits Times, an English-language newspaper in Malaysia, quoted an unidentified senior police official as saying that the investigator had “solid” evidence that can draw the death of Kim Jong-nam to a North Korean citizen identified as Ri Jong-chol who was arrested on Saturday. The fourth suspect to be detained in connection to the death of Kim, Ri was apprehended at an apartment located in downtown Kuala Lumpur. When being arrested, he was carrying an “I-Kad” — an official identification card issued to foreign workers — that said his name is Ri Jong-chol.The newspaper reported that Ri could be an operative of the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau which manages the communist state’s clandestine operations, saying the place he was arrested had been used as a “safehouse” for North Korean agents in Malaysia since 2011. The Malaysian police has also been trying to ascertain the authenticity of Ri’s identification card, which has low security features and could be easily forged, said the newspaper. The police are investigating into the possibility that he forged the document to hide his real identity. “Unless they are high-profile officials and secret agents, it is unlikely to live abroad independently,” said a South Korean official familiar with North Korea’s intelligence operation. “It is quite likely that Ri was assigned a special operation.“Ri is the fourth suspect to be detained in the death of Kim, who died on his way to hospital within minutes after being sprayed with poison by two women as he waited to board a flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The two women -- identified as 28-year-old Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong and 25-year-old Indonesian Siti Aisha -- told the police they thought the attack was part of a comedy show prank and rehearsed the scene to get it right for the video. Tito Karnavian, Indonesia‘s most senior policeman, said the two women had already performed the prank on other men before attacking Kim. It involved convincing them to close their eyes before spraying them with water.”Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong-nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer,“ Karnavian told reporters on FridayOne Indonesian newspaper reported that Aisha was approached by a mysterious man at the Kuala Lumpur nightclub and offered $100 to be involved in a prank. Her 26-year-old Malaysian boyfriend was also arrested by police as an alleged accomplice. Police are hunting for other alleged accomplices.North Korea, meanwhile, has accused the Malaysian government of conducting a “hostile” investigation against the reclusive regime, saying that they would reject the outcome of autopsy on the body believed to be Kim Jong-nam. In his first public statement on the case, North Korean Ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol said that North Korea would “categorically reject” the results of the autopsy, which he said was performed despite its objections and with its officials excluded.“The Malaysian side forced the postmortem without our permission and witnessing, we will categorically reject the result of the postmortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance,” Kang saidThe ambassador also called for the body, whose identity he did not mention, to be released immediately because the deceased was traveling on a diplomatic passport and therefore should be under North Korea’s consular protection. Earlier Friday, Malaysian police said that the body would not be handed over to the North Korean embassy until a family member could supply a matching DNA sample.

Malaysian police said Saturday that they had arrested a fourth suspect, a 46-year-old North Korean man. Kim, who had been estranged from his younger half sibling for years, was attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday. A rotund man in his mid-40s, he told medical workers at the airport that he had been sprayed in the face with a chemical. He grew dizzy, suffered a seizure and was dead within hours, Malaysian officials said. Without citing much in the way of evidence, observers including South Korea pointed to the obvious culprit in Monday’s attack: Kim’s half-brother, Kim Jong-un, who has executed or purged a slew of high-level officials since taking power in 2011.As the rumor mill swirled, Malaysia arrested four people over the course of the week _ including an Indonesian woman who told investigators she was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank.North Korean officials made no public comments for several days, but they privately demanded custody of Kim’s body and strongly objected to an autopsy. The Malaysians went ahead with the autopsy anyway, saying they were simply following procedure. On Friday night, North Korea’s ambassador to Malaysia broke his silence. At an unusual news conference held close to midnight outside the morgue, Ambassador Kang Chol said Malaysia may be “trying to conceal something” and “colluding with hostile forces.”  “We will categorically reject the result of the post-mortem,” Kang said, adding that the procedure was carried out “unilaterally and excluding our attendance.”Malaysia is one of just a handful of countries to have full diplomatic ties with North Korea, with each country having an embassy in the other’s capital. Malaysia has also been a key place for quiet, semi-official “track 2” diplomatic talks between North Korea and the United States. The results of the autopsy have not been released publicly, but a Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigation said the results were inconclusive and that there was a second autopsy Friday night. He asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak to the media.Malaysian police official Abdul Samah Mat, however, denied that the second autopsy had taken place. Less than a week after Kim’s death, the case had already reached well beyond Malaysia to North Korea, South Korea and Indonesia, along with Macau, where Kim lived with his family, and Vietnam, which was looking into whether another of the suspects was a citizen. The intrigue over the case raises all sorts of questions about Kim’s mysterious death, but a lack of closure and a lingering sense of the unknown are not unusual when it comes to North Korea. While South Korea has blamed North Korea for a slew of notable assassinations or attempted killings in past decades, the North often denies involvement or simply doesn’t comment. The suspects in Malaysian custody are: Siti Aisyah, the Indonesian woman; another woman, who carried Vietnamese travel documents and was seen on closed circuit television footage in a shirt with “LOL” emblazoned across the front; a man investigators said is Aisyah’s boyfriend; and the North Korean man, who was arrested Friday night.Malaysia is seeking DNA samples from Kim Jong-nam’s immediate family. He is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau. Kim reportedly fell out of favor in Pyongyang in 2001, when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He and his younger brother have the same father, the late Kim Jong-il.Even as diplomatic ties between Malaysia and North Korea frayed, Malaysian officials appeared to be carefully following internal protocols for issues like control of the body, analysts said. It’s likely that Malaysia is hoping that following strict procedures would keep them from antagonizing North Korea _ or anyone else in the international community. “As a very small country, Malaysia does not take sides,” said Geetha Govindasamy, a senior lecturer in East Asia studies at the University of Malaya who has studied North Korean ties to Southeast Asia.","malaysia tussle over corpse ,brazen assassination of kim ,tussle over corpse 4th ,duped female assassin investigators ,combative north korean diplomats","['Malaysia', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'North Korea ’s']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84565789  0.21741092

Between 2008 and 2011 she and her then-husband lived in a modest dwelling with flaking red paint in a narrow alley of the densely populated Tambora neighborhood in western Jakarta.  Her former father-in-law Tjia Liang Kiong, who lives in a nearby middle-class neighborhood and last saw Aisyah on Jan. 28, described her as a “very kind, polite and respectful person.”  “I was shocked to hear that she was arrested for murdering someone,” he said. “I don’t believe that she would commit such a crime or what the media says -- that she is an intelligence agent.”  The three suspects -- Aisyah, a woman carrying a Vietnamese passport and a man said to be Aisyah’s Malaysian boyfriend -- were arrested separately Wednesday and Thursday.  The women were identified using surveillance videos from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, where Kim Jong-nam suddenly fell ill Monday morning. Malaysian officials said he died on the way to a hospital after telling medical workers at the airport that he had been sprayed with a chemical.  Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said two women believed to be North Korean agents killed him with some kind of poison before fleeing in a taxi.  News of Aisyah’s arrest has captivated Indonesia’s scandal-and-mystery loving media, with some outlets characterizing her as a spy.  “Oh my God, how can I believe it,” said Aminah, a housewife who is one of Aisyah’s former Tambora neighbors. “She’s very nice with all the people here, she’s so naive. How she can kill a great man? No way, it’s impossible,” said Aminah, who uses one name.  Aisyah’s mother, Benah, said by telephone that the family comes from a humble village background and has no ability to help her.  “Since we heard that from the television, I could not sleep and eat. Same as her father, he just prays and reads the holy Quran. He even does not want to speak,” said Benah. “As villagers, we could only pray.”Aisyah, according to Kiong, had only completed junior high school and moved to Malaysia with her husband in 2011 to seek a better life after the garment-making shop they ran from their home went out of business. The couple left their nearly 2-year-old son in Jakarta, who has been raised by Akiong and his wife since then. Malaysia, which is approaching developed-nation income levels, is a magnet for millions of Indonesians, who typically find work there as bar hostesses, maids and construction and plantation workers.  A year after leaving Indonesia, Aisyah returned to Jakarta and told Kiong she wanted a divorce from his son because he’d changed and the marriage had become unhappy. Kiong said his son gave a different account: Aisyah was having an affair with a Malaysian man.  The divorce was finalized in 2012 and Aisyah told Kiong she was living with her parents in Serang in Banten province that neighbors Jakarta and working in a shoe store. A few months later she was on the move again, telling Kiong she was working in a clothing shop on Batam, an Indonesian island near Singapore and Malaysia. At their last meeting in late January when Aisyah visited her son, Kiong thought she looked very slim and when his wife asked if she was sick, Aisyah said she had had a respiratory illness. Indonesian immigration said Thursday that Aisyah entered Malaysia on Feb. 2 by ferry from Batam.  Rahmat Yusri, head of the neighborhood where Aisyah lived, did not believe she could commit murder. “I was so surprised when I heard that because I knew her well,” Yusri said. “I did not believe it because she is an innocent, a quiet woman who came from a village.”","indonesian woman suspected ,korean leader half brother ,the indonesian woman suspected ,indonesian woman suspected of ,the audacious killing of","['JAKARTA', 'Indonesia', 'AP', 'indonesian', 'north korean', 'Malaysia', 'Siti Aisyah', 'malaysian', 'Kim J']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56614596  0.4448745

""He was sweating all over his body, and seemed very uncomfortable when he responded to my questions. He was probably worried about the impact of his comments and expressions. The thought now gives me a pain in my heart.""There is wide speculation that North Korea's government was involved in Kim Jong-nam's death. Malaysian police have arrested three people in the case, but it's not yet known whether they have links to North Korea.Kim Jong-nam said the Chinese government protected him in China and gave him a bodyguard, but did not do so elsewhere in Asia, Gomi said. When they met, Kim Jong-nam was picked up by a Chinese driver, Gomi said. South Korea's intelligence service says Beijing had long protected Kim Jong Nam, perhaps because it may have seen him as a possible future North Korean leader should the current government in Pyongyang collapse. Kim Jong-nam's frequent trips to Southeast Asian countries in recent years may have indicated a growing distance between him and China's government, Gomi said.","korean leader half brother ,tokyo ap japanese author ,gomi book my father ,kim opposed his family ,reforms tokyo based journalist","['AP', 'japanese', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'malaysian', 'Kim', 'Tokyo', ""Yoji Gomi 's"", 'Kim Jong - il', 'I', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47543845  0.52578163

Comfort women refer to Korean women who were forcibly taken to front-line military brothels by the Japanese army during World War II. Under the deal reached on Dec. 28, 2015, Japan apologized and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for the creation of a foundation aimed at supporting the victims, euphemistically called comfort women.The poll surveyed the opinions of 1,003 males and females aged over 19 from Tuesday to Thursday.The public's approval rating for the renegotiation rose to 63 percent in September 2016 from 58 percent in January 2016, one month after the deal.Out of the respondents, supporters of the ruling Liberal Korea Party disapproved of the renegotiation, 58 percent to 30 percent.Asked about the new girl statue erected in December in front of the Japanese Consulate in the southern port city of Busan, 78 percent said it should be kept there, with 16 percent saying it should be removed or transferred.In January, Japan recalled its ambassador to Seoul in protest of the statue installment in front of the consulate.

""Isn't Kim Jong-un the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il?US-based media Radio Free Asia said that North Korean residents including party officials in provincial areas do not know that the half brother of the current leader was killed ahead of the 75th birth anniversary of his late father.But sources said that reports of Kim's death have begun to slowly go viral at the country's border areas with China where access to outside information is relatively easy to come by.South Korea's military plans to use loudspeakers along the inter-Korean border to inform North Koreans of Kim's killing in a bid to reveal the brutality of the North's regime, government sources said.Kim Jong-nam was once viewed as the heir apparent, but he had been living in other countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.The latest case marked the most high-profile death under the Kim Jong-un regime since the execution of Jang Song-thaek in December 2013, the once-powerful uncle of the incumbent leader.Experts said that the assassination is seen as the North Korean leader's move to strengthen his reign of terror by eliminating any potential challenge to his one-man rule.Malaysian police have arrested three suspects including two Asian women in connection with Kim's death. The results of an autopsy on his body are expected to come out in coming days.","korean residents have secret ,brother sources north koreans ,koreans unaware of death ,half brother as pyongyang ,death of north korean","['North Koreans', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53577304  0.38680285

Ted Poe, who serves as chairman of the House's subcommittee on terrorism and trade, told Radio Free Asia that it is a ""very serious problem"" if Kim Jong-un assassinated his half brother. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attends a meeting of the North's ruling Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang on Feb. 15, 2017, to mark the 75th birthday of his late father Kim Jong-il.  Kim Jong-nam -- the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il -- was killed at an airport in Malaysia on Monday after allegedly being attacked with poison by two women, according to South Korea's spy agency.According to the RFA, Poe expressed his stance that if the North turns out to be behind the murder, it will be another terrorist act by the North.The lawmaker introduced a similar bill to the previous House last year, saying Pyongyang meets the criteria for terror sponsor designation. That bill later passed through the Foreign Affairs Committee but was ultimately scrapped as the House expired at the end of last year.North Korea was put on the US terrorism sponsor list for the 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Airlines flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the US administration under President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Calls had spiked for putting the North back on the list after Pyongyang was found to be responsible for the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. But the State Department did not do so, saying relisting would only be symbolic without significant practical consequences.","murder report us congressman ,jong nam murder report ,kim jong nam murder ,house subcommittee on terrorism ,murder of north korean","['US', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Kim Jong - nam', 'US', 'US', 'Ted Poe', 'House', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Kim Jong - un']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1830821   0.59115595

During the meeting, the officials vowed to redouble efforts to ensure the safety of prominent North Korean defectors and South Korean nationals who could potentially be the target of Pyongyang's attacks.Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of the North's strongman, died Monday at an airport in Malaysia in an apparent assassination by North Korean operatives. The exact cause of his death is under investigation by Malaysian police.Observers said Kim's murder may be part of the North Korean leader's scheme to preclude any potential challenge to his leadership and consolidate his power.Later in the day, senior officials from the state anti-terrorism center and the National Police Agency decided to step up efforts to protect North Korean defectors, particularly those engaging in anti-Pyongyang activities.During their meeting, the two sides decided to run a real-time communication channel to smoothly exchange intelligence and step up efforts to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country.Also high on the agenda at the ministers' meeting was the North's launch on Sunday of a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the first provocation this year and since the new US administration took office last month.Related to the launch, ministers agreed to push for stronger international cooperation to further pressure Pyongyang into renouncing its nuclear and missile programs, and maintain a ""watertight"" security readiness to counter additional provocations, Hwang's office said in a press release.Noting the rising jobless rate, ministers decided to pay more attention to creating jobs and stabilizing the livelihoods of ordinary citizens. Government data showed Wednesday that the country's unemployment rate stood at 3.8 percent last month, edging up 0.1 percentage point from the same month last year. From a month earlier, the rate rose 0.6 percentage point from 3.2 percent.""The employment situation is difficult, but if we try , there should be ways ,"" Hwang said.Hwang urged top policymakers to do their utmost to revitalize the economy by creating new jobs, helping local firms expand their presence in foreign markets, removing unnecessary regulations and harnessing the country's technological edge to sharpen industrial competitiveness.Regarding the spread of the animal disease, the government decided to mobilize ""all available resources"" to contain and prevent it from spreading to pigs.","defectors after the murder ,profile north korean defectors ,south korea acting president ,north korean defectors after ,north korean defectors","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Hwang', 'Pyongyang']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.52970654  0.44288138

South Korean intelligence said that the assassination of the elder Kim was a standing order from Kim Jong-un for the past five years, but many suspect there may have been a more urgent need to carry it out now.  Kim Jong-nam, the exiled half-brother of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un An unnamed North Korea official said Kim Jong-nam could have been assassinated after defying his younger brother’s order to return home. Kim Jong-un, unnerved by his defiance and worries that he might defect to other countries, may have ordered a hit, the official said.“Kim Jong-un is believed to have ordered that Kim Jong-nam be assassinated before he sought asylum overseas,” the official told US broadcaster Radio Free Asia. “Kim Jong-un was apparently worried about Kim Jong-nam fleeing to the United States or South Korea out of fear of being killed.” Sources familiar with North Korea said that the reason why the leader Kim sought to bring his half-brother back home “immediately” may have been a handsome amount of money left by their father Kim Jong-il, the late leader of North Korea, and Jang Sung-taek, their uncle executed by the leader Kim in 2013. In an interview with Yonhap News Agency, the sources said Kim Jong-nam was called “deep-pocket of Macau,” after obtaining wealth left by his uncle. Kim Jong-nam also received a huge inheritance from his father who felt pity for seeing his eldest son live in exile overseas. The Chinese city of Macau is where the deceased is believed to have lived with his family. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, speculated that Kim jong-un may have been angered by the latest media report that confirmed Kim Jong-nam’s attempt to defect to South Korea. According to officials who worked under the previous South Korean government which is said to have pursued Kim Jong-nam in 2012, the scheme did not work out because Kim felt “overwhelmed” by the idea of living in the South, which is technically still at war with the North. “We did ask him about his defection to the South,” an anonymous high-level official for the previous Lee Myung-bak administration said during an interview with local daily Segyeilbo. “But we eventually stopped pursuing him because he saw defection to the South as being too risky.” Recently, a local daily reported that Kim Jong-nam had served in the 2000s as a middleman between officials in North Korea and incumbent South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who then worked as the leader of the main opposition party. The newspaper also reported that Kim Jong-nam, who was then living in Beijing, delivered a letter that Park wrote to Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s late leader and the father of Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un, in 2005. The letter showed Park requesting help on cultural exchange programs pushed by her family-run foundation.Kim Jong-nam was killed Monday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport after being attacked by two unidentified women with poison. Seoul’s spy agency Wednesday confirmed the death of Kim, stopping short of saying that North Korea was behind it. The eldest son of Kim Jong-il, he was once an heir apparent, but he had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.By Yeo Jun-suk","killing south korean intelligence ,the killing south korean ,murder motive the murder ,theories abound over murder ,killing south korean","['Kim Jong - nam', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'Kim Jong - un']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40983021  0.63709271

The incumbent ruler Kim Jong-un, who was seen stone-faced and staring into space throughout a party-government-military assembly in television footage a day earlier, paid tribute at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of his father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung, the official Korean Central News Agency said. The Rodong Sinmun, Uriminzokkiri and other state mouthpieces also churned out articles idolizing the Kim dynasty.  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attends a meeting of the North's ruling Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang on Feb. 15, 2017, to mark the 75th birthday of his late father Kim Jong-il. Dubbed the “Day of the Shining Star,” the deceased strongman’s birthday was dwarfed by the assassination of his eldest son, the young leader’s half-brother, by poison-armed secret agents in Malaysia on Monday. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service pointed to the North’s top reconnaissance bureau as the likely mastermind behind the killing. Though the North’s state media remains silent on the incident, as was widely expected, foreign news outlets such as AP and AFP reporting from Pyongyang highlighted the stark, ironic contrast between the festive mood and the murder’s shockwaves sweeping through the globe.Across the capital a multitude of events unfurled, from a figure skating gala and a synchronized swimming festival to fireworks and mass rallies reportedly attended by as many as some 3,000 government officials in uniforms. Last week’s successful firing of a new intermediate-range ballistic missile was deemed another anniversary “gift.” Most rank-and-file citizens, however, would be unaware of the existence of their autocrat’s half brother, not to mention his death, North Korean defectors say. That is partly because in a hierarchical, strictly Confucian society like that in the North, the eldest son takes over. Kim Jong-un is the third son. While news reports of Kim Jong-nam’s murder and the ongoing arrests of the suspects spread outside the country, Kim Jong-un remained stoic during Wednesday’s celebrations, not smiling or waving, even when the participants hailed the missile launch or as he exited the event. His display was reminiscent of 2013 when he showed up at a public meeting shortly after the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek.In Malaysia, senior North Korean diplomats reportedly rushed to the hospital to urge that an autopsy not be conducted on Kim Jong-nam’s body. As the request was declined, they attended the session and demanded the body be handed over, local authorities said. To help North Koreans realize the regime’s brutality, South Korea’s military said Wednesday it will broadcast news of the murder through loudspeakers installed around the border regions. “Ordinary citizens and soldiers would not be interested in whether Kim Jong-nam is dead or alive, all they care about is how to eke out their living,” Kang Myung-do, the son-in-law of former North Korean Prime Minister Kang Sung-san who now teaches North Korean Studies at the Kyungmin University here, said in an interview with SBS on Wednesday.“But when the regime revealed the execution of Jang Song-thaek and tried to boost its legitimacy through statements from all ranks and classes, it backfired and the people questioned how  killed his own uncle. So if his ‘poison-murder’ of his half-brother is known through the loudspeakers, many would become skeptical over his inhumanity and immorality.”By Shin Hyon-hee","death north korea celebrated ,murder nk marks late ,late leader birthday unfazed ,marks late leader birthday ,korea celebrated the 75th","['Kim Jong - nam', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Sun', 'Kim']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3499651   0.24748522

The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead a day after the incident took place.This file photo taken on Sept. 22, 2016, shows Chinese murder suspect Chen Guorui speaking to reporters after reenacting his crime in the city of Jeju on South Korea's largest island of Jeju. The defendant was nabbed some 40 kilometers away from the scene a few hours after the crime.Chen told police he killed her because Kim reminded him of his former wives who ran away after having extramarital affairs.But during questioning by the prosecution, he changed his statement and said he committed the crime to be jailed here and not go back to China. ""The defendant took away the valuable life of the victim for a reason that cannot be understood,"" the Jeju District Court said in a statement. ""He did not show any signs of remorse or offer an apology.""The court said it took into consideration that the defendant has been mentally ill for the past five to six years, according to a psychiatric evaluation. Chen entered the country through a visa-free program for Chinese tourists less than a week before he committed the crime and was scheduled to leave a few days later. The case has sparked a public outcry along with a series of other crimes committed by Chinese tourists on the island, leading to growing calls for a toughened visa policy.","years for murdering korean ,murdering south korean woman ,for murdering korean woman ,25 years for murdering ,murdering korean woman","['chinese', 'south korean', 'Jeju', 'Chen Guorui', 'Kim', 'catholic']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49191347  0.08190534

Malaysia has reportedly completed an autopsy on Kim Jong-nam but it has yet to announce the results. The Southeast Asian country reportedly plans to return the body to North Korea.Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of former leader Kim Jong-il, is widely believed to have been killed by female agents. He was once seen as heir apparent but his sibling took power after his father's death in December 2011.  The military has strengthened intelligence sharing on North Korea with US Forces Korea and bolstered its surveillance and defense capabilities to counter any aggression by the North, the JCS official said.The assassination took place a day after Pyongyang test-fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine.

Kim Jong-nam, 46, was murdered with poison at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday before boarding a flight to Macao.The Malaysian police is currently trying to determine who is behind the murder although his brother is largely reported to have ordered it.Touching on inter-Korean relations, Salmon said using both talks and military pressure toward North Korea is important in dealing with the communist country. ""Offering them the treaty to end the Korean War would be a good piece of leverage that we never used, but we should use it,"" he said, referring to the option of signing a peace treaty that could replace the current truce agreement the two sides have.In a ceremony at the British Embassy in Seoul, Salmon was awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire on Thursday in recognition of his history books on the Korean War for which Britain deployed more than 80,000 troops.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  waves in a photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency in November 2016 and his half brother Kim Jong-nam waves at a hotel in Macau, China, in a 2010 photo provided by the JoongAng Sunday paper.  To carry out the order, officials from the ministry met Kim Jong-nam in Macau on Jan. 20 and Kim asked them to give him some time to think about the younger brother's request, according to the report.""Kim Jong-un was apparently worried about Kim Jong-nam fleeing to the United States or South Korea out of fear of being killed,"" the official was quoted as saying. ""Kim Jong-un is believed to have ordered that Kim Jong-nam to be assassinated before he sought asylum overseas.""A source with knowledge of North Korean affairs told RFA that Kim Jong-un had the North's diplomats overseas meet Kim Jong-nam twice -- late last year and early this year. On a separate occasion, a North Korean official stationed in Laos gave Kim Jong-nam a letter from the current leader after meeting him in person, the source said.The leader is believed to have attempted to cajole him into returning home, but Kim Jong-nam's failure to give a definite answer apparently led to the fratricidal order, according to the source.Kim was killed on Monday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport after being attacked by two unidentified women with poison. Seoul's spy agency on Wednesday confirmed the killing of Kim, stopping short of saying that North Korea was behind the latest killing.But it said that the murder of Kim Jong-nam has been a ""standing order"" issued by Kim Jong-un since he inherited power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father.Kim Jong-nam -- the eldest son of Kim Jong-il -- was once an heir apparent, but he had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.","korean diplomats had tried ,report north korean diplomats ,us broadcaster reported thursday ,korean diplomats had pressed ,the estranged half brother","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Malaysia', 'US', 'north korean', 'Radio Free Asia', 'the State Security Ministry', 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37109834  1.05341518

Gunfights erupted and more than 90 South Koreans were killed including many civilians on a bus. Only two of the 31 commandos survived, one fled to the North and one was captured.    1974 presidential attemptIn 1974, Park, late father of the current South Korean president Park Geun-hye, survived another assassination attempt.A pro-Pyongyang Korean living in Japan, Mun Se-gwang, opened fire with a revolver while Park was delivering a speech. He missed Park but killed Park's wife Yuk Young-soo. Mun was executed that year.1983 MyanmarNorth Korean undercover agents killed 21 people, including four South Korean cabinet ministers in a bomb attack in Yangon.A timed device planted under the roof of the city's Martyr's Mausoleum was  intended to kill then South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan.It exploded before the president arrived, but his entourage was badly hit.Three North Korean agents fled the scene, one was killed and two others were captured by Burmese authorities.    1987 Korean AirA South Korean plane flying from Baghdad to Seoul exploded over the Andaman Sea. All 115 people on board were killed.The two bombers were traced to Bahrain where a male agent committed suicide  by biting a cyanide capsule hidden in a cigarette as they were about to be  taken into custody. The other agent, Kim Hyon-Hee, was captured and brought to Seoul. She later  confessed her attack had been aimed to hamper the 1988 Seoul summer Olympics. She was sentenced to death but later pardoned.    1996 diplomat killingSouth Korean diplomat Choi Duk-keun was found bludgeoned to death in  Vladivostok in 1996 in what South Korean media said was revenge for the death of 25 North Korean submariners who died when their vessel ran aground in the  South during an infiltration attempt.    1997 family affairYi Han-yong, a nephew of Jong-Nam's mother Sung Hye-rim, was fatally shot in 1997 outside his home. The two assailants were never caught.Yi had been living in the South since his 1982 defection, where he had  published his memoir revealing details of the Kims' private lives.

Kim, 46, is reported to have fallen after two unidentified women sprayed his face with a liquid-like substance as he waited for his flight to Macau in an airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Kim, who was once North Korea’s crown prince, has been under such a threat for at least five years, South Korean officials said. This 2011 photo shows a poison-tipped ballpoint pen and other tools firing poison bullets found on a failed North Korean assassin. YonhapThe communist regime is seen frequently using toxic materials to kill defectors in the South and South Korean human rights activists working overseas.In 2011, there was an attempt to kill rights activist Park Sang-hak, who headed a conservative civic organization that sent anti-communist leaflets to the North. A spy, who is only identified by his surname Ahn, was found to have received orders to kill Park from a spy in Mongolia.He was arrested with two poison guns, a poison pen with a toxic tip and the poisonous pills which could kill a victim in 3 second after ingested.The toxic pen contained neostigmine bromide in its tip, which can kill a victim with only as little as 10 milligram.Ahn was caught by the nation’s National Intelligence Service officials on Sept. 3 after he called out to Park on a subway station near Gangnam, Seoul, in an attempt to kill him with a poison pen.A South Korean pastor who helped North Korean defectors in Dandong, China was murdered in a toxic pen attack by a North Korean agent who has not been caught or identified. Patrick Kim gave out bibles and booklets that aroused anti-sentiments towards the North’s late former leader Kim Jong-il and received warnings from the regime while he was alive.The North’s methods of killing changed when they targeted Korean leaders or random civilians.A terrorist explosion occurred when former President Chun Doo-hwan visited the tomb of the late Myanmar’s leader Aung San in 1983, which left 17 dead and 14 seriously injured. It was later found that three North Korean special forces officers implemented two explosives on top of the grave’s roof. In November 1987, a year before the 1988 Olympics took place in Seoul, two North Korean spies also planted bombs on a Korean Airline plane to interfere with Seoul’s preparation for the event. All 115 passengers on board died in the explosion.By Jo He-rim","murder of kim jong ,assassins toxic spray ,used in the murder ,the murder of kim ,murder of kim","['Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'Kim']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22342594  0.46551296

The views were contrary to the assessment of South Korea’s top spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, which told lawmakers Wednesday that the incident is presumed to have been based on Kim Jong-un’s “paranoia” about his older half-brother, rather than a calculated decision. “In order to show their loyalty to the leader Kim, some fervent subordinates might have acted on a tacit order from him to take out Kim Jong-nam” said Ahn Chan-il, director of the World North Korea Research Center and former North Korean military officer who fled to South Korea in 1979.  Photos of the two unidentified women who allegedly attacked Kim Jong-nam, as reported by local mediaKim Jong-nam, 47, died Monday after being attacked with poison by two unidentified women at a Kuala Lumpur airport while waiting for a flight to Macau, where his family members live, according to Malaysian police and the NIS. It has not yet been confirmed whether North Korea was behind the attack.Ahn noted there must have been an “urgent need” to assassinate Kim Jong-nam, adding that the Kim Jong-un may have been extremely unnerved by the possibility that his outspoken, flamboyant half-brother might seek asylum in South Korea and western countries. In 2012, there was a rumor that Kim Jong-nam considered defection to South Korea. Recently a local media reported that South Korea had tried to negotiate his defection, but the effort failed due to differences over the terms and conditions. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, said the very report could have angered Kim Jong-un, prompting him to order assassination of what he viewed as “real threat” to his leadership. “Without approval of Kim Jong-un, assassination of Kim Jong-nam never would have happened,” said Cheong. “If the elder Kim blackmailed the younger Kim with a threat to defect, Pyongyang’s leadership would have chosen to assassinate him, instead of considering a compromise.”Chung speculated that General Bureau of Reconnaissance, Pyongyang’s intelligence agency which manages the communist state’s clandestine operations against South Korea, may have orchestrated the murder, saying the agency is in charge of taking out dissenting officials and has been spying on Kim Jong-nam. Earlier in the day, the NIS said the killing of Kim Jong-nam had been a “standing order” for North Korean agents since 2012, when he reportedly sought asylum in South Korea. The intelligence service added that Kim Jong-nam also asked Kim not to kill him and his family members. Yang Moo-jin, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies, agreed that Kim Jong-un might have took a “specific step” that led to the assassination, speculating that the deceased may have tried to come to South Korea or refused to return to the North in defiance of the leader’s order. “I suspect Kim Jong-nam definitely did something that hurts the reputation of North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, which the North viewed as the most serious crime,” said Yang. “Defection attempts, refusal to obey the order… anything could be possible.” North Korea`s leader Kim Jong-un and his half brother Kim Jong-nam. YonhapRegarding the motive for taking out his own brother, experts noted that Kim Jong-un was “extremely nervous” about Kim Jong-nam’s harsh criticism against his power structure amid the rumors that the elder Kim might have been supported by China, main ally of North Korea. “From the Kim Jong-un regime’s point of view, Kim Jong-nam is like a pain in the ass,” said Ko Yoo-hwan, a professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University. “The people in Pyongyang might have been afraid that Kim would work as a dissenter.”  Kim Jong-nam, since falling out of the succession race after his mother, Sung Hae-rim, was rejected by the late leader Kim Jong-il, has been living outside North Korea. He had stayed in China for a while and later moved around South East Asian such as Malaysia and Singapore.But the experts dismissed the idea that Kim Jong-nam was a Chinese favorite pick to replace the current leader in the event of insurgency in the North, saying that the scenario was “scrapped” after Kim Jong-un executed his uncle Jang Sung-thaek, a pro-Chinese high-profile official. For this reason, analysts predicted little impact from Kim’s death on the North’s relations with China, but Pyongyang will face international condemnation and risk being branded a state sponsor of terror by the US again. Washington took the North off the terrorism sponsor list in 2008.“Electing Kim Jong-nam as a replacement for Kim Jong-un is an old narrative from before the execution of Jang,” said Ko. “As opposed to worsening relations with China,  could enhance North Korea’s image as a rogue state.”","murder of kim jong ,loyalists behind killing experts ,killing experts the murder ,korean experts said wednesday ,experts the murder","['Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Kim']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23309693  0.70933747

It was his outspoken attitude and resistance to the hereditary power succession which ruled him out as leader, giving way to his younger half-brother Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-nam Until he was ousted, however, the elder Kim was deemed the most cherished son of the late state leader. He was also the first-born of his father’s second wife Song Hye-rim, a former movie star who is said to have been the favorite of his three spouses.As the younger son of Korean-Japanese dancer Koh Young-hee -- whose background is considered rather humble compared to Song’s -- Kim Jong-un has often been reported to keep a jealous watch over his half-brother.The latter not only had the full support of Jang Song-thaek, the once-powerful but now executed uncle of the incumbent leader, but also was deemed a “more rightful heir” to power due to his mother’s reputed background.This tension also explains the repeated attempts to have the elder Kim killed over the past years.Kim Jong-nam’s mother, Song, who was married to someone else at the time she met Kim Jong-il, was forced by the Kim family to leave North Korea in 1974. She spent the rest of her life in Moscow, Russia, where she died alone in 2002.","brother the assassinated kim ,half brother the assassinated ,old elder half brother ,jealous of his 46 ,elder half brother","['Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Il - sung']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50148594  0.5088715

The incident introduced Kim Jong-nam, the slain older half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, to the outside world. But his yearning 16 years ago to visit Tokyo Disneyland blew his chances to succeed in the reclusive dynasty, incurring the wrath of his father and longtime strongman Kim Jong-il.Shown is a file photo taken in August 1981 of Kim Jong-nam , the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, together with his father , late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. A press statement released by the Malaysian police on Feb. 14, 2017, said a 46-year-old North Korean named Kim Chol died the previous day on his way to a hospital from a Malaysia International Airport service counter where he sought initial medical treatment. Born in 1971 to Kim Jong-il and Sung Hae-rim, a married actress with whom the late leader had an affair, Kim Jong-nam spent his childhood at international schools in Moscow and Geneva, like his brothers and sisters. After his return home, he quickly climbed the regime’s ladder, securing four-star general status in 1995 and chairing a state computer committee in charge of the country’s information technology policy in 1998.  Yet his political fate began to wane in the late 1990s after his aunt, Sung Hae-rang, took asylum in the US, following her son Lee Han-yong, who defected to South Korea via Switzerland in 1982 and was shot to death by North Korean agents in 1997. Kim Jong-nam’s parents, meanwhile, had also become estranged, as the leader had started seeing Ko Yong-hui, Kim Jong-un’s mother. Kim Jong-nam had since lived a life in exile, transforming himself into a vocal regime critic until allegedly being slain with poison by North Korean operatives Monday in Kuala Lumpur.Despite his fall from grace, he was believed to be managing his father’s slush funds in China, Macau and other Southeast Asian countries where he also enjoyed casinos, top hotel bars and other extravagances. After the despot fell ill and his much younger half-brother geared up to take over, however, he raised his voice against a “third dynastic succession” during interviews with Japanese media. In 2011, he questioned the newly minted heir’s capabilities, saying, “In that young kid’s face, I can’t read at all any signs of his sense of duty, prudence and agony over the nation’s future.” He faced an endless series of death threats, including a botched attempt in 2010 in Beijing by an agent disguised as a defector who testified to South Korean authorities that the order came from above.Safety concerns may well have affected his absence at his father’s funeral in December 2011, as well as his decision to maintain a low profile, especially since the 2013 execution of Jang Song-thaek, his once-formidable uncle and patron. Kim was last spotted in France last September and in 2013. His son Han-sol was studying at the Sciences Po university in Paris. Han-sol did a rare interview with a Finnish broadcaster in 2012, during which he called his uncle a “dictator.” Yoji Komi, an editor at the Tokyo Shimbun who built personal ties with him via emails and meetings, wrote Wednesday that though Kim refrained from political remarks due to safety concerns about his son, he had told acquaintances he was going to start speaking out against the regime again once he graduates from college.By Shin Hyon-hee","slain older half brother ,tokyo disneyland blew his ,fake dominican republic passports ,tokyo alongside his son ,disneyland blew his chances","['Tokyo', 'Dominican Republic', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Tokyo']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41409436  0.42418665

The country holds diplomatic ties with both Koreas and is located within four hours by flight from Macau, his home after leaving North Korea.  For North Korean agents, it would be easier to carry out an operation like this in Malaysia than in the Chinese city of Macau, where the authorities are well aware of the risks Kim was facing and provided security services to him and his family.

Malaysian media outlet the Star reported Wednesday that local police were analyzing CCTV footage of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.It was here that Kim Jong-nam, the 46-year-old half-brother of the North Korean leader, was killed by an unidentified toxic substance at around 9 a.m. on Monday. The CCTV footage showed one of the two female figures who approached Kim -- a relatively young woman wearing a white long-sleeve T-shirt and a mini skirt. Her agile and sharp movements have led to speculation she and her partner were well-trained special agents dedicated to secret missions, including high-profile assassinations.It is common for the North Korean regime to train women -- often those who look attractive and are sociable -- as special agents. Their prime role is to catch their target off guard and speedily eliminate the “enemy,” often using stealthy means such as poisoned needles or close-range shooting.It was also based on such background that a number of female espionage agents were caught over the past decades in action in South Korea.This time, the two agents appeared determined not to miss their target, who has long been a source of annoyance to their state leader.Both of them reportedly turned on Kim while he was at a check-in kiosk before a flight to Macau, with one grasping him from the back and the other spraying a toxic substance onto his face.While the two aggressors fled and disappeared from view by taxi, Kim complained of severe pain, upon which he was moved to the airport’s first aid center and then to a general hospital downtown. He died on the way.

It is rather a reflection of Kim Jong-un’s monomaniacal side than a calculated move to remove a threat to his regime,” Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the Democratic Party of Korea told reporters after a closed-door session with the nation’s spy agency chief. “An assassination attempt from North Korea was first spotted in 2012. Kim Jong-nam sent a letter begging for his and his family’s life to his brother Kim Jong-un in April that year,” Kim said. “In the letter, Kim Jong-nam said ‘Please cancel the punishment order for me and my family. We have nowhere to go. Suicide is the only way to escape.’”South Korea’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, on Wednesday confirmed that Kim Jong-nam, 46, was killed with poison at an airport in Kuala Lumpur by two unidentified women on Monday. He was waiting to take a flight to Macau, where his family members live. Pyongyang has been on the lookout for the opportunity to assassinate Kim Jong-nam, who was believed to be under the protection of the Chinese government until recently, the agency said.By Ock Hyun-ju","assassination of north korean ,monomaniacal side the assassination ,killing shows kim jong ,dictator monomaniacal character lawmaker ,the assassination of north","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Kim Byung - kee']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70619881  0.6337328

""If it should be confirmed that the assassination was carried out by the North Korean regime, this would be a telltale example of the brutal, inhumane nature of the Kim Jong-un regime,"" Hwang said during the meeting attended by top security and diplomatic officials.""Based on the understanding that this case is of great importance, our government is keeping close tabs on North Korea's movements,"" he added, directing officials to devise ""thorough measures"" to deal with additional provocations by the reclusive state.Malaysian police officials were quoted by media as saying that Kim, 45, was attacked with a chemical spray at a Kuala Lumpur airport and died while being transported to a hospital. He was waiting for a flight to Macau when the attack happened, the officials said.Many observers believe that the killing is part of the North Korean leader's efforts to get rid of potential risks to his autocratic rule and further consolidate his power. The incident was reported Tuesday, just two days after Pyongyang sharply ratcheted up military tensions with the launch of a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, which analysts here said indicated Pyongyang's progress in developing delivery vehicles for its nuclear weapons.At the NSC session, Hwang stressed the need to strengthen sanctions and pressure against the recalcitrant regime to make it realize that it has no other option but to abandon its nuclear ambitions.""We have to make sure that UN Security Council sanctions or major partners' independent sanctions are thoroughly enforced so that pressure on the North can actually have the substantive effect ,"" Hwang said.The acting president also called on political circles to support government efforts to deal with Pyongyang's persistent military threats.","brother indicates regime brutal ,assassination of north korean ,hwang says apparent assassination ,assassination of nk leader ,apparent assassination of north","[""South Korea 's"", 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Hwang', 'the Standing Committee of the National Security Council', 'Kim Jong - nam']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.28795409  0.62026632

Kim Jong-un The killing is the latest in a series of purges leader Kim has carried out since taking office five years ago.""I think it speaks to the question of how much resistance there is inside the country,"" Victor Cha, a Georgetown University professor and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Yonhap News Agency.""I know that there's a lot of people who say five years in, the transition is stable. But he sacks the minister of state security last month and now kills the elder brother. Doesn't look so stable to me,"" Cha said.Mark Tokola, a former senior diplomat and currently vice president of the Korea Economic Institute of America, said it's obvious that the North's leader ordered the killing, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong-nam in the past.""In looking for a motive for the murder, there is a Latin phrase for it, ""Qui bono?"" . There are very few that would directly benefit from Kim Jong-nam's death other than his half-brother in Pyongyang,"" Tokola said in an analysis piece.Tokola also said the motivation could be a ""a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un.""""Whether or not Kim Jong-nam was actively plotting against Kim Jong-un , he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose Kim Jong-un,"" the expert said. ""Kim Jong-nam has been fairly quiet in his exile, but was quoted in the Japanese press in 2010 as saying he opposed dynastic succession in North Korea.""Tokola also noted the North's leader has been eliminating those perceived as threats to him, including the brutal killing of his uncle Jang Song-thaek in 2013.The killing could also be interpreted as another North Korean affront to China, he said.""Kim Jong-nam has been living mostly in Macau, certainly under Chinese protection, and was quoted in 2012 as saying that North Korea needed 'Chinese-style economic reform,'"" Tokola said. ""Some commentators have theorized that the government of China was keeping Kim Jong-nam in reserve with the option of helping him assume power if Kim Jong-un fell in the future.

Security Council to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court for its ""organized and large-scale"" human rights violations regarding such enforced disappearances, although little progress has been made so far on the matter, she said.    Ariel Dulitzky, one of the panel members, said the group even asked Pyongyang to allow them access to the country for an on-site visit last year, but the country remains unresponsive.    ""Sadly up to today, we could not verify any single case"" because of North Korea's lack of cooperation on the issue, he noted.    The meeting with reporters followed the group's five-day consultation held in Seoul this week where the experts reviewed petitions seeking to determine the fate or whereabouts of those who were reportedly abducted by the North and other countries.   The Seoul government has said about 3,000 South Korean soldiers and civilians were confirmed to have been kidnapped by the North during and after the war.   North Korea, however, categorically rejects such accusations, saying they are just slander aimed at toppling the country's regime.","list for koreans abducted ,enforced disappearances said friday ,abducted by north korea ,koreans abducted by korea ,abducted by korea growing","[""the United Nations '"", 'South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Working Group on Enforced']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51383829  0.542858

He concluded that his sons would have ``miserable'' lives if they returned home because they had come to know the truth about the country.    Ahead of their defection to South Korea last year, Thae said he told his sons that he was going to ``cut the chains of slavery and you are free men.''    He said his sons are ``now feeling a true sense of freedom'' in South Korea.    Thae said his disappointment with leader Kim Jong Un was another reason he defected. Kim, who took office in late 2011 following his dictator father's death, has orchestrated a series of high-profile executions, purges and dismissals in what outside analysts say is an attempt to bolster his grip on power. Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons has drawn tough international sanctions.     Thae is the most senior North Korean diplomat to defect to South Korea. In 1997, the North Korean ambassador to Egypt fled but resettled in the United States.     North Korea has called Thae ``human scum'' and accused him of embezzling government money and committing other crimes.","korean diplomat to defect ,senior korean defector says ,korean defector says his ,other north korean diplomats ,defector says his sons","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'Yong Ho', 'the north Korean Embassy', 'London', 'London', 'north korean']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37159798  0.44018626

The book has drawn criticism for challenging the coercive nature of the recruitment of Korean women for sex slavery.Nine of the former “comfort women” -- the euphemistic term for Korean women coerced into sex slavery for the Japanese military -- filed a defamation suit, denouncing the book for describing the victims as “prostitutes” and “collaborators with the Japanese military.”In the book, Park said that the women had volunteered to serve as prostitutes for the Japanese military out of patriotism and there is no evidence of the Japanese government’s involvement in luring the women into sex slavery.  Following the ruling, a former comfort woman Lee Yong-soo, 88, expressed fury. “Isn’t there a law? She should be found guilty. This is not right!” she told reporters outside the courtroom, calling the professor Park “pro-Japanese collaborator.” “If they told us to take us to factories and made us sex slaves, shouldn’t someone take responsibility?”Park, on the other hand, signified her satisfaction. “It was a right ruling. Thank the judges who reasonably proceeded with the case,” she told reporters. Park has argued that the book was a mere expression of her opinion for the public good to clarify the controversial diplomatic issue based on her academic research. She also hit back at the prosecution for misinterpreting its content without grasping the full context. The prosecution asked for a three-year prison term, saying “Park had no remorse even after causing a scar to the victims by intentionally distorting historical facts. The freedom of expression is an essence of democracy, but insulting others cannot be tolerated.”The same court earlier in January 2016 ordered Park to pay 10 million won to each of the nine former comfort women who filed a civil suit seeking a financial compensation for mental distress the book has inflicted on them.It is estimated that up to 200,000 women were forced to be sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during the war, with many of them being Korean. Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women has remained one of the key sources of diplomatic dispute between South Korea and Japan. The countries reached a historic deal defined as “final and irreversible” on Dec. 28, 2015 in which Japan promised to pay 10 billion yen to a Korean-run foundation for the surviving victims in return for Seoul’s promise not to raise the issue again in international forums. But some of the comfort women and their rights groups have protested the deal, calling for an official and legal compensation from the Japanese government.By Ock Hyun-ju","korean women sexually enslaved ,professor of japanese literature ,south korean university professor ,japanese literature at seoul ,defaming the korean women","['south korean', 'korean', 'Japan', 'the Seoul Eastern District Court', 'Park Yu - ha', 'japanese', 'Seoul ’s Sejong University']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.45536312  0.105505

A policeman then strangled him inside Camp Crame, the national police headquarters in Manila, the Justice Department said last week.“We are outraged by the abduction and slay of a South Korean executive inside Camp Crame,” said Duterte’s spokesman Ernesto Abella. “We assure everyone that there will be no whitewash or cover-up. We will not tolerate abusive, errant policemen who betray the organization.”The kidnappers demanded a ransom from the victim’s wife and she initially paid five million pesos , thinking he was still alive, authorities said last week when they first announced details of the police officers’ involvement.The policemen for months led the wife to believe her husband was alive but he had been in fact killed on the day he was abducted, investigators said.The officers involved were from a task force focused solely on illegal drugs and stationed at the sprawling Camp Crame.The incident has shocked and angered the South Korean government, with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-Se demanding those behind the crime be brought to justice.The police have come under intense scrutiny as the frontline troops in Duterte’s efforts to eradicate illegal drugs in society, with human rights groups accusing them of mass extrajudicial killings.Police have reported killing 2,250 drug suspects since Duterte assumed office, with 3,710 others murdered by unknown suspects who at times have left signs at the crime scenes accusing their victims of being drug dealers or addicts.Duterte has repeatedly promised to protect police from prosecution if they are charged with murder for killing a drug suspect, leading to fears corrupt officers feel they have a green light to commit crimes in the name of the drug war.","korean murder by police ,south korean murder manila ,killing of the businessmen ,murder manila afp philippine ,korean murder manila afp","['MANILA', 'AFP', 'philippine', 'Rodrigo Duterte', 'south Korean ’s', 'Duterte ’s', 'Angeles City', 'Manila']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1832044   0.31650299

She had been treated for spinal stenosis, colitis and cerebral infarction for the past two years, but her symptoms worsened recently.Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work at front-line brothels for Japanese forces.   Born in North Jeolla Province in 1923, Park was taken to a Japan-dominated region in China in 1942 and was forced to work at brothels for Japanese soldiers in such cities as Nanjing, Hankou and Wuchang before Korea was liberated from Japanese colonial rule in 1945.Park ran away from the military brothel but was unable to return to her hometown, according to the ministry. She has since lived in China, raising an adopted daughter.","korean victims park died ,dies at 94 korean ,sex slavery victim dies ,wartime sex slavery died ,94 korean victim","['korean', 'Japan', 'Xiaogan', 'China', 'Hubei Province', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family']",27,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.29651836  0.14870541

They used a forged arrest warrant to kidnap Ji, he said.Four more people, including Ji's housekeeper, were also believed to be implicated in the abduction, according to the ministry official. About two weeks after the abduction, Ji's family gave 5 million Philippine pesos  as ransom after getting a phone call from the kidnappers. They also withdrew cash from Ji's credit cards.Active in the labor export business in the Philippines, Ji had been acquainted with the suspects.Later in the day, South Korea's Ambassador to the Philippines Kim Jae-shin plans to meet with Philippine Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay to lodge a formal complaint and call for a thorough investigation.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here also plans to call in the Philippine Ambassador to South Korea to deliver similar messages. A telephone conversation is also reportedly scheduled between Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Yasay over the issue later in the day. ""South Korea is now urging the Philippine government for a thorough investigation into the case,"" another ministry official said, also indicating that Seoul may take action to demand the Philippine government provide compensation for the crime committed by government employees.","murdered by philippine policemen ,ransom last year murdered ,korean man abducted for ,man abducted for ransom ,korean man abducted","['south korean', 'Philippines', 'Ji', 'Angeles City']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04588024  0.21592176

In protest, Tokyo has also recalled its ambassador and consul general from the South and put currency swap talks on hold.""Japan's high-level response to an action by a civic group outside of Seoul's control makes a mountain out of a mole hill.It's an appalling error in strategic judgment that will endanger Korea-Japan relations at a time when unity among US allies is critical to deterring regional aggression,"" Oba said.""The United States must steer Japan toward a stance that reduces tensions and advances Korea-Japan relations,"" he said.He also said that the next US ambassador to Japan should actively make the case to Japan's ruling party leaders that further historical reconciliation serves Japan's security interests.Effective ""outside pressure"" from the US is critical to move the two key allies toward reconciliation, he said.Japan could have limited its response to diplomatic channels or lodged a public protest, rather than recalling its ambassador and cutting cooperation, Oba said. Such overreaction stoked ""Korean doubts about Japan's sincerity in addressing its wartime wrongs and empowers critics of Japan,"" he said.The renewed tensions came at a bad time when the Korea-Japan ties have become more vulnerable as uncertainty has grown for the fate of the 2005 agreement in the wake of the impeachment of South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Oba said.""Japan is an easy mark in Korean politics, and the comfort women agreement's association with the unpopular Park makes it even more likely to become a campaign issue.

The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.In April, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North continues to control political activity and ban or limit political opposition, while maintaining a network of political prison camps.Pyongyang is expected to react angrily to the latest sanctions.","sister of north korean ,state department blacklisted for ,sanctions on the sister ,younger sister and vice ,the state department blacklisted","['the United States', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Yo - jong', ""the Workers Party 's"", 'Propaganda and Agitation Department', 'north korean', 'the State Department']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19360571  0.26806247

The ruling comes after an appeals court for the first time found three draft rejecters not guilty in October. Last year alone, conscientious objectors were found not guilty in nine cases at the lowest courts. Some 18,700 conscientious objectors have been jailed for refusing to serve in the Army on the grounds of religion, freedom of thought and conscience since the 1950-53 Korean War. All able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve at least 21 months in the Army. The conscientious objectors have been uniformly sentenced to 18 months in prison without being given other options to serve the country. The Ministry of National Defense opposes the introduction of alternative services, citing growing threats from North Korea and possible abuse of such a program for draft-dodging.The Constitutional Court is set to rule whether the Military Conscription Law punishing conscientious objectors is constitutional in the coming months. The court has ruled against conscientious objection twice in 2004 and 2011, prioritizing national defense over individual rights.A poll, released Tuesday by the National Human Rights Council of Korea, shows that the South Korean public is clearly thawing to faithful draft rejecters. Those who reject the concept of conscientious objection accounted for 52 percent of the 1,504 respondents in the survey, conducted from May to December last year, down from nearly 90 percent in 2005 and 64 percent in 2011.

He also claimed that the pact aims to lay the base for a future-oriented relationship between Seoul and Tokyo.The opposition parties, as well as some of the victims, however, claim the agreement was made too hastily and without receiving consent from the victims. Opponents claimed Japan has not expressed a clear stance or apology on its role in the sexual enslavement of women. Tokyo, meanwhile, recalled its top envoys to South Korea and suspended bilateral currency swap negotiations in protest of a civic group's installation of a statue symbolizing the ""comfort women"" in front of its Consulate General office in the southern port city of Busan. Political observers said Hwang's comment urging restraint also targets opposition parties that have been claiming that the Seoul-Tokyo deal must be scrapped. On Monday, Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the Democratic Party, said the parliament should set up a separate budget to return the money it got from Japan, claiming the people are feeling ""humiliated"" by the deal. The minor opposition People's Party said the agreement was not an official deal signed by the two governments, but only a document clinched between foreign ministers, and that it is not legally binding for future administrations. The South Korean government has ruled out the possibility of renegotiating the pact.

She is suspected of receiving favors from a college in Seoul in the admissions process and on tests by taking advantage of her mother's ties to the president. The foreign ministry recently requested the 21-year-old to turn her passport in but she didn't comply by the given deadline. The ministry said her passport has automatically been nullified beginning Tuesday. Chung has been in custody of Danish authorities and showed no signs of voluntarily coming back home to face a probe.  Detention center located in Aalborg, Denmark where Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, is being held Special prosecutors looking into the alleged corruption scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye and her friend Choi earlier asked local authorities to extradite Chung.  Experts say that with the passport nullification, pressure will likely grow for Chung to return home. The ministry said that it plans to notify local authorities and Interpol of its latest decision in order to make Chung's passport invalid immediately.  Chung's mother Choi is suspected of meddling in state affairs and influence peddling. The president is also accused of conspiring with Choi.  Suspicions surrounding President Park and Choi led to massive candlelight vigils across the country over the past few months and eventually prompted the National Assembly to impeach the president on Dec. 9.","her deportation from denmark ,korea nullifies passport ,korea nullifies passport of ,daughter south korea foreign ,deportation from denmark chung","[""South Korea 's"", 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Denmark', 'danish', 'Aalborg', 'Seoul']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54450595  0.03944249

The country's current leader inherited power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father. But the late leader is seen as having kicked off a behind-the-scenes process to confirm Jong-un as his heir even before he officially made his decision known to the Workers' Party of Korea. The former leader ordered a meeting between the military's division commanders and his son in late 2008 where they were required to pledge their allegiance to Kim Jong-un, according to a paper carried by the school newspaper of North Korea's top Kim Il Sung University. Some experts had raised the possibility that military officials held a meeting to support Kim Jong-un, but it is the first time that the move was confirmed by a document published in the North. Kim Jong-il was believed to have suffered a stroke in the summer of 2008 that may have caused him to make his son Jong-un his successor. The transfer of power marks the second time that the North carried out a father-to-son power succession. The late leader took over the regime in 1994 when North Korean founder and his own father Kim Il-sung died. In September 2010, he named Kim Jong-un as a four-star general in the military, making his hereditary succession plan official for the first time. The paper also cited specific instructions in 2009 handed by the current leader's father which vindicated his choice for successor, stressing that his son is fully qualified to become the country's next leader. ""The meeting between division commanders and Kim Jong-un seemingly aimed to secure loyalty from the military,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. Analysts said that North Korea is likely to make 2017 a high mark of extolling the virtues and capabilities of the incumbent leader. The country's state media has begun to call Kim the ""respected supreme leader"" since Dec. 17 last year, the fifth anniversary of his father's death.","groom his third son ,secretly groom his third ,his third son jong ,former north korean leader ,groom his third","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il']",27,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4986228   0.5619489

Around noon, Japanese Ambassador to South Korea Yasumasa Nagamine is also scheduled to leave the country in a gesture of protest over the recent installation of the statue, the sources said. On Friday, Japan announced the plan to recall its diplomats ""temporarily,"" a decision which came a week after a civic group erected the statue of a girl symbolizing South Korean women sexually enslaved by Japanese forces during World War II in front of the Japanese Consulate General building in Busan.  Japan has protested the erection of the statue as a violation of the deal it signed with South Korea in December 2015 to settle the so-called comfort women issue.  Following the deal, Japan has repeatedly demanded the removal of another statue in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, but South Korea has said the fate of the civic group-erected statue is beyond the government's authority.  As the bilateral row deepened, Tokyo on Friday also announced a halt to ongoing negotiations on a currency swap agreement with South Korea and called off a high-level economic cooperation meeting.  Observers said the departure of the Japanese diplomats' will not be a drawn out affair although the date of their return to South Korea depends on future developments on the diplomatic front.","leaves korea in protest ,condemns japan wartime atrocities ,korea in protest over ,woman statue japanese ambassador ,korea in protest","['japanese', 'South Korea', 'Yasumasa Nagamine', 'japanese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Busan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Busan', 'Yasuhiro Morimoto', 'Japan', 'Busan']",27,"[ 0.          2.          2.         ... -0.2327897   0.05551665

I think it's now South Korea's turn to show sincerity in an unwavering manner,"" Abe said in a programme aired Sunday on public broadcaster NHK.The plight of the women has marred relations for decades but the governments of Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye reached an agreement in late 2015 to finally resolve it.Under that accord, which both countries described as ""final and irreversible,"" Japan offered an apology and a one-billion yen payment to surviving Korean comfort women.South Korea is expected to have a new administration following the impeachment of Park but Abe demanded the accord be honoured.""It is a matter of national credibility to implement  even if the government changes,"" he said.Critics of the accord say the deal did not go far enough in holding Japan responsible for wartime abuses during its 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula.Mainstream historians say up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea but also other parts of Asia including China, were forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War II.The statue in Busan was initially removed by local authorities after South Korean activists placed it in front of the Japanese consulate in the southern port city.But after the Japanese defence minister paid homage at Yasukuni Shrine last month -- a spot where senior convicted war criminals are honoured -- Seoul allowed the activists to put the statue back up.","tokyo wartime sex slavery ,wartime sex slavery tensions ,korea to remove statue ,in japanese military brothels ,japanese military brothels mostly","['AFP', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'South Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Busan', 'japanese']",27,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.39097592  0.01315841

He will likely return to Japan next week.`Comfort women` statue installed at the end of last year by a civic group in front the Japanese Consulate General building in in Busan Tokyo also announced a halt to the ongoing negotiations on a currency swap agreement between the two countries and the postponement of a high-level cooperation meeting.In response, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se brought in Japanese Ambassador Nagamine later in the day to deliver his concerns and the government‘s stance on the issue. In particular, the statue in Busan has become a diplomatic thorn between the two countries, as Tokyo has demanded its immediate removal. It is the second such statue installed in front of Japan’s overseas diplomatic missions, following one set up outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.A local district office first rejected the civic group‘s request to place the statue, citing concerns it could hamper transportation, but it changed its stance and allowed for its installment in the face of strong public outcry.Japan’s wartime enslavement of women in front-line brothels has been a major source of a long-standing diplomatic rift between Seoul and Tokyo. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese troops during the war.In 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a deal in which Tokyo expressed apology and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation aimed at supporting its surviving victims, euphemistically called “comfort women.”The decision was hailed by the international community as a step in the right direction given that the comfort women issue has been a long-standing obstacle to ties between the two neighboring countries. Critics, however, have demanded the deal be scrapped, saying the apology was not sincere and the government hurriedly agreed to the deal without seeking opinions from victims. Controversy is also lingering over Tokyo’s push for the statue in front of its embassy in Seoul to be removed as part of the deal. The Seoul government acknowledged that it promised to make efforts to produce a “proper resolution” on the matter, but noted it doesn’t have any authority to remove the statue, which was built by a civic group.","regret over japan action ,protest against statue recently ,ambassador in protest against ,korea expresses regret over ,expresses regret over japan","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan']",27,"[ 0.          1.          2.         ... -0.26431492  0.24986516
