The regulation covers the narrative of product slogans, company names and catchphrases spoken or written in foreign languages. When foreign languages are used, Korean subtitles should be added to offer enough information for local viewers, the agency said. The current broadcasting law states that TV commercials must use a standard language, abide by rules for Korean spelling system and loanword adaptation. It also prohibits unnecessary use of foreign languages. But there has been no specific clause stipulating the time limit for foreign languages in TV ads. “To reflect the growing use of foreign languages in TV commercials and better enforce the law, we specifically set the time limit for foreign language use in TV ads,” the agency said. In February, French cosmetic brand Christian Dior and Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo were cautioned for using all-English narrative of their products -- perfume J’adore and clothes Heattech, respectively -- in their ads that aired on cable-TV channels last year. The KCSC offered recommendations to the companies, addressing the public role of language used on TV. “The society has become more accepting of English and the use of foreign languages reflects the changing social atmosphere. But those who are not familiar with English or having difficulties in reading Korean subtitles can possibly be excluded. And a flood of foreign language use can have an impact on teenagers,” the agency said in its deliberation.According to reports from the National Institute of Korean Language obtained by Jung Jin-hoo of the minor opposition Justice Party, a total of 6,815 TV commercials and programs breached the “correct” language use rule on TV last year. Of them, 31.9 percent were caught after using unnecessary foreign languages, followed by 25. 7 percent having errors in subtitles, 10.9 percent using online words and 10.1 percent using defamatory language. But the guidelines will likely rekindle a long-held debate over the state’s restrictions on commercial freedom of expression. The controversy dates back to 2002 when the then-industry ministry suggested that the media agency allow advertisers to use foreign languages and songs in TV ads to help companies better promote their brands amid globalization. The advertisers’ association campaigned to scrap restrictions on foreign language uses in TV commercials, saying that such a ban stifles freedom of expression and creativity. It also added that the ban discourages multinational companies from promoting their image, fails to live up to global standards and fails to meet consumers’ diversifying tastes.The claims, however, triggered resistance from the Culture Ministry and Korean language advocate groups which voiced concerns over its adverse impact on Korean language and culture.  In a report by the Korea Broadcasting Advertising Corporation published in 2003, the state-run agency claimed that foreign language in TV ads could undermine the development of Korean language, enhance Korean’s perception that foreign languages are more elegant and accelerate westernization of Korean culture, the report said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","the ban discourages multinational companies ,total of 815 tv commercials ,tv advertisements are now banned ,difficulties in reading korean subtitles ,of 815 tv commercials","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Communications Standards Commission', 'korean', 'korean', 'french', 'Christian Dior', 'japanese', 'Uniqlo', 'Heattech', 'KCSC', 'korean', 'the National Institute of Korean Language', 'Jung Jin - hoo', 'Justice Party', 'the Culture Ministry', 'korean', 'the Korea Broadcasting Advertising Corporation', 'korean', 'Korean ’s', 'korean', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 1.          1.          6.         ... -0.18439598  0.30150789

2,2,Korea's childbirths edge up in Oct.,"The number of childbirths in South Korea rose in October after falling for two straight months, a government report showed Wednesday, a positive development for a country struggling with an aging population.In October, some 36,900 babies were born, up 1.1 percent from the same month last year, according to the report from Statistics Korea.The rebound follows newborn numbers falling 3.6 percent and 3.7 percent in Augu...","The number of childbirths in South Korea rose in October after falling for two straight months, a government report showed Wednesday, a positive development for a country struggling with an aging population.In October, some 36,900 babies were born, up 1.1 percent from the same month last year, according to the report from Statistics Korea.The rebound follows newborn numbers falling 3.6 percent and 3.7 percent in August and September, respectively. South Korea, whose population is expected to peak in 2030, has been trying to push up its birthrate to prevent a decline in the national workforce, which could result in more welfare expenses and damage the country's growth potential. The country has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.The statistical agency said there were no clear cut reasons for the modest gain.For the first 10 months of 2015, childbirths edged up 0.8 percent vis-a-vis 2014 to about 373,400 babies, according to the report.In 2014, 435,400 babies were born in Asia's fourth-largest economy, down 0.2 percent on-year. The drop also followed a 9.9 percent plunge in the previous year.The latest report also showed about 23,200 couples tied the knot in October, down a sharp 14.4 percent from a year earlier.The number of newlyweds is a good indicator of future childbirths as very few children are born to single-parent families here. The total number of marriages dropped 5.4 percent last year to 305,500, following a 1.3 percent contraction in 2013.For the January-October period, about 243,600 couples got married, down 1.6 percent from the same period last year.The latest findings then showed the number of divorces decreasing 2 percent on-year to about 9,800 in October. In the first 10 months of this year, the number of separations shrank 6.2 percent on-year to about 90,300.The number of deaths, meanwhile, moved up 2.2 percent on-year to some 23,100 during the month. Total deaths in the country hit229,800 as of September this year, an increase of 4 percent from a year earlier.In a separate report, the statistics office said the number of people changing their homes rose 5.9 percent on-year to about 50,000 in November. This number is down slightly from 653,000 in October.

3,3,Seoul to simplify pollution controls,"The central government will simplify the system for controlling pollution-generating facilities starting from 2017 as part of its efforts to reduce unnecessary procedural issues and lessen the burdens of businesses, officials said Tuesday.

For this, the Environment Ministry said it would integrate polution permit systems. Currently, up to 10 types of separate permissions are required to run one pollution-generating facility. The permissions range from air pollution to water quality.The new system will allow companies to submit only one online document for facility approval.“Simplifying the permission system while meticulously running it is the goal of the new rule. (The ministry) will put efforts into helping the environment and economy to coexist by ensuring the environment quality while reducing the businesses’ burden,” said Environment Minister Yoon Sung-kyu. The new move came after industry complaints grew over the complicated approval system that requires several permissions, with up to 73 kinds of paper documents. Organizations that screen the requests also differed depending on types of permission, ranging from the ministry to local-level offices, adding to the industry’s burden. Introduced in 1971, the regulation has been imposed on businesses based on a uniform standard that focuses on limiting the pollution concentration from waste water outlets or factory chimneys, overlooking businesses’ individual characteristics. This has sometimes left loopholes as it allowed some regions to be “legally” over-contaminated as only the pollution concentration levels of water outlets and chimneys were considered. Some areas with few pollution sources, on the other hand, have been overregulated. Considering the technological development and industry transformation, the industry has also voiced the need to adopt more realistic standards. The new rule, enacted Tuesday, will be gradually applied to all pollution facilities from 2017 to 2021. Existing facilities will have to receive the new integrated permit within the next four years. The facilities will be subject to permission reviews every five to eight years, the ministry said. The new scheme is expected to save about 9 billion won ($7.7 million) a year, officials said. Foreign countries have run similar schemes since the 1980s to maximize the effectiveness of the pollution facility control. Germany and the U.K. introduced it in 1980s and the European Union adopted it from the 1990s.The EU countries saved about 200 million euros a year, the EU committee said.In 2006, the OECD recommended for Korea to introduce the integrated pollution control system to raise efficacy.

The famine, which is thought to have killed some 2 million people, was caused by the North’s international isolation following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, along with bungled economic policies and flooding.Underscoring that the North’s simultaneous pursuit of nuclear armament and economic development are incompatible, the institute noted that Pyongyang would seek a way out of the dilemma the two-pronged policy has posed. One of the possible ways to address the dilemma would be to obtain its nuclear-power status, engage in direct negotiations with the U.S. and restore relations with China, its major patron and traditional ally, the institute said.To secure its nuclear-power status, the North could do something to show off technologies for nuclear fusion or uranium enrichment, which would make it difficult for the current nuclear powers states to reject Pyongyang’s claim about its nuclear armament, the institute said.Touching on the North’s seventh congress of the ruling Workers’ Party slated for next May, the institute said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is likely to use the event to declare the opening of his era that differentiates from his late father, and his vision to enhance people’s livelihoods.On the issue of the U.S.-China rivalry, the institute said that the two major powers may seek to restrain from clashing with each other, although there are possibilities that they could engage in minor confrontations.In the last year of his presidency, U.S. President Barack Obama is unlikely to put forward a strong foreign policy initiative and may focus on practical issues such as the issue of securing congressional ratification for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal involving 12 Pacific-rim nations, the institute said.China may also refrain from taking confrontational foreign policy moves as it focuses on the domestic economy, it added.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","march refers to serious famine ,the serious droughts there may ,to serious famine that struck ,serious famine that struck the ,serious famine that struck","['North Korea', 'the Asan Institute for Policy Studies', 'communist', 'North ’s', 'the Soviet Union', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Workers ’ Party', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58183432  0.36476722

In 2011, they accounted for 3.8 percent of all Korean victims, but the proportion increased to 5.1 percent last year. This was the first time the Korean government has released a report on male sexual abuse victims.Among victims reported from 2011-2014, 60 percent of them experienced sexual harassment, such as being touched inappropriately or being kissed or held in ways that caused discomfort, while 20 percent of them were raped by the abusers. The victims were abused by both males and females, including a cases of a female boss at work and a male superior while serving military duty. The report also included a case where a cab driver was forcefully and sexually assaulted by a drunk female passenger when he tried to drop her off at her destination. South Korean law currently doesn’t acknowledge same-sex rape or any forms of sexual penetration other than vaginal as rape. Accordingly, same-sex rape is defined as “rape-like” by Korean law and carries lighter penalties.According to a 2013 government survey, 70 percent of male sexual abuse victims who participated in the research said they began to harbor hatred toward random people, while 17.3 percent said they no longer felt safe.Meanwhile, 53 percent of male victims who sought help at a state-run support center said they were depressed, while 26 percent said they were experiencing anger problems.

With the law vocally opposed by an increasing number of sex workers, its efficacy has constantly been questioned. The Korea Herald is publishing a three-part series shedding light on the hidden side of Korea’s sex industry. The following is the second installment. – Ed.When Lucien Lee, a South Korean transgender woman, met her blind date back in 2012, she didn’t think it would turn into her first sex work opportunity. Her date was a man in his 30s who misunderstood their gathering as being for a mutually agreed-upon sex transaction. “He said ‘I thought we’d be going to a motel,’” the 24-year-old told The Korea Herald. “So I asked him how much he was thinking of paying me. He said 100,000 won ($85). I thought it wasn’t a bad deal. I went ahead and did it.”Lee is currently a university student majoring in law and working part-time as a self-employed sex worker while living with her parents. She is also one of many Korean sex workers who are vocally against the nation’s antiprostitution law, which criminalizes both the selling and buying of sex. As a transgender woman who is also a lesbian, Lee said the current law is based on a stereotypical notion that most sex buyers are men while sex workers are women, which does not reflect and grasp the reality of today’s sex industry in Korea where services for women and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community also exist and are thriving. She also added that the law fails to protect sex worker’s rights, especially when they are abused or exploited by their customers or employers.  Members of a group supporting women’s human rights hold an event to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the antiprostitution law in Jeonju on Sept. 24. South Korean sex workers participated in a rally in central Seoul on Sept. 23 in protest of the antiprostitution law that has criminalized the sex trade since 2004. YonhapLee, who is still legally classified as male, identifies herself as a transgender woman and a lesbian, and most of her clients are male. Some included married couples who wanted to have a threesome. “It makes the work easier for me,” Lee said. “(Having male clients while being a lesbian) eradicates the possibility that I may develop personal feelings for my clients. I would not want that.”In 2013, Lee couldn’t report to the police when she was sexually abused by a male teenager, who threatened to report her to authorities if she did not have sex with him for free. Since receiving hormone replacement therapy in 2012, she has been struggling to find other part-time jobs to support herself as a student. “As long as sex trade is illegal, sex workers cannot rely on government protection,” she said. “How can you report the abuser to the police if doing so can risk your own career and source of income?”Invisible workers and clientsPark Sung-jun (not his real name), 43, has been working as a male sex worker since the 1990s. He now runs his own sex business targeting female clients only, which he claims is one of the biggest in the country.Park’s business mainly offers massage service for women, but often includes sexual intercourse. Reservations are done via KakaoTalk -- he has more than 2,500 client phone numbers saved on four mobile phones -- and the client and her male “therapist” meet at a motel room. Sometimes, clients ask to spend all day with a specific therapist. The “therapist” can get paid for watching a movie with the client or going on a day-trip away from Seoul -- sex is just optional. Clients are from all age groups and types -- married, single, widowed and divorced.“I think women clients feel more comfortable when they pay for sex than having a one-night stand,” Park told The Korea Herald. He said women can be just as sexually curious and adventurous as men. “Many would go, ‘Oh my god, I must be crazy. What am I doing?’ after having sex with a stranger. But there’s something about paying money for sex. It’s just a service you paid for. You don’t’ feel as bad about yourself. And once you become close with the therapist, you want to pay for the emotional intimacy.”Like Lee, Park said the current antiprostitution law fails to grasp the reality of the industry by assuming that all buyers are men and workers are women. He claimed that a significant number of clients in the industry -- about 50 percent -- are couples asking for a threesome. Sometimes the men only choose to watch while his partner has sex with the sex worker. During the interview, he showed a text message inquiring about threesome services. “I want to give something special to my wife on our wedding anniversary,” it said.Park explained there is also an industry that only targets lesbians and gays that is booming behind closed doors. Once, Park had a lesbian client who wanted to try having sex with a man only to confirm her sexual orientation. In person, Park showed how easy it is to find such services online through local search engines by using simple search terms such as “massage for women” and “women only,” which are in fact secret words for sex services for women by female workers. “Most people don’t know these sites are for sex services because ‘massage for women’ doesn’t sound like anything sex-related,” he said. “If the government is really determined to end sex trade in the country, I think the only way to do it is to ban the Internet. But of course, that’s impossible.”Park said male sex workers working for male clients are practically invisible to the authorities, who “simply don’t guess” that men can be involved in sex work targeting gay men or women. “That’s why male sex workers targeting gay men work at off-line brothels -- whereas every other service involving women workers or clients is arranged online and takes place in motels -- because they don’t have to worry about crackdowns,” Park said. “The authorities don’t think there is any sex trade going on when there is no woman in the building.”When approached by The Korea Herald, the Gender Equality Ministry seemed to be unware of the existence of the nation’s sex industry targeting the LGBT community.Lee Jung-ki, a senior inspector at the ministry’s Women’s & Youth’ Rights Promotion Bureau said it’s “hard to imagine” that sex workers targeting gay men exist. “I can imagine gay men dating,” he said. “But it’s hard to imagine that such an industry targeting gay men exists.”Sex work as laborPrior to receiving her hormone replacement therapy, Lucien Lee had worked part-time for a parcel delivery company. As a dock loader, she would take a bus at 6 p.m. to Daejeon, where the distribution center was located, and load thousands of parcels to trucks for delivery. Food was provided by the company, but Lee doesn’t remember having any good meals there. “The bean sprout soup had no bean sprouts in it. It was just water,” she said. The work was hard. She could barely find a moment to sit and rest at work, which usually lasted until 8 a.m. the next day. For about nine hours of labor, she was paid 80,000 won. For her first sex work, which took just a few hours, she was paid 100,000 won. As of this year, Korea’s minimum wage stands at 5,580 won an hour. After receiving hormone replacement therapy, getting a part-time job has become even more difficult for Lee due to her sexual identity. She appears to be and identifies herself as a woman, but she’s still a male according to her legal documents including her ID. Legally changing one’s gender in South Korea can be costly and tedious, as it requires medical operations that are not covered by the national health insurance. Lee hasn’t filed her request to the court yet.According to a 2006 report on human rights conditions on South Korean transgenders, written by local nongovernmental organizations, the vast majority of MTF (male to female) Korean transgender people work in the “entertainment industry” or as temporary or part-time workers.“I think working in the ‘entertainment industry’ practically means working as sex workers,” said Lee. “Even if you work at bars, if you don’t go to the ‘second rounds,’ which means sex service, the chances are you won’t even get paid the minimum wage.”Professor Kim Yong-hwa at Sookmyung Women’s University, who claims the law should be revised so that sex workers should not be punished while sex trade should still be banned, said prostitution ruins a woman’s dignity and sense of morality. In her report submitted to the Women’s Human Rights Commission of Korea, she defined South Korea’s sex industry as a “market serving men.” “The reason prostitution (of women) continues to exist is because the demand from men never goes away,” she wrote in her report. “But prostitution violates women’s human rights and diminishes a society’s moral character.”The Korean government stands firm on its stance that the commercial sex trade cannot be legal. Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung said earlier this year sex was “something that cannot be sold and bought.”Lee said sex work deserve to be recognized as labor. “I think many (Korean) women politicians who claim themselves as feminists grew up in a life of privilege,” she said, adding that sex trade should be legalized with due government regulations. “I don’t know what ruins one’s dignity more -- sex work or living without a job or not being paid minimum wage while being a contract worker. Some say all sex workers are forced to work as sex workers. But when you think about it, who isn’t forced to work? Most people work not because they enjoy it, but because it pays and they need to survive. This applies to every job, not just sex work.”Potential danger According to Park, being a male sex worker isn’t easy. It often requires smashing Viagra pills into powder and mixing it with sports drinks. The drink the concoction before work to make sure they can satisfy the clients. “It’s tough work,” he said. “It’s about being professional -- treating clients with the utmost care and making sure they get what they want from you.”While his business is also illegal according to the current law, Park claimed that by not recognizing women as sex trade clients, the authorities are failing to see potentially more serious crime cases in the industry.“I make sure my workers get tested for STDs every week,” he said. “Once one of them tested positive, I made sure I informed every single client who received services from him. I think that’s the ethical way of doing business. But I’m not sure if other people involved in this business do what I do.”Aside from sexually transmitted diseases, he has also heard of male sex workers taking video footage of the clients’ bodies while giving a back massage. He’s even heard of a case where a sex worker used his client’s personal information for blackmail to get more money.  Park also heard a number of cases where the “therapist” end up raping the client by not controlling his own sex drive, when the client actually only wanted a massage.“The world has changed so much,” he said. “I don’t know why so many government policies are all still so male-oriented.”By Claire Lee and Suk Gee-hyun(dyc@heraldcorp.com) (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)","of many korean sex workers ,criminalized the sex trade since ,korean women politicians who claim ,south korean transgender woman met ,sex trade since 2004 yonhaplee","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Lucien Lee', 'south korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Jeonju', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'YonhapLee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'KakaoTalk', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'LGBT', 'Lee Jung - ki', 'the ministry ’s Women ’s & Youth ’ Rights Promotion Bureau', 'Lucien Lee', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'South Korea', 'Lee', 'south korean', 'MTF', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Kim Yong - hwa', 'Sookmyung Women ’s University', 'the Women ’s Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'korean', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'korean', 'Park', 'Park', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 1.          0.          4.         ... -0.65699381  0.3378993

So our ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff plan to advance the joint operations scheme with the U.S.”During the conference, the ministry also floated plans to step up its readiness against Pyongyang’s potential terrorist attacks next year. In a related development, Seoul and Washington plan to launch joint tabletop exercises in 2016 as part of their efforts to bolster their cyber and space warfare capabilities against the communist state. “Our military will maintain a firm readiness posture to deter and adamantly respond to North Korea’s various provocations including its threats of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction,” the ministry said in a statement. “The ministry and the JCS will meanwhile upgrade their integrated regional operational posture in preparation against its simultaneous and complex terror attacks.” During a discussion session, some senior military official raised the need for abolishing the statute of limitations for defense industry-related crimes, calling them “unpatriotic acts” and urging “harsh punishment,” a ministry official said. The military, the Navy in particular, has in recent months been reeling from a string of graft scandals involving former and incumbent commanders, sparking public criticism and calls for sweeping reform.Defense Minister Han Min-koo, for his part, urged the commanders to make utmost efforts to regain public confidence in the face of the ongoing furor over the wrongdoings, a series of shooting rampages and other tragic accidents within barracks. “The static value of our military is to win a war against the enemy under any circumstance,” he was quoted as saying by ministry officials. “We have to make a military that is not only trusted by the people but also respected by them.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","terrorist attacks next year in ,terrorist attacks next year ,band last weekend in china ,potential terrorist attacks next year ,submarine next year the country","['North Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Moranbong Band', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'North Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'Kim Min -', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'North Korea ’s', 'JCS', 'Navy', 'Han Min - koo']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95114088  0.67617369

The boat service cancellation rate for Heuksan, located 97 kilometers southwest of the port of Mokpo, stands at around 13 percent per year.The government expects to spend 580.5 billion won ($499.1 million) on building the airport for Ulleung and 183.5 billion won on Heuksan.The ministry said that the airports will both have one 1,200-meter-long, 30-meter-wide runway and will be able to accommodate 50-seat propeller-powered regional passenger planes such as the ATR-42 and Q300. Bidding for the Ulleung airport construction will be completed by the end of this year, while competition to build the Heuksan airport will be held early next year.""Heuksan airport will be opened in 2020, with Ulleung to follow a year later,"" the ministry said.The opening of the airports, meanwhile, is expected to not only help people living on the islands, but promote local tourism. Travelers visiting Ulleung could reach 925,000 in 2030 from 460,000 in 2013, with numbers for Heuksan expected to rise from 360,000 to 883,000 in the same period.The ministry said that because these islands are in key locations in the East and Yellow seas, direct flights can allow the government to keep closer tabs on illegal fishing and facilitate search and rescue operations in the event of accidents.

Lee Ju-yeol said in a monthly meeting with economic experts here.  The central bank governor has repeatedly pointed to problems stemming from China's slowing economic growth that has been blamed for a dip in South Korea's own exports.  China is by far the world's single largest importer of South Korean goods, accounting for over 25 percent of South Korea's overall exports last year. South Korea's exports have fallen every single month since the start of the year, plunging 15.8 percent on-year in October.  Lee said problems for South Korean exports coming from China may be more permanent than previously believed.  ""If we say China's slowing economic growth due to sluggish demand is a macroeconomic risk, the narrowing gap between the competitiveness of South Korean and Chinese firms is a micro risk,"" he said at the breakfast meeting.  Growing competition from Chinese companies in the global market has long been an issue for South Korean firms, while further improvements by Chinese competitors will certainly eat into South Korean exports.  The BOK chief urged local companies to boost their investment in research and development to help prevent such cases, while also calling on the local government to create and improve a business environment that promotes investment.  ""India is fast becoming a new growth engine of Asia. And we need to pay attention to the fact that India's recent rise has been made possible by a bold move (by the Indian government) to remove all unnecessary regulations hampering investment not only by local companies but also by foreign investors,"" he said. In a report released Monday, the state-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade said South Korean manufacturers currently have an average 3.3-year technological lead over their Chinese counterparts, down from 3.7 years in 2011.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government requested the Defense Ministry and Transport Ministry simplify the approvals process for drone use in cases to be used for monitoring the city’s traffic status, officials said. Under current rules, flying drones over 12 kilograms requires a permit from the Seoul Regional Aviation Administration. Regardless of the weight, taking pictures with drones or flying them in flight-restricted areas also needs approval from the Defense Ministry for each flight. Flying drones over 150 meters high, at night and dropping objects are strictly prohibited. Seoul City has been using drones under 12 kilograms for monitoring and analyzing the traffic status and checking traffic facilities.Because most parts of the capital are flight-restricted areas, the city has to submit an approval request a half month before each use of a drone, the officials said. Flights are prohibited from traveling above most areas in Seoul north of the Hangang River, while flights south of the river are restricted based on occasion. A Defense Ministry official must also be present at the drone-flying site.“The strict drone rule is understandable as it involves public security. Applying the same regulations for private drones to public-purpose drones, however, often delays the project time due to trivial administrative works,” a Seoul City official told The Korea Herald. “If the government grants approval for a certain period, not for each time, it will greatly simplify the work,” he added. Seoul City has been active in utilizing drones in various sectors. In August, the city vowed to adopt drones in search and rescue operations at disaster scenes. It is currently running two drones in the fire and disaster department on a trial basis, authorities said.

The suspects were among more than 900 people who were detained in a six-month nationwide crackdown on Internet and telephone fraud scams that typically steal victims' money through fake websites where they are asked for personal or financial information.A statement released by China's public security ministry on Thursday said that the 31 suspects from South Korea and China were recently arrested for allegedly stealing financial information from South Korean victims through a so-called ""phishing"" scam. Such scams send e-mails to victims to lure them to fake websites that ask for personal passwords and security codes. Then, the information was used to conduct financial transactions in the victims' names.Victims lost ""more than 3 million yuan (US$469,356) per week"" through the Internet fraud ring in Yanbian, the statement said, citing ""preliminary statistics."" The statement did not say exactly how many South Korean nationals were arrested and officials at the Chinese ministry were not immediately available for comments. The Chinese town of Yanbian, where ethnic Koreans account for about 30 percent of the population, is located near the sensitive border with North Korea. State-run China Daily newspaper reported on Friday that the Chinese authorities started investigating the Internet fraud ring in Yanbian ""after receiving evidence from police in South Korea.""

Meanwhile, only 14.1 percent of girls had the same health condition.The gender disparity in Korea was significantly high considering the OECD average for childhood obesity was 24.3 percent for boys and 22.1 percent for girls.  YonhapLocal experts pointed out that Korea’s popular culture and social pressure on young girls may play a factor in the statistics. The only country that had a higher gender disparity in obesity than South Korea among the OECD was Poland, where 21.2 percent of male children were obese while only 8.5 percent of their female counterparts were experiencing the same condition. “I think young girls are more conscious about their body image than their male counterparts,” said researcher Kim Min-jeong from the Korea Health Promotion Foundation. “While the number of obese male schoolchildren has been increasing in recent years, the same did not happen among young girls.”While avoiding obesity is important for all teenagers regardless of gender, local studies previously showed that more than 90 percent of Korean bulimia patients were women. According to a 2013 study by the National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, a total of 1,796 Koreans sought medical help for the eating disorder that year. Among them, 93.9 percent, 1,684 people, were women, while only 6.2 percent were men.About 70 percent of the female bulimia patients were in their 20s and 30s. The study, whose coauthors included a psychiatrist, suggested that the country’s strong emphasis on young women’s personal appearance may be linked to the statistics. Meanwhile, obesity has emerged as a major health threat in Korea in recent years. According to a study released by the National Health Insurance Service in August, the number of obese Koreans -- those with a BMI of 30 or above -- accounted for 4.2 percent of the entire population in 2012, up from 2.5 percent in 2002. One in 17 South Koreans will be obese in 2025 if the current trend continues, the report said.

Other co-sponsors included South Korea, the United States, Britain, Australia and Germany, according to the resolution.The nine-page draft is largely similar to the landmark resolution that was adopted at last year's General Assembly with a call for referring the North's human rights situation to the ICC for the first time. Just like last year's resolution, this year's also calls for the ICC referral.""The General Assembly ... encourages the Security Council to continue its consideration of the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the commission of inquiry and take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of the referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court,"" the resolution said. The resolution also calls for ""effective targeted sanctions against those who appear to be most responsible for acts that the commission has said may constitute crimes against humanity"" and encourages the Security Council to continue discussions and active engagement on the issue.The proposed resolution is expected to be put to a vote at the Third Committee later this month, sometime between Nov. 16-20. If approved by the committee, it is expected to be formally adopted at the General Assembly next month.The move to adopt a new resolution is expected to anger North Korea.But chances are not high for the Security Council to actually refer the issue to the ICC because China and Russia, which have friendlier ties with North Korea than any other countries, are expected to veto such a move. Still the resolution played a great role in drawing international attention to the issue.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year, with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses taking place in the country.

Founded in 1968 in the wake of the Biafra Famine in Nigeria, the organization has marked its presence in all of the world’s major crises since, tackling poverty, epidemics, broken sanitation situations and natural disasters. “Our work is driven by our humanitarian identity and commitment to address extreme poverty,” the Concern Worldwide CEO Dominic MacSorley said at a reception at the Irish ambassador’s residence in Seoul in end-October. “We respond effectively to emergencies to save lives and alleviate suffering, respect people’s dignity and strengthen community-building and community-preparedness against future disasters.” (From left) Concern Worldwide Korea country manager Lee Jun-mo, Concern CEO Dominic MacSorley, Irish Ambassador Aingeal O’ Donoghue, Concern overseas director Paul O’ Brien and the ambassador’s spouse Peter R. Bullen at the ambassador’s residence on Oct. 29. The Irish EmbassyThe Concern operates in 27 of the world’s least developed countries with support from offices in Dublin, London, Belfast, New York, Chicago and now Seoul. Employing over 3,300 workers and spending over $160 million annually, it reached out to more than 7.4 million distressed people around the world last year. At present, the Concern is providing assistance in Turkey, Lebanon, Nepal, Afghanistan, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, as well as North Korea, where it has provided food, water and sanitation services since 1998, with support from the Ministry of Unification. The Concern has also worked in war-torn Syria, typhoon-hit Philippines and Ebola-stricken West Africa. A key part of its mission lies in supporting education, boosting local agricultural production and providing health care and nutrition to women and children. “Famine is ingrained on the Irish nation as we had our own famine in the mid-1800s, where over a million people died and another million emigrated,” MacSorley said. “Those events have remained a key part of being Irish and Concern. We empathize with those who are hungry and respond to their needs.” As both Ireland and Korea have experienced colonization, wars, conflict and poverty, and similarly overcome their hardships through economic development, the two countries should also help others experiencing difficulties, by supporting the aid programs, he added.

China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Friday that the upcoming talks would have a ""great significance to upholding the tranquility and stability of the relevant waters and consolidating and growing bilateral friendly cooperation."" ""It is hoped that China and the ROK can fairly and properly resolve the overlapping claims of maritime rights and interests through amicable consultations and set a good example for regional countries in addressing similar issues,"" Hua said, without saying the exact date of the talks.In November 2013, China drew concerns by declaring an air defense zone over the East China Sea that overlapped with South Korea's own air defense zone and Ieodo. Ieodo is located 149 kilometers southwest of Korea's southernmost island of Marado and 247 kilometers northeast of the nearest Chinese island Tongdao.","sea boundaries next month china ,between seoul and beijing president ,china have held annual discussions ,next month china foreign ministry ,beijing president park geun hye","['South Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park Geun', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Ieodo', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Ieodo', 'South Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Hua Chunying', 'China', 'ROK', 'Hua', 'China', ""South Korea 's"", 'Ieodo', 'Korea', 'Marado', 'chinese', 'Tongdao']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.97187036  0.72770339

As of last year 341 Chinese boats have been caught breaking rules.The latest understanding comes after Seoul took flak for not including an IUU clause in the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) inked earlier in the year.The two sides have been operating a joint fisheries committee for years and there has been a steady decline in illegal fishing activities by Chinese fishermen operating in South Korea's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), although unauthorized operations have yet to be fully controlled. This has hurt the amount of fish caught by South Korean fishermen.Under the latest deal, South Korean authorities will raise the fines they slap on Chinese fishing vessels that violated rules to 300 million won (US$263,400) from 200 million won, and also have the option to directly confiscate the catch from Chinese fishermen instead of handing the matter over to Chinese authorities.In addition, the country will create a database on repeated offenders and provide it to China so they can take necessary action. The two countries then concurred on the creation of a sea check point through which all fishing vessels must cross after catching fish that will make it easier for officials to check if rules were followed.The Chinese side, moreover, agreed to better regulate fishing boats that operate in North Korean waters near the sea demarcation line with South Korea. Such boats have trespassed into waters controlled by South Korea to catch fish and then flee over the demarcation line if they are found to be operating illegally. ""In the past there was nothing South Korea could do about these boats,"" an official said.Besides these measures, South Korea plans to develop a electronic permit system that can be attached to ships operating in South Korean EEZ that will allow authorities to check their identity without having to see paper documents that can be easily forged.The ministry, meanwhile, said Seoul and Beijing agreed on the annual fishing quota within their respective EEZs for 2016 that is unchanged from this year.Under the deal, 1,600 Chinese boats can enter South Korea's EEZ and catch 60,000 tons of fish, while the same number of South Korean ships can do the same in the Chinese waters. South Korean boats, however, rarely venture into the Chinese zone because of low fish stocks caused by excessive fishing.

Increased movement of people and vehicles has recently been spotted at the Punggye site, along with hints of construction work for a new tunnel, the official said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. No signs of an immediate blast were detected, however, he added. Pyongyang carried out three rounds of underground experiments there ― in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The South Korean government declined to confirm the news, citing intelligence. “We are closely monitoring North Korea’s nuclear activities in cooperation with the U.S. and other related countries,” Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said at a press briefing. The new construction activities came as Seoul gears up for its first trilateral summit with China and Japan under President Park Geun-hye on Sunday.

The four countries are members of the stalled six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing North Korea.

North Korea needs a minimum of 5.4 million tons of food to feed its people.The average food shortage per year has been around 400,000 to 500,000 tons under Kim's regime, he said.His claims are based on the assumption that North Korea's crop production may fall 10 percent in 2015 on-year.Earlier this year, North Korea grappled with what it called its worst drought in 100 years.A decline in an import of crops by the North from China was also cited as the cause for North Korea's bigger food shortage, he said.In the January-September period, North Korea imported around 38,000 tons of crops from China, down 30 percent from a year earlier, amid the long-frayed Pyongyang and Beijing ties.A U.N. report showed in April that about 70 percent of North Korea's 24.6 million people are suffering due to food shortages and 1.8 million, including children and pregnant women, are in need of nutritional food supplies aimed at fighting malnutrition.

They are united with their mothers for breast-feeding and other bonding time. The schedule for the mothers, who often seek the service to ensure they can rest for about a week after giving birth, includes facials, body massages, and child care classes. A mother (left) looks at her newborn at a hospital in Seoul. Many young mothers in Korea choose to go to postpartum centers right after they are discharged from hospitals. (File Photo/ The Korea Herald)The Health Ministry said it will now encourage the centers to place mothers and their newborns together, and discourage them to house a large number of babies in the same room all at once. “This system in which many babies are staying with one another in the same room, has been making newborns vulnerable to possible infection,” said the ministry in a statement. “Starting soon, all babies will be required to be kept at least 90 centimeters from each other in the same room.”Health authorities also said that the current system at the centers, in which mothers and babies stay in separate rooms, goes against the World Health Organization’s recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and the newborn. The WHO guidelines specifically mention that the mother and baby “should not be separated and should stay in the same room 24 hours a day,” and mothers “should be counseled on hygiene, especially hand washing.”According to data from the Health Ministry, the number of postnatal centers increased from 488 in 2011 to 602 this year. Meanwhile, the number of newborn children who have developed infectious diseases while staying at such centers has increased dramatically, from 49 in 2013 to 264 so far this year. Three mothers and three caregivers were also infected while staying in such facilities this year.As of this year, 68.8 percent of new Korean mothers opt to stay at postnatal centers instead of home after their deliveries. The centers are especially sought by women whose family members are not available to help with their postpartum care. Yet 122 centers, about 20 percent of all facilities nationwide, were reported to the authorities for hiring unqualified nurses, while 113 of them faced disciplinary action for not educating their staff on infectious disease control and prevention as required, from 2013-2015.The Health Ministry said all staff who work at such centers are now required to receive education on infectious disease control, and must be vaccinated for a total of five infectious viruses that are prevalent in such centers before being hired. The viruses are: hepatitis A, influenza, varicella, Corynebacterium diphtheria and measles. They will also soon be required to wear facial masks all times when working and interacting with babies.All visitors of mothers will be banned from seeing babies, and will be only allowed to meet the parent. Any center that has been affected by an infectious disease outbreak will be shut down permanently if the center is proven to be responsible for the outbreak by not following the rules, the Health Ministry said.

To survive what has become the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, over 5 million children need food, water and shelter before the winter.A delegation from the United Nations Children’s Fund visited Korea last week to secure much-needed support from the government, companies and citizens.  Members of UNICEF and Korea’s National Assembly pose at a roundtable meeting at the National Assembly last Monday.

Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“Over the last few months, the world shared grief over the plight of Middle Eastern and North African refugees, particularly the dead 3-year-old Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi on a Turkish beach,” Yoka Brandt, the UNICEF deputy executive director, told the National Assembly members on Oct. 19. The waves of refugees into Europe, projected to reach 900,000 by next year, are merely the tip of the iceberg, she claimed, as 12 million people are dislocated in and around Syria. Behind these numbers, “people have terrible stories to tell ― witnessing and being victims of unimaginable violence, losing family, starving and being deprived of education,” according to her. As of now, 2 million children in Syria are out of school, as 1 out of 4 schools was destroyed and 50,000 teachers were either killed or displaced. Only 1 in 3 hospitals is still open.“Given the lack of water and basic services,” she added, “the perils of the coming winter will most negatively affect children.”To help relieve the crises, exacerbated by intensifying American and Russian air strikes, UNICEF says it needs $14 million in aid, of which $6.5 million would be used in the next 6 months. Members of UNICEF and Korea’s National Assembly pose at a roundtable meeting at the National Assembly last Monday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldThe Korean government, working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Unification and the Korea International Cooperation Agency, contributed around $25 million separately in 2013 and 2014. The Korean Committee for UNICEF last year raised $88 million from individuals, firms and foundations.Hanna Singer, UNICEF Syria representative, emphasized that the water supply in Syria had halved since the conflict began, and diseases such as polio, hepatitis A and typhoid have resurfaced. “Water is being used as a weapon by armed opposition groups,” she lamented, noting that water was unavailable for 41 straight days in summer to the detriment of 2.1 million people in Aleppo. UNICEF adopts dual approaches to administer water, sanitation and hygiene services, dubbed “WASH.”The first objective aims at trucking 10 million liters of water and disinfectant daily, and the second objective works to enhance resilience by rehabilitating groundwater wells and supply networks. “Our motto is to stay and deliver, despite the mortal dangers,” Singer said, mentioning her late colleague Mohammed Khalaf, who was killed two weeks ago in Raqqa delivering immunization services. “I pay tribute to him through this work.”Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com) Members of UNICEF and Korea’s National Assembly pose at a roundtable meeting at the National Assembly last Monday.

The OECD report assessed various aspects of well-being, including health status to work-life balance, asking OECD populations to rate their lives on a scale of 0-10, from “worst” to “best.” The older Koreans got, the less they were happy with their lives, with those aged between 15 and 29 being the most satisfied with a score of 6.32. South Korea scored the lowest in terms of perceived social network support, meaning that Koreans on average feel lonely and isolated in society without anyone to rely on. Koreans were also the least content with their health status. But Asia’s No. 4 economy saw an increase of 12.3 percent in its household income between 2010 and 2013, the biggest jump in the OECD bloc, with its job security and housing affordability being comparatively high.

Cho is one of the most-wanted conmen in South Korea, having allegedly scammed up to 50,000 people out of an estimated 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in a pyramid marketing scheme.Cho Hee-pal (Yonhap)The 58-year-old established a medical equipment supply company and ran 10 leasing branches to lure potential investors with false promises of high returns on their capital between 2004 and 2008. Amid the burgeoning probe into the pyramid scam, Cho and his aides fled to China in 2008. In 2012, the South Korean police announced that he had died of a heart attack while being taken to a hospital from a hotel in Qingdao, China. But doubts have lingered over his death, with victims claiming that Cho faked his own death to dodge the police probe and public scrutiny. Fresh testimony, revealed by a local media outlet Tuesday, raised the possibility that his death was fabricated. A 47-year-old man claiming to have been a key aide to Cho said that he had talked to him over the phone several times, the last time being in late 2013. The man, surnamed Choi, served an eight-month jail term on charges of hiding Cho, but moved to China with the fugitive. According to his testimony, Cho underwent plastic surgery to change his face upon arriving in China. He also allegedly tried to remove his fingerprints, though that was unsuccessful. Cho also reportedly has several girlfriends in Korea delivering money for him to live in China. He allegedly carries a handgun in his pocket at all times and spends most of his time playing golf and drinking alcohol. Cho is claimed to have lived in Yantai, just one and a half hour’s flight from Incheon, disguised as 53-year-old Korean-Chinese Cho Young-bok, or Cao Yongfu, since 2008. His death was backed by several pieces of evidence, such as a death certificate issued by Chinese authorities, medical records written by Chinese doctors and video footage of his funeral service in China. But victims argued that Cho might have bribed Chinese government officials to obtain falsified documents to prove his death. They also questioned the videotape, as it is rare to record funerals in Korea. There have also been speculations that the police hastily announced Cho’s death without confirming the facts at the time to defend senior prosecutors and police officers involved in the fraud case. So far, six senior police officials and prosecutors were convicted of accepting kickbacks from Cho in return for leniency in the investigations into his fraud scheme.With Kang’s return, the prosecution is expected to speed up the probe into whether Cho is still alive, his hidden assets and alleged big-scale collusion between investigators and Cho.Kang Tae-yong, Cho’s No. 2 man in the pyramid scheme, was apprehended by the Chinese police at his residence in Jinangsu Province on Saturday, seven years after he escaped to China. He allegedly took charge of the company’s finances and lobbying investigators.Kang is expected to be extradited to Korea as early as this weekend. As the suspect might keep mum about Cho, the prosecution plans to focus on tracing Cho’s false bank accounts and flow of his assets. It has already found 120 billion won under Cho’s false bank accounts.

The Agency for Defense Development acknowledged that the device disappeared from its office in Moscow last October. The equipment, last used in June 2014, is attached to a fax machine and designed to encode plain text and decipher encrypted messages.  (Yonhap)The Defense Ministry immediately instructed the institute last February to cease the use of the gear across the board, collecting them and changing their passcodes, officials said, adding that there have not been any breaches of crucial data. The Daejeon-based think tank runs its office in three countries and the Moscow unit opened in 2011. “The military has retrieved all units of the same model that had been used overseas and taken steps to alter the cryptographic program and encryption keys,” ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “As of now, no encoding gadgets are operating abroad other than those installed at the military attache’s offices, and we plan to reinforce security checks so as to prevent a recurrence of such an incident.” Wary of a possible intelligence breach, the National Intelligence Office, Defense Security Command and Defense Intelligence Agency have launched a probe into the device’s vanishing. The ADD also levied a one-month salary cut on a security manager as a penalty for his lax oversight. Officials said the security manager frequently goes on business trips. But concerns persist as the whereabouts of the machine and mastermind and background of the incident remain in the dark, and no related investigation has been carried out on the spot. “The machine was mobilized only three times over the last three years ― all in 2014 ― and there is absolutely no possibility for a leak because once you open it, a sensor prompts the decryption key to be deleted,” another ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. “Given the sensitivity of the issue, we had to be cautious not to cause any diplomatic problems.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","monday to have lost fax ,lost fax encryption system in ,institute last february to cease ,fax encryption system in russia ,lost fax encryption system","['South Korea ’s', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Defense Ministry', 'Daejeon', 'Moscow', 'Kim Min -', 'the National Intelligence Office', 'Defense Security Command', 'Defense Intelligence Agency', 'ADD', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.4199636   0.12453898

The Nenskra Hydro Power Plant is a $1 billion project that came out of years of negotiations involving Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-Water), Georgian government, Georgian State Electricity System and its commercial operator, which recently signed an implementation agreement. The package encompasses the project’s implementation, power purchase agreement and other related enclosed contracts. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili, Georgian Vice Premier and Energy Minister Kakhi Kaladze, the Korean ambassador to Georgia and top executives of K-Water and Salini Impregilo attended a groundbreaking ceremony on Sept. 16. The project will be completed by 2021 by Italian construction company Salini Impregilo, and financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Asian Development Bank and Korea Export-Import Bank.

No new cases have been reported since July 4, with the last person to have contracted the illness testing negative for the virus early this month.The MERS outbreak prompted foreign tourists, especially Chinese, to cancel their visits to South Korea in droves, pounding the local tourism and retail sectors.The agency also said the number of Japanese visitors, which is expected to sink 19.2 percent on-year in 2015 due to MERS, will likely recover next year and reach 2.2 million in 2019.Considerably more visitors from Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam are expected starting in 2016 thanks to the high popularity of South Korean pop culture in those countries, the KTO said.

Shim Jae-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party, the nation’s fertility rate, which stands at 1.21 children per woman this year, in fact decreased from 2006 -- 1.25 children per woman. The number of newborns also dropped from 448,200 in 2006 to 435,300 this year, according to the lawmaker.The budget for the policies, however, increased significantly over the nine years. The government allocated 14.7 trillion won for its policies to encourage parents to have children this year, which is about seven times larger than the budget of 2.1 trillion won in 2006. The policies implemented since 2006 include child care allowance for all parents with young children up to age of 2 years, more after-school programs for children of double-income households, and encouraging employers to grant maternity leave for their female workers. Some experts have said that one of the biggest reasons behind the policy failure is the lack of programs for young, single Koreans who are forced to put off marriage and having children because of expensive housing and limited job security. Gender inequality in the nation’s labor force has also been also pointed out. According to Rep. Min Hyun-joo of the ruling Saenuri Party, some 260,000 women were fired from their work while taking their maternity leave in the last five years.The government expects that the nation’s military would be short of 84,000 soldiers by 2030, and the health care cost for the elderly would result in a deficit of 47.7 trillion won ($44 billion) in the national health insurance fund in the same year, if the current fertility rate continues.

Among firefighters, a total of 104 were killed.     Investigations into the Aug. 12 blasts at the Ruihai International Logistics warehouses showed they were located closer to homes than permitted, and stored much more hazardous material than authorized, including 700 tons of highly toxic sodium cyanide.     A series of massive explosions late at night shattered windows and tore facades off buildings for kilometers (miles) around, while launching debris including heavy steel storage canisters into nearby communities with the force of an artillery shell. Disgruntled homeowners have held numerous angry protests demanding the government buy back their apartments, saying they are unlivable.    The disaster has raised questions about corruption and government efficiency, potentially tarnishing the communist government led by President Xi Jinping, who has made those two issues a hallmark of his administration.     Authorities are investigating malfeasance in the issuing of permits and regulation of the company, and have detained 12 of its employees and executives. They include the primary owner, who was on the board of a state-owned company and kept his ownership of Ruihai hidden as a silent partner.     Also detained as part of the investigation are 11 government officials, while the head of the government body in charge of industrial safety, Yang Dongliang, has been placed under investigation for corruption.     Yang had previously worked for 18 years in Tianjin in state industry and local government, rising to executive vice mayor.     Authorities say they have sealed all waterways leading out of the blast zone to curb cyanide contamination as teams in hazmat suits clean up hazardous debris.     According to the Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau, water samples inside the disaster zone have shown levels of cyanide as high as 20 times above that considered safe. No cyanide has been detected in nearby seawater or areas outside the 3-kilometer (1.8-mile ) radius quarantine zone.

Korea’s post-transfer Gini index -- the income inequality rate after social security transfers have been made -- marked 30.8 percent, ranking 18th among the 30 advanced economies. Notably, Korea’s pre-transfer Gini index marked second lowest among the advanced nations. The post-transfer index is only 2.8 percentage points lower than its pre-transfer index, meaning the nation’s distribution of income is likely to be unequal.  (Yonhap)“Corruption (in Korea) is another area of concern, allowing those with power in various domains to extract rents,” the report said, adding that home and financial ownership in Korea are notably low while social protection, including health care, remains “quite limited.”“By underexploiting this lever, Korea goes from having one of the most equal income distributions before transfer to a much less equal one after transfers and taxes compared with other advanced economies.”Public transfer payments, such as unemployment benefits and social retirement benefits, are made to disproportionately benefit and support those with the lowest incomes. Also, under most tax systems worldwide, those with high incomes pay proportionately higher income taxes than the low-income earners. The system, if it works correctly, narrows the gap between the rich and the poor and reduces income inequality. The rates shown in the WEF report, however, show that Korea’s tax and transfer systems are failing to reduce inequality substantially. For example, the country currently does not run a state-run unemployment assistance program, which makes the unemployed vulnerable to poverty and social isolation. Meanwhile, Norway and Sweden had some of the lowest post-transfer Gini index among the 30 countries. Norway’s post-transfer index was 24.4 percent, significantly lower than its pre-transfer index which stood at 44.8 percent. Sweden’s post-transfer index, at 23.6 percent, was also notably lower than its pre-transfer index at 48 percent, meaning its distribution of income through tax and public transfers is relatively more equal than other countries. “It is imperative to provide opportunities for the poor and vulnerable to access education, health, and other basic services which can improve their human capital,” the report said. Korea also belonged to the most corrupt 20 percent of the 30 advanced countries, with a poverty rate -- the proportion of those who belong to the less than half of the respective median national income -- of 14.6 percent. Its poverty rate was also one of the highest among the 30 nations.

According to a report by the Korean Smokers’ Association submitted to Rep. Yoon Ho-joong of the main opposition New Politics Alliance of Democracy, the number of cigarette packs sold in July stood at just over 350 million, close to the average monthly sales over the past three years, 362 million. (Yonhap)Tobacco sales more than halved to 170 million packs in January, compared to the same period a year earlier, after the government raised tobacco prices by 2,000 won ($1.70) per pack from 2,500 won to 4,500 won on New Year’s Day.The 80 percent price hike came as part of the government’s efforts to lower the nation’s smoking rate amid public health concerns. South Korea has one of the highest male smoking rates among OECD countries at 43.7 percent, according to the Health Ministry.But the figures have gradually bounced back, with sales increasing from 240 million in March to 270 million in May and 350 million in July, the report said.The recovering sales, coupled with the accompanying rise in tax revenues, rekindled a debate over whether the government‘s price hike was to benefit the nation’s health or to collect more taxes. According to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the government secured an extra 1.2 trillion won in tax payments in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. “The government stressed that the price hike was aimed at promoting public health, not at reaping tax revenues, but it only resulted in putting more burden on smokers,” said Rep. Yoon.“The authorities cannot get away from criticism that it raised the cigarette price to make up for the shortfall in last year’s tax revenues,” the lawmaker added. The government has been increasing its antismoking campaigns in recent years, including its push for a bill that makes it obligatory for tobacco-makers to display word and image warnings on cigarette packs. The passage of the antismoking bill finally came earlier this year, after 11 attempts since its first try in 2002. It would deter Koreans from smoking by highlighting the dangers through pictorial warning labels required to cover more than half of the cigarette packs. Lawbreakers could face up to a year in jail or 10 million won in fines, or revocation of the company’s business license. The bill will take effect next December after an 18-month grace period.But the Korean Smokers’ Association opposed the bill, calling it a “gimmick” to cover up the controversy over the tobacco price hike.“The government’s policy turned out to be a failure and it needs to allow smokers to participate in the decision-making process,” it said in a statement in May.Doubts linger over whether the graphic warnings on cigarette packs will help Koreans give up smoking, with no countries having succeeded in lowering the smoking rate through such a measure. Unclear clauses in the new plan, which stipulates that the images on cigarette packs must not be “excessively” repulsive, are also likely to leave room for argument between the authorities and tobacco industry.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","shortfall in last year tax ,tobacco sales more than halved ,sales in south korea recovered ,10 million won in fines ,raised tobacco prices by 000","['South Korea', 'the Korean Smokers ’ Association', 'Yoon Ho - joong', 'New Politics Alliance of Democracy', 'South Korea', 'OECD', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance', 'Yoon', 'Koreans', 'lawbreaker', 'the Korean Smokers ’ Association', 'Koreans', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40939447  0.29740307

(Korea Forest Service)The Korea Forest Service has successfully brought the nation’s advanced expertise in the forest leisure industry and ecological tourism to Indonesia, widening the scope of environmental cooperation between the two nations. KFS, the state agency for afforestation and forest resources, invited around 30 islanders of Lombok, a global vacation venue in Indonesia, to learn Korea’s latest green leisure know-how. The five-day instruction program was held from Aug. 24 to 28, pinning high hopes on maximizing the tourist value of the lush Indonesian island. The tutorial offered a variety of lectures and on-site training for forest tour guides, craftsmen and butterfly breeders. In addition, the program introduced Korea’s historical New Village Movement, an agricultural development plan that aroused the widespread social participation of farming communities. Earlier in the first half of this year, a group of high-profile forest authorities of Indonesia also participated in KFS’ program. The educational program is part of the Korea-Indonesia cooperative agreement signed by the governmental forest agencies in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Korea-Indonesia diplomatic ties. According to the agreement, Korea and Indonesia support the active exchange of expertise on forest-related industries, including forest-healing leisure plans and living-ecology tourism. KFS’ tutorial aims at contributing to Indonesia’s master plan to invigorate the forest-related tourism industries of Lombok. According to the master plan, Indonesia will establish environmentally friendly tourist facilities for forest healing and ecological tourism in Tunac on Lombok Island by 2018.As a nation with mountainous areas taking up more than 70 percent of the entire territory, Korea has accumulated rich experience and knowledge in forest tourism, according to the KFS. “The tutorial programs focus on the sustainable growth of (Lombok’s) local economy, rather than an instant development of a single tourist program,” a KFS official said.

Data from 2012 on Austria, Canada, France, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and the United States was not available in the report.Even after expanding the scope to outside the OECD, only Lithuania ― at 29.5 per 100,000 ― had a higher rate of suicide than Korea.The suicide rate for Asia’s fourth-largest economy has been highest among all OECD countries every year since 2003 when 28.1 people per 100,000 took their own lives. The rate peaked in 2009 at 33.8. While the country’s rate hovered around the OECD average up until 1995 ― marking 12.7 ― the figure jumped to 21.7 in 1998 when the country was hit hard by the Asia financial crisis. After Koreans, Hungarians were most likely to take their own lives ― marking 22 per 100,000 ― followed by Japan at 19.1.The sky-high suicide rate for Koreans was also apparent among students. Separate data revealed by Rep. Kang Eun-hee of Korea’s Saenuri Party showed that 17 students had committed suicide due to stress from school grades as of Aug. 17, accounting for roughly 23 percent of 61 students who took their own lives during the same period this year. The number of suicides from academic-induced stress in the first semester of this year has already surpassed the nine from 2014. South Korean schools operate two semesters a year with the first one starting in March and the second in September.According to 2014 data by Statistics Korea, suicide was the No. 1 cause of death among people aged 10 to 39. While Koreans showed a relatively high tendency to take their lives, they were ranked near the bottom in various criteria in quality of life.According to Korea’s 2015 edition of OECD’s “How’s Life?” biennial report to provide a comprehensive picture of well-being among OECD countries, the country’s health status, work-life balance and subjective assessment of well-being were ranked 33rd, 31st and 29th. Koreans’ spending on health was also lower than the OECD average. The report showed that Koreans spent about 6.9 percent of their gross domestic product on health in 2012, well below the OECD average of 8.9 percent.Korea’s health spending is also heavily dependent on the private sector: Public sources covered only 56 percent of the spending, compared to 73 percent for all OECD countries.

Rivalry for Arctic resources has intensified as shrinking polar ice is opening new opportunities for exploration.Russia was the first to submit its claim in 2002, but the U.N. sent it back for lack of evidence. The ministry said that the resubmitted bid contains new arguments. ""Ample scientific data collected in years of Arctic research are used to back the Russian claim,"" it said. In 2007, Moscow staked a symbolic claim to the Arctic seabed by dropping a canister containing the Russian flag on the ocean floor from a submarine at the North Pole.Amid tensions with the West over Ukraine, the Kremlin also has moved to beef up Russian military forces in the Arctic. The effort has included the restoration of a Soviet-era military base on the New Siberian Islands and other military outposts in the Arctic. Russian officials said the facilities are crucial for protecting shipping routes that link Europe with the Pacific region across the Arctic Ocean. Earlier this year, the military conducted sweeping maneuvers in the Arctic that involved 38,000 servicemen, more than 50 surface ships and submarines and 110 aircraft.

Though the U.S. Forces Korea confirmed that none of them had shown signs of infection and the materials were immediately destroyed, the incident triggered rigorous protests by civic groups and public demands for a thorough fact-finding investigation. The allies have set up a hotline and emergency cooperation mechanism since the mishap.Set to kick off its mission by inspecting the Osan lab later this month, the joint working group consists of officials from two countries’ defense, foreign, health, agriculture and food ministries and other related agencies, as well as private legal and microbiology experts. They will also draw up measures to forestall a future relapse.The working group will be chaired by Maj. Gen. Chang Kyung-soo, director-general for policy planning at Seoul’s Defense Ministry, and Maj. Gen. Robert Hedelund, commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Korea, and will operate under the Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement Joint Committee, which is separately scheduled to convene Wednesday to discuss the issue. “We’ve decided to create the working group for a more comprehensive and systematic review,” the ministry said in a statement. “This reflects our common understanding that we should dispel public concerns and safeguard the people’s health and safety by meticulously verifying facts and devising steps to prevent similar delivery accidents.” But the announcement is unlikely to quell mounting calls for a revision of the SOFA, which governs the legal status of some 28,500 U.S. troops stationed across South Korea, given the congressional approval and other lengthy and convoluted legal and administrative steps required for its amendment. On Saturday, some 1,000 members of 40 civic organizations gathered in front of the air base, lambasting the U.S. for the anthrax shipment and Seoul for its failure to acknowledge it and properly respond. They demanded the SOFA regulations to be strengthened, citing the current Article 9 of the agreement stipulating that South Korea does not conduct inspections of U.S. military cargo.“South Korea is not a venue for the U.S.’ bacterial experiments,” they chanted, demanding a halt of Washington’s ongoing bioscience project here and a closure of related facilities within the compound. Better known as the JUPITR program, the Joint U.S. Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition has been underway for two years at U.S. military bases in South Korea as part of Washington’s strategy to advance biosurveillance capabilities on the peninsula while rebalancing military assets toward the Asia-Pacific. May’s laboratory biological defense training, which the USFK said took place for the first time, was designed to boost the allies’ peninsula security capacity by testing existing and new systems that could better identify and detect toxins and pathogens in the environment. “A revision of the SOFA itself or its annexes will be challenging chiefly because it will need to pass U.S. Congress and thus take a long time. But the SOFA committee could manage to come up with certain binding agreements such as an agreed recommendation,” a Foreign Ministry official told The Korea Herald on the customary condition of anonymity. Defense Minister Han Min-koo also said at a parliamentary questioning last month that though further details were to be examined, the issue will be better complemented by an agreed recommendation, rather than an adjustment to SOFA, and reinforced information sharing between the two nations’ militaries. During his recent visit to Osan, he reaffirmed Seoul’s commitment to the joint biochemical initiative, saying “As long as North Korea has chemical warfare capabilities and the threats exist, the JUPITR program should continue to be developed to counter them.” South Korea’s intelligence authorities believe that the communist country has long invested in building clandestine germ arsenals involving anthrax and smallpox. Melissa Hanham, a senior fellow at the Washington-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said last week that a bio-pesticides research institute in Pyongyang appears to be capable of churning out “regular, military-sized batches of biological weapons” including anthrax. After analyzing images released by state media after a visit by leader Kim Jong-un last month, she said the Pyongyang Bio-technical Institute was generally thought to produce insecticides but was in fact being used as an “old and well-used cover for a biological weapons program.”Pyongyang’s state media dismissed the claim on Saturday as a “foolish attempt” by South Korea and the U.S. to dilute criticism in the wake of the anthrax blunder.

Bermudez Jr., chief analytics officer of AllSource Analysis, said in a report carried by the website 38 North of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies that the North's Ponghwa Chemical Factory would not have been running if Beijing had halted crude exports.Bermudez cited satellite imagery showing the refinery operational.""Numerous reports during 2014-2015 have stated that China, North Korea's largest crude oil supplier, did not sell it crude oil during 2014, a development that would force North Korea's single operating oil refinery into caretaker status,"" Bermudez said in the report.""Satellite imagery from 2014 and 2015, however, reveals that the facility has remained operational, though perhaps at somewhat lower levels than in the immediately preceding years, calling into question media reports of an oil cutoff from China,"" he said.  Imagery indicates activity at the factory's rail loading and unloading facility, and construction activity within the factory, such as the building and maintenance of storage tanks and additions to several buildings, provides another indication that the facility remained operational, the expert said.China has long been the main provider of food and fuel aid to the North.But relations between Pyongyang and Beijing significantly soured after Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in late 2012 and the North carried out its third nuclear test a few months later. Xi is the first Chinese leader to visit South Korea before North Korea.Xi has neither visited the North nor met with its young leader, Kim Jong-un, although he held a series of summit meetings with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.The frayed relations between the North and China prompted speculation that China stopped crude supplies to the North. But widespread views are that even though crude exports could have been halted, Beijing has been providing it in aid.Analyst say that China, which considers North Korea as something of a buffer zone, fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border and ultimately the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation next door.

Korea's severe drought seen as having eased: SeoulThe Unification Ministry said Friday that a severe drought that hit North Korea appears to have considerably eased since June as rainfall has almost reached last year's level in many areas.   North Korea has been grappling with what it called the worst drought in 100 years, sparking concerns about food shortages. South Korea earlier predicted that the North's crop production could fall by as much as 20 percent if the lack of rain continues into early July.   The ministry said the dry spell seems to have eased in North Korea though several areas in the northeast and midwest provinces are still suffering from the drought.   ""North Korea had suffered from severe drought across the nation until May. But it seemed that since June, the situation has considerably eased,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, said in a press briefing.   ""But some provinces such as Hwanghae and Hamgyeong provinces are still grappling with prolonged drought, which warrants a close watch,"" he added.   The ministry said that the average precipitation in May reached 54.5 percent of that recorded a year earlier. But in June, the rainfall increased to hit almost 90 percent of the level recorded in the same period last year.   Seoul earlier said that it is willing to provide support for North Korea in coping with the drought if the country makes a formal request. There has been no request from Pyongyang.   ""Currently, the South government is not considering providing food aid to the North,"" said a ministry official, asking not to be named.   Touching on the joint industrial park, the ministry reiterated that pending issues related to Kaesong Industrial Complex should be resolved through dialogue between the two Koreas.   South and North Korea plan to hold talks on the joint operation of the complex next Thursday to discuss a prolonged dispute over the North's unilateral move to raise wages for its 55,000 workers there.   Pyongyang sent a notice to Seoul saying that it will strengthen its monitoring of South Koreans who move in and out of the complex.   The North is known to have expressed complaints over activities by South Koreans including possession of goods banned in the North such as USBs and newspapers, vowing to take punitive actions if found.   ""The issue should be dealt with in accordance with the two sides' agreement and the related regulations.

The examination is being conducted in all areas where North Korean laborers are working.The remarks came as the North Korean ruling party and government officials are reported to have sought to defect out of fears over possible executions or punishments due to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s so-called reign of terror.South Korea’s state spy agency earlier said that since taking power in late 2011, Kim has had about 70 senior officials executed in an effort to establish himself.

In June, the algal blooms spread in the Hangang River in Seoul as well, and Seoul Metropolitan Government issued an algal bloom warning on June 30 in the downstream section of the river, spanning from Jamsil Bridge to Haengju Bridge. It was the first such warning in 15 years.  A Seoul City vessel carries out water treatment near Seongsan Bridge on the Hangang River in Seoul. (Yonhap)Green algal blooms are considered harmful as they can block water flow and cause odors, affecting the ecosystem. The blue-green algae even contains toxic substances that can cause respiratory problems or paralysis in humans. The algae warning is issued when the cell count of blue-green algae exceeds 5,000 cells per milliliter and over 25 milligrams per milliliter of chlorophyll A. The blue-green algae level around Seongsan Bridge recorded 27,000 cells, officials said. The toxic substance microcystin-LR was already detected in some spots along the Hangang River exceeding the safety threshold level of 1 microgram per liter, they added.  The continuous drought and high temperatures have contributed to the algae occurrence, experts said. “Algal blooms usually proliferate in the summer when the water temperature goes up and there is enough sunshine. This summer, the spread was made easier as the discharge flow from Paldang Dam decreased due to the drought, leaving the water to remain stagnant in the river,” environment engineering professor Choi Suing-il at Korea University told The Korea Herald.  The discharge flow from Paldang Dam last month plummeted by 56 percent compared to last year, Seoul City said.  The government and municipalities have carried out emergency preventive measures to contain the algae while strengthening monitoring. Despite the efforts, the green tide is still expanding. The algae warning alert on the Hangang River in Seoul was extended to Mapo Bridge and Hangang Bridge on Friday. Public concerns are consequently growing over the algae’s impact on drinking water. The Hangang River and Nakdonggang River are the main water sources for nearby residents. Experts, however, stressed that water was safe unless it had been directly exposed to the green tide, the authorities said. “Major water treatment facilities in the country are equipped with advanced water treatment systems. This system carries ozone and granular activated carbon that completely eliminate all pollutants as well as their odors and bad taste,” Choi added. “There will be no impact on our drinking water.”The government, however, warned the public not to carry out recreational water activities such as fishing or water skiing in river sections where alerts had been issued, as direct exposure to the algae can trigger skin irritation.The government anticipates that the upcoming rain will likely relieve the algae spread as a typhoon is expected to hit the peninsula from Tuesday to Thursday.

He also said South Korea has played a leading role in fighting climate change.  He made the comments after the Cabinet approved the country's commitment in the central city of Sejong.  South Korea plans to submit its contribution to the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat in the German city of Bonn via email later in the day, according to officials.  South Korea's contribution calls for reductions of 25.7 percent from the country's business-as-usual level by 2030 and the other 11.3 percent cut comes in the form of purchase of carbon credits to offset emissions.  South Korea said it is pushing to develop technology to reduce greenhouse gases while considering building more nuclear power plants.  The announcement came more than two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama asked President Park Geun-hye to set an ambitious goal in cutting greenhouse gases, citing efforts for the success of the U.N.

According to the Korea Association of Travel Agents, about 200,000 foreign visitors booked Korean tour packages for July and August, down 82 percent from a year ago. This is expected to cause a loss of over 100 billion won ($90 million) in sales. By nationality, the number of Japanese tourists declined by 84 percent to about 28,000 and Chinese visitors similarly dropped by 84 percent to some 132,000. The number of tourists from European and East Asian countries and the U.S. also fell by around 70 percent. As part of its efforts to overcome the MERS crisis, the union said it would guarantee a MERS insurance program for all incoming foreign visitors. Under the insurance package, they will receive 5 million won in treatment compensation if infected with MERS. The union will also ensure 100 million won in compensation if travelers die within 20 days of being officially diagnosed with the disease. The travel insurance will automatically be effective for those visiting the country from June 22-Sept. 21 without any registration necessary, the KATA said. Regular visitors, such as green card holders, crewmen or those with a working visa will not qualify. Travelers who visited the Middle East will also be excluded, it said. The measure followed an announcement by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism earlier this month that it would release a similar insurance package in a bid to help the ailing tourism industry.

Yun rejected this view. Noting the difficulty erasing the “collective memories” of the past, experts say the leaders of the countries should employ a more “active and creative” diplomacy to minimize their conflicts and maximize cooperation in handling shared challenges such as regional security and demographic changes. Park Geun-hye (left) Shinzo Abe (right) (Yonhap)“There are many areas where the two countries can see a convergence of their strategic interests, including North Korea’s military threats, protection of global commons such as maritime transport routes and maintenance of the regional status quo,” said Nam Chang-hee, an international politics professor at Inha University.“They should strive to frequently hold dialogue to better understand each other, find common ground, and expand their cooperation, which will help ease their historical tensions. That is what diplomacy is all about.”With Washington’s push to bring its key allies of South Korea and Japan together in a Cold War-era campaign against the former Soviet Union, the two sides reached a landmark deal to normalize their relations on June 22, 1965 ― after some 14 years of grueling negotiations.The normalization deal was struck amid intense opposition in Korea, where memories of Japan’s colonial atrocities were still potent.A day after the signing of the deal, then-President Park Chung-hee, the late father of the incumbent president, told his nation, “It is wise to grab the hands of even a onetime foe, like Japan, if it is needed to promote the well-being of our people for today and tomorrow.”Though it failed to settle historical issues, the outcome of the deal reflected the delicate balance between the two sides’ interests. On the back of the deal, Korea, then faltering in the aftermath of the 1950-53 Korean War, laid the foundation for its economic rise, while Japan, criticized for its wartime atrocities and aggressions, was given a chance to restore regional trust. “The deal was, at the time, seen as mutually beneficial. From a pragmatic standpoint, Korean officials viewed the deal as a way to facilitate their country’s industrialization to move beyond the ashes of the war,” said Kim Soung-chul, senior fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute.“Though historical issues were pushed aside and left unresolved (in the process of the negotiations), the deal was a turning point in the checkered history of the bilateral relations.”Under the “Agreement on the Settlement of Problems Concerning Property and Claims, and on Economic Cooperation between Japan and Republic of Korea,” Tokyo pledged to offer to Seoul $300 million in free grants, $200 million in long-term and low-interest loans and $300 million in commercial loans. The financial assistance to Seoul was offered not in the form of reparations for damages from Japan’s brutal colonization of the peninsula, but as “economic cooperation” and the settlement of property claims.The deal, thus, did not include any apology or words of repentance on the part of Japan for the occupation of its territory, despite Korea’s repeated calls during the negotiations. Experts say this has left the deal “incomplete and unfinished,” although they recognize the agreement was an “inevitable compromise” for a poor Korea whose per-capital gross domestic product was merely around $100 a year at the time.“As Korea’s top priority at the time is to pluck its people out of poverty and push for economic development, it needed technological and financial support from Japan ― a reason why historical issues were put on the back burner,” said Kim Ho-sup, diplomacy professor at Chung-Ang University.“Now, the historical issues are things to be complemented to ‘fully normalize’ the bilateral ties ― a tough task, which was left behind for the next governments.”The different interpretations of the normalization pact have also been a source of tension between the two countries. But Seoul claims the agreement did not settle all issues stemming from Japan’s colonial rule, and that it did not deal with violations of individual human rights such as Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.Cooperation eclipsed by conflictsThe considerable progress in the two sides’ cooperation in various areas has been eclipsed by conflicts over Japan’s distortions of history in school textbooks, repeated claims to the Dokdo islets under Korea’s control and its refusal to explicitly apologize for its wartime sexual slavery.But experts say that in terms of bilateral cooperation, the partnership has fared well, and that the two countries should strive to prevent political and historical tensions from damaging cooperative relations.According to recent data from the Korea International Trade Association, the trade volume between Korea and Japan, which was some $220 million in 1965, rose to around $86 billion last year. Japan is now Korea’s third-largest trading partner after China and the U.S. Korea is also the third-largest trading partner for Japan.“Despite political conflicts between the two nations, the quality of their economic cooperation has improved, though the quality of it has somewhat decreased as Korea’s economic exchanges with a rising China have increased,” said Lee Jung-hwan, Japan expert at Kookmin University.“Still, Korean firms participating in the ‘global value chains’ rely much on Japan for securing their component parts and production facilities to manufacture their final products,” he added, referring to international networks to optimize manufacturers’ production processes.Lee pointed out that amid worsening historical feuds, people in both countries seemed to take their economic cooperation for granted “just as they take air and water for granted.”However, historical tensions appear to have negatively influenced bilateral trade to a certain extent. Two-way trade volume, which rose to a record high of $108 billion in 2011, has fallen over the last four years. Over the course of 50 years, people-to-people exchanges have also dramatically risen. The annual number of Korean and Japanese nationals who traveled between the two countries has soared to more than 5 million from merely around 10,000, including around 5,100 Japanese visitors, in 1965. Experts say the increase in people-to-people exchanges is attributable largely to the two sides’ active economic exchanges, open-door policies toward each other and the pan-Asian popularity of Korean pop culture.Relations deadlocked in history trapSince Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began his second term in December 2012, his rhetoric and action, which critics say reveal his “revisionist” view of history, have worsened diplomatic friction with South Korea.From his remarks in April 2013 on the “ill-defined” definition of an invasion to his visit in December that year to the Yasukuni Shrine honoring the country’s war dead, including 14 Class-A war criminals, Abe’s nationalist moves have called into question his political will to mend ties with Korea.Last June, Tokyo carried out a controversial “review” of the 1993 Kono Statement, in which then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono apologized to the victims of sexual slavery. After the review, Tokyo suggested the apology was the product of a political compromise between Seoul and Tokyo, challenging its credibility.The Abe government’s decision to send a senior official to the Feb. 22 “Takeshima Day” celebration to assert its sovereignty claim to Dokdo has further exacerbated the relations. The Japanese prefecture of Shimane has observed the day for Takeshima, the Japanese name for Dokdo.Tokyo has also claimed sovereignty to Dokdo in its diplomatic and defense white papers. The bilateral conflict over Dokdo peaked in August 2012 when former President Lee Myung-bak visited the islets. After the visit, Tokyo made a proposal to Seoul to bring their spat over Dokdo to the International Court of Justice. Seoul rejected it, arguing there is “no dispute whatsoever” over Dokdo.Adding fuel to the historical spats is Japan’s bid to put 23 Meiji Industrial Revolution sites, including those related to Koreans’ colonial-era forced labor, on the UNESCO World Heritage list.Seoul has demanded Tokyo exclude seven of the sites, where nearly 57,900 Koreans were forced to work during the colonial era ― from the application, or to clearly present the facts about forced labor when they are designated as heritage sites.Above all, the thorniest historical issue is that of Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women, euphemistically called “comfort women.” Seoul has long called on Tokyo to take “legal” responsibility for the victims and officially apologize to them, stressing that the issue is urgent as there are only 50 surviving victims with many having died. Tokyo claims the issue was already settled under a 1965 normalization agreement.Although their differences over history seemed irreconcilable, all the bilateral efforts to address them have not gone down the drain. In 1998, then Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi expressed “deep remorse and a heartfelt apology” to Korea for Japan’s colonial rule in a joint statement issued at the close of his summit with then Korean President Kim Dae-jung.Seoul also secured the 1993 Kono Statement and 1995 Murayama Statement that expressed Tokyo’s apology for its wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women and its colonization of the peninsula, respectively.Future-oriented partnershipExperts say that Seoul and Tokyo should enhance high-level communication to help them better understand each other, remove misunderstandings and restore bilateral trust.Noting that historical issues can hardly be completely resolved, they also said the two sides should find ways to manage them well, and prevent them from escalating and hurting mutually beneficial cooperation in trade, security and other areas.On the part of national leaders, they should not ride the wave of growing nationalism to improve their political positions, the experts added.“Both countries need to focus on the future and their shared democratic values, respect for rule of law, emphasis on free market economics and the many things they share,” T. J. Pempel, political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.“Both sets of leaders should agree not to talk about ‘the history issue’ for a decade or more.”Nam suggested that Seoul and Tokyo strive to find shared challenges for which they should step up bilateral cooperation. The challenges include their slowing economies, demographic issues stemming from their aging populations, North Korea’s military threats and an ongoing shift in the regional balance of power caused by the rise of China.Some experts also noted the need to increase exchanges among young people of the two countries who are largely free from the influences of the colonial past and can better understand one another through various high-tech tools, including social networking services.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","largest trading partner for japan ,summit with then korean president ,korea last june tokyo carried ,rising domestic nationalism seoul prime ,now korea third largest trading","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Yun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Shinzo Abe', 'North Korea ’s', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Soviet Union', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Kim Soung - chul', 'Sejong Institute', 'Japan', 'Republic of Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Kim Ho - sup', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'the Korea International Trade Association', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'China', 'the U.S. Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'China', 'Lee Jung - hwan', 'Japan', 'Kookmin University', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Lee', 'korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'pan - asian', 'korean', 'Shinzo Abe', 'South Korea', 'Abe ’s', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Yohei Kono', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Shimane', 'Takeshima', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'the International Court of Justice', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Keizo Obuchi', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Seoul', 'Murayama Statement', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'the University of California , Berkeley', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea ’s', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 0.          0.          8.         ... -0.34072167  0.49080098

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Visitors can ski one day and sunbathe the next, watch the dervishes whirl before going clubbing, and stroll through a centuries-old bazaar before visiting a modern shopping center next door. According to Ali Karakus, the director of the Turkish Embassy’s office of culture and information, Korean tourists have been missing out on the full spectrum of travel options in Turkey. “Perhaps due to the tourism agency’s choices, Koreans have visited limited areas in Turkey ― Istanbul, Cappadocia and Pamukkale. This is only 10 percent of what we have to offer,” Karakus told The Korea Herald at the Korea Travel Fair 2015 at Coex in Seoul on June 11. “If visitors spend extra time touring nearby areas of the hotspots, they will experience the full depth of Turkey’s attractions, including outdoor activities, local food, customs and festivals.”The director recommended western Turkey, particularly the southern province of Antalya, known as the Turkish Riviera.  Lake Egirdir in western Turkey. (Turkish Tourism Ministry)Because of its white sandy beaches, aqua-blue coves, ancient ruins and untouched countryside, the region has been a magnet for international tourists and honeymooners. It is the No. 2 destination in Turkey, attracting 11.5 million tourists last year, especially from Germany, Russia, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Antalya has 197 beaches that qualified for the Blue Flag international award given to safe and clean beaches, marinas and boats. It has many beach resort towns nearby that are lined with luxury hotels, waterfront bars and restaurants and shopping facilities. Turkey is also an emerging destination for golf tourism. The Belek region in Antalya province has 17 golf clubs and 50 five-star hotels along the coastline. Straddling Asia and Europe both physically and psychologically, Turkey combines diverse ingredients and recipes into its cuisine, making it one of the world’s richest gastronomies, the director said. Food and drinks shape people’s experiences of visiting a place, argued Karakus, while pointing out that both Turkish coffee and Korean kimchi were added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list in recent years.“What I observed from Koreans is that they like to share things and foods with others, like Turks (do). Hospitality comes from sharing things,” he said. “Turks have gathered at cafes to drink coffee and smoke shisha since the mid-16th century, which formed our hospitable culture.”Turkey aims to attract 50 million foreign tourists annually by 2023, which marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the republic. Thirty-seven million international tourists visited Turkey last year. One unique aspect of Turkey is that many cities are “open air museums” that display heritage as part of the cityscape. Many more heritage areas are undiscovered and awaiting archaeological excavation, he stressed. Tourism makes up 10 percent of Turkey’s annual gross domestic product, and is a major source of income for the service industries. “Turkey welcomes you. Our society is in harmony with the government to promote tourism,” Karakus said, adding that any newcomer to the country would be regarded as a full-fledged member of the community in less than 6 months.

The weak Japanese yen also played a role in discouraging bilateral trade between the two neighboring countries.Japan was once the second largest trade partner for South Korea, but based on the latest data, it is now the fifth largest.Some observers noted that the fall might also have been affected by their strained ties over historic and territorial issues. Relations between the two countries have worsened due largely to Japan's refusal to acknowledge and apologize for its past wrongdoings, such as issues regarding former Korean sex slaves, during its colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45.

""The ministry will deliver the recommendation to the KHNP.""Built in 1977, the 580-megawatt light water reactor extended its life by 10 years to 2017, but it has faced growing pressure from residents and civic groups over safety concerns in light of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan.   If the KHNP accepts the government's recommendation, it will be the first time that South Korea permanently closed a nuclear power plant, presenting a difficult challenge of decommissioning.   The latest move comes as residents and civic groups as well as politicians based in Busan have ratcheted up pressure on the government to block the nuclear plant operator's bid for another life extension.  During the meeting also attended by KHNP CEO Cho Seok, proponents of the continued operation stressed the economic benefit of using the existing facility.   Opponents argued that closing the Kori-1, which accounts for a mere 0.5 percent of the nation's total energy production, would not significantly lower the power generation rate and suggested its closure would pave the way for developing the decommissioning technology.   The ministry expected it would take at least 15 years to demolish the reactor, pledging to make legal frameworks and develop decommissioning technology to dispose nuclear wastes and reprocess spent nuclear fuel to prepare for its closure.  ""The government will establish the nuclear industry infrastructure which covers all cycles ranging from construction, operation, demolition and nuclear waste management,"" Chung Yang-ho, a ministry official in charge of energy policy, said.

Song Dae-sub, a professor at Korea University’s College of Pharmacy, sees that the country’s dry and moderate weather provided a better living environment for the virus than much hotter and more humid Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. “In principle, Korea’s weather conditions make it easier for the virus to survive than Saudi’s,” he told a news briefing hosted last week by the Health Ministry. “The virus gets weak if humidity rises. Even in a dry atmosphere, high temperatures and direct sunlight have a negative impact on its survivability.”  A woman wearing a mask, plastic gloves and a raincoat enters Samsung Medical Center, one of the most heavily MERS-affected hospitals, in Ilwon-dong, southern Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)His assessment could boost hopes for hitting the brakes on the continuing spread, as scorching heat followed by the summer rainy season draws near. Yet the government and other experts warned against forging a hasty bond between the epidemic and the weather, saying more evidence is needed. “I think that the climate has only a limited effect, if any, given that MERS has been proliferating only within the hospitals, rather than on a community basis,” said Kim Woo-joo, a Korea University internal medicine specialist and president of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases. “It will be safer to understand the spread as a result of the MERS patients’ contact with many other people in enclosed areas.” In line with Kim’s remarks, the hospital environment and culture associated with patient visits have also been pointed to as further crucial contributors. At major Seoul hospitals such as the Samsung Medical Center, which became the biggest source of MERS patients, patients race to make appointments with what they believe to be the best doctors in Korea, often having to wait for months until they receive surgery or other treatments. The institutions’ crammed wards also make it easier for close contact between patients and their caretakers to occur, which is then accelerated by the culture where family members together visit their sick relatives. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, and Peter Ben Embarek, chief of the agency’s MERS team in Geneva, have also picked Korea’s culture of family members caring for their loved ones at home and in hospitals as one of the driving forces behind the outbreak. “The country’s unique culture could indeed be one of the factors, including patients awaiting at emergency rooms before formally transferring to a ward, group patient visits and multi-bed rooms at hospitals,” Song added.

In that case, North Korea is believed to be focusing on producing maize as an alternative to rice.  ""This year, the supply of fertilizer is not smooth, compared with last year,"" said the official, asking not to be named.  The North has relied on international handouts since 1995 to help feed its people in the face of chronic food shortages.  A U.N. report showed that about 70 percent of North Korea's 24.6 million people suffer from food shortages and 1.8 million, including children and pregnant women, are in need of nutrition.  Last year, the North suffered from a severe drought in the spring, but managed to produce crops at a level similar to that of 2013 due mainly to the use of preserved water.  The official said that the North's agricultural reforms might have helped it maintain the food production last year, but this year's situation may bode ill, given that fertilizer availability is worse.  In 2012, the North announced the so-called ""6.28 measures"" that centered on allowing farmers to keep 30 percent of their production quota plus any excess over the quota.

""But North Korea is not expected to close down the zone just because of the wage issue.""The joint industrial complex, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.The operation of the complex has been highly affected by inter-Korean relations. The Seoul-Pyongyang ties have been strained since 2010, when the South imposed sanctions banning economic and cultural exchanges following the North's torpedoing of a South Korean warship and its shelling of a border island.In April 2013, the North unilaterally shut down the industrial park for about four months, raising concerns about the viability of the factory zone. Four months later, the two Koreas decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park.Seoul has rejected Pyongyang's unilateral wage hike, saying it is in breach of a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations. The wage hike cap has been set at 5 percent per year.Touching on the talks on a wage cap, Jeong claimed that the South needs to show ""flexibility"" over the issue although the matter should be resolved through consultations by the two sides.When it comes to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Jeong said North Korea has ""grave"" concerns about the disease.Concerns about the spread of the MERS virus are growing in the South as it has killed six South Koreans so far, while the number of those infected has increased to 87.The communist country has been highly sensitive to the outbreak of contagious diseases due to its weak health care system. Last year, Pyongyang imposed an entry ban on foreign tourists for about five months due to concerns over the deadly Ebola virus.""It is certain that the North has grave fears about the newly-found infectious disease,"" Jeong said, adding that North Korea had asked the South Korean firms at the zone to unveil measures to counter the Ebola virus last year.""But there have been no requests from the North over MERS except for its recent demand for the supply of thermal scanners and masks,"" he added.At the request of the North, South Korea on Monday installed three thermal scanners for those who move in and out of the complex to prevent the spread of the virus in the reclusive country.The communist country still bristled at any criticism of its medical system, saying the South could not even contain the spread of MERS.""Recently in the South, a respiratory infectious disease has been spreading rapidly and pushing people into extreme anxiety and fear,"" said a report carried by the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the North's ruling Workers' Party. ""Who are they slandering in such a situation?""The paper also criticized South Korea's National Assembly speaker, Chung Ui-hwa, who cited the North's poor health care in proposing a bill for cross-border exchanges in health and medicine.

Last week, the government identified St. Mary’s Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, as a MERS-affected hospital after 37 cases of MERS had originated from the facility.“We are revealing the names of hospitals to show that the government is accurately keeping track of confirmed patients. We will continue to disclose hospital names to actively find infected individuals within the hospital and prevent spreading of the disease,” said acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan in an emergency briefing at Seoul Government Complex.Choi explained that the government had refrained from revealing the information out of fear that it may spark nationwide panic and create a vacuum in medical treatment in hospitals involved. But the authorities, including President Park Geun-hye, have decided that the benefits of disclosing information outweigh the possible side effects, he added.“(The announcement) represents a shift in the government’s strategy, to pour all of our efforts to end the MERS situation in its early stages,” Choi said. He added, however, that the government is not considering an extra budget, but would spend funds reserved for national emergencies.The government will also step up monitoring system of potential patients, which will include a cellphone tracking system.Choi said the government is not considering upgrading the alert level for MERS from its current “caution” status. He reiterated the infection was still being contained to hospitals and had not yet spread to the general public.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","five largest hospitals in seoul ,south korea on sunday disclosed ,hospital after 37 cases of ,patients have visited samsung medical ,south korea on sunday","['South Korea', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul Asan Hospital', 'Seoul', 'St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Seoul Government Complex', 'Choi', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Yoon Min - sik']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23242591  0.54654485

Of them, only 276 are inhabited. One among them is Jangbyeongdo Island, which is about two hours away from its closest port of Mokpo. There are currently 91 people residents, 26 of them aged 65 or older. Most of them make a living by digging for octopus in the mudflats and seaweed farming.Jangbyeongdo, only about 1.63 square kilometers in size, is also one of the 138 islands of South Jeolla region that have no medical facilities, pharmacies or resident health care workers. For them, seeing a doctor means having to travel to Mokpo, or wait for the “floating hospital” ― a state-run ship that functions as a medical facility ― that visits about five times a year. The island doesn’t even have berths for ships to anchor. When the ship arrives near the island, patients take turns to board a small boat that takes them to the floating vessel in the ocean.The Hospital Ship Jeonnam 512, one of the five hospital ships run by the government that is based in Mokpo, offers dental care, general medicine services and traditional Korean medicine. The ship also houses a little pharmacy and a room for X-ray screenings and simple medical tests. There is one general physician, one dentist, and one traditional Korean medicine doctor. All treatments and prescribed drugs are free.Patients from Jangbyeongdo Island, one of 138 remote Korean islands that do not have any medical facilities, arrive on a state-run hospital ship by boat on May 20. (The Ministry of Health and Welfare)On May 20, some 40 residents of the island ― almost half its entire population ― were on board, waiting for their turn to see the doctors. One of them was Jeong Oh-rae, a 77-year-old diabetic patient. Her doctor, Lee Kyung-ho, seemed concerned about her blood sugar level.It was over 300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), an extremely high rate considering the normal level is 150 mg/dL. She was experiencing blurry vision, which is one of the typical symptoms of high blood sugar.“You need to take more insulin. I’ll prescribe it for you,” Lee told Jeong. “I can’t see you often enough to check on you regularly. Take the prescribed insulin, and make sure you tell your doctor in Mokpo about your blood sugar level the next time you see him.”Dr. Lee, 31, joined the team of Jeonnam 512 in April, as part of his public medical service that substitutes for his mandatory military duty. Having spent most of his life in Seoul, Lee said he wanted to gain experience in medically underserved communities.“This is a rare opportunity for any doctor,” he told The Korea Herald. “There are only five state-run hospital ships in the country, and each carries only one general physician. It’s meaningful to be somewhere totally different from where I was trained as a doctor and give back what I learned.”For patient Jeong, the floating hospital visits are something she does not want to miss. “I get everything here, including eye drops and pain relief patches,” she said. “They make me feel safe until the ship’s next visit.”The ship’s 15 staff, including three doctors, two nurses and two medical technicians, are onboard more than 180 days a year. South Jeolla Province runs two hospital vessels, including Jeonnam 512, as the region has the highest number of medically underserved islands. Each of the two ships visit about 150 islands annually.A patient from Jangbyeongdo Island, one of 138 remote Korean islands that do not have any medical facilities, talks to a doctor on a state-run hospital ship that visits her island about five times a year. (The Ministry of Health and Welfare)Being on the ship isn’t always easy and sometimes poses unique challenges. For traditional Korean medicine doctor Kim Jin-hoo, the challenge is to practice acupuncture when the ship is pitching on the waves. Since a large number of residents of remote islands are the elderly, acupuncture treatments are especially popular among the patients who suffer from chronic back or nerve pain. And sometimes, the treatment is a little too popular.“I’m getting used to the pitching now, but practicing acupuncture on a floating ship is still a challenge,” the 26-year-old doctor said. “One of the other challenges is that many of the patients don’t want to leave the treatment room mostly because they want to talk more about their condition. But I have to ask them to leave because other patients are waiting in line. Things aren’t as efficient as hospitals in cities, but I don’t always mind because it lets me learn more about the patients at the same time.”Sometimes motion sickness is hard to handle, even for health care professionals. “I just have to lie down sometimes,” said Park Jung-sun, a nurse. “Some days we are lucky, and some days we are not. It really depends on the weather.”The South Jeolla Province spends about 2.9 billion won ($2.6 million) annually to run the two hospital ships. The central government supports 800 million won every year. “The biggest burden is the fuel oil, which costs 1.2 billion won a year,” said Kang Young-koo from the provincial government. “We would appreciate more support from the central government.”To improve medical services in remote regions in the country, the Health Ministry plans to introduce telemedicine, the use of information technology through devices such as smartphones in order to provide clinical health care at a distance. The move has been fiercely opposed by the nation’s largest group of physicians, who claim that it would lower the quality of medical services and jeopardize the operations of small local clinics and regional hospitals.However, Dr. Ryu Jae-kwang, director of Mokpo Hankook Hospital who receives patients from remote islands across South Jeolla, said telemedicine is very much needed in his region, especially during medical emergencies which often require air ambulance services. The Korean government currently only operates four air ambulances, much fewer than other countries such as Japan, which runs 46.“Telemedicine isn’t just between doctors and patients. It is needed between medical staff,” Ryu said. “In emergency situations where the patient is in a critical condition, it is important to make the right diagnosis as soon as possible. Telemedicine between experienced doctors and emergency staff decreases the chances of misdiagnosis and lets the patient receive the best possible care even when he or she is being sent to the right medical facility. “South Korea has the best Wi-Fi system in the world,” he continued. “It makes no sense that telemedicine isn’t already happening.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","seaweed farming jangbyeongdo only about ,only five state run hospital ,of 138 remote korean islands ,japan which runs 46 telemedicine ,ships visit about 150 islands","['MOKPO', 'South Jeolla Province', 'korean', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Mokpo', 'Jangbyeongdo', 'South Jeolla', 'Mokpo', 'Mokpo', 'korean', 'korean', 'Jangbyeongdo Island', 'korean', 'the Ministry of Health', 'Jeong Oh - rae', 'Lee Kyung - ho', 'Lee', 'Jeong', 'Mokpo', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jeong', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Jangbyeongdo Island', 'korean', 'the Ministry of Health', 'korean', 'Kim Jin - hoo', 'Park Jung - sun', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Kang Young - koo', 'the Health Ministry', 'Ryu Jae - kwang', 'Mokpo Hankook Hospital', 'South Jeolla', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Ryu', 'South Korea', 'Claire Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          7.         ... -0.35350609  0.57239658

At least six other people are missing in floods that have ravaged mountain districts of six provinces and autonomous regions in central and southeastern China. More than a quarter-million people have been moved to temporary shelters, and major damage has been inflicted on buildings and crops.Apart from the two schoolchildren, 42 others have died due to floods and heavy rains, including 16 in the collapse of a nine-story building in the city of Guiyang following a landslide. Eight other people were killed in the central province of Hunan when a bus skidded into a guardrail and overturned.The Guangxi regional government said 21 other kindergarten students were sent to the hospital in the school bus accident on Friday, with three listed in serious condition. The bus was licensed to carry 11 people, but had a total of 26 on board. The driver, teachers and school administrators have been taken into custody, the government said. Overloaded buses have been involved in accidents killing scores of children in recent years as local schools are closed and consolidated into larger campuses farther away from the children's village homes.Seasonal rains cause major flooding around China almost every year. The worst in recent history was in 1998, when 4,150 people died, most of them along the Yangtze River.The massive Three Gorges Dam has largely contained Yangtze flooding, but the problem persists in other parts of the country.","china latest round of flooding ,accidents killing scores of children ,cause major flooding around china ,major flooding around china almost ,seasonal rains cause major flooding","['AP', 'China', 'China', 'Guiyang', 'Hunan', 'Guangxi', 'China']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61874348 -0.0128092

(Yoon Min-sik/The Korea Herald)In order to achieve this, he said the country would take inspiration from South Korea, a country that transformed itself from one of poorest countries in the world to one of leading economies in Asia in a matter of decadesYoh said South Korea could be the country’s “role model” as it seeks to evaluate and improve the curriculum. “There are two ways to acquire human resources. Either bring in people from outside, or adjust your education to start building such resources,” he said, emphasizing the necessity of education.Unlike Korea, the country has resources. But Yoh said South Sudan needed to teach its future generations the importance of education and not rely on resources, because resources can be used for the country’s benefit at any time. Education, on the other hand, needs to be developed over time.

Meanwhile, only 6.1 percent of households that belong to the wealthiest 25 percent did the same. Also, 7.5 percent of the poorest households could not receive necessary medical treatment for financial reasons, while only 0.6 percent of those who belong to the wealthiest 25 percent experienced such difficulties in 2012.The healthy life expectancies ― average number of years that a person can expect to live in “full health” ― of Koreans aged 30 also varied according to their education levels. The rate among those who received higher education was 76.6, compared to 65.8 for those who never finished high school.The study also showed that the poor had less access to cancer screenings. While 80.5 percent of the poorest 25 percent of Korean women received cervical cancer screening in 2012, 90.1 percent of the wealthiest 25 percent had their checkup.Also, only 57.2 percent of Koreans who belong to the poorest 25 percent received colorectal cancer screening in the same year, while 67 percent of the wealthiest group received the examination.The World Health Organization states that social factors including education, employment status, income level, gender and ethnicity have an influence on one’s physical and mental health. The lower a person’s socioeconomic position, the higher their risk of poor health, it says.Kim Dong-jin, who organized the research at KIHASA, said the government should make efforts to combat health inequalities, which he thinks have been deepening in the last few years. “Central and municipal governments should make joint efforts to monitor the situation consistently and archive the information,” he said. “There should be more policies and welfare programs to tackle this issue.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","poorest 25 percent of korean ,poorest 25 percent received colorectal ,25 percent of korean women ,25 percent received colorectal cancer ,80 percent of the poorest","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for the Health and Social Affairs', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'the World Health Organization', 'Kim Dong - jin', 'KIHASA', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.32532474  0.66041893

104,104,Seoul seeks to guarantee  children’s right to play,"South Korea’s Welfare Ministry on Wednesday announced its plan to tackle children’s unhappiness, including establishing a charter on “children’s rights to play.”According to the ministry’s 2013 data, Korea scored the lowest among the OECD in terms of children’s “life satisfaction” with a total of 60.3 out of 100 points.

The government’s goal is to increase the index to 77 points by 2019.Some of the major reasons behind the statistics include lack of leisure time and hobbies, as well as stress over academic obligations. Korean children were found to be the unhappiest among OECD countries in previous years as well, with 64.3 points in 2009, 65.1 in 2010 and 69.29 in 2012.The ministry plans to tackle the problem by announcing a special charter on “children’s right to play” in the near future, partly inspired by what is already stated in the proclamation in the 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child by the United Nations General Assembly. The 1959 declaration reads: “State Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.” The ministry hasn’t decided when to unveil the charter, which is currently being established. Korea ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, which stipulates that all children have the right to play and rest, but it is the first time the government is making an effort to ensure that Korean children enjoy that right.“The government policies on children have been mostly focused on their education and development, not their happiness or leisure time,” said Koo Mi-jeong from the Welfare Ministry.“The newly established charter will be more detailed than what is stated in the U.N. convention, and will try to meet the unique or specific needs of Korean schoolchildren. Once the charter is announced, four ministries ― the ministries of education, gender equality, culture and welfare ― will work together to come up with leisure programs for schoolchildren.”The government is to also decrease the number of children who have no hobbies to 32 percent from the current 54.8 percent, as well as the number of child victims of physical abuse to 280,000 from the current 294,188 by 2019. It also hopes to decrease the number of child victims of sexual violence to 25,000 from the current 26,962, and increase the happiness index of children in poverty to 54 points from the current 46.1 by the same year.

According to Seoul Metropolitan Government, the self-reliance rate of 25 districts on average plummeted to 31.5 percent this year, reaching the lowest mark since the city started to draft and execute its own budget under an elected mayor in 1995.The self-reliance rate, which is the ratio of district offices’ own revenue sources such as local taxes to overall revenue, indicates the level of fiscal strength of the districts. Since 1995, the overall financial independence has remained over 50 percent but the number started to plummet from 2010. Last year, the average rate dropped to 33.6 percent, the authorities said. The self-reliance level differed by regions. While Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu in the affluent southern region and Jung-gu in central Seoul remained above 50 percent, most northern residential districts such as Nowon-gu and Dobong-gu recorded less than 20 percent, the city said. The growing burden of public child care services and the basic pension scheme for the elderly have affected financial independence, it added. As part of President Park Geun-hye’s presidential election pledges, the government expanded the existing public child care program to children aged 5 or younger since 2013, and started to provide around 150,000 ($137) to 200,000 won allowance for the elderly aged 65 or older since 2014. “Seoul City and district offices have been asked to share the cost burden way too much by the central government since it introduced the universal welfare schemes ― free child care and basic pension for senior citizens,” city officials said. The districts are currently shouldering 343 billion won a year for the child care scheme, which is more than 30 percent of the total cost. For the elderly basic pension program, local offices are shouldering 218 billion won or 15 percent of the total cost, they said.

The decision will allow the Ace Gyeongam Foundation to shore up agriculture in Sariwon, the capital of North Hwanghae Province, by building an additional 50 greenhouses and providing 15 tons of fertilizers and other construction and farming materials. “They will provide technical support such as for establishing gardens and greenhouses so that the project will proceed smoothly,” Unification Ministry spokesperson Lim Byeong-cheol said at a news briefing. The organization, based in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province, was set up in 2008 by Ahn Yoo-soo, chairman of furniture maker Ace Bed Co. Ahn, who hails from the region, will deliver the goods worth some 200 million won ($186,000) by land on Tuesday and assess the project’s progress until Saturday together with a team of seven technicians and officials. The announcement marks South Korea’s first fertilizer assistance to the impoverished neighbor since it imposed bilateral sanctions on cross-border trade, investment, travel and other exchanges following the North’s deadly attacks on a corvette and border island in 2010. The last package by a private group was authorized in April the same year. State-level support has not taken place since 2007, although humanitarian aid directed at women and children has continued.Ahn expressed gratitude for the decision, saying his project would provide a “chance to look to the future where our people reconcile and work together.” The foundation has been running a greenhouse farm there since 2009 at a 33,000 square meter area to boost agricultural production and technology transfers. It has since installed 100 greenhouses and is expected to scale it up to 300. Along with cement and heavy equipment, fertilizers and grains such as rice and flour remain sensitive items due to concerns that they can be stored for a relatively long time and thus the communist regime may divert them for military and other unintended uses through resale to other countries. President Park Geun-hye vowed wider humanitarian assistance and proposed a joint agricultural complex in her speech in Dresden, Germany, last March, but her initiative has made little headway amid persistent cross-border tension. “The government will approve humanitarian aid to North Korea such as for those in agricultural and diary sectors, if they are conducted in a transparent way and in the interest of the North Koreans,” a foundation spokesperson said.

(Yonhap)“We would usually dispatch the advance team first and then the search and rescue staff, but we have decided to send part of them together this time because the situation is changing, in line with the ongoing aftershocks and adding to the already tough conditions, such as the small scale of our embassy and communication interruption,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “While carrying out emergency rescue activities, we will make preparations for our upcoming full-fledged mission in tandem, adapting to the situation on the ground and looking into the range and type of activities of follow-up personnel.” The decision was made at an intra-agency meeting designed to discuss the scale, timeframe and other details of the public-private disaster response team. The meeting was led by Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, with the public safety and security and health and welfare ministries also in attendance. Other organizations, including the Korea International Cooperation Agency, also participated.

Korea also had its own series of seven five-year economic development plans between 1962 and 1996, leading to the “compressed development” of the economy.Ethiopia’s president attributed his country’s success to having a clear vision of advancing leadership; pursuing realistic policies with a rational assessment of realities; and promoting strategic public-private partnerships to remedy market failures.“The general philosophy behind all of this is to have a democratic developmental state,” Teshome said, adding that Ethiopia has a lot to learn from Korea’s Saemaul Undong, a nationwide community movement launched in 1970 to modernize rural towns. Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Most recently, the Korea International Cooperation Agency has been providing vocational training and organizational assistance to agricultural projects in Ethiopia.During his weeklong visit, Teshome met Korean President Park Geun-hye and participated in the opening ceremony of the World Water Forum in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. He was also greeted by business leaders from the Korean Federation of Industries, Daegu Chamber of Commerce and Industries, LG Electronics, CJ Corporation, and agricultural machinery and textile companies.Teshome acknowledged the appreciation of the Korean government and people for Ethiopia’s participation in the Korean War (1950-1953), in which 6,000 Ethiopian troops fought as part of the United Nations’ forces.Ethiopia and Korea established diplomatic relations in 1963. “Our solidarity and fraternity will serve as a springboard for future cooperation,” the president emphasized.After finishing high school in Ethiopia, Teshome won a government scholarship to study in China. Between 1978 and 1982, he obtained an undergraduate degree in the philosophy of political economy at Peking University, where he developed an understanding of Asian cultures.He worked in the Ethiopian government for two years and returned to Peking University for a masters and doctorate in international law. Teshome went on to become the Ethiopian ambassador to China, Japan and Turkey, before becoming the president in 2013.Teshome highlighted investment and construction opportunities in Ethiopia’s water and green energy sectors. In late March, Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan reached a historic agreement to build the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which would generate over 6,000 megawatts of electricity for Ethiopia and its neighbors.The $5 billion project will make it Africa’s largest hydroelectric power plant, part of a long line of mega-sized infrastructure projects aimed at turning Ethiopia into a regional powerhouse.“Building the dam is a matter of existence for Ethiopia,” Teshome said. “Our people must change the state of affairs to which we belong today. We are not willing to continue our same way of life.”The president said the project will lead to trust and integration in the Horn of Africa region. It will also improve water management, create jobs and spur community development in the Nile Basin, he said.In March, Ethiopia met target No. 10 of its Millennium Development Goals to provide safe drinking water and sanitation services to its citizens. The five-year plan places water supply at the core of its objectives.“We will build together and prosper together,” Teshome said. “To build a prosperous nation requires energy, which lies in water in Ethiopia. We will kick-start our industries and forge an industrialized society.”Teshome also called upon Korean educators and researchers to work in Ethiopia, as 10 universities will be added every five years to the current 36 universities in the country.Lee Jang-gyu, a retired professor of electrical engineering from Seoul National University, has been the president of Adama Science and Technology University in Addis Ababa since 2011. He is the first Korean university president in Africa.Korean professionals in the field of information communication technology are welcome at a technopark in Addis Ababa currently under construction, Teshome added.Highlighting the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, he said, “The importance of the conference is to have a shared vision with the international community about financing development as we jump into the 2015-2020 period’s post-millennium goals for development.”“Ethiopia has marvelous and magnificent projects lined up to protect the environment and shift to renewable energy, all in the interest of the international community.

None of the South Korean firms have paid the wages,"" said Yoo Chang-geun, vice president of the group.But the ministry said it's still early to say that the North has extended the deadline.Seoul points out that Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for two quasi-government committees from each side to set the wages together. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year.The two Koreas have held the talks on the wage dispute twice so far through a quasi-government committee, but they failed to produce a breakthrough.""There is no change in Seoul's stance that the wage dispute should be resolved through consultations,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at the unification ministry, said at a press briefing on Monday. ""We plan to come up with measures to minimize any potential damage to South Korean firms, such as providing them with financial compensation.""South Korean firms have been squeezed as the Seoul government has asked them not to accept the North's decision while the North has threatened to collect an arrears charge if they do not pay the higher wages.South Korea is concerned that the wage row could set a precedent for the North to make unilateral decisions on the operations of the industrial park.The Kaesong Industrial Complex opened in the early 2000s, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North.

The abacus was first presented as drawings of circles by Babylonians around B.C. 3000. It was later modified into the shape we know now ― the rectangular wooden frame and beads strung up on metal rods ― by the Chinese in A.D. 1300, who called it “suanpan.” Koreans adopted it in 1400 under the name “jupan.” By visualizing numbers with beads, this analog tool made complex calculations possible for clerks and merchants before the age of digital calculators.Jupan continued to exist as a useful tool in modern times, as it enabled its users to picture the beads in mind and perform quick mental calculations. A “jupan,” or abacus, is a calculating tool that experts claim helps enhance concentration“Becoming familiar with jupan not only improves the right hemisphere of the brain that helps people to think about problems step by step, but also the left side that is related to creativity, as people get to mentally visualize the arrangement of beads as they calculate.” said Lee Young-ha, a professor at the Department of Mathematics Education at Ewha Womans University. “In addition, as the beads on jupan are tiny and easily moved along the wire, one has to pay close attention while moving them, which ultimately leads to the improvement of concentration.” Supported by expert opinions, a recent phenomenon has arisen in South Korea, in which jupan is regaining newfound popularity as an effective means to cultivate the minds of young people, who are over-dependent on digital technology. Kim Soon-hi, the head of the Korea Association Zhoushan’s Gangnam branch, singled out the advanced digital tools of today as the cause behind young children’s lack of concentration, perseverance and arithmetic dexterity. “Digital calculators and computers don’t require thinking. Kids from younger generations are inundated by this on-hand technology. Many of them even fail to learn their home phone numbers by heart,” she said. “In the 1970s and ’80s the ability to calculate with jupan was a prerequisite for anyone who wished for a career in business,” Kim said. “But now, jupan is primarily used as an educational tool.” “Older people do it too as ‘brain sports’ that help prevent dementia.”The number of people paying attention to the benefits of jupan has consistently increased, Kim said. As a result, the once-bimonthly supan certification exam is now carried out every month as of this year.The number of students who took the certification test doubled in February to over 1,000, compared to the 450 in January. Kim, a veteran jupan instructor at Seoul National University of Education, said she hoped for more people to recognize the benefits and potential of jupan.

Countries with a yearly water supply of 1,000 to 2,000 cubic meters per person are considered water-stressed.Amid concerns over Korea’s water resources, the head of Korea’s state-run environment body stressed that going back to the basics is the key to overcoming this problem.“Expanding water reuse and reducing the leakages are the most realistic solutions,” Korea Environment Corporation CEO Lee Si-jin told The Korea Herald. Korea Environment Corporation CEO Lee Si-jin. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)“Some claim that developing new water resources can relieve the shortage problem. But considering its high cost, ecological problems and possible conflicts with concerned regions, that’s not viable.” KECO has committed to sustainable growth by connecting the public and private sectors in water management and greenhouse gas emission reductions. Lee, who has been a consultant to KECO and the Environment Ministry for over two decades, took the helm of the company in 2013. Lee stressed that three factors affect Korea’s water use: the limited amount of water, resource waste and the limit of developing water resources.“If we at least reuse a certain amount of water spent at households and industrial facilities, the water shortage problem can be greatly solved,” Lee said. Water reuse includes purifying and treating rainwater, sewage and effluent into industrial and agricultural water, he added. The government is considering a long-term scheme to reuse 2.5 billion tons of water or 12 percent of the total water resource by 2020 based on KECO’s study. “Along with efforts to widen the water reuse, water leakage management should be carried out to conserve resources,” 58-year-old Lee said. As of 2013, Korea recorded 650 million cubic meters of water leakage per year, worth 515 billion won ($470 million), the CEO added. As part of its efforts to minimize the leakage, KECO has launched a special water management project in two regions in Gangwon Province since 2009. This includes improving the waterworks pipes and running a real-time management system. While the project is still underway, the leakage rate in Yeongwol-gun and Jeongseon-gun in the province already dropped by about 10 percent to 37.1 percent, and by 3 percent to 80 percent, respectively, he said.In recognition of its works in water management and other environmental projects, KECO won the Environmental Business International Award for the last four years and Green Apple Awards three years straight. As part of further efforts to find solutions for water issues, KECO is participating in the seventh World Water Forum, the world’s largest water event that kicked off Sunday in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, in southern Korea. The state-run company will host the World Water Challenge to award those who come up with the most feasible and innovative water solutions. “Countries around the world have participated in the challenge. I’m looking forward to seeing water solutions through creative ideas in the challenge,” Lee said.

""A flexible economy and sustainable welfare systems are critical for the country's future.""His comments come amid a government push to abolish the so-called dual labor market. The dual labor system refers to the gap between full-time regular employees who enjoy ""excessive"" job security and good pay vis-a-vis non-regular workers whose employment is tenuous and are usually paid less than their regular employee counterparts.Choi has claimed this system has hurt youth employment, although labor unions have opposed any move to weaken job security.Touching on the overall state of the economy, Choi said that expansionary fiscal policies, advantageous exchange and interest rates and oil prices along with more transactions in the property market are all pointing to an economic recovery.""The government expects the upturn in economic indicators, along with the revival of confidence by consumers and businesses, to lead to more consumer spending and investment,"" he said.Kim In-ho, the co-chairman of the committee, concurred that change is critical at this juncture, making clear that the government alone cannot resolve all outstanding issues.""The country needs to change so the necessary reforms can be pushed forward whenever the need arises,"" said Kim, who also heads the Korea International Trade Association. ""The country must pursue a policy of sustainable and inclusive growth."" He also said South Korea needs to reach consensus on such critical matters as the labor market and employment and that, companies must play a leading role in creating more jobs.

Situated between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, Denmark has overcome its water challenges using innovative engineering. “Not just Denmark, but the whole world is facing increasingly severe problems related to drinking water,” Brosbol told journalists from Korea, Japan, China, Singapore and India at the ministry building. “From the Danish perspective, it is both a challenge and opportunity because we can use our expertise and experience to solve these problems.”Brosbol will attend the seventh World Water Forum in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province from April 12-17 to promote Danish water technologies and send a political message to the United Nations about the importance of water, she said.  Danish Environment Minister Kirsten Brosbol (left) speaks to reporters from Asian media at the ministry building in Copenhagen last week. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this year identified water as the greatest challenge facing humanity,” the minister stressed. “Denmark’s joint water sectors will urge the U.N. to adhere to the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals currently under negotiation.”Korea, for its part, said it would produce a declaration urging a much-belated international coalition. The Danish Water Forum, which promotes cooperation and knowledge sharing in the water sector, will participate in Korea. Denmark has pursued sustainable development since the 1973-74 oil crisis, and worked to increase environmental awareness among citizens. In the 1970s, the Danish Ministry of Environment instituted a regulatory regime that held companies accountable for environmental effects, while nurturing green technologies, Brosbol pointed out. The country’s current success in the water industry is driven by public-private partnerships, as well as high standards of regulation and innovation. “Danish companies see regulations as an asset, rather than a liability,” emphasized Brosbol, explaining that government intervention helped the industry make technological breakthroughs and reduce its ecological footprint. She added that government oversight had led to companies gaining an edge against international competitors as the global paradigm shifted toward sustainable development.By investing in measures to adapt to climate change, such as coastal protection, flood management, climate resilient buildings and food security, Denmark has used the climate threat to create jobs and raise exports as part of its green growth strategy. Denmark has one of the strictest regulations in the European Union on groundwater protection and wastewater treatment, stressed Brosbol.“Thanks to generational efforts, the Copenhagen Harbor became clean enough to swim in, and people drink water straight from the tap,” she said. “Both large and small and medium-sized companies feed into a cycle of innovation and global business expansion.”The Danish government also provides humanitarian and technical assistance to countries through development cooperation. Expert advisers are sent to Danish embassies around the world to give feedback to companies entering new markets, she added. As a result, the Danish economy has grown by 80 percent since 1980, while energy consumption stayed the same and water consumption dropped by 40 percent. A new national agreement in 2012 aims for a fully functioning green economy by 2050. The key to the Danish success is its integrated approach combining water management, climate change and urbanization, said Tanya Jacobsen, project manager at State of Green, which arranged the press tour.“The water supply in Denmark is decentralized to the local level and water prices are set by the government,” she said. “Despite being relatively expensive compared to other countries, the price reflects costs of taxation, groundwater protection, abstraction, distribution and wastewater treatment.”Preparing for the changing climate, urban drainage capacity has been strengthened by combining canals, lakes and retention basins, and recreational areas and green corridors were added to help cool the city and increase biodiversity.

The Chinese-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has recently gained traction as major Western economies, including Britain, Germany and France, decided to join. South Korea, a close ally of the U.S. in Asia, has said it will make a decision by the end of this month. The end of March is the deadline set by China for interested parties to become members of the AIIB. Many experts see the bank as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank which have been dominated by the United States and other Western economies.""We will make an announcement on joining the AIIB sometime this week or early next week,"" said the source, who is in regular contact with Chinese officials over the matter. It has not been decided yet how much of a stake South Korea would have in the AIIB, according to the source. ""Once the announcement is made, we will begin negotiations with member states of the AIIB over our stake,"" the source said. China has offered $50 billion and seeks a reported stake of up to 50 percent in the AIIB, which South Korea views negatively because China could make unilateral decisions in the bank's operations.Details of the AIIB are still sketchy, but the source said European countries would have a combined 25-percent stake in the AIIB. So far, about 30 countries have decided to join the AIIB and they will hold a working-level meeting in Kazakhstan later this month, the source said.On Sunday, Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli dismissed concerns about the governance structure and decision-making process of the AIIB, saying it will follow ""internationally accepted rules.""The U.S. has been negative about the Chinese push, interpreted as an attempt to bolster its economic clout in Asia. The U.S. has called for transparency and high standards of governance as key requirements for such an institution.""The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund initiated by China are also very important, and they will follow internationally accepted rules in their operations,"" said Zhang, who ranks seventh in China's ruling Communist Party hierarchy, told the China Development Forum in Beijing. ""As you know, many countries have expressed their willingness to participate in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which fully shows how attractive this market is,"" Zhang said. ""We welcome investors from all countries.""

Some estimates have said size of prospective projects to be pursued by Middle East countries could reach as high as $750 billion won over the long haul.""By forging close ties and meeting specific development demands, South Korea could generate a new growth momentum for itself,"" said the finance ministry, which coordinates economic policies. The foremost plan is for South Korean companies to move up the value added chain in the overseas industrial plant sector with the goal of securing at least $70 billion in fresh orders this year and $80 billion in 2016.Last year, South Korean builders won $66 billion worth of orders abroad with the bulk of the mega projects coming from the Middle East.""Emphasis will be on greatly increasing financial support for local builders so they can engage in so-called investment development projects,"" Deputy Finance Minister Jeong Eun-bo said.Such projects require the builder to become an investor in the project, allowing it to partake in earnings and play a role in management instead of just acting as building contractors.The government will earmark an extra 5 trillion won ($4.43 billion) in funds to help local companies secure such projects. It will get financial institutions to set aside 300 billion won worth of ""joint loan guarantees"" that will mainly go to helping small and medium-sized builders. Lenders will make available 1 trillion won worth of indirect lending to all companies wanting to expand abroad.There will also be larger credit lines and multilateral development bank loans that can be used to win orders.Notable projects include two or more System-integrated Modular Advanced Reactors in Saudi Arabia that would invigorate South Korea's atomic energy exports that have made slow progress in the past few years. The SMART plan could also permit South Korea and the Middle East kingdom to jointly export the reactor to other countries. The reactors have one-tenth the output of conventional commercial power plants, with many countries considering such units.Besides construction and plant exports, the government said it will meet the steadily rising demand for halal foods, whose global market reached $1.08 trillion in 2012 and is expected to grow to $1.62 trillion in 2018, roughly 17.4 percent of the global total.Halal foods refer to products consumed by Muslims under Sharia law that are prepared in a specific way according to Islamic customs.""As of last year, South Korean firms shipped out $680 million worth of halal products, but it aims to increase this by setting up a specialized production complex that can better allow supervision,"" the official said. The goal is to export $1.23 billion worth of halal foods in 2017.The government said it will also hone in on expanding ties in the service sector through at least 150 billion won in funds to support health and medical related projects in the second half of this year. Medical services are promising because Middle East countries have far smaller numbers of doctors per capita than other countries and one-tenth the number of hospital beds compared with South Korea. For cultural contents, a 200 billion won fund will be created to promote joint projects.For foreign investment, the government said the goal for 2015 was to attract at least one service-oriented investment region in the country while drastically slashing existing restrictions to attract more investments. In the past, foreign direct investments have been centered on manufacturing.The government plans to incorporate 14 new service businesses as being eligible for tax breaks.Related to FDI, the finance ministry said the Saemangeum reclamation region in the southeastern part of the country will become a special development project with various incentives to overseas investors.The region, covering 409 square kilometers of land, is idyllically situated across the Yellow Sea to be used as a launching base for companies interested in selling products to or operating in China.""The region will be given favors in the hiring of foreign workers and immigration rules, as well as a host of financial benefits and easing of building and development rules,"" Jeong said.The government will ease requirements for permanent residence visas for foreigners who work in key research and development fields, the official said.At present, such visas are given only if a person resides in the country for five years, but this may be lowered to three.The easing of rules can encourage immigration of highly qualified workers, especially since the country's population growth is slowing down.The government hopes that closer ties with the Middle East will help South Korean nationals find more work abroad. In 2014, some 5,000 workers were sent abroad, with the goal to double the number by 2017.Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said after the meeting that dispatching of workers to the Middle East is promising because these countries already rely extensively on outsiders for its industrial sectors.""These countries can become an outlet for South Korean job seekers with skills in nuclear power generation, IT and medical expertise,"" the policymaker said.The industry ministry said it plans to spend some 12.4 trillion won on safety infrastructure projects in 2015, with money going to improving safety standards and into the development of cutting-edge technologies.""Because locally built reactors, as well as other plants, will be going online, such facilities can hire South Korean safety workers, which can help with employment,"" said Park Chung-won, deputy minister of industrial policy.Large local companies will invest some 3 trillion won, or 700 billion won more on-year, in safety technology this year, aiming to export some of the technology and know-how to the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

138,138,S.

The seasonally adjusted jobless rate also rose 0.5 percentage point, from 3.4 percent to 3.9 percent.   There were some 1.2 million people without jobs, compared to 988,000 the month before.  The latest rate is the highest since February 2010. The statistical office said seasonal factors usually cause numbers to rise in the month.  ""February is a month when students are on school break and when people graduate, so it invariably affects unemployment numbers,"" said Sim Won-bo, head of the agency's employment statistics division. Unemployment is calculated by the number of people who want jobs but have been unable to find employment.  Sim said that while unemployment has risen, so have the number of jobs and the total number of people with jobs.   The job market had improved unusually for the better in February 2014, adding 835,000 jobs, and the employment rate managed to increase in February this year as well, gaining 376,000 positions, a strong sign of the state of the job market, the official said. Last month's number is higher than the 347,000 jobs created in January.   Sim also pointed out that national employment numbers topped 25.19 million last month, the highest reading for February since the government started keeping monthly employment statistics in July 1982.  The unemployment rate for young people between 15 and 29 measured at 11.1 percent in February, up significantly from 9.2 percent a month earlier. The February figure for the age group represents the highest monthly tally since corresponding data began to be compiled in 2000, and is the 18th consecutive monthly increase.  The labor underutilization indicator hit 12.5 percent last month, the highest reading since the government started checking such data last May.  This indicator is based on guidelines made by the International Labor Organization and reflects the number of people who are ""underemployed"" and those who currently hold part-time jobs but want full-time work.   It also counts unemployed people who have given up looking for work not by choice but due to circumstances, which makes them potential job seekers. A rise in this number is an indication that employment conditions felt by ordinary people are worse than what official jobless figures show.   The agency started to provide the indicator to provide a more accurate picture of the country's labor market situation.  The finance ministry claimed that February showed a rise in both unemployment and the total number of jobs.  ""There is an upward momentum in the job market with manufacturing and services fueling growth and offsetting losses in the farming, fisheries and financial sectors,"" it said.  It argued that even while unemployment did rise, so did the employment rate for all people over 15 that stood at 58.8 percent, a 0.2 percentage point gain from a year earlier.  For the young job seekers, the ministry cited a ""mismatch"" between the large number of college graduates and a relatively lower number of positions available for such well-educated people.  About 70 percent of South Korean youths receive college education and above. This is much higher than 53 percent for Germany and 52 percent for Japan.  The job market is rigid, in part preventing the hiring of young people, and the government will try to push for labor market reforms and introduce hiring schemes that allow students to find work while still at school, the ministry said.  The government has been trying to introduce more flexibility into the job market by reducing the privileges of regular workers, while at the same time correcting low pay and the issue of less job security for non-regular workers.

More than 800 micrograms leads to a yellow dust warning.  People are advised to stay indoors when yellow dust advisories or warnings are in place. When going outside, they are advised to wear protective glasses and yellow-dust masks.  As of 4 a.m., Seoul's atmospheric concentration levels of ""particulate matter (PM)-10"" pollutants soared to 1,044 micrograms per cubic meter. This marks the worst yellow dust that has hit the peninsula during a winter season since Dec. 25, 2009, when the level recorded 963 micrograms.  PM-10 refers to airborne particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter. Epidemiological evidence indicates that exposure to such pollutants causes cardiac and respiratory problems, according to experts.   This also is the fourth highest level since the authorities began filing records for fine dust concentration.  Yellow dust warnings had previously been in place in Seoul five times -- in March 2002, April 2002, April 2006, December 2009 and November 2010.  Monday's yellow dust was the result of the combination of low precipitation and low pressure in the deserts in southern Mongolia and northern China where the dust mainly originates from as well as a strong northwesterly wind, the KMA said.  The weather office forecast that the yellow dust will gradually weaken starting in the afternoon. Light yellow dust is expected to continue in some areas until Tuesday, it added.

High winds whipped through the area. The civil defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were no reports of deaths or injuries. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.The Marina area is home to dozens of towering apartment blocks and hotels, many of them built over the past decade. The apartments are popular with Dubai's large number of expatriate professionals. Police blocked off areas around the Torch, which still had power. Lights were on in many of the apartments inside and multiple fire trucks and police vehicles were on the scene.Residents of at least one neighboring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution because of strong winds, but they were later allowed back inside. Two residents of the Torch said they were told the fire started around the 52nd floor. Flaming material falling from the initial fire then set a lower part of the building ablaze, they said. One of the residents, Steve Short, 53, of Liverpool, England, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly. He said fire alarms alerted residents to the blaze and building management sent workers knocking on doors to ensure residents got out. Resident R.J. Morlock, 33, of Houston, shot video on his phone that showed bright yellow flames reaching what appeared to be several stories on two separate parts of the building.  He said residents were nervous coming out but fire crews were able to bring the situation under control. ""I was really surprised they got it under control pretty quickly,"" he said. ""It looked like it was going to go up.""The Torch opened in 2011 and is one of the world's tallest residential towers, according to developer Select Group.","fire early saturday in dubai ,tallest residential towers caught fire ,towers caught fire early saturday ,skyscrapers debris from the fire ,residential towers caught fire early","['DUBAI', 'United Arab Emirates', 'AP', 'Dubai', 'Torch', 'Debris', 'Dubai', 'Torch', 'Torch', 'Steve Short', 'Liverpool', 'England', 'Resident R.J.

Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) saying in its latest assessment that the North's food production is estimated at 5.94 million tons in 2014, compared to the 5.93 million tons in 2013-2014.That represents the highest level since the North's economic collapse in the mid-1990s.Experts on North Korea's agricultural sector have said that the increase in the country's food production is attributable to agricultural reform measures that center on allowing farmers to keep at least one third of their harvests.""The FAO assessment of North Korean food production is consistent with anecdotal reports that North Korea has made productivity improvements in recent years and that the North Korean economy is stable if not growing slowly,"" Snyder said in an article on the CFR's website.""This means that North Korea's two-pronged policy of simultaneous economic and nuclear development is showing some modest results on the economic side. The problem is that the nuclear priority remains in place and North Korea's efforts to develop missile and nuclear programs continue to proceed unchecked,"" he said.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has made the so-called ""Byeongjin"" policy one of the country's biggest goals, pledging to rebuild the moribund economy while forging ahead with its nuclear program. South Korea, the United States and other nations have claimed the policy is a nonstarter, saying the North cannot rebuild its economy as long as it holds on to its nuclear ambitions. American officials have often said the North ""can't have its cake and eat it, too.""""North Korea's apparent economic progress is bad news for those who expect increased sanctions to be decisive in driving North Korea to make a strategic choice to give up its nuclear weapons,"" Snyder said.

""They said they would design my face to look like a South Korean, and help me design a new nose, lips and chin, but (afterwards) when my friends saw my nose they were all shocked. They said it was crooked (and) ugly,"" Chen said.Seoul on Friday announced a crackdown on illegal brokers and unregistered clinics in a bid to protect medical tourists, especially those drawn by the country's huge plastic surgery industry.The country is a cultural powerhouse in Asia -- its soap operas and pop music videos are massively popular in China and often feature cosmetically-enhanced stars.While China's domestic plastic surgery market is worth tens of billions of dollars, persistent safety concerns are driving growing numbers of wealthy consumers abroad.South Korea has pushed hard to foster its so-called ""medical tourism"" industry, which was worth the equivalent of nearly $360 million in 2013, according to official figures.China topped the medical tourist list with more 25,400 visitors, an increase of 70 percent from the previous year, the South Korean health ministry said.Chinese tourists generally pay more than twice as much as locals for cosmetic procedures, Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly reported this month.Dozens of South Korean clinics have Chinese-language websites, some offering surgery alongside sightseeing vacations, with promotions offered during Chinese holidays.One clinic promises to provide ""almond shaped eyes"" and a ""magical V-shaped face"" -- considered the ideal of feminine beauty in much of East Asia, another is seemingly full of glowing testimonials from past patients.While most procedures in South Korea appear to occur without incident, last month attention focused on the industry after a 50-year-old Chinese woman was left in a coma by a clinic in Seoul's up-market Gangnam district.As much as a third of Chinese patients' costs can go towards fees for brokers who act as liaisons for the hospitals, Chen said after making initial enquiries she was contacted ""incessantly"" by an agent and felt cajoled into having the surgery.She spent more than $26,000 dollars on the surgery in 2010 at the Beauty Line clinic in Seoul. One of her procedures involved having cartilage taken from her chest and added to her nose to make it more prominent. But upon returning to China, she began to suffer from nasal infections. Now staying at a clinic in Beijing she says her mental health suffered and she is taking 12 antidepressants each day.""I've lost sleep, I can't meet with friends, and I suffer from depression, because my nose is just too ugly,"" she said.""I feel tricked. I think the industry is protected by (South Korea's) government, because its a key source of revenue,"" she added.Park Ji-Hye, an official at South Korea's health ministry, told AFP that ""activities involving illegal brokers and inflated fees, as well as disputes over malpractice, are sparking complaints from foreign patients"".Hoping to bring the industry into line, authorities last Friday declared owners of unregistered facilities treating foreign patients could be punished with jail sentences.""Some clinics are treating Chinese patients without a state license allowing them to treat foreign patients, because obviously that's where the money is,"" said Cho Soo-Young, spokesman of the association of Korean plastic surgeons.Back in China, an online support group made up of hundreds of victims of alleged botched cosmetic procedures conducted in South Korea, has begun a campaign to highlight the problems.""You start to believe that cosmetic surgery is something magical that can change your life. We have to take some responsibility ourselves, for not understanding the industry, and being too trusting."" said group organiser Jin Weikun.But many women in the group added that clinics had not warned them of potential risks. Winnie Wang, 45, said she was ""devastated, cried and even attempted suicide"" after an operation in 2013 left her with unequally sized eyes.Yu Lijun, a designer, underwent one of the most controversial procedures at Seoul's Faceline clinic -- ""double-jaw"" surgery -- which involves cutting the bone to produce a slimmer jawline. Today her mouth is visibly misaligned, making it hard to eat and prompting her to wear a facemask at all times.Mi Yuanyuan, a Chinese actress, said a 2013 operation at the same clinic left her with regular pain in her nose, as well as numbness and hair-loss on her forehead.""They said there weren't any risks,"" the 38-year-old said. ""They said the surgeon was as famous as the Hermes bag I was carrying.""But Faceline disputed this saying Yu had been through two botched surgeries in China that had left her mouth crooked before coming to them for help fixing it. ""We sent Yu back several times because the risk was too big but eventually decided to treat her after her repeated pleas for weeks,"" the clinic said in a statement, adding that she did not follow post-surgery care instructions.It also said Mi had signed a pre-surgery statement acknowledging potential side effects to her procedures.Beauty Line, which is licensed to treat foreign patients, said it could not locate the file of a patient named Chen Yili, as its records are in Korean and do not contain patients' names in Chinese. The company did not return calls from AFP after being contacted by a reporter with proof of Wang's history at the clinic.   (AFP)","paid south korean hospital thousands ,south korea booming medical tourism ,two botched surgeries in china ,chinese women who claim shoddy ,chinese actress said 2013 operation","['chinese', 'Chen Yili', 'south korean', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Chen', 'Seoul', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Southern Weekly', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam', 'chinese', 'Chen', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Beijing', ""South Korea 's"", 'Park Ji - Hye', ""South Korea 's"", 'AFP', 'chinese', 'Cho Soo - Young', 'korean', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Jin Weikun', 'Winnie Wang', 'Yu Lijun', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Yu', 'China', 'Beauty Line', 'Chen Yili', 'korean', 'AFP', 'Wang', 'AFP']",7,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.34996504  0.3073855

Norway’s out-of-wedlock fertility rate was 55 percent, while Ireland’s was 64.1 percent in the same year. Meanwhile, Japan’s rate was 2.2 percent. “South Korea and Japan are countries where most people do not choose to have children unless they are married,” said researcher Cho Sung-ho from KIHASA.“This is why marriage is a very important factor in the countries’ fertility rates.”The number of Koreans who put off marriage has increased dramatically. According to Statistics Korea, 50.2 percent of Korean men born between 1976 and 1980 were single for the period of 2006 to 2010, while only 13.9 percent of those born between 1956 and 1960 were single when they were the same age.On the other hand, only 5.3 percent of Korean women born from 1956 to 1960 were single in their early 30s, while 29.1 percent of those born from 1976 to 1980 were unmarried at the same age. One of the main reasons many here are delaying their marriage is the high cost of housing and weddings. According to the local wedding consulting firm Duowed, Korean couples spent an average of 238 million won ($216,000) on their wedding ceremonies and housing in the past two years. On average, men shouldered 64 percent of the total cost. Cho mentioned in his report that modern South Korean demographics ― a low fertility rate and an aging society ― are similar to those experienced by Japan. According to Cho, about 20 percent of all Japanese men, and 10 percent of Japanese women, were single as of 2010. “Japan’s two-decade-long period of economic stagnation resulted in a growing number of people who chose to live alone,” he said. “As the South Korean economy is expected to experience slow growth, we may be following in Japan’s footsteps.”According to Cho, Japan tries to help young, single job seekers find jobs as part of its measures to boost its fertility rate. South Korea’s demographic policies, on the other hand, have mostly focused on married couples who do not have children.“It is necessary to support young people so they can experience dating, marriage and childbirth without too many difficulties,” Cho wrote. “In order to do that, creating quality jobs and support programs for job seekers must be introduced as part of measures to tackle the country’s low fertility rate.”South Korea’s birthrate stood at 1.18 children per woman last year ― the lowest among OECD member countries.

""We have received confirmation from our partners in Pyongyang that the Arirang Mass Games will not be taking place this year,"" Young Pioneer Tours, a China-based travel agency specialized in trips to the isolated North, said in a brief release posted on its website Saturday.The Arirang Mass Games are highly choreographed shows where tens of thousands of performers stage a spectacular display of acrobatics, gymnastics, dances and flip-card mosaic animations. Though the agency did not elaborate on reasons for the cancellation, the decision comes amid the North's strict quarantine measures against the Ebola epidemic. Apparently in a move to prevent the deadly virus from spreading into the country, North Korea has barred foreign tourists from visiting the nation since last October.""We have been working closely with our partners in North Korea in regards to when the current Ebola travel restriction will be lifted and tourism to the DPRK will resume as normal,"" the tour company said in a separate release. DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Saying that it is expecting the borders ""to reopen very soon within the coming weeks,"" the company said ""other exciting and unique events"" will be held this year in the North such as the Pyongyang Marathon in April and the huge celebrations later this year of the 70th anniversary of Liberation Day and Party Foundation Day.After last taking place in 2013, the Arirang Mass Games were canceled last year without any official reasons, though observers speculate that it may have had to do with renovation work at the event venue the May Day Stadium, in Pyongyang, or possible preparations for new programs.

The policy comes in apparent efforts to improve relations with Cuba following a recent breakthrough in the nation’s Cold War standoff with the U.S.Seoul’s Foreign Ministry clinched an agreement with the World Food Program for the three-year project on the sidelines of the agency’s executive board meeting in Rome on Tuesday. The organization made a proposal early last year in line with its “Zero Hunger” initiative. “The latest food security program has significance as our first ever development cooperation project with Cuba at the government level,” the ministry said in a statement.“We expect to make a meaningful contribution to Cuba’s economic and social development by distributing food to the underprivileged while helping the country lay the foundation to secure food self-sufficiency.” Cuba is one of the four countries with which South Korea has no official diplomatic relations, severed since Fidel Castro took power and established a communist government through the 1959 Cuban Revolution. The Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency runs a small office in the capital, currently. The Caribbean island country has instead nurtured a close partnership with Pyongyang. In July 2013, Panamanian authorities intercepted a North Korean vessel carrying arms from Cuba, which constituted a breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions.Yet Seoul has apparently been looking to rewrite the bilateral relationship after Washington made a historic move in December to end more than 50 years of hostility and restore ties with Havana.On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said at the National Assembly that he will “pursue normalization of the relationship” with Cuba. With a major international book fair set to kick off in Havana this week, the ministry is sending a delegation of officials for the first time, alongside novelists and poets. Kim Dong-ki, director general for cultural affairs at the agency, is scheduled to discuss ways to expand cultural exchanges on Friday with Alfredo Ruiz Roche, director general for external relations at Cuba’s culture ministry. In November, the ministry also supplied $1 million worth of personal protective equipment to Cuban medical workers stationed in Sierra Leone and elsewhere through the World Health Organization to help fight the Ebola spread.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","hunger initiative the latest food ,havana on tuesday foreign minister ,2013 panamanian authorities intercepted north ,provide cuba with million billion ,meeting in rome on tuesday","['South Korea', 'Cuba', 'central american', 'Cuba', 'the U.S.Seoul ’s', 'Foreign Ministry', 'the World Food Program', 'Rome', 'Cuba', 'Cuba', 'Cuba', 'South Korea', 'Fidel Castro', 'the Korea Trade - Investment Promotion Agency', 'Pyongyang', 'panamanian', 'north korean', 'Cuba', 'U.N.

In the evaluation, South Korea ranked 29th with 71.5 points, classified as “mostly (economically) free.” Those with scores of 80 or higher are listed as “free.” Hong Kong with 89.6 points topped the list, followed by Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Switzerland. The U.S. ranked 12th ― right above the U.K. ― with 76.2 points.Since the index was incepted in 1995, Pyongyang has remained at the bottom of the list. The index evaluates four policy areas affecting economic freedom: rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency and open markets. It also looks into 10 areas of freedom such as labor freedom, monetary freedom and trade freedom.In the 2014 Democracy Index released by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis wing of the British magazine the Economist, North Korea ranked 167th ― the lowest level ― getting 1.08 points with 10 being the perfect score. The North has been at the bottom of the rankings seven times since 2006.With Asia’s average score being 3.65, far lower than the world’s average of 5.5, Japan ranked first in Asia with 8.08 points, followed by South Korea with 8.06 points. Norway topped the global list with 9.93 points, followed by Sweden, Iceland, New Zealand and Demark. The U.S. ranked 19th with 8.11 points. The Democracy index evaluates five major areas: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. The index categorizes countries into one of four types of regimes: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes and authoritarian regimes. North Korea experts largely concur that such negative evaluations may not further raise political pressure on Pyongyang, given that the flow of information from outside is tightly controlled, and the regime has long resisted foreign values and norms.But in the long run, there could be some negative ramifications on the North’s efforts to shore up its moribund economy, as the indices have long underscored the unpredictability and opaque nature of the regime.“These indices are not slapping the North with sanctions or anything like that,” said Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies of Seoul National University.“But we can’t say that there would be no negative impact, given that these adverse evaluations could get in the way of the North pushing to attract foreign investments and expand development projects with other countries.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","north korea dictatorial state governance ,economist north korea ranked 167th ,have highlighted north korea dictatorial ,highlighted north korea dictatorial ,highlighted north korea dictatorial state","['North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the u.s.-based Heritage Foundation', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'Cuba', 'South Korea', 'Hong Kong', 'Singapore', 'New Zealand', 'Australia', 'Switzerland', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'Pyongyang', 'the Economist Intelligence Unit', 'british', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'Iceland', 'New Zealand', 'Demark', 'U.S.', 'Democracy', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'Song Sang - ho']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77889681  0.52616531

Single-person households had the second-highest poverty rate ― 47. 2 percent ― among all groups of people, including children, the employed and single-parent households, in 2013.The statistics are alarming as the number of the elderly, as well as single and two-person households, has increased dramatically here over the last 20 years. Koreans aged 65 or older accounted for 12.6 percent of the total population in 2013, and the proportion of the elderly is forecast to exceed 20 percent by 2026 and 50 percent by 2100.Meanwhile, 48.2 percent of all Korean households in 2010 consisted of one or two people, according to KIHASA. Last year, they made up 49.9 percent of all families in Seoul. The Seoul Metropolitan Government predicts that more than 60 percent of Seoul families will be single or two-person households, including single-parent families, by 2035.Notably, the poverty rate of households with female heads of the family was 32.4 percent in 2013, the third highest among all groups of Koreans, while the rate of single-parent households was the fourth highest at 18.5 percent. “From this research, we found that the elderly, single-person households, households with female heads of the family and single-parent households are the most vulnerable to poverty among all Koreans,” wrote KIHASA researcher Im Wan-seob in the report. “Antipoverty programs are needed for these groups and their specific needs.”According to Statistics Korea, less Koreans think it is one’s responsibility to support one’s aging parents financially.In 1998, almost 90 percent of the country’s population thought family members must take care of and support their aging parents, but only 33.2 percent of the population thought so in 2012.The poverty rate of South Korean children was 7.9 percent in 2013, while the rate for the employed was 7.8 percent the same year.

All imports of birds and poultry products from Australia had been discontinued in late 2012 after an outbreak of AI was reported in the country, and the ban was maintained when the virus re-emerged in October 2013. Canberra later requested that Seoul lift its ban after it declared itself AI-free in line with World Organization for Animal Health standards early last year. Imports of Australia-bred birds have not been significant so far.

The respondents said the lack of options was the main reason they would take the nonregular job, with 43.3 percent saying “getting a job at any rate is important” and 41.6 percent saying “there are not enough regular jobs.” “At first I had specific goals, such as to become a producer for a broadcasting station or a journalist. But now I just want to start working,” said Song Min-ho, a 30-year-old graduate of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. It has been nearly four years since he received his degree in English linguistics, yet he has yet to land a job.In the survey, 39.1 percent said the main thing they were looking for in a nonregular job was whether they could eventually become a regular worker.When asked if they thought it was difficult to become a regular worker, 94.4 percent of the respondents said “Yes.”According to Statistics Korea, it takes young workers ― those from the ages of 15-29 ― an average of 12 months to find their first job after entering the job market.

Over 91 million travelers visited the market last year, making it one of the most visited tourist attractions worldwide. Visitors can buy ceramics, lanterns, carpets, copperware, jewelry and other goods in the 600-year-old vaulted walkways. “To haggle like a pro, lowball your starting offer and don’t be afraid to walk away. And if it all gets overwhelming, break for a succulent doner kebab or strong cup of Turkish coffee,” tourism magazine Travel+Leisure says.The Olympos Cable Car in Antalya province in southern Turkey is the world’s one of longest aerial trams at 4.3 km. With the slogan “From Sea to Sky,” the tram offers a panoramic view of the Mediterranean Sea and Mount Olympos on its way to a mountaintop station at 2,365 meters above sea level. Tourists can hike, mountain climb and paraglide in the summer and ski in the winter, and gaze at the stars at night year-round. Last year, more than 2.8 million tourists visited ancient sites in Antalya province, which has 284 historical ruins; major sites include the Santa Claus Church in the Myra city, the Alanya Castle and the ancient city of Xanthos ― a UNESCO-protected area.Turkey’s Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs recently designated 527 areas in 81 provinces for nature tourism.

Bonuses paid to the 21 other plaintiffs lacked regularity and thus do not count, it said.A court ruling in favor of the unionists would have cost Hyundai Motor trillions of won. Experts estimate that the ruling, if it takes effect, will reduce the amount to around 11 billion won (US$10.19 million).It also smoothens the path for the automaker to go ahead with its large-scale 81 trillion won investment plan spanning over the next four years to build facilities and develop technologies.Since the two plaintiffs represent 5,700 employees who came from Hyundai Motor Service, which was consolidated with Hyundai Motor Co. back in late 1990s, all of them could be eligible to receive additional pay. The number accounts for just 11 percent of Hyundai Motor's 50,000-strong union.""The ruling is meaningful given that it could provide a benchmark to resolve the earlier controversy surrounding the ordinary wage,"" a Hyundai Motor official said on condition of anonymity. ""Moving away from the ineffective seniority-based pay structure, we need to place our focus on coming up with a globally competitive advanced wage system.""Hyundai Motor's labor union said the court's decision was ""disappointing,"" adding that it will decide whether to appeal the ruling after discussions with its members.Controversy over the ordinary pay issue flared up after the Supreme Court ruled late in 2013 that bonuses should be viewed as part of a worker's standard wages if given on a regular, uniform and periodic basis. The ordinary wage refers to a fixed amount paid regularly to an employee, and it is used as the basis for calculating employee benefits, such as overtime pay, paid annual leave, severance pay and other allowances. The business community has been watching the ruling closely since it could provide a direction for similar debate going on at many other businesses, which could face a sharp increase in salaries that they have to pay their workers. The Federation of Korean Industries, a major business lobby group comprised of large conglomerates, welcomed the court ruling, saying that it provided a clear-cut decision on the issue and would help stop similar lawsuits. It still expressed concerns that the ruling could cause fresh confrontation and conflict among workers since it applices to only some of the workers. Shares of Hyundai Motor closed at 171,000 won, down 2.01 percent from a day earlier, underperforming the benchmark KOSPI's 1.36 percent drop.

The reactor has since been turned off for a review of its safety.The state-run Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS) in October had completed an inspection of the reactor and concluded that it can operate for another 10 years. On Thursday, a group of minor opposition lawmakers and a coalition of environmental groups staged a protest rally outside the commission's office, demanding an immediate and permanent shutdown of the reactor. They questioned the transparency of the government's inspection.""(The government) should shut down the Wolseong reactor, because its life span expired and safety is not guaranteed,"" they said in a statement issued at a joint press conference in downtown Seoul. ""It is absurd to extend the life span without clearing safety concerns.""South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply, and is building several more. In 2007, the government extended by 10 years the life span of the 580-megawatt Gori No. 1 lightwater reactor that began commercial operations in 1977. The Wolseong No. 1 is the first heavywater reactor under review for a possible extension of its life span.The state power operator, Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. (KHNP), said the life span of the Wolseong reactor should be extended, given the long time and huge money needed to build a new plant.""It is necessary to make use of reactors for a long period considering environmental costs and other burdens, and the country's chronic energy shortages,"" the KHNP said in a statement, adding it hopes for the extension plan to be approved at the next meeting.

""But currently, nothing has been decided over the issue.""South Korea's ministry of food and drug safety has the final say on deciding whether to remove the ban.His remarks come amid growing calls to improve the stagnant bilateral relations that have been beset by Japan's refusal to face up to its wartime history. Seoul and Tokyo are trying to mend ties first in non-political sectors.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of Seoul-Tokyo ties. Korea was under Japan's colonial rule from 1910-45.Noh Kwang-il, spokesman at the foreign ministry, said that Seoul will decide whether to ease the ban based on scientific evidence and public safety consideration.Touching on China's move to set up an infrastructure development bank, the official said that South Korea is carefully weighing the merits of joining the bank.Since late October, China has clinched preliminary deals with more than 20 countries to establish the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that will be used to finance massive development projects in Asia.China is seeking to set up the bank as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank, led by the United States and Japan. Seoul has been wary of joining the bank so far, saying that details about the governance structure need to be clarified.""If Seoul joins the bank, it may have to chip in about 1 trillion won ($923.7 million). The government is carefully considering whether to join it by gauging what actual benefits we can get,"" the official said.The U.S. remains seen as uncomfortable with Seoul's possible move to join the AIIB as it believes China's move to set up the bank is aimed at raising its economic clout in Asia.South Korea has been explaining to Washington that Seoul could face burdens in doing its diplomacy with other Asian countries if it stays away from the AIIB, given that infrastructure projects in Asia require massive financing.

The paper, published in November in the journal by the country’s Academy of Social Science, also indicated the communist country’s resolve to kick-start an ambitious yet dormant project to lay a natural gas pipeline and railway through North Korea to the South. “The development of the Tumen River and surrounding regions has emerged as a key item for economic cooperation among the countries in Northeast Asia over the some 20 years since the 1990s,” the report reads. “The establishment of an oil and natural gas pipeline and the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the Trans-Korea Railway is another cooperative project that is gaining attention.” The report reflects Pyongyang’s efforts to shore up its faltering economy amid international sanctions imposed over its nuclear tests and missile launches. Other multilateral initiatives such as for a special industrial zone in border regions with China remain languid. Yet it also stressed the need to defuse tension on the peninsula for greater inter-Korean economic cooperation, pointing to international sanctions, U.S. forces in South Korea and the allies’ annual military exercises. “The North and South need to expel external forces of the U.S. from the peninsula, realize a reunification under the ideology of ‘uriminzokkiri (among our people)’ and carry out tasks that would contribute to a unification,” the publication said. Seoul, for its part, has set its sights on regional economic collaboration under President Park Geun-hye’s “Eurasia Initiative” through an integrated Eurasia power grid and a logistics network also covering China, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. But it faces mounting challenges such as lingering tension, economic uncertainty and risks of depending on the recalcitrant North.

South Korea's ODA to Bolivia amounted to an estimated $4.64 million in 2014, accounting for 0.22 percent out of the total ODA that Seoul extended that year.Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said that his country is in need of foreign investment, expressing hope that robust technical assistance from Seoul will be helpful for its development.""I hope that bilateral cooperation with South Korea could help achieve Bolivia's national development goals,"" Choquehuanca told a group of reporters in Seoul. ""I'm sure that South Korea's assistance will help us attain a set of goals such as poverty eradication and stable supply of energy and drinking water.""South Korea has become the first country in the world that has transformed into an aid donor country from a recipient nation. Seoul's ODA to underdeveloped countries will rise nearly 5 percent this year to 2.38 trillion won ($2.18 billion).""South Korea and Bolivia have something in common historically as the two nations suffered from foreign powers' aggression in the past,"" Choquehuanca added. ""By further tapping on common grounds, I hope that people from the two countries get closer.""Bolivia is one of the 11-members of an intergovernmental organization that shares socialist ideology and hopes for deeper economic integration in Central and South America such as Cuba and Venezuela, named ""the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America.""Touching on Washington's move to normalize its ties with Cuba, Choquehuanca said he welcomed such a decision.Last month, the U.S. and Cuba agreed to restore their diplomatic ties in about 50 years in a surprise decision.""We respect other countries' diplomatic decision. Bolivia welcomes the agreement between the U.S. and Cuba,"" the foreign minister said, expressing hope that more progress could come between the two nations.His visit to Seoul came on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Bolivia.Choquehuanca, who arrived in Seoul Saturday for a three-day visit, held talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se earlier in the day. It marked the first time since 1996 that a Bolivian foreign minister visited Seoul.He expressed hope that South Korea could join on-going massive infrastructure projects in Bolivia including e-government development and the construction of international airports, according to Seoul's foreign ministry. In return, Yun proposed ways to widen cooperation so that Sucre can share with South Korea's technology and experience in such fields as the petrochemical industry and energy efficiency, it added.Yun also pledged that Seoul will expand necessary supports to Bolivia, one of 26 countries where Seoul has concentrated its ODA provision.Seoul and Sucre have decided to unveil commemorative stamps this year as an event to mark the anniversary, Choquehuanca noted.

The traded volume amounted to 1,190 tons of carbon emissions worth 9.74 million won.The market is only open to companies subject to the emission quota as well as three state-controlled lenders. During the starting stage from 2015 to 2017, companies under the emission target will receive carbon allowances for free.The KRX said it will operate the derivative market for shortened hours before extending them to full operation.""I expect that the carbon trading scheme will help (companies) effectively reduce carbon emissions and help the green industry grow,"" KRX Chairman Choi Kyung-soo said in an opening ceremony held at the Busan headquarters. ""(The KRX) will make efforts to develop the carbon market in the mid- and long-term, not focusing on the short-term market performance.""Market watchers expect thin trading for this year due to a lack of confidence in the new system and the flexible accounting system, saying that trading will pick up starting in 2018, when the second stage of the program begins after a three-year grace period.""As companies can carry forward or use allowances in advance, market participants are likely to wait and see in the early stage of trading,"" said Kim Sang-ku, a researcher at Kiwoom Securities.In the long term, however, the scheme will help expand the green energy market as South Korea, the world's seventh-largest carbon emitter, is facing growing pressure to join global efforts to tackle climate change, they said.""As carbon reduction capacity may emerge as one of the key competitiveness factors of individual companies, the eco-friendly and renewable energy market will grow in the long term,"" said Park Jong-seon, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co.

The country is breaking out of years of protectionist legacies to become a safe haven for investment and trade. Millions have moved out of poverty to form a fledgling middle class, ready and willing to splurge on consumer goods. After half a century of bloody armed conflicts with the guerrilla organization FARC, the clouds are finally parting with progress in the peace process.Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin’s recent visit to Korea from Jan. 6-7 reaffirmed both countries’ commitment to increase cooperation after a free trade agreement was signed in February 2013. As the first foreign minister to visit Korea under Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos’ government, Holguin met Korea’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, as well as Colombians studying and working in Korea, journalists and Korean business communities. “The purpose of my visit is to invigorate economic cooperation, which is expected to take off after the FTA comes into force this year, and to increase exchanges in educational and cultural areas,” Holguin said in an interview with The Korea Herald at Colombian coffee franchise Juan Valdez Cafe at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul last Wednesday.Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin (left) and Colombian Ambassador to Korea Tito Saul Pinilla pose after an interview with The Korea Herald in front of Colombian coffee franchise Juan Valdez Cafe at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul last Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“We are waiting for a constitutional review of the agreement, expected to be completed in a few months. As we are moving toward resolving a six-point agenda with the FARC, Colombia will be politically more stable and economically competitive.”With Korea’s traditional trade partners experiencing a slowdown in growth in recent years, rapidly developing South American economies are prompting a “pivot to South America” for Korean companies.After the free trade agreement was signed, ratification had been delayed as a result of stiff opposition by Colombia’s automobile and electronics sectors; but passed through parliament last year.Cars, automobile parts and synthetic resins make up the bulk of Korea’s exports to Colombia, and following lowered tariffs, exports of heavy construction equipment and materials, pharmaceutical products and medical equipment are expected to increase. The two countries became strategic partners in 2013, and there are currently 36 Korean companies operating in Colombia with cumulative investments of over $70 million.The Colombian government has been at the forefront of attracting foreign investment to steer national development, targeting areas of job creation, infrastructure, energy and environment, among others. The International Monetary Fund forecast Colombia’s economy to grow 4.5 percent this year, maintaining the healthy average 4 percent pace of the last 10 years. “As a country with a large territory facing both the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, Colombia has huge demands for building its countryside through infrastructure development,” Holguin said. “Korean companies will make a fortune by building roads, airports, harbors, bridges and railways, and can use Colombia’s strategic location as an outpost to other Central and South American countries.”Colombia has rich natural resources of oil, coal, mineral fuel, natural gas and precious stones; and exports large quantities of pulp and paper, coffee, meat, cotton, sugars and other agricultural produce. Bilateral free trade will bring more Colombian fruits, meat and dairy products to Korea, Holguin said.Regarding the peace negotiations with armed rebel group FARC, Holguin said, “We have agreed on three points ― agricultural development, ending drug trafficking and political participation ― of the agenda and are negotiating the other three ― disarmament, compensating the victims and implementation of the peace deal.”The Colombian Embassy in Seoul said, “Colombia respects Korea’s rapid development experience, which it hopes to model its own growth. Latin American countries aspire to combine their natural and human resources with Korea’s expertise in science and technology, to add value to them and export.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","korean companies operating in colombia ,forecast colombia economy to grow ,seoul last wednesday colombian foreign ,bring more colombian fruits meat ,korea exports to colombia","['korean', 'Colombia', 'FARC', 'colombian', 'Maria Angela Holguin ’s', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'colombian', 'Juan Manuel', 'Holguin', 'Korea', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Colombians', 'Korea', 'korean', 'FTA', 'Holguin', 'the Korea Herald', 'colombian', 'Juan Valdez Cafe at', 'Seoul', 'colombian', 'Maria Angela Holguin', 'colombian', 'Korea', 'Tito Saul Pinilla', 'the Korea Herald', 'colombian', 'Juan Valdez Cafe at', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea Herald)“We', 'FARC', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'south american', 'korean', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'Colombia', 'korean', 'Colombia', 'colombian', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'Colombia', 'Colombia', 'Holguin', 'korean', 'Colombia', 'Central and south american', 'colombian', 'Korea', 'Holguin', 'FARC', 'Holguin', 'colombian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'latin american', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",15,"[ 0.          0.          5.         ... -0.466171    0.84334028

Seoul plans to send 20 other medical workers to the West African country in the coming months.South Korea has joined global efforts to fight Ebola by sending medical workers and offering a combined US$12.6 million in assistance.

Such mandatory imports are subject to only a 5 percent tariff.   The tariff rate for non-mandatory imports must be agreed upon by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). South Korean officials say the process may take years, noting such a process for Taiwan took 57 months.   According to South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, five countries -- the U.S., China, Australia, Thailand and Vietnam -- have filed a complaint with the WTO, arguing that the offered tariff rate for non-mandatory imports is too high.   South Korean officials said these countries hold a special interest in Seoul's rice market.   ""Of the countries that have raised an objection, four, except Vietnam, had jointly shared a country-specific quota of 200,000 tons per year in rice exports to South Korea under the MMA quota,"" Choi Seok-young, chief of the South Korean mission to Geneva, told reporters.    These four countries oppose South Korea's rice market opening as it has ceased the country-specific quota, meaning South Korea no longer is required to import rice from them.  Choi and the South Korean trade ministry assured that Seoul has no intention of making a concession, saying its tariff rate is more than reasonable when compared to those of Japan and Taiwan that liberalized their local rice markets before South Korea.  South Korea's 513 percent tariff is an ad valorem duty, which is tax based on the price of an article.   Taiwan and Japan, on the other hand, impose a specific tax, which fixes the amount of tax depending on the weight of rice imports.   ""Japan and Taiwan liberalized their rice markets with a specific tax, which at the time of their market opening translated into an ad valorem tax of over 1,000 percent,"" Choi told reporters.  The South Korean trade ministry said Seoul needs to reach an agreement with each and every one of the countries that have objected to the tariff rate before obtaining an official WTO approval.   ""The government will do its utmost to make sure the country's rice import tariff rate is fixed as it is, through negotiations with the countries that have filed a complaint,"" the ministry said.
