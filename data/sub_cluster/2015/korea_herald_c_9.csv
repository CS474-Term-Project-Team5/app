In a struggle to meet this schedule, the leadership of the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea had met on Sunday for a dead-end negotiation but in vain.Accordingly, the current constituency demarcation will lose legal effect, starting from Jan. 1. The NEC will also stop taking applications for candidate registration until a new electoral map is confirmed and effectuated.Preliminary candidates who have made their registration by Wednesday, however, will be temporarily allowed to carry on with their campaigns, according to the commission.The most plausible scenario is that Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa will authorize his power and submit a compromise draft to the constituency committee.Despite growing pressure from the ruling party and the presidential office, Chung has consistently refused to push ahead with the bill, urging for bipartisan agreement until the last minute.Chung’s draft is likely to conform to the current system, allocating 246 seats to local constituencies and 54 to proportional representatives.But there is still a chance that parties may reach a last-minute agreement on 253 regional seats and 47 proportional seats, in an effort to maximize the number of local candidates within the house.Meanwhile, it is the preliminary candidates of the opposition camp who are expected to face additional difficulties as they must now apply the party’s new name in their campaign materials.The main opposition party on Monday changed its title to the Minjoo Party of Korea, replacing New Politics Alliance for Democracy as part of a rebranding effort following scores of defections by key party members this month.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)","election watchdog said wednesday ,ultimatum on constituency remapping ,election watchdog ,deadline the nation election ,over redrawing the electoral",[],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54787368  0.40548062

Choi Kyung-hwan, the president’s top aide with a mission to sway parliamentary election nominations in favor of pro-Park figures.Choi is coming back to his third-term seat after his successor as finance minister was named in a Cabinet reshuffle Monday. He is expected to spearhead the faction loyal to President Park Geun-hye, and bracing for his return is the party’s chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who represents the “non-Park” faction.The power struggle between the two factions has already been vicious over a series of bills, leadership appointments and other party affairs. And the fight is likely to intensify over the party’s nomination rules for the April 13 general elections.The outnumbered pro-Park faction -- currently led by Supreme Council member Rep. Suh Chung-won -- has been pushing for wider strategic nominations not only in weak battlegrounds, such as the Jeolla provinces, but also in strong regions of metropolitan areas. Through this, the faction aims to expand its clout. Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung attends an event celebrating the holiday season on Tuesday. YonhapKim, on the other hand, remains steadfastly set on his defunct open primary project or something similar, vowing to keep the nomination as transparent as possible -- meaning more involvement of voters and ordinary party members and less influence from Park.Political pundits have said the anticipated power struggle within the Saenuri Party reflects the chronically backward politics of South Korea, where the months before each parliamentary elections are tainted with nomination struggles amid the lack of a fundamental system.“Saenuri Party has been enjoying steady approval ratings despite the low public popularity of the Park administration and the ruling camp in large part thanks to the internal feud at the opposition NPAD,” said Yoon Seong-yi, political professor at Kyung Hee University.“With Saenuri also falling into the same chaos, the party is likely to suffer a setback. This is the most representative case of Korea’s backward politics where those who seize power do not end up seeking fundamental improvements in the nomination process once they win,” he added.With Choi returning to the stage, the pro-Park faction is expected to align more systematically, having direct communication with Cheong Wa Dae through Choi and presidential aide on political affairs Hyun Ki-hwan.It has been the resolve of the pro-Park faction to build up the party base and eventually seek to hoist a pro-Park member as the party’s next chair. Kim’s tenure ends in July. The next chairperson has to take on the crucial task of leading the party through the 2017 presidential election.Kim, who has been dubbed as a likely candidate to run for president, is likely to resign from his position before the end of his term. Based on the party rules, a party chairperson cannot double as presidential candidate. The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, held the first meeting of its special committee on nomination rules Tuesday. Wary of the looming factional battle, the party members were seen to take a cautious approach in public.“It is hoped that (the members) will refrain from (making moves) that can be perceived as a factional problem by people,” said Rep. Hong Moon-pyo, the party’s first deputy secretary-general.Kim, for his part, began to meet with high profile potential parliamentary candidates, starting off with Ahn Dae-hee, former prime minister-nominee, who he met Tuesday.

A total of seven NPAD lawmakers have left the party since its leader Rep. Moon Jae-in took the helm in February. Among them, Reps. Moon Byeong-ho, Yoo Sung-yop, Hwang Ju-hong and Kim Dong-cheol quit the party in the wake of Ahn’s defection. They flanked Ahn at the press conference to show their support.The four dissenters expected that several more dissenting lawmakers would follow them, noting that Ahn’s burgeoning popularity in opinion polls would encourage the lawmakers to join Ahn’s camp -- particularly those representing the NPAD stronghold of South Jeolla province. “I think one or two NPAD lawmakers will leave this week,” said Moon Byung-ho. “I think (the NPAD lawmakers) are agonizing over their next move because Ahn’s approval ratings among voters in the Jeolla provinces has been soaring. The region will emerge as the center of a typhoon,” he added. Among the eight seats in Gwangju, the capital city of South Jeolla Province, the number of seats held by the NPAD was reduced to five as Reps. Chun Jung-bae, Park Joo-sun and Kim Dong-chul left the party. The remaining five are reportedly considering following suit, except for Rep. Kang Gi-Jung. By region, Ahn’s new party recorded the highest approval rating of 31 percent in Gwangju in a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on Monday. The polls showed that Ahn’s future party’s approval rating came in at third with 16.3 percent, following the NPAD’s 25.7 percent and the Saenuri Party’s 38.2 percent. While setting his new party’s objective of winning the 2017 presidential elections, Ahn vowed to create a third opposition group that can prevent the Saenuri Party from gaining more than 200 seats, the mark for an overwhelming majority in the Assembly, in the 2016 general elections. Observers noted that the fate of Ahn’s new political party would determine whether the third party would succeed in South Korea’s political landscape, where two major parties have mostly enjoyed supremacy against independents attempting to create a third party. Except for the late President Kim Dae-jung’s defection from the then-main opposition Democratic Party in 1995 -- he had created his own party, National Congress for New Politics, and emerged as the biggest opposition in the 1995 general elections -- the defectors’ attempt to replace the main opposition have failed. “Ahn’s new party will serve as a watershed moment for the Korean political system; whether it can transition from a two-party system to a multiparty system,” said Choi Jin, the chairman of the Institute of Presidential Leadership.“Due to the legacy of the military dictatorship, third parties have struggled to establish themselves and ended up being minor parties. But things have been changing in favor of the creation of a third party, as diverse voices are springing up in the pluralist Korean society,” said Choi. Other observers, such as Kim Jong-in, the former senior presidential secretary for economic affairs who lured Ahn into politics in 2011 when Ahn became popular among young voters, dismissed the possibility that Ahn’s new party would emerge as a significant political group in the elections. “In politics, image is not everything. I think Ahn has proved nothing since 2011. His new party would gain some seats in the South Jeolla Province and Seoul metropolitan areas. But the election would ultimately come down to the rivalry between the Saenuri Party and the NPAD,” said Kim in a media interview. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","opposition presidential candidate rep ,opposition presidential candidate ,monday announced his plan ,former opposition presidential candidate ,presidential candidate rep","['Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58811617  0.27535364

Korea Midland Power Co. has been running without a chairperson for six months, while KNOC did not have a CEO for four months, Korea South Power Co. for three months and Korea East-West Power Co. for the past month.Most recently, Korea Electric Power Corporation, the nation’s top utility company, was expected to look for someone to replace current president Cho Hwan-eik whose term ended on Dec 16. With the state companies accelerating the process for nominating their CEOs, industry observers speculated that the post would be filled with politicians who would be dropped from the political parties’ nomination for 2016 general elections. “As far as I know, the government has told us to begin the process of nominating the CEOs. If we can’t find a suitable person, the position could be filled with retired ministers or politicians who were denied opportunities to run for the elections,” an official from an energy company told the Korea Herald, wishing to remain anonymous. Officails receive submission from prospective candidates for the 2016 general elections. YonhapThough the committee at each company selects the final candidates for the leadership post, it has been an open secret that the government has a huge say in the process because the president appoints the nominees in accordance with the recommendation of the Industry Minister. The leadership positions for the state companies have often been held by the retired senior government officials and politicians from the ruling party. The post was considered a reward for the high-profile figures who were forced to end their careers in the government and politics.   For instance, Korea District Heating Corp.’s CEO Kim Sung-Hoi was a former lawmaker who had served between 2008 and 2012. Kim became the president of the heating company in 2013 after the ruling party rejected his candidacy for the 2012 general election.The barrier between public enterprises and political circles has been low, with many incumbent CEOs throwing their hats into the ring for the April 13 general election.To name two, Korea Airports Corporation President Kim Seok-ki and Incheon International Airport Corp. President Park Wan-su last week announced their resignations to run in the elections. Korea Broadcast Advertising Group President Koak Sung-moon, a former lawmaker, is also contemplating running. “I am afraid frequent leadership changes will compromise the companies’ competitiveness. We have to ensure the elected chiefs fulfill their legal terms” an anonymous retired government official who had worked for state-companies told the Korea Herald. The CEO of state companies’ legal term is three years. According to the study of 177 state companies released by civic group Citizens United for better Society in May, 72 companies has suffered from an average of 56 months vacancy for their leadership during the Park Geun-hye administration from 2013 to 2014.

Ahn Cheonl-soo, who had left the party over a power struggle with the current party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. They were the first to follow behind Ahn in leaving the party after several other dissenters retracted their initial decisions to defect and decided to stay for the sake of an opposition victory in next year’s general elections. Reps. Moon Byung-ho, Yoo Sung-yop, and Hwang Ju-hong -- who had warned of their defection since Ahn left the NPAD on Dec. 13 -- vowed to create a new opposition bloc with other dissenters who had already left the NPAD or are planning to quit the party. “We are leaving the NPAD to walk the path of victory and reunite the opposition bloc,” Moon said in a news conference at the National Assembly. “We will gather forces from the people who agree with us and create a new political group to realign the opposition bloc,” said Moon. But the prospects of their plan to rival the established parties remained to be seen as the majority of the NPAD dissenters, who have echoed the defectors’ criticism against the current NPAD leadership, were seen to be reluctant to follow their lead. Representatives Hwang Ju-hong (center), Moon Byung-ho (left) and Yoo Sung-yop talk to reporters after a press conference announcing their NPAD defection at the National Assembly on Thursday. YonhapExcept for Rep. Kim Dong-cheol, who is reportedly considering leaving the party, there have been no other NPAD lawmakers inside or outside the mainstream suggesting they would quit the party in the foreseeable future. Even Rep. Song Ho-chang, who had worked for Ahn’s presidential campaign in 2012, has decided to stay. As an opinion poll released by local pollster Realmeter showed Wednesday that the NPAD’s approval ratings were almost double that of Ahn’s prospective party, some dissenters cautioned that more defections would lead to a division of the opposition -- a scenario that has led to election defeats in the past. “South Korea’s political structure is based on two major political parties whose support comes from regional divisions,” said Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, another NPAD dissenter who decided to remain at the party. “Third parties have always raised hopes for a new kind of politics, but they often gave up midway,” said Kim.  For example, the divided opposition bloc suffered a crushing defeat in the 1996 general election as then-main opposition Democratic Party split into two opposition groups -- National Congress for New Politics and Unified Democratic Party. Mindful of the scenario, the three defectors have yet to outline their next move -- whether they will join forces with Ahn or other NPAD defectors, such as Rep. Chung Jung-bae, who has recently created his own minor party, or Rep. Park Joo-sun, who on Thursday stressed the imperativeness of the dissenters forming a single opposition bloc. Meanwhile, NPAD third-term lawmaker Rep. Choi Jae-sung announced Thursday that he would not run in the election. The move was considered to be in support of chairman Moon’s reform initiatives that he vowed to uphold in Wednesday’s press conference to keep the house in order.Moon has said he would adopt a bottom-up approach for nominating candidates for the 2016 general elections amid calls for the established NPAD members to forgo their run to make way for fresh faces. Moon had warned that NPAD lawmakers categorized in the bottom 20 percent in their job performance reviews would be deprived of the opportunity to stand for reelection. Among the dissenting lawmakers, Hwang and Yoo refused to undergo the review.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","three opposition lawmakers quit ,lawmakers thursday bolted from ,lawmakers quit npad three ,opposition lawmakers quit npad ,opposition lawmakers thursday bolted","['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Ahn Cheonl', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.4428125   0.42787057

However, Speaker Chung Ui-hwa reiterated that he would use his authority to call a vote on a bill that would determine new rules for next year’s general election unless the rival parties’ lawmakers reached an agreement by the end of this year. His remark came as President Park and the ruling Saenuri Party ratcheted up pressure on the speaker to bypass the deadlocked parliamentary committees and put to a plenary vote the overdue bills that aim to relax regulations on businesses and reform the labor market. It was considered a setback to the presidential office’s accelerating attempts to pressure the Assembly into legislating Park’s economic policies, a move that Chung and main opposition party said would violate the democratic rule of separation of power. “(If I propose the bill myself), it would be an act of constitutional violation. (My proposal) would bring more chaos to the nation and more harm to our economy,” the former Saenuri Party lawmaker said. By custom, the speaker leaves his or her party when assuming the position. President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday denounced the Assembly for “failing to do its job,” highlighting that the pending bills are crucial to revitalize oversupplied industries and create jobs for young people. Her remark was widely seen as a pressure on Chung to greenlight the bills. But the fifth term lawmaker refused to cite the economic situation as a reason for him to exercise his authority, disputing the argument that the nation’s economy is bad enough to constitute an “emergency situation” where the speaker could independently put the bills to a vote in a plenary session.According to Clause 85 of the Assembly’s law, the speaker can bring bills to the floor without undergoing the committee’s review when the nation faces natural disaster or contingencies like wars, or when the Assembly’s political parties with more than 20 parliamentary seats agree to do so.  Rep. Chung Ui-hwa. YonhapThe main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chimed in. NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in blasted President Park for compromising democratic rule by intervening in the legislative body’s affair. “Korea democracy is hurting. The president is ignoring the opposition parties and treating the speaker and the ruling party’s leader as if they are her subordinates. I think what the Park administration is doing is nothing but another version of dictatorship,” said Moon.  Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, an independent who left the NPAD over a power struggle with Moon, echoed the criticism. He said on Twitter that the president is blaming the Assembly for her administration’s own failure and putting undue pressure on the head of the National Assembly. While Cheong Wa Dae did not directly comment on Chung’s refusal, it repeated that it was up to the speaker to move things along at the Assembly.Presidential secretary Hyun Ki-hwan had visited Chung’s office on Tuesday to urge him to exercise his power, and later criticized the lack of progress by saying the Assembly was “only looking out for the lawmakers’ interests.” Chung denounced Hynun’s remark as “crude and absurd.” Saenuri Party members visited Chung’s office after his remark on Wednesday and urged Chung to accept the presidential office’s demand to propose the pending bills. The speaker reportedly refused once again, and the atmosphere grew tense as he yelled at the visiting lawmakers, according to insiders.Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters the same day that he is thinking of suggesting Park to exercise her presidential power to order an emergency legislation of economy-related bills without waiting for the Assembly endorsement. The authority was last used by late President Kim Young-sam in 1993 when he adopted policies to achieve transparency in financial transactions. Meanwhile, the speaker reiterated that he would put to a vote the bill that aims to redraw electoral maps for the 2016 general election. Although prospective candidates began to register for the ballot Tuesday, the lawmakers have remained deadlocked over the rezoning scheme, meaning the candidates don’t yet know what their potential constituency will be. “The right to vote is the most important fundamental right. We will face serious consequences unless we resolve the issue by the end of this year. I have to make a judgement call before parliamentary contingencies occur,” said Chung. His remark came a day after the rival parties’ leadership failed to reach an agreement on the rules that determine the number of seats for lawmakers elected via vote by local constituencies and the seats for those who obtain their parliamentary seats through proportional representation.The Saenuri Party has favored a plan to reduce the number of proportional representation seats, but the NPAD and another minor opposition party insist the 54 seats given to the proportional representation scheme remain the same. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","assembly speaker wednesday rejected ,pending bills that president ,national assembly speaker wednesday ,speaker wednesday rejected cheong ,speaker rejects blue house","['the National Assembly ’s', 'Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Chung Ui - hwa']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37964934  0.1263229

The registration of preliminary candidates is set to begin on Tuesday without a clear agreement on the electoral map.While some NPAD dissenters were set to announce their defection early this week, others, who have demanded the resignation of chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, reserved their decision on whether to leave.The division between the NPAD dissenters came after Ahn vowed to form his own opposition group on Sunday. Comparing his defection to Steve Jobs being kicked out of Apple in 1985, he pledged on Monday to transform the “old-fashioned” liberal parties in a way that can rival the conservative bloc in the 2016 general election.  “Steve Jobs was the founder of Apple, but he was kicked out by John Sculley. Now what happens next is up to Steve Jobs,” said Ahn, comparing himself to the late innovator. Ahn on Monday submitted documents to finalize his defection from the NPAD. NPAD former cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. YonhapAhn’s close confidant Rep. Moon Byeong-ho announced that he and Reps. Yoo Sung-yup and Hwang Ju-hong would leave the party either Tuesday or Wednesday. He expected that up to 30 NPAD lawmakers would leave the party by the end of this year. Reps. Yoo and Hwang, whose constituencies are in the NPAD stronghold of South Jeolla Province, have hinted at their departure since they refused to undergo the party’s assessment to determine underachieving lawmakers ahead of the election nominations.But a majority of NPAD dissenters remained more cautious about their possible defection. While continuing to pressure Moon to step down, the nonmainstream factions were seen as closely watching the voters’ mood in their constituencies to determine whether the voters will tilt toward Ahn or remain supportive of Moon. “Moon should be held accountable (for Ahn’s departure) and help us bring the party back on track … but whether or not to defect is up to individual lawmakers. We are not planning on a mass defection,” said Rep. Choi Won-sik, who leads one of the biggest NPAD nonmainstream factions. Many of the constituencies at stake are in the NPAD stronghold of South Jeolla Province, where Ahn and Moon Jae-in have competed for approval ratings. According to the local pollster Realmeter, the voters have alternated between the two for their preferred NPAD presidential candidate. Other dissenting NPAD bigwigs such as Rep. Joo Seung-yong also took a cautious approach. The third-term lawmaker, who represents a district in South Jeolla Province, wrote on Facebook, “I have constantly insisted that we should prevent further NPAD division.” National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, meanwhile, urged the floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party and the NPAD to come up with the new electoral map as soon as possible.“It could create a legislative emergency,” he said, indicating he may choose to exercise his power to put other relevant bills submitted by the National Election Commission for a vote unless the parties come up with a compromise by the end of this month.If the lawmakers fail to come up with new constituency maps by Dec. 31, when the efficacy of the current zones expires, the country will be on course to head into the general election without any constituencies in place.“Without the rival parties’ consensus, all your constituencies will become void from the 31st and all preliminary candidates will be forced to suspend their campaigns,” Chung said.The parties, which are required to agree on constituency boundaries ahead of every parliamentary general election, have not met a single legal deadline.The lawmakers have clashed over the rules that will determine the number of seats for the lawmakers elected through votes at local constituencies and the seats for those who obtain their parliamentary seats through proportional representation. The Saenuri Party has favored a plan to reduce the number of proportional representation seats, but the NPAD and another minor opposition party insist the 54 seats given to the proportional representation scheme remain the same. Despite the constant standoff over how to redraw electoral maps, the rival parties made a breakthrough on Monday by agreeing to pass revised bills related to election rules. Among them are a bill that authorizes the use of phone calls to survey the selected voters who will determine the parties’ nomination for the elections. According to the bill, the political parties can assign the voters a secured phone number to collect their opinions on the parties’ agenda, including the nomination of candidates for the elections. The rival party leaders had agreed to adopt the system in September, but has remained deadlocked over the opposition from Cheong Wa Dae. While advocates assert that the move would grant voters the right to choose their own representatives, Cheong Wa Dae had insisted that the phone-based survey would skew the public opinion and cost too much in taxpayers’ money.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","party dissenting lawmakers ,the party dissenting lawmakers ,party dissenting lawmakers with ,dissenting lawmakers with tough ,to leave the party","['Ahn Cheol', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84082055 -0.12717551

Youn Kwan-suk said after his botched arbitration efforts between Ahn and Moon. ""It is feared to take away the prospect of victory in the general elections,"" he said.   Rep. Kim Sung-gon noted that ""A split in the opposition bloc will no doubt lead to a defeat. Without solidarity of any kind, everyone will be doomed.""   The ruling Saenuri Party slammed Ahn's desertion as a political performance engineered before creating a unified opposition front before the general elections.  ""I wonder if this is not a political gesture for the unification of the opposition front intended for next year's parliamentary elections,"" ruling party spokesman Kim Young-woo said, recalling Ahn's withdrawal of his presidential bid in 2012 which helped Moon gather more voters in the previous presidential race.

Ahn Cheol-soo on Sunday reiterated his call for an early convention to replace current chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in.Ahn of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded last week that a party caucus be held by January to select a new leadership before the April 13 general election. Moon rejected the idea Thursday but instead accepted a set of reform measures suggested by Ahn three months ago. Ahn, again, called on Moon to reconsider.“This is not the time to cling to one’s vested rights. … Let me know clearly if you have no intention to transform our party together … (Accepting my reform measures) is not enough to overcome the crisis that the party faces,” Ahn said in a press conference, reiterating the need for Moon’s referendum. The power struggle between Moon and Ahn is seen as fueling the factional divide in the NPAD, which is beset by flagging support and threats from dissenting lawmakers that they will leave the party unless changes are made. Since Moon took office in February, the NPAD has seen a string of liberal heavyweights’ departures. Rep. Chun Jung-bae defected in March in protest against Moon’s refusal to nominate him for the 2015 April by-elections. Third-term lawmaker Rep. Park Joo-sun left the party in September amid Moon’s push to overhaul the party in the wake of by-election defeats. With over a year left in Moon’s tenure as a party leader, sources described Ahn’s remark as an ultimatum to his former rival Moon, indicating Ahn would join the defectors unless Moon accepted his “final” proposal. Moon and Ahn had competed during 2012 presidential race.“I am not going to make any more suggestions or proposals. … If Moon is reelected, I will endorse the decision and give my full support to him. I sincerely urge Moon to consider what is best for the party,” Ahn said.Ahn highlighted that the referendum on Moon’s leadership was the only option to reassure the voters and the NPAD members in the run-up to the general election, refuting Moon’s dismissal that his plan was an attempt to deepen party divisions.   Former NPAD chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo on Sunday helds press conference at the National Assembly. YonhapMoon did not immediately respond to Ahn’s challenge, saying he would “not speak today” about Ahn’s press conference.Public opinion remained split over the issue. According to the survey of local pollster Realmeter released on Thursday, 32.9 percent of NPAD supporters endorsed Moon’s leadership, outweighing 21.4 percent of those who approved Ahn’s referendum move. More unaffiliated voters, meanwhile, supported Ahn’s plan with 36.4 percent agreeing to it.The two NPAD heavyweight’s feud escalated after Moon asked Ahn to join a three-way coalition leadership with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon on Nov. 18. Ahn rejected the proposal and insisted on holding a party caucus to overhaul the leadership. The NPAD has been pushing to overhaul the party with a tougher in-house nomination procedure and ethical regulations in light of heavy factional fighting and repeated election defeats. Observers have forecast another major defeat by the NPAD against the Saenuri in the April general election based on current approval ratings. According to a Dec. 3 survey from local pollster Realmeter, the NPAD’s ratings came at 27.1 percent, while the ruling Saenuri Party recorded 43.9 percent.On Thursday, the NPAD leader had vowed to strengthen his grip on the party’s governance. Moon said he would oversee the committee recruiting candidates for the parliamentary race and that he would refer them to the party for transparent nominations. Moon also pledged he would hold accountable those who refuse to undergo the party’s review board for the nomination. As an example, Moon urged the party’s ethics committee to discipline Rep. Yoo Sung-yup and Hwang Ju-hong, who refused to participate in the review process.  The latest move has been to change the party’s name. With 73 percent of its members supporting the change, the party will gather public opinion about the new name from Dec. 7-14. The party will select the name through the votes of NPAD members and a public survey.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","april 13 general election ,general election moon rejected ,week that party caucus ,democracy demanded last week ,ultimatum on change factional","['Ahn Cheol', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.61363822  0.04925191

""If Moon doesn't want to reform the party with me, he must clearly say so.""   Ahn's statement came after Moon rejected his request for a ""revolutionary"" convention that could potentially cost the chairman his job.   Pundits interpret Ahn's statement as an ultimatum, with the former software mogul appearing to be planning an exit from the party if Moon fails to accept his request.   Moon rebuffed Ahn's proposal last week as ""unrealistic"" and ""ill-timed,"" but he said he will adopt the dozen suggestions made by Ahn in September to restore public trust in the party.   On Sunday, Moon refused to respond to Ahn's statements, telling reporters, ""I won't speak today."" His silence is seen as a precautionary measure since an immediate response could make Ahn leave, costing votes in next year's general elections.   Previously, Moon had suggested a three-way joint leadership with Ahn and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, which Ahn rejected.   A sense of crisis has been palpable inside the liberal party ahead of the general elections slated for April next year.   Some analysis shows the NPAD will get only 70-80 seats in the 300-member parliament.

Candice Miller (R-MI), is aimed at tightening border security amid fears that the U.S. could fall victim to terrorism after last month's deadly shootings in Paris. Nationals of France and Belgium, which are among the 38 visa waiver countries, were found involved in the Paris attacks.Other members of the visa-free program include Britain, Germany, South Korea and Japan.Earlier this week, the White House also announced a set of measures to strengthen regulations of the visa-free program, including stricter checks on whether visitors have records of any past travel to countries constituting a terrorist safe haven.""For terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons.That was certainly the case on 9/11, and, unfortunately, it holds true today,"" Miller said in a statement. ""It is imperative that we address every vulnerability that might allow terrorists to carry out another attack on U.S. soil -- including vulnerabilities with our Visa Waiver Program.""The legislation calls for requiring visa waiver countries to continually share terrorism and foreign traveler data with the U.S., utilize Interpol's criminal and law enforcement databases, report lost and stolen passports within 24 hours and screen all passengers against all Interpol databases and notices.The bill also calls for requiring visa waiver travelers to use electronic passports with biometric enabled chips by April 1.Failure to meet these requirements would result in the loss of the visa-free status, according to the bill.The legislation is expected to pass the House as Democrats are also in support of it. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she supports the legislation.

Soldiers' salaries will also be hiked starting next year.   The military, however, sustained hefty budget cuts in many of its procurement projects aimed at defense against North Korea's missile and other threats.  The ministry had initially proposed a 64.3 billion-won budget for next year to launch its project to acquire five surveillance satellites by 2022.  The budget was reduced to 10 billion won in the government-wide budget planning before the National Assembly further cut it to 2 billion won earlier in the day.   The satellite project is intended to secure the local military's own capacity to monitor North Korea's missile sites and other key military facilities, for which it has been relying on the U.S. surveillance assets.   The military had also wanted 24.8 billion won for its project to purchase unmanned aerial vehicles to boost surveillance over North Korea's military activities, but the National Assembly approved only 11.6 billion won.   ""These are core assets our military should acquire before retrieving the wartime operational control of South Korean troops in the mid-2020s (from the U.S.), but the budget cuts may inevitably deal blows to them,"" a ministry official said.

It falls 300 billion won short of the amount requested by the government in September.The Constitution obliges the parliament to pass its annual budget bill by Dec. 2 to allow 30 days of preparation for the bill's implementation.For more than a decade before 2014, the parliament had always failed to meet the deadline for endorsing a budget bill for the new year.Rival parties often clashed over items on the bill, sometimes leading to physical fights as well as sit-ins inside Parliament.In 2013, the National Assembly passed the government's 2013 budget bill after the beginning of fiscal year, marking the first time in the country's history. The parliament again approved 2014's budget bill on Jan. 1, narrowly avoiding the risk of the government formulating a tentative budget for the first time in history.As public criticism mounted, the Assembly revised relevant parliamentary laws in 2014 to have the budget bill automatically referred to a plenary session if the parties fail to complete deliberation of the budget by Nov. 30.With the new laws on the advancement of the National Assembly, the National Assembly passed the government's 2015 budget bill on Dec. 2, 2014, meeting the legal deadline for the first time in 12 years.The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, again, failed to keep their promises this year.President Park Geun-hye earlier met with leaders of rival parties and asked cooperation on next year's budget and a set of bills to improve people's livelihoods.She has repeatedly asked the rival parties to make a compromise on contentious issues and pass the budget as soon as possible.Legislators, themselves, voiced concerns and said the parliament should not be locked in bitter political wrangling.National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa said, ""All of us should have self-reflection and feel a sense of responsibility (for failing to meet the deadline).""Chung, who invoked his power as speaker to put some contentious bills to a vote, said the parliament should stand to its promise.""I do not understand why the two parties negotiated like this,"" Rep. Kang Ki-jeong of the NPAD told reporters just before the session. ""The budget bill is a mess.""The Saenuri Party also said it is regrettable that the parliament had failed to meet the deadline, noting it is time to take care a set of economic bills aimed at improving the livelihoods of the people.""Politicians should accept the fact that they should take time for self-examination in running the parliament,"" Kim Young-yoo, spokesman of the party, said in a press release, adding that the parliament should not repeat this year's mistake again.

Ahn Cheol-soo Sunday rejected the incumbent chairman Moon Jae-in’s request to build a coalition leadership, dealing a blow to Moon’s attempt to unite the embattled party ahead of next year’s general election. Instead, the entrepreneur-turned-politician proposed a plan to select new leadership by holding a party caucus next January and merge with the People’s Reform Party, a newly created opposition party founded by Rep. Chun Jung-bae who defected from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy in March.“I believe the coalition will not be enough to bring substantial change to the party and give voters the impression the party is truly harmonized,” said Ahn. “My proposal will serve as a good opportunity for Moon to jump-start (the efforts to overhaul the party).” Former NPAD Chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. YonhapOn Nov. 18, Moon proposed to build a tentative triumvirate with Ahn and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon in the run-up to the 2016 general election. Moon had proposed to share the leadership position with the NPAD bigwigs during the period. Ahn had reserved judgement.  Ahn reiterated the NPAD should overhaul the party’s “archaic structure” he claims to be out of touch with the general public and build a broad opposition force against the Park Geun-hye administration’s “unilateral governance.” With refusing to give a direct answer for Ahn’s suggestion, Moon expressed regret over Ahn’s rejection, saying that his coalition scheme aimed to end the party’s factional feud and to unite the party. He noted that he would continue to gather party members’ opinions.   Mayor Park, for his part, vowed to bridge the gap between Ahn and Moon. Park had partly agreed to Moon’s proposal, saying that he would help Moon on the condition that his support does not clash with his position as mayor.   The three-way coalition came amid escalating infighting among the NPAD rival factions over Moon’s push to overhaul the party. It is widely expected that Ahn's rejection would challenge Moon’s leadership and throw the embattled party into a deeper chaos.  Some NPAD nonmainstream members have been lashing out at Moon for steering the party in favor of those in the mainstream loyal to Moon and his political mentor, late President Roh Moo-hyun. Moon dismissed their criticism, saying they were merely trying to have more say over the party’s nomination for the upcoming general elections. Taking sides with Ahn on Sunday, nonmaintreamers urged Moon to quickly accept Ahn’s proposal.“(Accepting the offer) is the only way to bring us to victory in the 2016 general election and 2017 presidential election. I sincerely urged Moon to recognize the significance of his decision,” NPAD lawmaker Rep. Park Jie-won said via Facebook. Park was defeated by Moon in the party’s leadership contest in February. During Moon’s tenure, the NPAD has suffered from low popularity among voters. According to a Nov. 26 survey from local pollster Realmeter, the party’s approval rating stood at 26.7 percent, while the ruling Saenuri Party recorded 43.5 percent. Moon himself struggled to appeal to voters, particularly those from the NPAD’s stronghold of South Jeolla Province. According to pollster Gallup’s October survey, Moon’s popularity rating as next president stood at 8 percent, 1 percent lower than ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep.

Separately, 21.8 percent supported Kim Moo-sung, head of the ruling Saenuri Party, in a potential presidential race. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy received 17.1 percent of support, down 1.1 percentage points from last week. The survey was conducted on 2,617 adults from Nov. 9-13 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points.

He expressed regret that despite concerted efforts to alleviate safety concerns, there are still those that have reservations about the project as a whole.""The government plans to listen to concerns expressed and redouble efforts to communicate with the people of Yeongdeok,"" the policymaker stressed.The statement was made the morning after a local committee opposing the construction of the reactors held a countywide vote on Wednesday and Thursday. Of the 34,432 registered voters in Yeongdeok, 11,201 cast their ballots resulting in a voter turnout of 32.5 percent, which is just shy of the minimum one-third needed to make any local elections binding. Organizers, however, plan to release the results of the vote. The government has persistently said the vote did not meet existing rules regarding a referendum and discounted it as nothing more than some groups trying to drum up opposition for a national project.  The government already designated areas in Yeongdeok as the construction site of its new Cheongji nuclear power facility in September 2012. Construction of the two 1,500 megawatt reactors is expected to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively.Yoon said that with the referendum issue over, the government plans to move swiftly to meet the 10 major development projects that the people of Yoengdeok wanted in exchange for hosting the nuclear plant.The government maintains that the construction and operation of the new reactors could cause upwards of 10,000 workers and their families to move to Yeongdeok and boost the local economy.""A high-tech medical facility, large scale welfare and community center and nuclear-related training institute will be built as soon as possible,"" the minister said. He added that roads linking isolated areas of the county will be pushed forward, which can bolster economic growth of the region and enhance convenience for residents.""In addition, the government and the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. that is building the reactors will further step up efforts to explain every detail of the construction process,"" the official said. ""A new committee made up of government officials, KHNP representatives and local residents will be set up to facilitate communication and exchanges,"" he said.The ministry, meanwhile, said that follow-up measures like the buying up of land around the planned nuclear plant site and other administrative and legal measures will be carried out according to plan.

Separate from the failed talks, the National Assembly passed a package of pending bills including a ban against large retailers doing business near traditional markets to jumpstart the parliamentary session, which has been stalled over the government’s push to reinstate state-authored textbooks.While the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy passed a motion to extend the operation of a committee dealing with electoral rules, they were required to vote their new electoral map by the Friday plenary session.If the lawmakers fail to come up with new constituency maps by year-end, the country is to head to general elections without any electoral zones, as the efficacy of the current zones expire on Dec. 31. The parties, however, have not met a single legal deadline for rezoning electorates since early 2000s.The lawmakers have clashed over the rules that would determine the number of seats for the lawmakers elected through votes at local constituencies and the seats for those who obtain their parliamentary seats through proportional representation system. The Saenuri Party has favored a plan to reduce the number of proportional representation seats, but the NPAD and another minor opposition party insist the 54 seats given to the proportional representation scheme remain the same as the current level.The parties are to continue the negotiation at the extended electoral rules committee.In a 188-14 vote, with 23 abstaining, the rival parties agreed to extend the committee’s operation -- which was set to end on Nov. 15 -- until Dec. 15. The Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung(left) and the NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. YonhapAmong the approved bills are a ban against large-scale grocery chains from opening up branches near small and local supermarkets and vendors.The revised environment law would also give the government the right to demand and order adjustment to automobiles’ gas emission in case of flaws.Meanwhile, the parties remain at odds over the bills that would overhaul rules in the labor market and business sectors.The rival lawmakers have also clashed over how to fund the government’s child care program and whether to implement a policy to impose caps on skyrocketing housing prices. They have also remained split over the parliamentary approval of the ratification of the Korea-China Free Trade Agreement. The legislative meeting came amid Cheong Wa Dae’s repeated calls for the lawmakers to take legislative action to jump-start the nation’s faltering economy. The presidential office highlighted that the pending contentious bills and the approval of the Korea-China FTA are “urgent.” Dismissing speculation that a Cabinet shake-up is imminent, Cheong Wa Dae pressed lawmakers into passing the pending bills. Several Cabinet members are expected to be replaced, as some have already resigned and more are expected to leave their post to prepare for the 2016 general elections.“The 19th Assembly is now in session. Among the parliamentary agenda items are bills related to reforming labor markets and boosting the economy, as well as the Korea-China FTA agreement. We sincerely hope the bills will be passed during the current parliamentary session,” Kim Sung-woo, senior presidential secretary of public affairs, said Thursday.

Upholding the lower court’s ruling, the nation’s top court ruled Rep. Song Kwang-ho of the ruling Saenuri Party to four years in jail for taking bribes worth 65 million won from the railway parts supplier AVT to help the company win contracts with the state-run Korea Rail Network Authority. The court also ordered him to pay a fine of 70 million won ($61,000) and forfeit another 65 million won. The court said that testimonies that he received the bribe were trustworthy and the original verdict that he abused his power in return of the kickback was appropriate. Company officials asked Song to help them win government contracts related to the construction of high-speed railways in the Jeolla provinces, in return for the kickbacks. The four-term lawmaker was the chairman of the parliamentary committee on land, infrastructure and transport from 2010-2012. The committee oversees the railway management agency. It also reaffirmed the lower court’s decision that even if the bribe was given in smaller portions and was delivered several times, it still remains subject to additional punishment. Under the law, a suspect accused of receiving a bribe worth more than 30 million won faces additional punishment. Last year, the parliament voted down the prosecution’s request to arrest Song, but the lawmaker was arrested after he was sentenced to four years in prison at his first trial. He later appealed the ruling, which an appeals court rejected.The appeals court, rejecting Song’s plea, said that he had committed a serious crime abusing his power as a four-term lawmaker and had abandoned his integrity as a legislator.On the same day, another four-year prison term was upheld by the top court for Rep. Kim Jae-yun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy convicted of taking 54 million won from a head of Seoul Art College. Rep. Lee is one of three NPAD lawmakers charged with the bribery case. The three lawmakers pushed a law that allowed the school to be recognized as a “training school” and eliminate its previous name “vocational institute.” The prosecution has pressed seven- and five-year jail terms to Reps. Shin Geh-ryeun and Shin Hak-yong, respectively. They are waiting for their first trial to proceed.Another Saenuri lawmaker, Rep. Cho Hyun-ryong, is also in an appellate trial over charges he received kickbacks from the railway part supplier. He was sentenced with five years in prisons from the lower courts.With Song and Lee losing their parliamentary memberships, the National Assembly now has 295 seats in total, with the ruling Saenuri Party holding 158 and the NPAD, 127.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","thursday sentenced two lawmakers ,jail for taking bribes ,four years in prison ,seats over bribery charges ,prison for taking kickbacks","['the Supreme Court', 'Song Kwang - ho', 'Saenuri Party']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18992122  0.38390359

We have problems with North Korea, where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know, nobody talks about it,"" Trump said. ""We have somebody over there, a madman, who already has nuclear weapons. We don't talk about that. That's a problem.""Trump said China is also a problem both economically and in terms of ""what they're doing in the South China Sea.""""They are becoming a very, very major force. So, we have more than just Russia,"" he said of China.In August, Trump said the North's leader is either ""mad"" or ""a genius,"" and much more ""unstable"" and difficult to deal with than his late father.North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile and rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.Trump has drawn keen attention from South Korean media for his repeated, unfounded criticism of the Asian ally for relying on the U.S. for its defense without giving the U.S. anything in return while making a lot of money.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the Asian ally from the communist North, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces.

Na Seong-lin of the Saenuri Party, after the government-ruling party consultation meeting. Ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers Reps. Kim Jung-hoon (left), Kim Sung-tae (center) and Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Lee Dong-phil attend the drought response meeting in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapMore than 700 million tons of water are stored in the 16 newly built dams along the four rivers ― the Hangang, Nakdonggang, Geumgang and Yeongsangang. The water is not being utilized because the dams are located far from the affected areas, officials said.The measures were devised as the country has been experiencing the worst drought in more than a century.Officials fear that the problem, if left unsolved, would severely affect agricultural production and quickly raise food and other consumer prices. The national weather agency forecasts that the current drought is likely to last until next April. Officials stressed that the plan was devised to utilize water from the four rivers and is not aimed at refurbishing them ― a controversial project undertaken by the previous administration. “This proposal is not related to the four-river project and we need to devise logical and objective ideas to overcome the drought,” said Kim Jung-hoon, policy committee chairman of the ruling party.The Four Major Rivers Restoration Project was a mega state plan pushed by the former Lee Myung-bak administration. The project has remained stalled amid concerns over causing massive environmental damage.An internal probe conducted right before President Park Geun-hye took office in early 2013 said the project was seriously flawed and had caused environmental damage such as lowering the water quality in the rivers.The state project was halted as the ruling party overturned its earlier position and urged the government to reassess it, which invited fresh criticism from Lee’s loyalists that the party was trying to protect the then-incoming leader Park from inheriting the financial and political burden.The drought measure is also expected to face resistance from the main opposition party. The New Politics Alliance for Democracy has been opposing the idea, calling it a waste of taxpayers’ money. Some experts also raised concerns that the plan lacks feasibility, saying the distance from the weirs to drought-stricken areas is too far.

Kim had said she is coming out of the closet in hopes that “people can accept themselves for whoever they are, and live positively.”“Her statement surprised all of us. We assume that people are not sexual minorities unless they say it out loud. To say one is gay takes courage to deny such an unspoken assumption,” the QIS said in its statement. It added that the group is not backing her campaign, but merely complimenting her on coming out of the closet. Kim said that it is worth forfeiting her privacy for “a chance to change all our lives.”“What I want the SNU to become is a society where an individual can exist as themselves, where all lives are beautiful just the way they are,” she said during her campaign Thursday.Kim, who is the sole candidate for the university’s 58th student council president, is currently the vice president of the council and a member of a committee for the rights of student sexual minorities at SNU. She was also involved in the student movement to resolve a recent sexual violence case against an SNU professor.If she wins, Kim will become the first public sexual minority to head the student council for the most prestigious university in Korea.

Kim Man-bok (Yonhap)The two join a host of other former Cabinet and Cheong Wa Dae officials who have stepped down from their seats in the past several weeks to prepare for the elections.Their resignations are also speeding up talks within the ruling party over their nomination strategy, as factional tensions loom between those loyal to President Park Geun-hye and those outside the mainstream of the party.Kim’s bid, in particular, raised eyebrows, as he is already in hot waters over his conduct after joining the Saenuri Party via facsimile in August.In a “letter to the public,” Kim said that while he served as the spy agency chief during the progressive Roh Moo-hyun administration, Kim said he was joining the conservative Saenuri Party for his personal beliefs.“As I have served in the NIS, I tend to think in the realm of conservativeness. And therefore a lot of the policies of the Saenuri Party are in sync with what I believe,” he said.He added that if he was to earn the party nomination, he was confident of his win in Busan, as there are already gatherings supporting him as a lawmaker candidate.Kim’s letter was considered a refusal to leave the party in light of controversy that he had publicly supported an opposition party candidate in the Oct. 28 by-election after he joined the Saenuri Party in August.The Saenuri Party was discussing whether to expel him. They said they will take due measures after an internal investigation of him is completed.Kim explained in the letter that he had shown support as a favor and that he had not known his application to join the Saenuri Party had already been accepted.Kim was put in the media spotlight by saying in an interview with a local newspaper that there was a permanent hotline between the leaders of the two Koreas during the progressive governments.The NIS moved to file a complaint with the prosecution against its former chief as he appears to have revealed confidential information he obtained during his leadership from 2006-2008.The NIS believes that Kim broke the law banning former and current NIS employees from revealing state secrets they learned while performing official duties. The law also bans an NIS employee from publishing a book concerning his or her NIS duties without the permission from the incumbent NIS chief. Kim recently published his memoirs regarding the 2007 inter-Korean summit, but he reportedly had not obtained NIS permission.From news reports","run in april elections ,conference sunday to resign ,party ticket to run ,sup press conference sunday ,sunday to resign","['National Intelligence Service', 'Kim Man - bok', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Gijang , Busan', 'Chong Jong - sup']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16040218  0.01547985

43,43,5 major disputes surrounding state textbooks," Last Friday, Choi Mong-lyong -- the government’s choice as one of the main authors for a new set of state-issued history textbooks -- resigned after allegations surfaced that he had sexual harassed a female reporter.While denying any wrongdoing, the professor emeritus of Seoul National University said he did not want to bog down the publication process.Professor Choi Mong-lyong is surrounded by the press as he hea...","Last Friday, Choi Mong-lyong -- the government’s choice as one of the main authors for a new set of state-issued history textbooks -- resigned after allegations surfaced that he had sexual harassed a female reporter.While denying any wrongdoing, the professor emeritus of Seoul National University said he did not want to bog down the publication process.Professor Choi Mong-lyong is surrounded by the press as he heads to his home in Yeouido, Friday. (Yonhap)The resignation of the seasoned scholar added to controversy swirling around the Park Geun-hye administration’s mission to establish a “correct” history lesson, which it vows to accomplish by retrieving school textbook rights from the private sector.The path toward government-controlled history lessons is still lined with obstacles, as polls indicate an increasing number of citizens opposing the need for the state textbooks. Gallup Korea said Friday that 36 percent of Korean adults supported the policy while 53 opposed it, versus 36 and 49 percent, respectively, last week.Here are five major points of dispute over the history textbooks.Supposed involvement of Cheong Wa DaeAlthough it was a sexual harassment scandal that ultimately brought down Choi, the 69-year-old had already been embroiled in controversy after a media interview in which he indicated the presidential office pressured him to support the contentious policy. He said Wednesday that Hyun Jung-taik, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, called him to request that he attend Wednesday’s press conference by the National Institute of Korean History, where the state-run body named him as one of the authors. Choi added that he was a “shield” for the NIKH on the state textbook issue, and that the institute should thank him. Choi denied Thursday that the phone call had happened, then flip-flopped again later in the day to say he did receive a phone call but claimed that it was merely a conversation between old friends.Cheong Wa Dae did not officially comment on Choi’s remarks.Despite Choi’s efforts, the news fueled a fierce reaction from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy who said that Cheong Wa Dae had been pulling the strings on the policy despite its insistence that the Education Ministry was in the driver’s seat.Last month, it alleged that the ministry had formed a secret textbook team off the books on direct orders from the presidential office. The government acknowledges the team’s existence, but denied it had any illegal nature.Transparency of the publication processDuring Wednesday’s press conference, the NIKH said that Choi and Shin Hyong-shik -- a professor emeritus of Ewha Womans University who specializes in ancient Korean history -- would be participating as two of six main authors of the textbook, and that some 36 writers would author the book. But the conference lacked details despite Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s pledge the day before that “all processes will be transparent.” NIKH chief Kim Jung-bae said the authors “should be allowed to feel relaxed (while working), at least until the copies are finished,” indicating that the NIKH may withhold the authors’ identities until they finish writing the books. National Institute of Korean History president Kim Jung-bae (right) reacts to a question during a press conference on the government’s plans for its history textbook publication at the government complex in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The NIKH limited the number of questions from the local media for Kim to five and was seen attempting to stop Shin from answering a question directed at him. Hwang has so far pledged to unveil sections of the textbook online for public feedback while the book is being written.The NPAD has criticized the government for running “secretive operations.”But proponents of the state textbooks say that it should be the officials’ priority to ensure the authors’ safety, as they can be subject to public criticism for their participation. Upon news of Choi’s appointment as an author, malicious online rumors targeting him circulated on social media. Hwang vowed to respect the authors’ wishes to remain anonymous.Maintaining unbiased contentThe state-authored textbooks will strive to narrate a history that is not biased in favor of any side, the government has said. Their goal was further elaborated by their open criticism against the current books, which they claim favor leftist views.“We can no longer teach our precious children with distorted and biased textbooks,” Hwang said in Tuesday’s press conference.The conservatives have pointed to some textbooks’ descriptions that they say make it seem as if South and North Koreas share responsibility for the 1950-53 Korean War, citing parts that describe frequent border skirmishes that occurred in the buildup to the war.Hwang added that the textbooks say that the South Korean “government” was established and the North Korean “country” was founded in 1948, which students could perceive as meaning the North is superior.He pointed out that the majority of scholars with textbook writing experience repeatedly participate as authors, saying the homogenous pool makes state-issued textbooks inevitable. The ministry has said the current system has failed to work as the authors have challenged government requests to revise the content. Opponents of the state textbooks say that such claims are exaggerated.Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD rebuked Hwang’s argument regarding the Korean War, saying that current textbooks make it clear that the North invaded the South. He said that while individual authors carry out legal actions in cases of conflict, the publishers have revised the content as per government orders.With regard to the description of the South Korean “government” being established in 1948, Do said it was because the Constitution states that the current government succeeds the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea established in 1919, which is not the case in North Korea. Aug. 15, 1948, the day when South Korea’s first formal government was founded, is also at the center of a history textbook debate. All high school history textbooks say that the South Korean government, not South Korea, was established that day.The dispute stems from calls by conservative “New Right” scholars to set the date as “Korea Foundation Day.” It rose to the surface during the former Lee Myung-bak administration, but faced fierce opposition from organizations related to Korea’s independence movement that it denies legitimacy of the provisional government. The state-authored history textbooks of the 1980s and 1990s also specify that the government was established on that day. While the government-issued curriculum guidelines also say the “government” was established, the 2015 guidelines for the state history textbook have been changed to say that the course will deal with how “South Korea” was established. Progressive civic groups, historians and teachers opposing the policy say that the change aims to whitewash aspects of controversial political figures including Park Chung-hee, a former president of Korea and the incumbent leader’s father, who is criticized for his dictatorial rule in 1960s and 1970s.They say that establishing 1948 as the year of the country’s foundation will respectively reduce the descriptions of the independence movement during the Japanese colonial period and instead depict pro-Japanese figures as those that helped found the country.Rushed schedule The NIKH’s timeline gives roughly 14 months to complete the state textbook -- two of which will be spent on setting a concrete plan, recruiting authors and testing the book in classrooms.Yang Jung-hyun, a history professor at Pusan National University with experience of authoring a state-published textbook, pointed out that past publications took at least two or three years.The NIKH has vowed to appoint “the very best” experts in each field as authors, but the incident with Choi left a dent in its recruitment process. Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor Justice Party called it “an obvious result of an unprepared, rushed plan.” He pointed out that the Education Ministry revised the 2015 curriculum guidelines on Thursday, merely two months after confirming the curriculum in September.The revision was to ensure that state textbooks are distributed to classrooms by 2017. Alternative textbooksFourteen progressive education chiefs across the country who protest state textbooks have vowed to work on developing alternate history textbooks for use. Calling the government decision “regrettable,” Gangwon Education Superintendent Min Byung-hee said his office would develop education materials for students’ “balanced historical view of history.”The Education Ministry is mulling legal action against such movements.The Korean History Research Association, one of the nation’s biggest historical societies, said last week it would start discussing plans to author an alternate textbook. Korean law does not allow schools to substitute state-approved textbooks, but education chiefs can create supplementary textbooks.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","state textbooks last friday ,textbooks resigned after allegations ,history textbooks resigned after ,textbooks last friday choi ,issued history textbooks resigned","['Choi Mong - lyong', 'Seoul National University', 'Choi Mong - lyong']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12336186  0.72294259

YonhapChong resigns 16 months after he assumed the post on July 17 last year following his predecessor Kang Byung-kyu, who stepped down to take responsibility for the sinking of the Sewol ferry that claimed 304 lives.While Chong did not specify whether he would run in next April’s general elections, his candidacy to run in his hometown Gyeongju was widely speculated on even as he was named to the ministerial post. The speculation peaked when Chong made a toast during an August gathering with ruling Saenuri Party members wishing them for an election victory. The opposition demanded Chong’s immediate resignation and filed an impeachment motion against him in September for violating the neutrality of public officials as a minister overseeing the country’s elections. “I will fulfill my responsibility without a hitch in the ministry’s work until a successor is named,” Chong said. While saying he does not have any “detailed plans,” Chong said he would “make a prudent decision after listening to public opinion,” in response to query whether he would throw his hat into the ring for the next National Assembly.“Even after I withdraw from my ministerial post, I am set on doing all that I can for the sake of the country’s development and the success of the Park Geun-hye government,” he said.Chong joins a host of other members of Cheong Wa Dae and the Cabinet who have resigned with a high possibility of running in the election.They include former Oceans and Fisheries Minister Yoo Ki-june, former Land and Transportation Minister Yoo Il-ho and Vice Transport Minister Yeo Hyung-koo. From Cheong Wa Dae, presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook and deputy head of the presidential security service Park Jong-joon. Two presidential advisers on politics -- Yoon Sang-hyun and Kim Jae-won -- also recently stepped down.In August, as his election law violation controversy escalated, Chong held a news conference and apologized for his toast, but refused to step down, instead vowing to ensure that his ministry would remain neutral in the elections. He denied he had plans to run for an assembly seat.Sources and news reports said President Park is likely to replace several more members of the Cabinet this week enabling them to join the parliamentary race.It is speculated that Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea and Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung -- both elected Saenuri Party lawmakers -- may seek another parliamentary term.Under South Korea’s election law, civil servants planning to join the legislature are required to resign from their posts at least 90 days before joining the race.By Yeo Jun-suk(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","minister resigns for elections ,resigns for elections home ,resigns for elections ,affairs minister resigns for ,home affairs minister resigns","['Chong Jong - sup', 'Cabinet']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72067267 -0.16305983

That's a lot of money, and then the U.S. gets other benefits,"" Straub said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency.

Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.Straub said Trump is trying to appeal to voters who feel that ""the U.S. is the victim in its relationship with almost all the countries where it has militaries, including Korea.""Neither South Korea nor the U.S. are victims of the alliance, he said.""I think he thinks by saying that the U.S. is losing money in its dealings with Korea, he will appeal to some Americans,"" the expert said.

New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Moon Jae-in (right) and floor leader Lee Jong-kul attend a general meeting with the party’s lawmakers at the National Assembly on Friday. (Yonhap)“Today, we decided to normalize all parliamentary sessions starting on Nov. 9 only to prioritize the people’s livelihood just for the sake of the livelihoods of the people,” said NPAD floor leader Rep.

The decision came after the party said it was considering enacting a law to ban the government’s move, and also filing suit with the Constitutional Court. NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in, however, said the party needs some time to review legal matters before bringing it to the top court. Since Tuesday, the opposition lawmakers have been refusing to attend the sessions, including the Assembly’s budget committee to review next year’s budget. The opposition, however, faced a dilemma as to whether to continue the boycott or not, as it faced backlash from the ruling party denouncing their parliamentary hold-up as an act of abandoning people’s livelihoods.Despite the NPAD’s boycott, the ruling Saenuri pushed ahead with the parliamentary review of next year’s budget Thursday.

The ruling Saenuri Party’s lawmakers unilaterally opened the Assembly’s budget committee to resume the 2016 review that had been stalled since the opposition boycotted the Assembly on Nov. 3. The law stipulates that the committee must finish the review by Nov. 30 and budget bill must be passed no later than Dec. 2. But lawmakers of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy refused to attend the session and continued their three-day boycott, though the party leadership appeared to be in a dilemma over the backlash to their parliamentary hold-up. Rival party`s whips, Rep. Lee Jong-kul of the NPAD(right) and Rep. Won Yu-chul of the Saenuri Party, met with the National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa to discuss plans to resume parlimentary sessions. Yonhap“I don’t think we can resolve (the textbook) issue overnight. We cannot afford to invest ourselves only in the textbook issue. We also have to revive the nation’s weak economy and improve people’s livelihoods,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. Moon also reiterated that the government rationale for rewriting history books is absurd, comparing it with an attempt to sympathize with North Korea. “The government’s argument that South Korea was founded on Aug. 15, 1948, is against the Constitution. It is nothing but an attempt to deny South Korea’s legitimacy and orthodoxy and sympathize with the North,” said Moon, pointing out that North Korea claims that it was founded in 1948.The NPAD asserted that South Korea was founded in 1945 because it is the only legitimate government that succeeded the Daehan Jeguk (1897-1910), the last empire of Korea, and the Korean provisional government during the 1910-1945 Japanese colonial era. Other minor opposition blocs, such as the Justice Party, agreed to the need for a fresh approach. Justice Party chairman Rep. Shim Sang-Jung asserted that the liberal blocs should come up with a new plan for the escalating textbook controversy.“We need to rebuild the coalition among opposition blocs,” Shim said in press conference Thursday. “The coalition should be expanded to address other issues, such as the ruling party’s attempt to push for labor reforms,” said Shim. In an attempt to sway the voters by emphasizing on public livelihood, the Saenuri Party urged the NPAD to bring the Assembly back on track.“Even though we are facing important issues related to people’s lives, the NPAD is walking away and derailing the parliamentary session. The NPAD is surely using this opportunity to overshadow its problems at home,” said Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, referring to lingering factional feud at the rival camp.The Saenuri Party’s move followed the government’s official announcement Tuesday that it would reinstate state-authored textbooks for middle and high schools and that it had started gathering a panel of history experts to author them.The Saenuri lawmakers have demanded the NPAD stay away from the textbook issue and withdraw the parliamentary boycott, saying the NPAD should stop “politicizing” the education issue that is now relevant to policies of the administrative branch, not the legislative one.

Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman made the remark in response to a question about Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's accusations that South Korea is getting a defense free ride from the U.S.  ""We have 65 years of alliance with the Republic of Korea, decades-old alliance with the Republic of Korea. I don't see that alliance changing,"" Davis told reporters after a Foreign Press Center briefing.  ""Our commitment has been long-term; it's been enduring. It has stood constant, regardless of whom the president was, regardless of which party was in power, and I don't see that changing,"" he said.  Trump has repeatedly made such unfounded criticism, even though South Korea has shouldered part of the burden needed for the upkeep of 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea to deter aggression from the communist North.  The billionaire real-estate mogul made the latest accusations in his new book, released Tuesday and titled ""Crippled America,"" claiming that countries that depend on the U.S. for protection should pay for the troops and the equipment the U.S. is providing.   The presence of U.S. troops in South Korea is a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the divided peninsula still technically at war.  Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces.   Last year, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won ($886 million) for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in 2014, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.  Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.

NPAD lawmakers on Tuesday stage protest against the government`s final decison to adopt state-authored textbooks. (Yonhap)“(The government) ignored the overwhelming majority of the public and turned a deaf ear to the people’s plea. They have shut down fax machines since Monday afternoon and rejected oppositions’ messages,” said NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in at the Assembly’s hall where fellow party members staged a sit-in. They were holding the parliamentary sit-in for the first time since the Sewol disaster that claimed hundreds of lives last April. They called the government’s reinstatement of state textbooks a “dictatorial” move. The NPAD lawmakers have yet to decide when to end their protest.Reluctant to hold talks with the Saenuri Party’s leadership -- an event that was scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the parliamentary impasse -- the NPAD pledged to continue its opposition, with such plans as filing a constitutional appeal and a campaign to gather signatures from those who oppose the policy.The Saenuri Party denounced the boycott and blamed the NPAD for derailing parliamentary proceedings. The ruling party demanded the rivals stick to the legislative schedule to pass pending draft bills and finish budget reviews. “Considering that the Assembly faces a busy and crucial moment, I feel it’s so regrettable that the NPAD boycotted the plenary session it had agreed to hold. I strongly urge the NPAD to let historians and other experts deal with the textbooks and return to its own legislative work,” said Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul. Meanwhile, municipalities’ top educators were divided over the textbook controversy. A group of liberal superintendents, teachers unions and college professors publicly criticized the government for reintroducing state textbooks, while some conservative educators supported it. Kim Ji-cheol, the education chief of South Chungcheong Province, said in a statement Tuesday that he regretted that the government had pushed through the process in what he described as an attempt to undermine diversity in public education. Some branches of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers’ Union -- the nation’s biggest progressive teachers’ union -- issued a statement condemning the government’s move. About 100 professors from Gangwon National University announced their protest in a public statement.Conservative superintendents such as Daejeon’s education chief Seol Dong-ho, however, endorsed the government policy, saying that the municipality would follow the government’s decision if it decided to author the textbooks.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","political tensions intensified tuesday ,parliamentary sessions in protest ,fiery protests political tensions ,protest against the government ,democracy boycotted parliamentary sessions","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Assembly']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80775684  0.02244085

Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea will hold a briefing at Seoul Government Complex at 11 a.m. Tuesday, according to the Prime Minister’s Office, where the government will confirm the policy to revise the publication system for secondary history education. Education Ministry officials move boxes containing petitions gathered and sent by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy opposing the government’s reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks in front of the ministry building in Sejong City on Monday. (Yonhap)The Education Ministry has been collecting public opinion on the issue for 20 days, under Korean law that stipulates that the government is to give notice in advance on policy changes or plans that could inconvenience the public. The abrupt change in schedule indicated that the ruling Saenuri Party and President Park Geun-hye are seeking to make official the much-disputed policy, which has been at the center of a political and social standoff.Rep. Kim Jung-hoon of the Saenuri Party’s policy committee urged the ministry on Monday to “finish confirmation as soon as possible to end political and ideological confusion, and focus on creating the correct history textbook.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, whic has strongly opposed the state textbook policy, said it would launch a sit-in protest from Monday evening and boycott the plenary session at the National Assembly Tuesday in light of the news.Rival parties and the public have been split over the government’s resolve to implement what it called a “correct history textbook,” and some of its tactics in pushing the plan.Last Sunday, the NPAD raised suspicion that the ministry was running a secret team on direct orders from the presidential office. The ministry acknowledged the existence of such a team, but said there was nothing illegal in its nature.Three NPAD lawmakers visited the ministry complex around 2 p.m. to hand over a petition against the state textbook and asked why Minister Hwang Woo-yea had turned down their request for a meeting, pointing out that his official schedule remained empty for the day. The ministry’s school policy office head Kim Dong-won, who accepted the petition on Hwang’s behalf, said Hwang was attending a personal appointment. The lawmakers also echoed an allegation made by a local media outlet last week that the ministry’s team tasked with collecting public opinion was deliberately ignoring calls. “(The ministry) could not be reached via fax nor phone, and it ignored the parliament’s demand to receive suggestions online,” said Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD.He also said that over 1 million people have signed a petition against the state textbooks, some 400,000 of which were delivered to the ministry. “(The ministry) should think about why so many people are against the idea. If it pushes ahead, even more people will protest, which I worry will cripple the education system in general,” he said. The Saenuri Party, on the other hand, delivered a written opinion welcoming the state textbook policy. Both the government and the ruling party had maintained that the content of current textbooks ― authored by eight private publishers ― are biased in favor of the leftists and is “self-depreciative” of Korean history.“(The textbooks) derogate the efforts of the former generation, who worked to write the proud history of Korea. ... The narrow-minded view of history makes children think that ‘our country is full of problems’,” the party said.The news of confirmation came a little over an hour after Kim Dong-won promised the lawmakers that all petitions will be carefully considered before the ministry reaches a decision, fueling criticism from the opposition that the government gathering public opinion was merely a formality.The government has also asked regional education offices to punish the teachers who denounced the state textbook policy. Korean law states that civil workers ― which include teachers ― cannot take politically motivated action. Local Kyunghyang Shinmun claimed Monday that the ministry had contacted college chiefs to get them to support the policy. The ministry denied the allegations. NPAD Rep. Bae Jae-jung, meanwhile, pointed out that the ministry has already spent 2.2 billion won ($1,930) on promoting the state textbook policy, which is about twice its annual PR budget.The latest poll results of by Gallup Korea ― announced last week ― showed that 49 percent of Korean adults were against the policy and 36 percent supported it. The rest remained unsure.It also showed that the president’s approval and disapproval ratings were both at 44 percent, and the biggest reason for disapproval ― 31 percent ― was the state textbook.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks from thursday ,to tuesday prompting flurry ,opposition party vowing boycott ,textbooks from thursday ,government issued history textbooks","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Education', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Seoul Government Complex']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35862371  0.39738837

The job had been vacant for 33 days since the former head Jung Kwang-sam left office last month. Jung had also announced his intention to run in April’s general election. The reshuffle followed a series of resignations from high-profile Cheong Wa Dae officials who are believed to run for the next general election. Aside from Min and Jung, Park Jong-joon, the deputy head of the presidential security service, stepped down earlier this month. Other two presidential special advisers, Yoon Sang-hyun and Kim Jae-won, also resigned last week.

We should not be left suffering (like this),” said Rep. Lee during a meeting with NPAD lawmakers.The remarks came amid intensifying political and ideological standoff intensifying after a head-on collision between Park and Moon at a rare meeting at Cheong Wa Dae.On Thursday afternoon, Moon urged her to scrap the plan but the president refused to do so, saying that it was aimed at ensuring the “correct” recognition of Korean history for future generations. She also expressed regret over the opposition leader’s allegations that her efforts had become increasingly politicized.With NPAD vowing to resist her drive, the president is also expected to make a public appeal on the plan during her budget speech at the National Assembly next week. Though the issue remains controversial, the opposition party is expected to face a bumpy road ahead with its resistance to Park’s drive as the legislature holds no power to stop the plan. The government can implement the plan by revising enforcement ordinances.The opposition party has been adamantly opposing her drive to issue the state-designated history textbooks that could be used to whitewash pro-Japan activities during the colonial era and the military dictatorships decades ago. The Park administration, meanwhile, has been pushing for the plan, stressing the need to provide a balanced view of history through a single set of history books authored by government-designated writers.Meanwhile, Lee Byung-ki, Park’s Chief of Staff, denied allegations that Cheong Wa Dae put pressure on the Education Ministry over history textbooks.“I heard that there as a government-ruling party consultation meeting (on textbooks) but Cheong Wa Dae has never issued a guideline to the ministry,” Lee told lawmakers at a parliamentary audit session on Friday.“I know it was the Education Ministry that made a final decision to publish state-authored textbooks after collecting the opinion of people from all walks of life.” By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","threatening to boycott president ,history textbooks political disputes ,boycotting speech on history ,history textbooks on friday ,textbooks political disputes intensified","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3848713   0.15693295

During the week, the ratings rose the most Thursday to reach 49.7 percent on the day Park paid a visit to the U.S. Pentagon in a move to hail the Seoul-Washington alliance.Realmeter said the rise in the ratings appears to be due to consolidation of conservative voters upon the country’s sharply divided views on the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks, and the diplomatic event that usually serves in favor of the leader.Support ratings per political party all showed a steady rise as the textbook debate reinforced each side of the ideological spectrum.The ruling Saenuri Party enjoyed an increase of 1.1 percentage points to 42.8 percent, while the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy showed a 0.6 percentage points rise to 26.3 percent.“The ratings for the Saenuri Party notched up as the conservatives gathered upon the state history textbook controversy, not to mention the electoral fraud claim by NPAD lawmaker Rep. Kang Dong-won,” said Realmeter. Rep. Kang’s remarks suggesting rigged election in 2012 prompted backlash from the Saenuri Party as well as his own for stepping out of line.“The NPAD, for its part, saw its ratings rebound due to the history textbook debate and the controversy over Korea’s fighter jet project KF-X,” the polling agency said. Washington turned down, once again during Park’s U.S. visit, Seoul’s request for transfer of some of the key technologies in tandem with its choice of U.S.-based Lockheed Martin to deliver next-generation warplanes. Of the potential contenders for the next presidential election, Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, recorded 19.9 percent, followed by NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in at 18.6 percent. Both saw a slight rise. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soo’s ratings fell 1.3 percentage points to 12.4 percent, maintaining third place, but marking the lowest since the first week of May.From news reports","48 percent last week ,ratings edge up president ,week the ratings rose ,monday the ratings marked ,ratings rose the most","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73926842  0.80649763

The National Assembly’s relevant committees held meetings to review the 2016 budget plans proposed by the government. According to parliamentary law, the lawmakers must complete the review by Nov. 30 and put the budget plan to a vote no later than Dec. 2. But the prospect for smooth legislation looks grim as rival parties are expected to engage in an escalating tit-for-tat over the budget bills that are likely to determine the political landscape in the run-up to next year’s general elections.The ruling Saenuri Party increased its pressure on rival lawmakers to approve the bill in time to jump-start the economy, while the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy vowed to prevent the legislation unless the Saenuri Party withdrew the plan to issue state history textbooks that the NPAD view as a move to inject biased historic views into students. “Considering the budget plan is the last one that the 19th National Assembly can process, we must pass the budget bill no later than Dec. 2,” said Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul. “(The NPAD) should cooperate in approving the budget bills that are related to peoples’ livelihood,” he added. Won also highlighted that the government’s move to adopt the government-issued history textbooks should be separated from the Assembly’s mandate to enact economy-related legislation the party had claimed would overhaul the rigid market and boost the nation’s sluggish economy. The bill aims to revise employment rules and regulations in the medical and tourism industry.Since adopting the book itself does not require parliamentary approval, the Saenuri Party reportedly would seek to use other government money for publishing the textbook if the NPAD rejected the plan. The publishing would cost about 10 billion won ($8.9 million).The NPAD held an emergency meeting Monday to discuss their course of action. While the NPAD pledged to thwart the move, they agreed to refrain from boycotting the parliamentary sessions altogether.“Given that (the adoption of) the textbook is not up to the Assembly, we have no parliamentary leverage to prevent (the legislation). We have no choice but to work with the people and win the next election to solve the problem and sign a new law,” said NPAD floor spokesperson Rep. Lee Un-ju. The NAPD also proposed on Monday a meeting between the rival parties’ leadership to discuss the textbook issue. The Saenuri Party rejected the meeting, saying that adopting and publishing the textbook is the job of historians and experts, not lawmakers. Meanwhile, NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in met on Monday with leaders from other opposition blocs ― Rep. Shim Sang-jeung of Justice Party and Rep. Chun Jung-bae, an independent lawmaker who had defected from the NPAD ― to coordinate their protest against the government’s move. The three opposition leaders announced that they would launch a civil campaign to reject state-authored textbooks. Naming the campaign as “civil defiance,” they said they will seek to gather signatures of endorsement from more than 10 million people.

Kim replaces Ju Chul-ki, who had reportedly offered to resign to take responsibility for Washington’s refusal to transfer fighter tech to Seoul last week.Ju Chul-ki (Yonhap)During a meeting held on the sidelines of Park’s trip, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, once again, rejected a request by South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo to transfer key technologies for building next-generation fighter jets. The delivery of the technology was never guaranteed in the contract when U.S.-based Lockheed Martin was chosen to deliver the next-generation warplanes, although the Seoul government had not publicized the fact until recently.Calling it a “humiliating” case, some ruling party officials blamed Park’s foreign affairs team including Ju, saying he failed to set a proper strategy before Han brought up the case in Washington. Pressure mounted on Ju after reports that he even dragged his feet to report the case to the president in June, after he learned from Seoul’s arms buyer, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, that Washington had already rejected its call two months earlier.The case was left unresolved until an opposition lawmaker brought it up during a parliamentary audit session. It was later found that the president was not informed. As Park’s discipline team initiated an internal probe prior to her trip to Washington, Ju was said to have offered to step down to take responsibility.Speculations have also been growing that Park was considering replacing her entire foreign affairs team including Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Defense Minister Han.Han came under criticism for revealing his intention to request the tech transfer to Washington before accompanying Park on her U.S. trip. Yun, Park’s first foreign minister, is also facing attacks that he failed to coordinate her foreign policies with related ministries and offices. Despite the growing criticism, Park’s reshuffle excluded Han and Yun.Ju has been leading Park’s foreign affairs team since she took office in early 2013. Starting his career as a diplomat since 1972, he served key posts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before he joined Park’s presidential campaign in 2012. Before taking the top senior secretary post, he served as South Korean ambassador to Morocco and France.The former career diplomat is one of the longest-serving senior secretaries who stood by Park for nearly three years. But he has been under constant pressure to resign from opponents questioning his role and capacity in tactfully mediating Park’s bold policies on North Korea and regional security.Known as a man of mild temper, Ju has been considered feeble-minded to question or suggest diplomatic alternatives to the president at times of tension on the Korean Peninsula and tangled relationship with neighboring countries.Kim Kyou-hyun is a career diplomat with expertise on the U.S. Known for his quiet demeanor and being a strategist, he has also been dispatched to the Defense Ministry. He was chosen as the first vice foreign minister upon Park’s inauguration and moved to the NSO in February last year, dealing with North Korean matters.Cho Tae-yong is known for his gentle and balanced delivery and has served in key posts in the Foreign Ministry dealing with the U.S. and North Korea’s nuclear program.He was deputy representative when the historical Sept. 19 Joint Statement was adopted in 2005 and has served as the chief six-party talks negotiator from 2013 to last year when he was promoted to the first vice minister.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","failed tech transfer president ,her new senior presidential ,new senior presidential secretary ,reprimand her foreign affairs ,new senior presidential","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Kim Kyou - hyun', 'the National Security Council', 'Kim', 'Ju Chul - ki']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51095986  0.32145989

This is a very serious issue,” he said.The previous day, Kang had claimed during a parliamentary interpellation session that the previous presidential race “will be recorded as a disorderly election more vicious than the rigged election of former president Syngman Rhee.” He was referring to alleged political interference by the National Intelligence Service during the campaign. Some NPAD members have often compared the 2012 election to the rigged election carried out under the Rhee administration in 1960 to extend his presidency.Their tit-for-tat came on the heels of an intensifying ideological battle back home following the government’s decision to reinstate state-authored history textbooks for secondary education.The National Election Commission also joined the fray by refuting Kang’s argument by detailing how the vote was counted and claimed such allegations seriously harmed the organization’s dignity.The ruling Saenuri Party immediately followed suit and reported Kang to the National Assembly’s ethics committee.NPAD leader Rep.

Moon Jae-in, former President Roh Moo-hyun and the progressives.Taking aim at the chairman of Foundation for Broadcast Culture Ko Young-joo’s repeated description of Moon as a “communist,” the New Politics Alliance for Democracy lawmakers urged him to step down as he had lost the political neutrality required to oversee MBC, of which the FBC is the largest stakeholder.Accusing Ko of being President Park Geun-hye’s personal choice for the post, the NPAD demanded Park should apologize for appointing what it called a “McCarthy-like” figure.“Ko defamed the main opposition party and the National Assembly. It is beyond the people’s tolerance,” NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-gul said. “Ko’s extreme rightist position can’t be compatible with overseeing a major broadcasting company.”“We don’t think Ko is alone. It appears that President Park selected him while being aware of his slanted views. Does the president agree with Ko’s view? Does the president believe that she can run the nation without his resignation?” Lee charged.The accusation reflected escalating ideological tit-for-tat between rival parties in the run-up to the 2016 general elections. While the ruling Saenuri Party turned up the heat in its attempt to revise what they see as “left leaning” history text books, the NPAD hit back at Ko’s “extreme rightist” remarks. In 2013, months after Moon was defeated by Park in the 2012 presidential election, Ko said that it would have been a matter of time before Korea became a communist country if Moon had been elected. The remarks were brought back to spotlight during the annual parliamentary audit last Friday.“When looking at the recent developments, one cannot help but doubt the identity of President Park,” said Supreme Council member Rep. Joo Seung-yong during the party’s emergency meeting convened to discuss Ko. “(Park) will be met with resistance from the people and the opposition unless she sacks him.”Despite the strong pushback from NPAD lawmakers, Ko refused to withdraw his position during the audit, and rather, told lawmakers that he is “confident” that Moon is a communist, along with the late President Roh Moo-hyun, whom he described as a “transformed” communist. The former prosecutor had confronted Roh, then a lawyer, in the 1980s during his investigation into allegations against student activists accused of attempting to overthrow the government, otherwise known as the “Burim Case.” The students were convicted but were retroactively declared innocent of the charges in 2014.After finishing his career as a prosecutor, Ko claimed that he was subjected to political retribution during Roh’s presidency (2003-2008). He dismissed the court’s acquittal decision as being left-leaning, alleging that North Korea had attempted to infiltrate Pyongyang sympathizers into South Korea’s judicial system. Before being appointed as the chief of FBC in August, he was chairman of the Committee for Restoration of National Normalcy, a conservative civic group, which published documents in 2008 that classified some NPAD lawmakers as North Korean sympathizers. Despite the NPAD’s calls for him to resign, the head of Korea Communications Commission, who appointed Ko and other board directors, denied that it had the authority to sack him, and argued that Ko would perform his duty. “We understand that Kim’s remark leans toward (a particular perspective), but we think Ko is capable of doing his job as a board member,” said KCC chairman Choi Sung-joon.Other NPAD lawmakers such as Rep. Song ho-chang raised fresh allegations that Ko had violated the law that bans illegal solicitation of public officials. Song claimed that Ko took a case related to his job at government agencies while he was a public official. Ko strongly denied the allegations. Meanwhile, the ruling Saenuri Party Leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung criticized Ko for making “problematic” remarks during the parliamentary audit. But he downplayed the possibility of his dismissal, saying that he had yet to consider the option.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday demanded the resignation ,opposition party on wednesday ,demands dismissal of fbc ,npad demands dismissal ,remarks against party leader","['Korea ’s', 'MBC', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Foundation for Broadcast Culture Ko Young - joo ’s', 'Moon']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.35952958  0.20423514

Cory Gardner (R-CO) led the introduction of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2015, with Rubio (R-FL) and Jim Risch (R-ID) as co-sponsors, saying the U.S. should not forget ""the severe risk posed by the nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent regime.""""The regime is a menace to the region and to its own people, with a disturbing record of human rights violations. We need a stronger, more focused policy on North Korea, and if the Administration is unwilling to provide it, Congress must act,"" Gardner said in a press release.The new sanctions called for under the legislation would apply the ""pressure required to change North Korea's behavior, and would mandate that the United States finally have a unified strategy for dealing with North Korean cyber attacks,"" the senator said.""We can't go any longer without a serious plan to deal with this threat. It's time to get serious,"" he said.In addition to sanctions, the bill also states that it is the policy of the United States to vigorously pursue sanctions against the North Korean government in order to peacefully disarm the North Korean regime, according to the release.The legislation also requires the president to submit a strategy to counter North Korean cyber-related attacks and impose U.S. sanctions on cyber criminals, while codifying two executive orders released earlier this year authorizing sanctions against entities undermining U.S. national and economic security in cyberspace, it said.The bill also calls for the State Department to identify human rights abusers in North Korea and submit a report on the North Korean regimes' political prison camps.""While the world is distracted by other bad actors, the North Korean regime continues to flagrantly conduct illegal arms sales, proliferate sensitive technology, expand its nuclear weapons program, conduct cyber attacks and repress the North Korean people,"" Rubio said. ""The United States must continue to stand against Kim Jong Un's tyrannical regime and work to pressure North Korea's leadership to end the modern day gulags that should haunt our consciences.""Calling North Korea ""one of the biggest nuclear threats"" to the U.S., Risch accused the administration of President Barack Obama of failure to take ""this threat seriously"" while focusing on ""a bad deal with Iran.""""It is time for the United States to increase pressure on North Korea and require them to end their nuclear program, stop the cyber-attacks against us, and respect the human rights of their own citizens,"" he said.

Suh Chung-won, a key loyalist to the president, collided with embattled party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung on Monday, highlighting the escalating factional tug-of-war over who will take control of the party’s nominations for next year’s general election. Taking aim at Kim’s remarks during a media interview, the seven-term lawmaker accused the party chair of seeking to sway public opinion to turn candidate nominations in his favor and of unilaterally attempting to determine the nomination process without prior discussion with party members. Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung (left) listens as Rep. Sun Chung-won, member of the Supreme Council, criticizes him over the nomination deal at the party’s meeting on Monday. (Yonhap)Kim had said in the newspaper interview that he would pursue a different form of strategic nomination -- a process in which party leadership strategically nominated disabled and female candidates -- as well as nominating high-profile candidates for constituencies that the party is traditionally weak in. It was considered a step back for Kim who had openly shut out the possibility of a full-fledged strategic nomination, considered to benefit party members loyal to President Park Geun-hye. Suh and other Park loyalists denied they were seeking such a strategic nomination, lambasting Kim for toying with nomination processes unilaterally.“I will not tolerate an individual trying to sway (the party) the way he wants,” Suh said, also referring to Kim’s surprise agreement with the main opposition party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in over the adoption of a survey-like nomination procedure for elections. Kim shot back by saying that Suh should make such remarks at a closed-door meeting.“It is a shame that my request for distinguishing between public remarks and private comments was denied. We should stop (the fighting) in front of the people,” said Kim.The verbal fight resulted in a failure of establishing an independent panel within the Saenuri Party to determine the nomination rules. The party had decided to seek alternatives that the party had hoped to provide a breakthrough to the stalemate between Kim and pro-Park faction.The confrontation came amid a partisan stalemate over the reallocating the electoral districts for the 2015 general elections. While rival parties agreed to find ways on Monday to maintain the number of lawmakers elected from constituencies in rural areas, both parties failed to come up with specific measures to address the partisan differences over the rezoning scheme.The Saenuri Party has insisted that the National Assembly increase the number of lawmakers elected from constituencies and cut the portion of proportional representation while the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has argued that more lawmakers should be elected through the proportional representation system. On the sideline of the intensifying in-house scuffle at the Saenuri Party, the main opposition leader Rep. Moon Jae-in urged President Park to withdraw her membership from the ruling party, ramping up his calls for the president to stay away from parliamentary discussion over nominating candidates for next year’s general elections. His remark followed his recent accusation against Park’s objection to the party leaders’ agreement on nomination rules as regressing democracy. He had described Park’s move as “dictatorial attempt” to undermine the democratic rule of separation of power. “I urge President Park to leave the Saenuri Party and focus on improving the people’s livelihood,” Moon was quoted as saying by NPAD spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok. “Park’s desire for post-presidency power should not distract our efforts to reform nomination procedure for elections,” said Kim. The Saenuri Party, for its part, dismissed Moon’s call. “We cannot tolerate the opposition party’s comments on Park,” said the Saenuri Party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo, calling it “incomprehensible” and “laughable.”By Yeo Jun-suk (jasoneyeo@heraldcorp.com)","president collided with embattled ,the president collided ,the president collided with ,saenuri party factional feud ,lawmaker accused the party","['Saenuri Party', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Kim ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59829748  0.06939407

He was also grilled over a golf trip he took shortly after a North Korean land mine injured two South Korean troops in August.Controversy has been brewing after the 61-year-old Army general was found to have described former President Park Chung-hee’s 1961 coup as a “military revolution” in his master’s thesis in 2001. Facing a relay of demands by opposition lawmakers for a clear explanation, Lee simply responded that it was “inappropriate to display a personal opinion” and that he had a “firm belief in political neutrality.” As the lawmakers called for a recess in protest against his repeated refusal to give an answer, Rep. Chung Doo-un of the ruling Saenuri Party who chairs the National Assembly’s defense committee adjourned the morning session early.  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman designate Lee Sun-jin (right) reviews documents during a parliamentary hearing at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)Lee, however, said later in the day that he respects the portrayal by a state history compilation committee of the 1961 takeover as a military coup, and by the Supreme Court of the Dec. 12, 1979, upheaval by former President Chun Doo-hwan as a military rebellion. The former chief of the Army’s 2nd Operations Command became the JCS chairman designate last month as the first-ever Army Academy graduate. If he secures parliamentary endorsement and then presidential approval, he will succeed Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, whose two-year stint has come to an end. Lee also apologized for playing golf only days after two Army staff sergeants were critically wounded in a mine blast while patrolling the southern part of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone in Paju, Gyeonggi Province.His golf trip coincided with the JCS’ unveiling that the mines were deliberately planted by North Korean troops who had crossed the border. In his defense, the general said he did not know about the findings at the time but his comment rather fueled criticism, given heightened tension that brought the two Koreas to the brink of an armed clash. “Even though I was not aware of the situation, I admit that it was not thoughtful for a commander to play golf,” Lee said. Should North Korea attack a border island again, the JCS will retaliate against its origin with additional weaponry including warplanes, Lee said. “A strike on the origin involving fighters can be extra,” he said, when Saenuri Rep. Yoo Seung-min pointed out that the South only mobilized K-9 self-propelled howitzers during Pyongyang’s shelling on Yeonpyeongdo Island in 2010 which killed two civilians and more than a dozen soldiers. “As the JCS chairman, I will instruct joint forces to hit the target.” On Pyongyang’s nuclear capability, he said it is estimated to have a stockpile of highly enriched uranium and been working on miniaturizing its atomic devices, but the scale of the warhead arsenal or any of their deployment remains unconfirmed. Lee also reiterated that it will be “helpful” for the U.S. Forces Korea to station advanced missile defense assets on the peninsula but South Korea has currently no plan to adopt them.“The decision on any stationing will be made based on our own needs and national interests,” he added.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","monday as lawmakers questioned ,former presidents military coups ,korean land mine injured ,fire during parliamentary hearing ,troops in august controversy","['Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Lee Sun - jin', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Army']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25889546  0.49762127

Moon Jae-in on Friday accused President Park Geun-hye of attempting to hold on to her influence by having her followers elected in next year’s general election in response to the ruling camp’s nomination rule row.“It is a dictatorial way of thinking for (President Park) who wants to maintain her power and secure her post-presidency position by getting her close confidants nominated for (a general election).” Moon said of Cheong Wa Dae’s open opposition to the rival party leaders’ agreement earlier this week on a new nomination procedure for April’s parliamentary vote.“Cheong Wa Dae’s attempt to interfere with the nomination issue is an act that denies autonomy and responsibility of party politics,” he said at the New Politics Alliance for Democracy meeting, calling for his embattled counterpart to stick to his guns.Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung(left) and the NPAD Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. YonhapMoon’s remark came amid an escalating tit-for-tat between Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung.The scuffle peaked on Thursday as Cheong Wa Dae publicly denounced Kim’s move and the ruling party leader subsequently denied the accusation. Kim even boycotted party meetings and public events where he was scheduled to attend alongside Park.Mindful of the party being plunged into disarray, Kim and the presidential office agreed to stop the blame game later Thursday evening. On Friday, the Saenuri Party lawmakers decided to form a special body to discuss how to nominate candidates for next year’s general elections. “We are going back to square one,” said the Saenuri Party whip Rep. Won Yoo-chul, “We should nominate excellent candidates who will perform well (at the upcoming elections). There will be no preconditions. We will address this matter in accordance with democratic rules and party’s regulation,” said Won. While predicting that the NPAD would benefit from the standoff between the President and the ruling Party, experts warned that the NPAD should be cautious as the Saenuri Party would eventually heal the wounds despite the president office’s “unprecedented” interference in the political party’s affairs. “Things are turning out better for Moon as his case for democracy is very strong,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. “But given the fact that the president enjoys much higher approval ratings than the NPAD, the impact of Moon’s appeal could be offset,” said Yoon.   “True, Park did violate democratic rules ... but Kim and Park would avert the worst case scenario as both needed each other’s supports. Park needs Kim who has a robust support base in his constituency. Kim, for his part, knows that he will never be able to run for president without Park’s support.”Chairman Kim, meanwhile, continued to challenge the Park loyalists, saying that there will be no “strategic nomination” as written in the party Constitution and rules.“Strategic nomination is a wrongful system. I will no longer discuss it,” Kim told reporters while attending an event. Political parties have often resorted to unilaterally nominating key figures to competitive constituencies. The pro-Park members have called for the system in the upcoming elections to secure a win.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","friday accused president park ,lambasts park for political ,friday accused president ,on friday accused president ,opposition leader moon lambasts","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51235443  0.57199103

Kim Moo-sung hit back at Cheong Wa Dae’s criticism of the party nomination scheme he agreed with the opposition. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy also hit out at the presidential office, accusing it of attempting to meddle in electoral affairs as part of its internal power struggle.Kim, who skipped party meetings and canceled public schedules earlier in the day, made an unexpected visit to the National Assembly to rebut the accusation that he had not fully communicated with Cheong Wa Dae and his party members when he pushed for a new party nomination procedure for elections.Kim also told reporters that he had notified the presidential office of his plan to hammer out an agreement with NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. The two had agreed Monday on a survey-like nomination system via secure phone lines after an impromptu meeting in Busan at Kim’s suggestion.                                                   The ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sug. YonhapThe nomination deal exposed and exacerbated the heavy power struggle between those loyal to President Park and the others in the Saenuri Party, with Cheong Wa Dae jumping into the fray Wednesday with remarks seemingly intended to undermine Kim’s leadership.The presidential office criticized the new nomination system, saying it could damage the fairness of nominations. Kim, however, waved off the concerns and shot back that a Cheong Wa Dae official should not insult a ruling party leader.“I didn’t get to hear whether they (Cheong Wa Dae) agreed or not, I just told them about how I would steer the discussion. (After the meeting) I took a photo of agreement and sent it (to the presidential office),” said Kim. “The reason why I reveal this is because I feel so frustrated. It seems that I have been depicted as someone who orchestrated the whole thing. If they continue to create something out of thin air, the party would be divided and find itself cornered in elections,” said Kim. Choeng Wa Dae clarified Thursday that Kim had notified Hyun Ki-hwan, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, on Sept. 26 of his meeting with Moon. It said that Hyun relayed his concern over Kim’s push for the new nomination procedure. The office also denied that their opposition to the procedure amounted to political interference.The presidential office said that Hyun did not report the matter immediately to President Park as she was on her U.N. trip at the time.The NPAD, meanwhile, denounced the tit-for-tat between Kim and Cheong Wa Dae and dismissed it as an attempt by Park allies to infringe upon political parties’ authority to nominate their own candidates. The NPAD also rejected the call from the Saenuri Party to hold a special meeting for an election system between the two parties’ leaderships. The NPAD labeled it as a move to nullify the effect of the agreement between the leaders of the two parties.  “It seems the demise of Rep. Yoo Seong-min all over again,” said Rep. Lee Jong-gul, referring to the former whip who stepped down under the pressure, having been accused of giving in to an NPAD demand despite Park’s strong objections. “The National Assembly is not an elementary school. Lawmakers are not supposed to sit and write what the president said. It seems to me that President Park wants to interfere with nominating candidates and election processes as a whole. I urge Cheong Wa Dae to mind its own business,” said NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-gul.Meanwhile, the latest poll showed that the ruling Saenuri Party had taken a hit from escalating in-house scuffles over the controversial nomination system. According to the survey on Thursday conducted by Realmeter, the Saenuri Party’s approval rating recorded at 37.4 percent, 3.9 percent point drop from last week.

First off, whether or not it can accurately reflect the public’s opinion,” a high-ranking official from Cheong Wa Dae told reporters.Kim Moo-sung and Moon Jae-in ― leaders of ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy ― had agreed Monday to introduce the “secure number” public nomination system, a variation of open primary that is designed to avert vote-rigging. An open primary allows voters not affiliated with a political party to participate but its critics say it has many side effects such as voters backing weak candidates for parties they are against.  Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung (right) speaks with Rep. Won Yoo-chul during the ruling party`s general assembly held at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The new system will have telecom operators create disposable phone numbers for voters, which are distributed for the parties. The parties would contact the voters on the phone, ask which party they back to eliminate supporters of opposing parties, and collect their vote.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the Cheong Wa Dae official said the presidential office felt the need to voice concerns over the system that has been sugar-coated as an advisable alternative.“We already know from experience that the results of opinion polls via phone are fundamentally different from the actual results,” he said, pointing out that the average response rate for the phone polls is south of 2 percent. The official added that using “the secure numbers” would not be sufficient to protect the identity of the voter in smaller constituencies.The point-by-point criticism came after Kim told reporters that the introduction of this new system does not require the approval of the presidential office since it is a mere technicality. While presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook declined to formally comment on the matter, other Cheong Wa Dae officials have criticized Kim for touching off the politically sensitive issue during President Park Geun-hye’s visit to New York for the U.N. General Assembly.The move came amid speculation that Cheong Wa Dae is keeping a check on Kim, who has been enjoying high approval rating as the potential next presidential candidate until a recent scandal involving his son-in-law’s conviction for drug abuse.Kim made an equally strong rebuttal against the Blue House, saying a presidential official “should not insult a party leader” and told the pro-Park faction not to attack him, saying he “has limits.”Kim reacted to Cheong Wa Dae’s criticism during his party’s general assembly later in the day, saying that all but one of its claims ― the part about average response rate for the phone polls being low ― were incorrect. He reportedly said the standoff was caused by a “misunderstanding” over technical aspects of the new system. The general assembly adjourned without reaching a decision on the issue.Kim, considered a “non-Park” member, had often butted heads with the pro-Park faction, but has also worked in cooperation with Park, particularly during her presidential campaign as the director of her campaign headquarters in 2012. Park and Kim have generally maintained rigid yet polite relations, especially after the summer carnage that ultimately reinstated the president’s presence in the ruling party. Park had lashed out against the party leadership for dillydallying on her reform initiatives, leading to the resignation of then-floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min.Implementing open primaries has been one of Kim’s major political platforms, but the pro-Park faction has been claiming Kim’s true aim is to widen his political clout. They upped the attack after the bipartisan agreement by accusing the Saenuri leader of “giving in” to NPAD demands. Park loyalists and Kim reportedly collided head on during a closed-door meeting of Saenuri lawmakers Wednesday morning.“Put aside the factional dispute. How can an agreement with an opposition leader without any discussion or consultation with party members be considered democratic?” Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said, adding that each party should decide on which system to adopt for its nomination process.Kim has denied accusations that he caved in to the NPAD’s demands and claimed that the new plan is a “completely different one” from what the opposition had proposed. He did vow to hold additional talks within the party, saying that the agreement with Moon was not a final decision.The Kim-Moon agreement was a contentious issue among the opposition lawmakers as well, with the nonmainstream NPAD members questioning its effectiveness.Senior lawmaker Park Jie-won tweeted that he agreed with involving the public in the primary but was against using the “secure numbers.” Rep. Song Ho-chang said using an opinion poll to nominate candidates for the election “defies the basic principles of democracy.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","presidential office on wednesday ,house bashes party nomination ,nomination proposals the presidential ,opposition to the bipartisan ,general election signaling","['Cheong', 'Dae']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65821201  0.27487603

Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor opposition Justice Party, claiming that the notion of cutting costs for the kindergartens was glossed over by education offices across the country as a result.Jeong also pointed out that the average fee for an English kindergarten was 751,000 won ($630) per month this year, an 8.5 percent climb from 692,000 won in 2013. Only 9 percent of the kindergartens cut fees while 33.2 percent had raised them. The average monthly income for a Korean household in the second quarter of this year was 4.27 million won, according to Statistics Korea. Seoul had the priciest English kindergartens at 1.01 million won, while institutes in the city of Gwangju saw the most drastic increase of 20.3 percent, from 219,000 to 263,500 won.“The ministry promptly announced it would reduce costs for English kindergartens, and they did practically nothing. They should at least try to implement the policy they’ve announced,” said Jeong. The rise in private education spending, particularly for children before they start compulsory education, has been causing concern in Korea. While the government has boasted that private spending dropped for the fifth straight year in 2014 to 18.2 trillion won, the amount of money spent per student had actually increased for the second consecutive year.According to the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, last year’s private education spending for children below the age of compulsory schooling jumped 22.2 percent to mark 3.2 trillion won. Woo Cheon-shik, an official from the Korea Development Institute recently announced that the actual amount of money spent on private education may be much larger than the ministry’s estimate.“Our analysis of the figures from Statistics Korea indicate that the annual private education spending is 32.9 trillion won, and is trending up,” he said in a seminar cohosted by the Finance Ministry’s Committee for the Mid/Long-term Strategy and the presidential National Economic Advisory Council.Woo warned that the bloating private education costs can widen the already considerable disparity between haves and have-nots in terms of money they spend on education. The top 10 percent of income earners in Korea spend on average 16 times more money on their children’s private education than the bottom 10 percent, according to local civic group A World Without Worries About Private Education. With parents spending more on their children’s education, Korea has seen a surge in the “edu-poor” in recent years, which refers to those who have become poor due to their children’s education costs.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","suppress the billowing tuition ,opposition lawmaker said thursday ,in kindergarten tuition hike ,korean government has failed ,private education an opposition","['south korean', 'the Education Ministry']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48285908  0.39906257

They claimed the government was singling out some liberal-leaning artists to deny them support from the nation’s largest funding agency, a move that Rep. Lee Jong-kul, floor leader of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, cast as a “return to anti-democracy.”  “The Park Geun-hye administration has tightened its grip on the arts and culture. I warn against its attempt to return to the era where democratic values were banned and denied. We will do whatever it takes to uphold the right to freedom of speech and improve the culture industry,” Lee said Tuesday.Rep. Lee Jong-kul. YonhapHis remark followed the NPAD lawmakers’ revelation during the parliamentary inspection into government agencies. Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the NPAD charged that Arts Council Korea manipulated the funding list to exclude those critical of the government, such as directors Lee Yun-taek and Park Geun-hyeong. Lee’s play titled “A Time to Offer Flowers,” was excluded from the list, though his play was awarded the top score in the evaluation process. Lee had supported Rep. Moon Jae-in in the 2012 presidential campaign. Park, whose play had a scene where actors mock President Park’s policy, failed to bring his play to the final list in first place. Park had said in a media interview that his political satire led to his project’s outright withdrawal from the list. As the scandal over censorship escalates, artists have held press conferences to denounce what they called “politically motivated” interference in cultural affairs and called for the government to stop censoring art products. “Freedom of speech is one of the greatest achievements from the past democratic movement. We have fought against the dictatorship really hard to achieve these goals. We believe censorship is the government’s attempt to control the public and undermine democratic values,” an association of advocacy groups for artists said in a press conference. But Arts Council Korea denied the allegation, saying that the agency had never considered political factors in determining the list for funding. In a statement, the agency said that they had simply laid out individual views about Park’s plays and that Lee’s work was excluded from the list as he had frequently received financial support from the agency before.Critics said the controversy well reflects the transition period of Korea’s democracy that still falls behind advanced nations, but downplayed the NPAD attempt to associate the government’s move with steps taken during the dictatorship, as they have different motives.“Fundamentally, a democratic government has the duty to endorse civil society. Korea is still struggling with this issue. The trend nowadays in advanced nations is to minimize the interference of the administration. It would be problematic if the level of (government) interference continues to rise,” Lee Taek-gwang, a professor of cultural studies at Kyung Hee University.“But it is different from what we witnessed during dictatorship. Back then, the government engaged in censorship under the logic of national security. As the overall society democratizes, the government also becomes one of the interest groups. Rather than making a direct interference, it is more so that the government is acting on behalf of its interests. The case for dictatorship is more of political rhetoric,” said Lee.By Yeo Jun-suk (Jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","attacks arts censorship lawmakers ,banned from government financial ,opposition party on tuesday ,their projects were banned ,npad attacks arts censorship",[],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38686782  0.11717448

Park Joo-sun bolted from the main opposition party to create a new one Tuesday, claiming the New Political Alliance for Democracy had run its course under the current leadership.The prosecutor-turned-politician said at a press conference that he would move to reorganize the opposition bloc and build an alternative political force, dealing yet another blow to NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. Rep. Park Joo-sun answers reporters` questions at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapPark joins a couple of other opposition politicians who have pledged to launch new parties, including independent Rep. Chun Jung-bae and former South Jeolla Gov. Park Joon-young.While all three have for the time being vowed to focus on their individual activities, there is speculation that they may seek to team up against the NPAD ahead of next year’s general election.“I plan to meet with (Chun and Park) in the near future,” the lawmaker said. All three hail from or represent Jeolla Province, the opposition’s political home turf.His move follows Moon’s decision a day before to cancel a vote of confidence that was seen as an attempt to temporarily silence his dissenters.Park’s defection had been widely anticipated as he was one of the party’s most vocal dissenters.“Although I have waited a long time for the NPAD to change through innovation, I have grown very skeptical whether the party will be able to seize the next administration,” Park said.Park entered politics in 2000 by winning in the South Jeolla Province constituency after serving as a legal affairs secretary in the Kim Dae-jung administration. Earlier, he served in various key posts as a prosecutor. He currently represents Dong-gu of Gwangju.Since the election of Moon as party chairman in February this year, Park has openly said that he would leave the party unless the factional hegemony led by the forces loyal to former President Roh Moo-hyun was discarded.He becomes the first NPAD lawmaker to have discarded his party membership voluntarily.This is not the first time that he has left the party. In the past, he left and rejoined the party repeatedly in the course of his arrest and acquittal on corruption charges through the years.Views were split on whether Park’s move would prompt an exodus of other disgruntled NPAD members.“When the party stabilizes around chairman Moon, we will be able to recover our momentum.

Chung Mi-kyung of the ruling Saenuri Party showed.  The indemnity claim is second of its kind after the Navy paid 27.3 billion won in compensation to Samsung C&T; Corp. last month for the financial burden stemming from the delayed construction.   Samsung C&T;, another contract builder for the project, kept its laborers and construction equipment ready as the construction, initially scheduled to begin in 2010, did not kick off until 2012 due to protests from environmental and other civic activists.   The Navy plans to settle Daelim's compensation suit through an arbitration body because it cannot accept the compensation amount claimed, according to the report.     Environmental and village protesters had staged massive rallies against the naval project on the southern resort island of Jeju, leading to a major delay in construction.  In efforts to solidify naval defense near the island, the Navy created the plan in 2007 to build a harbor big enough to accommodate 20 battleships and two cruise vessels near Gangjeong village on the southern tip of the island.  If completed as scheduled by the end of this year, the 1 trillion won project will provide South Korea with a launching point from which to send naval vessels into southern waters, a key trade route for the country.

The government has raised the need to forge a common understanding of history in a country where many people are deeply divided along political, regional and ideological fault lines.  Currently, eight private publishing companies print history textbooks after winning approval from the government. Middle and high schools then can choose any of the eight publishers' textbooks.   ""The textbooks being circulated right now are based on common viewpoints of the academic circle, and they have already been approved by the government,"" they said in the statement. ""If the state-authored system is implemented, it would deny the knowledge and perspectives shared by the majority of people in the field and impose the interpretation of those holding power.  ""Political authority and history should keep a certain distance,"" they said. ""A sound leader of a democratic society should focus on policies to improve the reality and future of the people for their happiness instead of engaging in the interpretation of history.""  They also said imposing a standardized view of history infringes upon the neutrality and autonomy in education guaranteed in the constitution.   About 160 professors from Korea University and some 1,100 liberal scholars and researchers of history and history education, as well as over 15,000 teachers in the field have voiced their opposition to the government's plan.  Meanwhile, conservative civic groups support the plan, arguing that most textbooks being circulated are left-leaning.  ""They all describe the country's history in a negative light,"" a group consisting of retired principals said in a statement released last Thursday. About a thousand retired principals participated in releasing the statement.   ""As the future is made from history, having a negative view of it and being self-abusive over it should be avoided,"" Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, said. ""State-authored history textbooks written based on corroborated facts and a neutral perspective should be introduced.""  Rep. Kang Eun-hee of the ruling party also said while the current system seems to respect diversity, it does not, as schools only choose one among the eight options and students learn with the one chosen. She said the proposed system could contribute to establishing a more balanced concept of history.  ""To keep the nation from being split in the classrooms, we need to teach a common history,"" Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea said.  The Ministry of Education plans to make a decision on the issue by the end of the month.

Moon Jae-in on Monday withdrew a self-imposed vote of confidence, pledging to conduct sweeping reforms to reunite the party mired in intensifying factional clashes.Moon’s much-anticipated decision, which followed Sunday’s endorsement by mainstreamers, was seen to put a sour end to weeks of raucous infighting prompted by his press conference on Sept. 9 to stake his leadership on the New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s reform measures. Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)While praised by Moon and his followers, his renewed approbation was shunned or discounted by some key party figures and potential rivals, including former party whip Rep. Park Jie-won and former cochairmen Kim Han-gil and Ahn Cheol-soo.Moon said he respected the decision made by a group of lawmakers and key members of the party to support him and urged the party to take the agreement as a chance to put an end to the factional feud and start afresh. On Sunday, the NPAD’s executive committee had agreed to proclaim confidence in the chairman without a vote and demanded Moon’s dissenters stop questioning his leadership. “I will withdraw my plan and humbly accept the loyalty (sworn by the party members). I will fulfill my responsibility to reform and reunite the party,” Moon said in a statement.“I will also make efforts for the unity of the progressive blocs to win the general elections.” Going forward, Moon is expected to speed up his efforts to dissolve factional feuds and seek ways to improve transparency in the party’s nomination rules in a dire attempt to restore the voters’ trust ahead of the general elections in April next year.However, Moon’s decision, as well as the agreement reached by the mainstreamers, were slammed by some 20 members of the nonmainstream factions, who called the recent development a political show and a half-baked show of confidence.Ahn, in particular, has been seeking to generate fresh momentum with supporters by hitting out at Moon and proposing alternative ways to reform the party. Rep. Chun Jung-bae, an NPAD-turned-independent lawmaker, also said on Sunday that he plans to launch a new party by January, saying that there is no future for the NPAD.Moon, for his part, defended his decision and leadership.On Ahn’s criticism about the party leadership showing double standards against corruption involving heavyweight figures, Moon countered by saying that the case of former Prime Minister Han Myung-sook, imprisoned for bribery, was a “clear case of a politically unfair” ruling, while speaking in a radio interview.The chairman also expressed his displeasure with Rep. Chun’s plan of launching a new party, defining it as an attempt to divide the party that goes against the voters’ sentiment in the South Jeolla Province region, where the party holds a strong sway.Chun lashed out at a news conference Sunday, saying he hoped Moon would “mind his own business” in response to the chairman’s request for him to rejoin the NPAD. On Monday, Moon rebuked him, saying it was rude to use such words.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","moon cancels confidence vote ,monday withdrew self imposed ,intensifying factional clashes moon ,factional clashes moon ,weeks of raucous infighting","['Moon Jae - in', 'the New p']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.72014809  0.08345511

(Yonhap)None of the major or minor parties have so far managed to set the agenda in their checking of the administration, instead being sidetracked by internal struggles ahead of next year’s general election.A slight chance of a redemption fizzled out as their superficial questions against high-profile witnesses such as Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin simply highlighted the need to overhaul the outdated audit system and practices.Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae has been reveling in its newfound momentum, as President Park Geun-hye, with approval ratings back above 50 percent, pushes ahead with her reform initiatives.Buoyed by what the government trumpeted as the “successful management” of the North Korean situation upon the Aug. 25 agreement and her attendance at China’s Sept. 3 military parade, it indeed seemed no other political power was close to keeping the administration in check.While the ruling Saenuri Party churns out nothing but praise for Park’s policies, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy remains too preoccupied with in-house battles to seriously criticize her initiatives. Observers said the dynamics between Park and the Assembly had shifted in favor of the administration, as it had more ability than the legislative branch to take initiative in state affairs.“There should be a healthy tension between the administration and the National Assembly,” said Lee Jung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Political parties sometimes need to unite and speak out against the government, but recently, there has been no such move.” The legislative absence was reflected in Park’s relentless push to reform the labor market, an issue that rival parties struggled to take the initiative on. The Saenuri Party, which has been cautious, even reluctant to protest against the president, especially since the July carnage that eventually resulted in “defiant” party whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min resigning, after Park threatened to veto an agreement he had landed with the NPAD. The Saenuri Party wasted no time in endorsing her labor reforms. The NPAD, for its part, struggled to address the president’s drive as the party is still mired in factional infighting over the party’s governance, structure and the fate of its leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. Professor Lee said the dysfunction in the legislative branch stemmed from lawmakers’ lack of policymaking expertise. Lawmakers’ ability to analyze policy and draft relevant bills is behind that of the ministries and other government branches.“If you compare the bill drafted by the executive branch to one drafted by the legislators, you will notice that the latter is inferior in terms of the depth of research and relevance to the issue,” he said. According to research by the Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice, a Seoul-based civic group, most bills, particularly those from prolific lawmakers, were found to be almost identical, churned out under different names, or contained similar provisions to those of the existing laws. The lawmakers’ lack of expertise is best shown during the ongoing parliamentary inquiry into government agencies. During the sessions, some of those who were eager to showcase their policy expertise were subjected to public ridicule for asking off-topic questions. Rep. You Dae-woon of the NPAD, for instance, came under attack for demanding the nation’s police chief to “demonstrate” how to shoot a gun before lawmakers in his questioning about gun accidents.Critics attributed their below-standard performance to the lopsided characteristics of Korea’s political parties, which have an overabundance of high-profile political heavyweights and an insufficient system to support rank-and-file lawmakers’ legislation. “Compared to the United States, where each congressman has about 20 to 50 aides, Korean lawmakers are only allowed to have a maximum of six aides. The number of policy researchers in the Assembly is only one-tenth of that of the U.S,” said Yoon Seung-yi of Kyung Hee University.The systematic fallout stems from the fact that even the established lawmakers have a hard time holding on to their seats in the Assembly and consequently the parliamentary committees. With more than half of the incumbent lawmakers losing their seats during each election, those currently in office frequently change from one committee to another depending on vacancies. Preferences also play a major part in fickle rotation of committee compositions as popular ones are often allotted to high-profile members as rewards.Such a frequent turnover among lawmakers prevents them from accumulating knowledge to address issues that are only getting more diverse and complex these days, political watchers say. Some critics half-jokingly label the Assembly as an organization for “amateurs” or “interns.” The dysfunctional parliament, the pundits said, will persist unless changes are made to the unique culture of Korea’s political system that centers on the prominence of party heavyweights, not rank-and-file lawmakers’ political expertise in legislative affairs.“Since Korea’s political parties’ depend upon the prominence of party heavyweights, the best strategy for lawmakers who want to raise their profile is to impress the top-brass in parties, not to develop political expertise,” said Yoon.The origin of major political parties traces back to the history of Korea’s politics. While the era of Three Kims ― former Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam and retired heavyweight Kim Jong-pil ―- has ended after they dominated Korean politics for more than a decade since the 1980s, the tendency lives on as parties often depend on and revere a political leader.In 2008, there was even a party named “pro-Park (Geun-hye) association” in the midst of the nomination battle within the Grand National Party, a precursor to the Saenuri Party.This long-running phenomenon has led to undermining public trust toward the parliament, as the voters view the parties as a proxy organization campaigning under an eventual presidential candidate, rather than an entity formed by like-minded legislators.According to a report from Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, only 17.4 percent of surveyed voters said they trusted the National Assembly, which was about 20 percent lower than their sentiments toward the executive branch. Of all public organizations, it ranked the lowest in public trust.Experts predicted that Park would maintain her dominance over the National Assembly until next April’s general election because the ruling Saenuri Party leadership will refuse to oppose her as she is just more than halfway through her five-year presidency. “I am pretty sure that President Park will hold on to her dominance … because those who seek future power dare not resist those who are currently in power,” said Shin Yul, political professor at Myongji University.

""The ruling party, the government and the presidential office agreed to closely collaborate on the drive for labor reform this year.""President Park Geun-hye has made easing labor regulations a top priority policy goal for the second half of her presidency.The government said that the reforms will increase labor flexibility in a country where job creation is the top priority amid the protracted economic slowdown.Currently, companies can terminate an employee's contract only when they are either involved in corruption or an embezzlement case. Firms are also permitted to lay off a number of workers should they face serious financial difficulty.But the labor circle opposes the deal, claiming that such reforms would jeopardize job stability.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the country's two umbrella labor groups, has vowed to stage a general strike on Wednesday in protest against the trilateral deal. The KCTU was not part of the trilateral committee.

Ahn Cheol-soo said that party members involved in corruption allegations should be immediately kicked out regardless of their status, calling for ""zero tolerance"" toward corruption.""If we do not fight corruption within our party, we cannot cope with corruption in the country. Now is the time for the NPAD to reform itself from scratch,"" Ahn said in a press conference which marked the third anniversary of his entrance into the political realm.The proposal came from the NPAD's reform committee, which was set up in May with the goal of resolving its internal factional feuds and to reverse the party's falling popularity.The main opposition party underwent crushing defeats in the parliamentary by-elections in April, raising urgency for the NPAD to win back voters' hearts ahead of next year's general elections.Moon Jae-in, chairman of the NPAD, has been in conflict with Ahn over Moon's recent proposal to hold a confidence vote on his leadership.Moon earlier said that he will step down if the party does not approve a new set of reform measures proposed by the reform committee, including how to pick candidates for the general elections next April.Ahn criticized the NPAD chairman, saying that his proposal will only aggravate the factional strife. Members of minority factions also vehemently opposed the proposal, saying that the move will only benefit Moon's followers.Later in the day, NPAD lawmakers and senior party members plan to discuss the issue of Moon's confidence vote.Also Sunday, Chun Jung-bae, an opposition-turned-independent lawmaker, announced plans to form a new party.

At the meeting, Moon said he would think about withdrawing the vote as lawmakers including Rep.

Lee Jong-kul remained uncooperative about conducting the vote, believing his attitude was a clear expression of him wanting Moon to step down. “The floor leader who was also in the meeting said he doesn’t know what to do with the vote and he has no authority to convene legislators for that,” said Choi.“This was an attempt to sideline Moon’s plan of doing the vote.”In a surprising announcement last week, Moon said he would have his chairmanship tested -- widely seen as an attempt to consolidate his leadership and silence objection from nonmainstream members of the party.

According to Rep. Baek Kun-ki of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, a Korean weapons brokerage based in the U.S., was involved in the Defense Acquisition Program Administration’s 2012 bid to adopt new AW-159 Wildcat helicopters in breach of the agency’s revised guidelines of 2010 ― which ban the participation of agents in a procurement project worth $2 million or higher. The chopper contract was valued at 589 billion won ($503.2 million).In its defense, the Seoul-based DAPA said the company only served as a “consultant,” not a broker directly involved in the deal. But in related documents submitted by the agency for a parliamentary audit, it was specified as a “trade agent,” Baek refuted. “The company can hardly evade questions about its suspected brokering activity given that it took part in a briefing session on the helicopter purchase in January 2012 as a trade agent,” he said. “It is unacceptable that DAPA broke its own rules to facilitate the broker’s participation by simply changing its position as a consultant.” The allegation emerged as a pangovernmental team consisting of prosecutors, state auditors, police and tax officials are looking into alleged malpractices by the country’s major defense brokers who have held sway over high-profile state procurement deals. The helicopter bid was at the center of its probe, with at least seven Navy executives indicted for forging the Wildcat’s test certificates to meet the qualifications. Former Patriots and Veterans Affairs Minister Kim Yang was also arrested in late June on charges of taking some 1.4 billion won in bribes from its U.K. manufacturer Agusta Westland. “With our defense industry lacking competitive edge, the back-scratching alliances between military and industry officials make the essential problem,” NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in said, calling for the nurturing of small- and midsize firms to consolidate the fundamentals. DAPA Minister Chang Myoung-jin conceded, saying there is a “possibility for corruption originated from personal connections” and vowing to continue to implement steps to stamp out irregularities and take greater care of major programs on his own. During the session, opposition lawmakers also launched a salvo on the rampant supply of faulty equipment in the military. After analyzing data by the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality, NPAD Rep. Kim Kwang-jin said that 103 out of 110 life jackets distributed in 2012 to the sailors of the 7,600-ton Aegis-equipped destroyer Seoae Ryu Seong-ryong failed to pass the quality test due to defects in their buoyant materials. NPAD Rep. Ahn Gyu-baek raised criticism for a perceived lax management of night vision goggles, saying Seoul’s current regulations do not stipulate any lifespan for quality assurance and thus the tools may foil soldiers’ night operations if used for too long.

Moon Jae-in walks up to a podium Wednesday to deliver a speech at the party’s central committee meeting on a proposed reform package at the National Assembly. (Yonhap)With the initiatives getting the official nod from the party, Moon appears to have seized a chance to consolidate his powerbase ahead of the elections. However, prospects remain unpromising as the approval was seen to sweep the burgeoning discord under the carpet, instead of turning around the party’s divisive mood.Moon’s call for a vote of confidence also stands after he proposed it earlier this month to confront mounting pressure for him to resign.If the measures were approved by the central committee, Moon had said he would have his leadership tested by holding a vote before the Chuseok holiday in late September.Calling it a new beginning, Moon said he would start implementing fresh measures to fundamentally reform the party and urged the party to end the ongoing factional fight for a shared goal of winning the elections next year.“The passage of the reform proposal is not the end but only the beginning,” said Moon after the meeting.“We will unite our party and become a winning political party through adopting fundamental and cultural changes apart from institutional innovation,” he said.The meeting was held a day after Moon met with former party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in a closed-door meeting to seek common ground for the party’s future and put an end to their public fissures. The meeting ended in failure only to confirm each other’s differences. Ahn boycotted the Wednesday meeting, claiming that he was deprived of a right to freely express his opposition to the reform measures.“If chairman Moon didn’t risk his leadership with the fate of the reform measures, I could have attended the central committee meeting and started a debate there to explain why I was opposing it,” said Ahn in a message texted to reporters. “But unfortunately, the meeting today has turned into (an event) to make a decision on the chairman’s fate.”The two have been engaged in a war of words as to whether or not to put the reform measures to a vote at Wednesday’s executive meeting, each accusing the other of driving the party into another catastrophe in pursuit of political gain. The NPAD central meeting was expected to be critical for both, as Moon wanted to reestablish his leadership and silence nonmainstream members who vehemently opposed reform measures. Ahn sought to stop Moon’s drive, which could hold back his ambition to be the liberal contender for the next presidential election. Despite the result, the chairman is likely to face pressure continuously from nonmainstream members to resign from his post. “After the vote, Moon, is expected to seek a political alliance with Rep. Ahn and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who both hold a strong image as innovative figures in the party,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live. It is crucial for Moon to work with Ahn and Park in order to win the general election next year, as they hold a strong support base among younger voters, particularly in Seoul and neighboring cities, he added. Moon has risked his leadership in line with the fate of the reform measures aimed at adopting new nomination rules. If the party disapproved the measures, the chairman said he would leave his post.His surprise announcement, aimed at silencing objectors, sparked a backlash, as the nonmainstream members escalated their demand that the vote on the reform proposals be delayed.Nonmainstream members had demanded that the vote be put off until after Oct. 8 when the parliamentary audit ends. They have remained skeptical of the plans, suspecting that the group of mainstreamers, led by Moon, would abuse the reform proposals to pursue their own political agendas.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","reform initiatives on wednesday ,opposition party approved package ,on wednesday despite opposition ,some of moon opponents ,wednesday despite opposition","['Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s', 'Moon ’s']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.35080177  0.1163421

The tripartite committee of labor, management and the government on Sunday struck a deal on reforming the labor market. The deal was endorsed by the Federation of Korea Trade Unions -- the largest umbrella union in the country -- the next day.Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung said that a bipartisan agreement for the revisions must be reached by Sept. 19, as the National Assembly’s final regular session closes in December. “This agreement was reached by the leaders of the related sectors and experts through over 120 meetings in the past year. Both the ruling and the opposition parties have a duty to respect the objectives and the content of the compromise,” Kim said. But the five-point labor law revision encompasses thorny issues flagrantly opposed by both the opposition lawmakers and many of the labor unions, heralding a grim prospect for the reform bill. The Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the second-largest trade union in the country and widely perceived as more belligerent than the FKTU, vowed an “all-out war” against what it defined as “collusion” of the tripartite members.The focal points of the dispute are revisions on the dispatched workers’ act and temporary agency workers’ act. The former expands the scope of dispatched workers by including specialized workers with annual income of over 56 million won ($48,000) and workers aged 55 or older, while allowing more sectors to employ them. The latter extends the maximum employment period for temporary workers from two years to four for workers aged 35 or older.The Saenuri Party and the Labor Ministry say the revision will protect temporary workers from being laid off, but the opposition argues that it will only prolong the nonguaranteed period for most workers.“(The bill for temporary workers) potentially can be a disaster. Right now we have the largest number of short-period workers among OECD members. I think increasing the number of temporary workers can be catastrophic for young people,” Rep. Eun Soo-mi of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said in a radio interview. She added that the dispatched workers bill can deteriorate the quality of jobs, particularly for elderly workers. Eun called the compromise a “half-baked deal” as the FKTU only represents about 5 percent of workers.The parties have similar opinions on the other three revisions. The revision for the Employment Insurance Act will increase unemployment benefits, and changes made to the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act will expand the range of accidents occurring during commute that are covered by companies. The Labor Standards Act will be revised to decrease working hours and clarify the standards for base payment.But the bipartisan discord is even more pronounced in the government’s plan to establish administrative guidelines that will make it easier for companies to lay off underperforming workers and revise company policies without the union’s approval.NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul said he cannot accept what his party had defined as a tool for “easy layoffs,” and said the party would agree on a legislative discussion for the layoff plans. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","saenuri party on wednesday ,five labor law amendments ,party on wednesday decided ,the government on sunday ,party on wednesday",['Saenuri Party'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48552141  0.2512494

The government has been raising the need to forge a common understanding of history in a country where people are divided ideologically.Currently, eight private publishing companies print history textbooks after winning approval from the government. Middle and high schools then can choose any of the eight publishers' textbooks.""It is not a simple question of history but of diversity, a crucial value in a democratic society,"" professor Kim Eon-jong said in a press conference at the university in Seoul.He was explaining why professors from all across the university, including those from the business administration department to the literature department, participated in releasing the statement. They argued the proposed system is an iconic child of the country's past military-backed regimes. ""What they call common understanding of history could be shaped by those holding the power,"" they added in the statement.  ""It is very regretful that the government did not discuss the issue with the experts in the field before pushing the plan,"" professor Kwon Nae-hyun said.

Moon Jae-in (Yonhap)The former and incumbent chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy had been engaging in a fight as to whether or not to put the reform measures to a vote at Wednesday’s executive meeting, each accusing the other of driving the party into another catastrophe in pursuit of political gain. The NPAD meeting on Wednesday was expected to be critical for both, as Moon wants to consolidate his leadership and silence nonmainstream members who vehemently oppose reform measures. Ahn seeks to stop Moon’s drive, which could hold back his ambitions to be liberal contender for the next presidential election.  Ahn Cheol-soo (Yonhap)The prospects for their precarious relationship remain dim despite their meeting Tuesday, observers say. “It could defuse mounting tension between the mainstream members and the non-mainstreamers for the time being, but the infighting is likely to continue for a considerable time,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live.In the latest in a series of verbal battles, Rep. Moon sent a handwritten letter to Ahn on Monday afternoon rebuking Ahn, saying that his demand to delay the party vote on the reform initiatives was “totally incomprehensible.” In the letter, which Moon posted on his Twitter later in the evening, the chairman stressed that he was pushing ahead with the matter because he believed that it was time for the party to move forward and put an end to the intensifying factional feud by adopting the new nomination rules. “I don’t understand at all, then, what are you suggesting me to do?” he wrote. “There have been growing voices (within the party) demanding me to resign from the chairmanship for a long time, and the division and the conflict that followed have put our party on hold, making it difficult for all of us to go forward. Then what would be solution to that?” In apparent retaliation, Ahn held a news conference early Tuesday blasting Moon once again, saying he was missing the fundamental point of the party reform. “If he pushes ahead with the measures, many people will cast doubts over him and his purpose,” he said. The entrepreneur-turned-lawmaker also said he would meet Moon face to face to settle the matter completely. The lawmaker has been boycotting Moon’s proposal to hold a vote of confidence on his leadership and urged the central committee to indefinitely postpone the Wednesday meeting.The sour relationship between the two goes back to the 2012 presidential election when they first held negotiations over merging candidacies to fight against then-ruling party candidate Park Geun-hye. After a series of lengthy talks, Ahn gave up his candidacy in the 2012 presidential election to support Moon, the then-presidential candidate for the Democratic United Party, the precursor to the NPAD. Ahn’s “support” however was lukewarm. Though he accompanied Moon on the campaign trail, he mostly remained reserved. After Moon’s defeat, the two remained at odds. Speculation was rampant that Ahn had demanded Moon join him in founding a new party and give him sole authority in political reform in return for merging the two campaigns.In early 2014, while Moon was still out of the spotlight suffering his election defeat, Ahn agreed to establish a new political party with then-Democratic Party chairman Rep. Kim Han-gil, thus the party’s new name, its third in as many years. After a short honeymoon period, Ahn offered to resign from his post as cochairman, taking responsibility for the NPAD’s crushing defeat in the following by-election. Moon remained out of the political spotlight until he seized the NPAD leadership earlier this year.Geum Tae-seop, a lawyer who worked as Ahn’s spokesman during the presidential race, said that despite the dramatic alliance the two sought during the presidential election, Ahn and Moon had remained poles apart.“Park Kyung-cheol (Ahn’s confidant) had said Ahn and Moon shared a deep connection that other people wouldn’t notice. They also met several times in unofficial settings (offering an impression) that they would work things out,” wrote Geum in a recent book.“Unlike what Park had said, there was no chemistry between the two candidates,” he wrote.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","two former presidential candidates ,reform spat the rivalry ,former presidential candidates moon ,tuesday evening the damage ,former presidential candidates","['Moon Jae - in', 'Ahn Cheol']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.64398789  0.46253663

Han Jeong-ae of the NPAD. Yonhap“Chong violated the law especially considering the fact that he holds the position that oversees the elections,” the party said.But the party decided to reserve the impeachment on Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan who made similar comments in favor of the Saenuri Party during the same dinner. Choi refused to apologize for his remark. A source said that any move against Choi would be decided later by taking the parliamentary audit procedure into consideration.The rival parties are gearing up for parliamentary elections next April.As the controversy escalated, Chong held a news conference last month and apologized for his toast but refused to step down, instead vowing to ensure that his ministry would remain neutral in elections.The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, rebuked the NPAD’s move, calling it an excessive political offensive.The party said that because only incumbent ruling party members were present at the dinner, Chong’s toast had no political motivation.Under relevant laws, the National Assembly can initiate an impeachment motion against a Cabinet minister if one-third of the lawmakers endorses it. Over half of the 298-member Assembly must vote for the motion to be referred to the Constitutional Court.

Moon Jae-in’s leadership became increasingly questionable after his ultimatum last week was seen to further escalate the in-house scuffle.NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in leaves his office at the National Assembly on Monday. YonhapMoon was absent from the party’s Supreme Council meeting for first time since he seized the chairmanship of the New Political Alliance for Democracy early this year, reflecting a severe disunity within the party and the top man’s weakening leadership.Moon’s boycott of the meeting reflected his deepening quagmire as he was seen to be left with little alternative to break through the standoff further bogged down by declining approval ratings. The former presidential candidate of the party had been facing mounting pressure to resign from some party members, mostly members considered outside of the mainstream.On Wednesday, a central committee of the NPAD is set to decide the fate of the reform measures aimed at adopting a new nomination process ahead of the general elections next year. Amid controversy over the measures, Moon said last week that he would leave his post if the party disapproved the plan. He, however, agreed to put off his initial plan to push for a vote of confidence until the Chuseok holiday next week. His surprise announcement, aimed at silencing objections, was seen to cause greater backlash, as the nonmainstream members escalated their demand that the vote on the reform proposals be delayed.The vote should be put off until after Oct. 8 when the parliamentary audit ends,” said Rep. Moon Byeong-ho, a member of the nonmainstream faction.“If chairman Moon does not delay it, we will demand a secret ballot, and if that demand is also not met, we will reconsider participating in the vote altogether,” he added.Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader of the party, meanwhile, denounced Moon’s plan to hold a vote of confidence saying it reminded him of the Yushin Constitution that gave former President Park Chung-hee dictatorial power. Through the revision of the constitution, Park was able to extend his presidency without seeking reelection. Lee’s remark likening Moon’s plan with the Yushin Constitution enraged the NPAD chairman, a former human rights lawyer who fought against the Park administration, according to sources. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, former cochairman of the party, also blasted Moon, saying that his plan has nothing to do with reforming the NPAD and rather has thrown the party into another in a series of power struggles. He also demanded the central committee indefinitely postpone the meeting scheduled to put the reform measure for a vote on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Cho Guk, Seoul National University professor and a member of the Innovation Committee of the party, said that any party member who objects to the party’s rules should either defect or launch a new party, in an apparent rebuke aimed at Ahn.“A party member should respect the party constitution and its justifiable process,” he tweeted, adding that every politician seeks political gains by denouncing others.“Moon Jae-in could tighten the grip on the party by supporting the reform measure while Ahn Cheol-soo could prevent Moon from taking control of the party by opposing the initiative. Lawmakers will be given another (parliamentary) term if they abort the plan,” he said.The remark came amid growing suspicion that Ahn may launch a new party by forming an alliance with Rep. Chun Jung-bae, who defected from the party in apparent opposition to Moon’s leadership. Observers say that Moon could have made the surprising announcement Wednesday, risking his political career in line with the party reform initiatives, to water down the significance of a private meeting between Chun and Ahn on the same day last week.Chun, who recently won a parliamentary seat in a by-election as an independent candidate, has reportedly asked Ahn to join a new party, a plan which would strike a serious blow to Moon, who wants to gather progressive forces to make head against the conservative bloc ahead of the general elections next year and the 2017 presidential election.If Moon renews confidence in his chairmanship, chances are high that nonmainstreamers will defect from the party and join a new one, according to insiders. But if he fails to retain his post, Moon could split himself from the party and launch a new one along with the members of the Pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction regarded as mainstreamers, they added.Han Sang-jin, professor emeritus at Seoul National University, who served as a member of an advisory committee of the party, however, offered a grim picture in a radio interview Monday, saying even if Moon keeps his job, the division within the NPAD would intensify anyway.The NPAD’s reform proposals call for an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the next parliamentary elections in April. The list also includes offering extra points to fresh figures, women and the handicapped in the nomination process. Nonmainstream members, however, have remained skeptical of the plans, suspecting that the group of mainstreamers, led by Moon, would abuse the reform proposals to pursue their own political agendas.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","party feud erodes moon ,monday as rival factions ,party took an ugly ,an ugly turn monday ,feud erodes moon leadership","['Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the National Assembly', 'YonhapMoon']",9,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.65715349  0.11729684

100,100,Mothers lash out at day care service changes,"The South Korean government’s plan to charge households with full-time housewives for the currently free day care service should they utilize it for more than seven hours daily is stirring controversy nationwide, with some critics calling it misogynistic and discriminatory. 　“The government is discriminating against full-time housewives by doing this,” said Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics All...","The South Korean government’s plan to charge households with full-time housewives for the currently free day care service should they utilize it for more than seven hours daily is stirring controversy nationwide, with some critics calling it misogynistic and discriminatory. “The government is discriminating against full-time housewives by doing this,” said Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. “Every mother, regardless of their employment status, should be able to access the public child care service for free.”Since 2013, the Welfare Ministry has offered a child care allowance for all parents with young children up to the age of 2 years. The parents currently have two options. They can either send their child to a state-run day care center for free, or opt to receive an allowance ranging from 100,000 won ($85) to 200,000 won monthly, according to the age of the child, and raise them at home on their own.Currently, all state-run day care centers offer services that are up to 12 hours daily, and the service is worth 780,000 won a month for 11-month-olds, 540,000 won for 1-year-olds and 410,000 won for 2-year-olds.  Upon the government`s revision, public day care service will only be free for seven hours daily for households with full-time housewives starting from July next year.(Yonhap)As the monthly child care allowance of 200,000 won is worth much less than the exempted day care cost of 780,000 won, the proportion of parents -- regardless of the mothers’ employment status -- who opt to send their children to centers instead of receiving the allowance increased significantly from 2011 to 2014, from 28.6 percent to 35.4 percent. According to the Welfare Ministry, this has made it difficult for double-income households, who are in desperate need of all-day day care service, but who can’t find their child a spot due to the service’s high popularity. As of 2012, public day care centers accounted for only 5.2 percent of all day care facilities in the country, according to the Korea Institute for Child Care and Education. Meanwhile, there are more than 5 million double-income households in Korea, accounting for 43 percent of all households in the country as of 2013. “Why is it full-time housewives’ fault that working mothers can‘t send their children to day care?” said one housewife online. “Is it wrong when a housewife catches up with her friends and enjoys coffee for a few hours while having her child at a day care? The government is indirectly and unjustly blaming housewives by revising the current system. The ones who should be blamed are policy makers and public servants who failed to serve all parents who are struggling with child care regardless of their employment status.”Upon the revision, public day care service will only be free for seven hours daily for households with full-time housewives starting from July next year. Single-parent households, households with three or more children, households with a person with disabilities and households with a mother who is seeking employment will be exempted from paying extra even if the mother is a full-time housewife. The revision, however, triggered fierce opposition from full-time housewives nationwide, who claim that they are often unjustly blamed and even criticized for sending their children to day care while not having to work and staying at home. Many of them online claimed they are often left with their baby alone all day at home, without any support from their working husbands and extended families, which leads to social isolation and even depression.The country’s misogynist online communities, including Ilbe, have infamously referred to full-time housewives who opt to send their children to day care or hire help with their husbands’ income as “Mom-chung,” meaning “mom bugs,” for not “fulfilling their responsibilities as mothers” while being financially dependent on their spouses. “It’s not like I didn’t want to work,” said a 31-year-old full-time housewife who wanted to remain anonymous. “It was this double, lose-lose situation. I would feel guilty and stressed while enduring long work hours and having my child raised by someone else, or lose my job and be a full-time mother. And being a full-time mother with limited support often isolates you from social life. This is why we need day care service too.”Overseas studies have long shown that personal stress influences a parent’s behavior toward their children. Parents who are experiencing severe child care-related stress or having marriage stress have a higher chance of abusing -- or neglecting -- their children, according to a 1991 study by Michigan State University.The social isolation of a parent due to having to raise a child alone has also been linked to child abuse and neglect, according to a 2002 report by the World Health Organization.In Korea, the number of child abuse cases increased by 44 percent last year from 2013, with 80 percent of the abusers being parents.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","against full time housewives ,daily is stirring controversy ,mothers lash out at ,discriminatory the government ,main opposition new politics","['south korean', 'Nam']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82169878  0.19078596

Ahn Cheol-soo, former cochairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, on Sunday urged the incumbent party leader to withdraw his plan to conduct a vote of confidence, saying that he was only turning the ongoing dispute over the party’s reform initiative into another in a series of power struggles. (Yonhap)In a statement titled “A Letter to NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in,” Ahn also called on the party’s executive council to delay a meeting scheduled for Wednesday to vote on the reform measures that would only highlight the party’s intensifying factional feud and further aggravate confusion within the party.The remark came a day after Moon accepted another demand by key party members to postpone a revote on his job, backtracking from his announcement last week. In a surprise announcement, Moon said he would leave his post if the party voted down the package of party reform measures. The former presidential candidate for the party had been facing mounting pressure to resign from some party members, mostly outside of the mainstream, who remained skeptical of the reform proposal and the leadership.Moon’s decision last week was seen as a move aimed to silence objections to the party’s reform initiatives and consolidate his position as the party leader amid a deepening rift between the pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction, regarded as mainstreamers, and nonmainstream members. But his decision was met with vehement opposition from most members of the Supreme Council, who condemned it as an ultimatum against nonmainstreamers.With Moon reaching the agreement with key party members Saturday, the dispute over the vote of confidence appeared to have started to settle down. But Ahn’s opposition Sunday seemed to have effectively reignited controversy over Moon’s leadership and the reform packages. The proposal, drawn by the party’s special innovation committee, calls for the party to form an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the general elections in April. The panel also suggested offering extra points to fresh figures, including women and the handicapped, in the nomination process. Members of minority factions, including Rep. Ahn, however, remained skeptical of the plan, suspecting that the group of mainstreamers, led by Moon, would abuse the reform proposals to pursue their own political agendas.“The proposal is far from the fundamentals of party innovation and we have already experienced a disastrous outcome,” said Ahn, referring to the party’s nomination rule that reflected popularity scores garnered from mobile users when selecting its presidential candidate in 2012.Ahn urged Moon to instead select the party candidates through an open primary system, which the ruling Saenuri has already adopted. Proponents believe that such a system would allow more rank-and-file party members and ordinary voters to participate in the process of nominating candidates.Ahn has repeatedly made comments blasting Moon and the NPAD reform committee, saying their attempts to overhaul the party have failed. The reform committee was set after the party went through a crushing defeat in a by-election in April to better prepare for the upcoming general elections and also for the presidential election in late 2017.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","leader to scrap vote ,party leader to withdraw ,npad leader to scrap ,to withdraw his plan ,to scrap vote","['Ahn Cheol', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Yonhap)In', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.13721399  0.01265119

Kim Moo-sung found himself in unexpected controversy as the opposition on Friday dup up a drug case involving his son-in-law, who was recently found to have been given a suspended sentence for drug abuse.News reports said the 32-year-old entrepreneur, who married Kim’s daughter last month, was given a three-year suspended sentence because he had no criminal record. The prosecutors did not file an appeal.  The revelation prompted the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy lawmakers to claim the judiciary branch was unjustly lenient toward the leader of the ruling party.The Supreme Court’s punishment standard stipulates that the sentence for habitual abuse of drugs should range from four years to nine years and six months.They also raised questions over the prosecutors seeking below-standard prison terms and not filing an appeal.Rep. Kim Moo-sung of the ruling Saenuri Party. Yonhap“I can’t buy the prosecutors’ argument that they followed the punishment standards in seeking the sentence,” said NPAD lawmaker Rep. Lim Nae-hyun, who has served as a prosecutor in drug-related cases. “The prosecutors didn’t even file an appeal when (the defendant’s) accomplice was jailed without suspension,” said Lim.Faced with NPAD lawmakers’ flurry of criticism, Minister of the Justice Kim Hyun-woong came forward to refute the allegation, saying the prosecutors’ appeal would be filed only when the court’s sentenced term is less than half of what the prosecutors sought. The court that handled the case also shunned the NPAD claims. Seoul Eastern District Court said in a statement that the court’s punishment standard is not legally binding and the below-standard sentence is often handed down if the violators purchased drugs for personal use, not for distribution. Kim, for his part, denied the allegation that he was involved in the court’s decision and claimed he had not known the situation until after the verdict.“I don’t think I have ever seen a judge who is more lenient toward politicians’ families. In this day and age, judges are more likely to give them a more severe punishment,” said Kim.

Moon Jae-in on Friday decided to go ahead with a vote of confidence from this weekend despite key members’ vehement opposition. The move, aimed to silence objections to the party’s reform initiatives, appeared to set off more infighting as most members of the Supreme Council condemned it as an ultimatum against nonmainstreamers.New Politics Alliance for Democracy spokesman Kim Seong-su said during a press briefing that the vote of confidence will be held for three days on Sept. 13-15, and the results would be announced at the party’s executive council meeting Wednesday, when the party is slated to vote on the reform measures.Moon had made a surprise announcement on Wednesday that he would leave his chairmanship if the party votes down the package of reform measures. Moon had been facing mounting pressure to resign from some party members who remained skeptical of the reform proposals and the leadership. NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in attends an audit session at the National Assembly on Friday. YonhapMoon’s vote will be conducted in two ways -- one by ARS poll among the party’s ordinary members and another by collecting approval ratings. Moon would step down if either of the votes fails to endorse him, or if the central committee turns down the reform packages.Kim explained that a decision to hold a vote of confidence does not require approval by the Supreme Council according to the party’s regulations.Earlier in the day, all members of the Supreme Council except for Rep. Jun Byung-hun opposed holding the confidence vote.“The best way possible for the time being to host the nationwide convention (to replace the leadership) as it is an opportunity to consolidate the people and the party,” floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said.Former floor leader and heavyweight member Rep. Park Jie-won called Moon’s decision “self-righteous” and that it was not acceptable.“(Moon) is basically forcing a choice between becoming pro-Moon or anti-Moon,” Park wrote on Twitter, suggesting instead to decide on how to seek Moon’s confidence through a formal decision-making process.The NPAD has been engulfed in tit-for-tat over the reform proposals that include ways to have an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the next parliamentary elections in April. The panel also suggests offering extra points to fresh figures, women and the handicapped in the nomination process.

Kim Moo-sung, who has been unleashing remarks daily targeting Naver and Daum Kakao. The Saenuri Party has been asserting that the Internet portals, which it describes as “de facto mainstream media outlets,” have intentionally painted a negative picture of the ruling party and violated the principle of media neutrality in political affairs. “We need to discuss ways to ensure the fairness and objectivity of portal news,” Kim said. “I believe the portals are virtually news media as they are able to change headlines.”Rep. Kim Moo-sung of the ruling Saenuri Party. YonhapHe also took issue with the portals’ “lenient” regulations by acknowledging one-man news groups as media, which he said enabled them to use their news reports as bait to pull in visitors and attract advertisements from businesses. The party has demanded the chiefs of the two companies face questioning during the parliamentary audit session that opened Thursday.The Saenuri Party’s think tank, the Youido Institute, backed the party’s argument, with its big data analysis of the news reports carried by the two portals. The findings suggested that the reports highlighted by the portals are more hostile toward the ruling party and the government.The NPAD, has rebuked the Saenuri Party, accusing it of putting pressure on the major portals in the run-up to next year’s general elections.The NPAD dismissed the Youido Institute study as biased and manipulated, and denounced the party for seeking to strongarm the portals to create favorable public opinion toward the government and the ruling party. “The people are aware that (Kim’s) intimidation against the portals stems from his personal and political greed ahead of the general and presidential elections,” said NPAD lawmaker Choi Min-hee during a party meeting Thursday.“I would like to ask him whether he is aware of the RUBICS system (Real-time User Behavior-based Interactive Content recommender System) and the technology used by the portals to operate? Rep. Kim is basically fighting with the IT system.”The NPAD spokesman Kim Yung-rok said that the Saenuri Party had constantly raised the issue before the elections because the portals had significant influence over the voters, particularly those in their 20s and 30s.The portals have become Korea’s most influential news providers, especially for young voters, as they use the Internet as the most frequent medium to access the news produced by traditional news outlets such as newspapers, radio and television, as well as Internet news groups.Rather than clicking on individual media websites, the users often click onto the portals, which aggregate the headlines of registered media groups on their main or news page. They also provide rankings of most searched words and news reports.According to a survey by the Korea Press Foundation, the Internet was the most frequent access point for news. In a one-week analysis over the method respondents used to keep up with the news, nearly all, or 99.6 percent of those in their 20s and 98 percent of those in their 30s said they used the Internet. The number was bigger than that of newspapers (17.6 percent of 20-somethings and 22 percent of 30-somethings) and television (86 and 92.8 percent).The portals, for their part, rushed to respond to the escalating debate. Naver said it would hold an editorial advisory board meeting to review the institute’s findings and discuss measures to address the issue. Daum denied the accusation that they univocally changed headlines. The Internal giant said in a statement that they did not change the headlines arbitrarily unless they needed to quickly adjust the number of characters to fit the site’s layout.Experts were also split on the issue, with some stressing the freedom of the press and others highlighting neutrality.“Under a democracy, a media outlet’s major role is its criticism of the government and the ruling party,” said Kang Sang-Hyun, a journalism professor at Yonsei University. “Media outlets can criticize the policies they oppose and praise the policies they approve of,” Kang. “If the users find reports interesting, they will top the most-favored list. If not, people wouldn’t read them. This is how the current media landscape works. Bringing in the portals’ CEOs and yelling at them is absurd and wrong. I am afraid the move is similar to what dictatorships would do,” Kang said.Shin Sung-ho, journalism professor at Sungkyunkwan University, gave a different point of view.“Most people access news through portals, which are basically operating as media. It is only right that (the portals) therefore take due responsibility and face regulations as a media,” he said.“While news is also cultural content, (the portals) are making it appear like it is free … this is a unique phenomenon only seen in Korea. There is a need to fix this,” Shin added.(jaonsyeo@heraldcorp.com)","internet portal news mudslinging ,slammed the ruling party ,portals are politically biased ,portal news mudslinging between ,rival parties lock horns","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71412015  0.37551638

ReutersThe 89-year-old, rarely seen without her signature hat and handbag, has met most of the major figures of recent decades, from India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to Japanese emperor Hirohito.South Africa‘s anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela called her “my friend,” while her reign also spanned the construction and the destruction of the Berlin Wall.The sprawling British empire of the Victorian era, on which it was said that the sun never set, has shrunk to a few remnants during her reign. Most recently, Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997.Yet even in far-flung parts of the world, “when people refer to the queen they almost always mean our queen,” said John Major, one of the 12 prime ministers to have held office while she has been on the throne.Britain’s slender republican movement condemns a system based on inherited privilege. But for many, the queen is a mainstay in a multi-ethnic country increasingly riven by regional divisions, including in Scotland, which voted against independence last year.Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor‘s birth on April 21 1926 was a relatively minor event for a world teetering between two world wars and just three years away from the Great Depression.The curly-haired “Lilibet” was destined for marriage, not the throne.But after reigning for just 325 days, her childless uncle Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American.Princess Elizabeth’s father inherited the crown as George VI and she suddenly became heir to the throne.When the young Elizabeth and her sister Margaret had to move to Buckingham Palace, she asked her nanny: “What -- you mean forever?”On her 21st birthday, she vowed to spend her life serving her country.On November 20, 1947 she married Philip -- a distant cousin who renounced his titles as prince of Greece and Denmark and his career in the Royal Navy to be with her. She has described him as “my strength and stay.”When George VI died at the age of 56 in 1952 she became queen aged just 25 and with two young children: Charles (born in 1948) and Anne (1950). Two others came later -- Andrew (1960) and Edward (1964).Her role is highly ceremonial and she remains above the fray of politics.Every year, she reads out the program of the government of the day at the State Opening of Parliament.Her voice remains neutral and high-pitched, even when the proposals include measures she is suspected of opposing, such as banning the traditional sport of fox-hunting.“Ma‘am” as her subjects address her, also presides over the Commonwealth composed of 53 members, including 15 former colonies where she is still the sovereign, such as Australia and Canada.“The primary role of the monarchy is to sell the British brand and the queen is very good at it,” said royal biographer Robert Jobson.Despite the widespread respect she now commands, her reign has had plenty of ups and downs.In 1981, her son and heir Charles married Diana in a fairytale wedding that quickly turned sour despite the birth of their two sons William and Harry.She called 1992 her “annus horribilis” when the marriages of three of her children -- Charles, Anne and Andrew -- fell apart and her castle in Windsor was badly burnt in a fire.In 1997, the queen was accused of being out of touch as her subjects wept for the death of Diana in a Paris car crash while she remained at her country estate in Scotland for days before coming to acknowledge the crowds of mourners in London.In the two decades since, though, there has been a remarkable turnaround for the monarchy -- helped along by a powerful communications machine.The queen has cut palace budgets and William’s marriage to Kate Middleton, a commoner, has helped create the image of a more modern monarchy.Charles, 66, is increasingly taking her place at public engagements but experts agree that she will most likely hold on to the end and not follow her Dutch and Spanish royal peers by abdicating.She has visited 132 countries, posed for 139 portraits and given thousands of speeches, though never an interview. Her private life is largely a mystery.The monarchy‘s official website says she still goes horse riding and has 30 Corgi dogs in her palaces.Rare indiscretions from palace insiders have revealed her love of the Racing Post newspaper’s horse racing tips, a Dubonnet and gin before lunch, and crossword puzzles.

Moon Jae-in proposed a vote of confidence in his leadership in line with the fate of the controversial reform measures, and urged the party to end factional infighting. He called for the unity of the party in order to win the general election next year and the presidential election in 2017.“If the reform proposal fails to pass, I will step down from the post of chairman,” he said.“But if (the council) approves the proposal and renews confidence in my leadership, let us put an end to controversy over my position.”NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in speaks at a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapMoon’s abrupt decision came as he came under growing pressure to resign from members of the party who remain skeptical of the reform proposals.The proposals call for an electoral committee of nonparty members to nominate candidates for the next parliamentary elections in April. The panel also suggested offering extra points to fresh figures, women and the handicapped in the nomination process. Earlier in the day, a subcommittee at the New Politics Alliance for Democracy passed the proposal, but it has to get a final endorsement from the party’s executive council. The council plans to put the proposal to vote next Wednesday.Moon putting his leadership on the line was seen as his last resort to put a break to intensifying factional feuds between pro-Roh Moo-hyun members, regarded as mainstreamers in the party, and nonmainstream members. “Recent cases of (party members) publicly attempting to shake the party and divide the party have just crossed the line,” he said, without mentioning names. “To save the party, tighten discipline and build principle, it is inevitable to call for a vote of confidence in my leadership.”The surprise press conference was also held a few hours after Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, a former joint party leader, met party defector Chun Jung-bae to discuss the future of the opposition party. Chun, who recently won a parliamentary seat in a by-election as an independent candidate, has reportedly asked Ahn to join a new party he plans to launch.  Ahn on Sunday lashed out at the NPAD reform committee, saying its attempt to reform the party had failed and that he has different views from Rep. Moon.Ahn, a software mogul-turned-politician, urged the reform committee to overhaul the party in a way to break away from what he described as “outdated” liberal values that resonate little with the general public.Meanwhile, some observers say that Moon was making a calculated move as the party’s executive council is very likely to pass the proposal. More than 60 percent of the council belong to his faction, said Hwang Tae-soon, a political commentator on a cable TV show.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","party leader said wednesday ,resign in an emergency ,to end factional infighting ,an emergency press conference ,press conference rep moon",['Moon Jae - in'],9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.80448538  0.91189766

Both parties remained adamantly against the other’s plan, while observers doubted whether the business leaders would actually appear for questioning even if included on the list. According to law, the listed witness will be jailed or fined for refusing to appear without due reasons, but most chaebol owners have defied past orders, citing business trips. The witnesses need to be notified a week before they take to the stand.The National Assembly. YonhapThe Saenuri Party plans to grill the portal giants’ chiefs -- Kim Beom-su of Daum Kakao and Lee Hae-jin of Naver. This comes after the party’s research institute published a big-data analysis on the two major portals’ newsstand. The findings suggested that the portals news sites are more in favor of the opposition than the ruling party. “Considering the influence of Internet portals on the general public, particularly the young people, it would be wrong if the portals provide people with biased information. We need to address the wrongdoings and give people accurate information,” said Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung. The move has been met with intense criticism from the NPAD, which denounced the Saenuri Party for attempting to “tame” the Internet portals in the run-up to next year’s general election. The portals are considered to have played a significant role in swaying voters during the past elections. “It is laughable that (the Saenuri Party) thinks the portals are biased because the users come across NPAD leader Moon Jae-in’s name more often than Kim’s. Considering President Park Geun-hye’s mishandling of government affairs, it is natural that Moon’s opposition will appear more frequently,” said NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo. The NPAD, for its part, upped the ante against conglomerates and pledged to question them under the slogan of the party’s initiative to reform their governing structure. The Saenuri Party, however, said summoning the conglomerate owners too often was an outdated practice of parliamentary inspections. “It would be fine if the lawmakers want to hear from experts who are familiar with business operations. But it is a wrong practice to grill the conglomerate owners who know few details,” said Kim.

Ahn Cheol-soo on Sunday called for sweeping changes to keep the party afloat amid faltering public support against its vapid reform moves.Ahn, a software mogul-turned-politican, urged the NPAD reform committee to overhaul the party in a way to break away from what he described as “outdated” liberal values that he said resonate little with the general public. The former cochairman of the NPAD suggested that addressing burgeoning corruption scandal is the key to bringing the voters’ attention back to the party that has been reeling from the defeat in the latest by-election at the hands of the ruling Saenuri Party. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the main opposition NPAD. Yonhap“The party has been peppered with a lack of moral discipline and exclusive leadership. ... Even though calls for addressing such issues are mounting, we are not allowed to speak out by those who stick to conventional wisdom and enjoy vested interest,” Ahn said at a press conference at the National Assembly.  “Publicizing the issues will be the first step in the right direction to overhaul the party. Breaking away from old-fashioned liberals and addressing the party’s corruption should be at the core of our efforts to rebuild the opposition party,” Ahn added.  Ahn upping the pressure on NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in and reform committee chairman Kim Sang-kon and painting them as being out of touch on reform issues was largely seen as an attempt to widen his clout within the party. Moon and Kim, for their part, rebuked Ahn’s remark as being “unconstructive.”Kim said he would not tolerate any attempt to undermine the party’s unity and incite infighting in the party to gain political advantages. Moon echoed Kim’s remarks, saying, “Those who sit in an important position should join efforts in the party reform.” He urged party members to restrain from “shaking” the party and come up with a plan to steer the party in the right direction instead.The tit-for-tat reflected the party’s fractional conflicts that trace back to the origin of the reform committee. The NPAD has launched the reform committee to overhaul the party leadership that has embroiled in factional infightings between mainstream and nonmainstream lawmakers. Ahn, who had vied against Moon during the presidential race in 2012 before eventually giving his support, is classified as a nonmainstream member who has often questioned Moon’s leadership.   Designed to unify the party’s divided organization, the reform committee has rolled out a total of nine proposals to reorganize the party, including ways to overhaul the party’s nomination system for elections. According to the plan, 20 percent of incumbent lawmakers who are deemed unfit would not be nominated.  With the latest proposal aiming to deal with the party’s leadership structure, the committee’s reform initiative has faced criticism that they have failed to garner public attention it had expected in the first place. Making matters worse, a number of NPAD heavyweights have recently been involved in corruption scandals, which have overshadowed the committee’s newly published reform plan. Han Myeong-sook, a former prime minister and NPAD member, was sentenced to two years in jail for receiving illicit political funds. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","changes former presidential candidate ,to overhaul the party ,software mogul turned politican ,overhaul the party ,outdated liberal values","['Ahn Cheol', 'NPAD']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59420842  0.02028515

The construction plan calls for a 3.5-kilometer long cable car system to be built at the southern region of Mount Seorak in Yangyang County, about 215 kilometers east of Seoul, setting up a means of convenient transportation all the way up to the peak of the Osaek area hiking course. The ministry, however, said it gave its approval under the condition that Yangyang County add supplementary plans that further address environmental and safety issues to its initial construction plan. The approval will be finalized once Environment Minister Yoon Seong-kyu gives the go-ahead. The cable car project has been a controversial issue among environmentalists here, who have argued that the mountain's natural environment must be preserved. Likewise, it has taken Yangyang County several years to have its plan passed. The county government had submitted its cable car construction plan in 2012 and in 2013, but was rejected both times due to issues that the structure's design could pose a threat to the habitat of some of the wildlife in the area. Advocates, on the other hand, say that the cable car will help to boost tourism and thereby add to the economic development of the region, especially ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, located just south of the county. Construction is to begin next year until October 2017. The cable car will have its trial run for about three months starting in November 2017 before its official operation starts in 2018.

The motion is referred to the Constitutional Court to be determined after more than half of the 298 lawmakers vote in favor.NPAD is likely to take the motion to the floor as it holds 129 seats, more than the one-third of seats needed for initiating the impeachment process. But the motion is less likely to pass the National Assembly as the Saenuri Party holds a majority 159 seats.This isn’t the first time Chong has come under fire for a gaffe.

His proposal came a day after the two Koreas’ agreement to defuse the latest cross-border military tensions and improve inter-Korean relations. Both sides agreed to push for the reunion to coincide with Chuseok, the national thanksgiving holiday, and hold working-level talks beforehand.NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. (Yonhap)“Now is the time for us to implement what South and North Korea agreed upon,” said Moon. “First, we should hold the reunion on a massive scale. Half of those who applied for the reunion have already passed away.”The reunions have been held sporadically, with last year’s event on Mount Geumgangsan being the first in four years.Applicants in their 70s account for about 80 percent of the separated, which means at least 6,600 people should meet every year to see their loved ones within their lifetime, Moon said. He urged the government to reach a deal with the North to include at least 1,000 people in the upcoming reunion list.The proposal came as part of Moon’s four initiatives, which included calls for the government to resume inter-Korea business, expand civilian exchanges and honor former inter-Korean agreements from the former Roh Moo-hyun and Kim Dae-jung administrations. Moon has been shifting his policy platform to national security and foreign affairs in recent weeks as he seeks to reinforce his wavering leadership and his party’s low approval ratings.On the same day, Moon met with the U.S. and Chinese ambassadors to Korea, Mark Lippert and Qiu Guohong, to discuss ways to improve inter-Korea relations and address North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. “The task we must address to normalize relations with the North is how to solve North Korea’s nuclear development. I believe that prompt resumption of six-party talks is the most viable option. I’d like to ask China to play a crucial role in resuming the talks,” NPAD spokesman Rep.

Kim Moo-sung (second from right) and floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul at Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Park’s rare invitation was seen as an attempt to restore ties with the party and to bring her reform drive back on track after a breakthrough in inter-Korean ties. This was the second such luncheon to be hosted by Park since her inauguration.Relations between Cheong Wa Dae and the governing party had been sour and climaxed last month when Park rebuked the party for failing to support her policies, effectively demanding the resignation of then-floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Yoo stepped down several days later, as the party scurried to mend ties with the president. Yoo was also present at Wednesday’s luncheon. Park wants to reform the nation’s four major sectors -- public service, labor, education and finance -- in a three-year economic plan that began last year. Observers say that she may feel under pressure as she has already passed the midway point of her single, five-year term, which ends in early 2018.The president has been reiterating that the reform plan should be completed within this year as politicians’ attention shifts to next year’s general election. “Now we have a big task called labor reform,” she said. “I ask you to lead the way to solve this issue for the economy and for future generations.”Park said earlier this month that she had put labor reform at the top of her state agenda, and that she would aggressively push for flexibility in the labor market. The Park administration sees the local job market as overprotective of employees and discouraging for companies to hire more.The remark was delivered on the same day that Federation of Korean Trade Unions, a labor umbrella group, announced its return to a tripartite committee. The panel, which consists of three representatives from labor, government and business, is expected to soon resume its stalled negotiations on a compromise on contentious labor issues.As soon as the representatives reach an agreement, rival parties are expected to lock horns over the bill. By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","party lawmakers wednesday calling ,reform initiative at luncheon ,lawmakers wednesday calling the ,lawmakers wednesday calling ,luncheon for ruling party","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61134857  0.37186295

Chung, an orthopedics doctor who had served as a head of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, testified before lawmakers at a National Assembly hearing that telemedicine would expand medical services to those living in remote areas and benefit the nation’s public health care system. “Telemedicine is a useful tool for public health service and the medical industry’s globalization. Combined with information technology and medical experts, it would give those living in remote areas access to quality medical services,” said Chung. His appointment is not subject to lawmakers’ approval.  Chung Chin-Youb, the nominee for the minister of Health and Welfare. (Yonhap)But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s lawmakers and the Korean Medical Association have objected to the telemedicine plan, saying that the introduction of high-tech equipment such as IT devices that can provide clinical health care at a distance would increase health care costs.The NPAD and doctors have also warned that telemedicine would undermine Korea’s nationwide public health service by pushing hospitals to engage in businesses that maximize profits. They labeled the introduction of telemedicine as a move to privatize the health care service. Faced with these claims, Chung said he opposed health care privatization and that it did not fit with Korea’s public health care system, which he described as “a model system for the rest of the world.”  Chung would fill the post of Moon Hyung-pyo, who was heavily criticized for his handling of Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak last June. Chung vowed to overhaul the nation’s disease control system that faced public criticism in the wake of the MERS outbreak. “Give the lack of coordinated system and medical experts to deal with infectious diseases. ... A swift response is the key to responding to disease outbreak.

It's like crazy,"" he said. Sharp is not a South Korean company, but a Japanese firm.Last month, Trump made a similar remark that whenever South Korea ""is in trouble, our military takes care. You know we get nothing."" In 2011, ahead of the 2012 presidential election, he also said that the U.S. is protecting South Korea, but ""they don't pay us.""About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the Asian ally from the communist North, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces. Last year, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won ($886 million) for 2014 for the upkeep of the U.S. troops, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.Trump has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination for next year's election as he made a series of unbridled remarks on immigration and other sensitive issues that apparently struck a chord with conservatives.

Kim Tae-won of the ruling Saenuri Party and Rep. Yoon Hu-duk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy came under fire for allegedly using their parliamentary clout to give their kids job opportunities at Korean Government Legal Service and the nation’s top display-maker LG Display, respectivelyDespite their plea of innocence and attempt to downplay their behavior, the public has criticized them amid the country’s surging youth unemployment rate and declining job security.Kim, denying the allegation, said he would resign from his seat if it was found true. Yoon said he merely made a phone call to “check on” her own daughter’s resume. Rep. Kim Tae-won of the ruling Saenuri Party. (Yonhap)The rival parties’ websites soon became inundated with criticisms against the politicians working under the slogan of creating more jobs for the youth, while giving back-door access to their own kids.Some comments even associated the case with “eum-seo,” an ancient hiring system of government officials during the Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms of pre-modern Korea. Under the system, aristocrats’ offspring were allowed to become public servants without going through the excruciating exams that average citizens had to take. The system has been used to give extra benefits to the children of aristocrats. Faced with the public uproar, the two parties have set out to address the issue and prepare measures. Saenuri Party Rep. Hong Il-pyo urged the National Assembly to pass a law that allows for swift punishment of lawmakers who are involved with such irregularities. NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, chair of the Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, said in an interview with local media outlets that lawmakers should revise the anti-graft bill, also known as the Kim Young-ran bill, to prevent conflict of interest among high-profile officials.Critics, however, said that signing new legislation or strongly enforcing relevant laws would be a temporary fix and not enough to prevent the occurrence of similar political scandals that have been prevalent and commonplace in Korea through the decades. “I think the scandal is more of a moral case, rather than a legal one,” said Seol Dong-hoon, sociology professor at Chonnam National University. “If we try to apply laws to the scandal, the lawmakers could be proven not guilty and get away with it,” Seol said. “Considering the lack of governing rules that can apply to these kinds of scandals, the most efficient way to prevent them from happening again is to relay the case to the voters and tell them not to vote for those lawmakers,” said Seol.Other experts attributed the scandal to the lack of political progress that lags behinds the nation’s economic development. Kim Joong-baeck, sociology professor at KyungHee University, pointed out that politicians should come up with strategy and leadership corresponding to Korea’s post-democratization era.“In Korea’s political landscape, I am not sure how many politicians would be immune to the all-out enforcement of the antigraft bill. What is worse, no matter how effective the bill is, some politicians would remain unscathed and come back to the political scene as long as they are elected,” said Kim. “I believe the issue is what we face after achieving economic development and rudimentary democracy. Compared to our remarkable economic success, we lack solid and sophisticated democratic rules. Politicians should develop specific policies and proactive leadership to address such a delicate issue,” said Kim. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasnoyeo@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers face uproar over ,two lawmakers face uproar ,lawmakers face uproar ,uproar over kids employment ,main opposition new politics","['Kim Tae - won', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoon Hu - duk', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Korean Government Legal Service']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6709168   0.18094203

The remarks came during a trial of the former secretary -- on charges of leaking official secrets and violating the presidential records management law.  President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)Cho further argued that although he was acting on Kim’s orders, the presidential office put the blame on him for gathering and writing false facts and leaking confidential files to his benefit. Kim has denied the allegations.The leaked presidential documents took center stage late last year after the confidential reports were exposed to the public. The documents suggested that Chung Yoon-hoi, Park’s former aide, colluded with presidential aides and meddled in state affairs by forming a secret group. Chung was Park’s chief of staff when she entered politics in the late 1990s.Cho also reportedly testified in court that he had delivered memos to the president’s younger brother Park Ji-man to warn him when it was deemed he was meeting people with ill intentions. “I verbally warned Park Ji-man and his wife not to meet people who approached him with bad intentions, but he did not listen. So I gave him a memo that carried brief profiles of those people and their reputations,” he said. Cho also said that his direct boss, the former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, also knew about the memo, which was later identified as part of the leaked confidential information.Cho’s claims contradicted the prosecution’s conclusion earlier this year that he was behind the fabrication of the documents and delivered them to Park’s brother.Prosecutors said in an interim report in January that Cho, while serving at the presidential office in 2013 and early 2014, ordered Park Gwan-cheon, the police officer who worked for him, to deliver 17 presidential documents to the president’s brother. They added that the contents of the document specifying Chung’s role was false and based on unverified information.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","rekindled former presidential secretary ,dae document leak scandal ,furor rekindled former presidential ,former presidential secretary reportedly ,former blue house secretary","['Park Geun - hye', '”Cho Eung - cheon', 'Blue House', 'Kim Ki - choon']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64804465  0.28717092

""What the prosecutors claimed were bribes were legitimate payments."" A separate controversy arose after it was found one of Kim's lawyers, Park Jae-hyun, previously worked at the same courts as presiding Judge Hyun Yong-seon. Kim has previously hired 10 lawyers who have personal relations with Judge Hyun, such as being alumni. When the Seoul Central District Court recently transformed the justice department to avoid nepotism, all of them resigned. Kim is a grandson of Kim Koo, a famous freedom fighter during Japan's colonial rule of Korea who was assassinated by an ultra-right-wing military officer in 1949.

Benjamin Cardin brought in the legislation (S.1982) earlier this month that would authorize the wall's establishment at the Korean War Veterans Memorial and allow certain private contributions to fund the project, congressional records showed Sunday.The legislation, which was co-sponsored by Sen. John Boozman and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, followed a similar bill that Rep. Sam Johnson, a Korean War veteran, introduced in the House in March.The two bills are almost identical and say that the proposed wall would list the names of all members of the U.S. Armed Forces who were killed in action during the Korean War and list the number of all American prisoners of war and those missing in action.""The Korean War Memorial in our nation's capital is a moving experience that literally reflects the veterans of what has often been called America's 'Forgotten War.' But missing are the individual men and women who answered the call to serve their nation during this three-year war,"" Cardin said in a statement.""We honor the service and sacrifice of our Korean War veterans and hope that this expanded recognition will bring solace and pride to their families through the knowledge that their loved ones will never be forgotten,"" he said.Co-sponsor Boozman said the proposed wall would be a ""fitting recognition that shows our nation's appreciation to the men and women who sacrificed their lives in service to our country during the Korean War."" It would also serve as a reminder of the human cost of the war, he said.The United States led the 21-nation Allied Forces to help South Korea repel the Chinese-backed communist troops invading from the North.

During Hyun’s six-year tenure, ridiculed as “lost years” by his opponents for compromising the agency’s political correctness and independence, the watchdog’s international reputation suffered a setback. It is now on the brink of losing the top A grade that it has enjoyed since 2004.The International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions, a global network, forwent assessment of the watchdog in 2014 and 2015, a move, many observers said would lead to downgraded ratings. Lee Sung-ho, nominee for chiarman of the National Human Rights Commission. (Yonhap)“It is pretty obvious that Lee might be yet another version of Hyun who acted as a puppet of Cheong Wa Dae,” said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul. “Despite the ICC’s repeated request for transparent nomination for the post, Lee’s selection was neither widely discussed nor transparent,” said Rep. Lee. NPAD lawmakers also questioned the former judge for his lack of experience in human rights and his past court decisions that were deemed offensive to sexual minorities while he served as a judge in 2013. According to reports, Lee had asked a defendant, who had applied for a gender change, to submit photos of sexual organs to verify his request although the photos are not mandatory under court regulations. His predecessor, Hyun, was also heavily criticized for making scores of controversial remarks including “Does sexual discrimination still exist in this country?” and “Korea has turned multicultural ... what with ‘(derogatory term for African-Americans)’ living amongst us.”Lawmakers also pointed to the agency’s lack of efforts to embrace diversity and transparency of its composition, or “Paris Principle,” a minimum standard which human rights agencies should meet to be considered credible, and more importantly, to be rated A grade.Mindful of mounting criticism of the agency, Lee vowed to secure A-grade status and push for revising relevant laws to ensure the agency’s diversity and transparency, if confirmed. He also pledged to compensate for his lack of experience in human rights by reaching out to minority groups.“If confirmed, I will try to hear the voices of the marginalized and underprivileged. I will do my utmost to expand my experience in diverse human rights issues relating to immigrant workers, refugees, sexual minorities and physically challenged,” Lee said during the hearing. The nominee’s appointment, however, is not subject to parliamentary approval. Meanwhile, most experts viewed his appointment as “inappropriate.” According to a survey by NPAD Rep. Choi Min-hee on 134 legal experts, more than 80 percent of respondents said the process for Lee’s nomination has been problematic.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heralcorp.com)","tuesday as opposition lawmakers ,opposition lawmakers accused him ,former judge at seoul ,opposition lawmakers accused ,hearing tuesday as opposition","['Lee Sung - ho', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'the National Human Rights Commission']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01393349  0.22304232

Rep. Park Ki-choon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy is suspected of receiving illegal political funds worth 350 million won ($299,000) and valuables such as luxury watches and bags from the head of a distribution agency, only known by his surname Kim, prosecutors said.
  
The Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office suspects that the three-term lawmaker helped Kim's business in exchange for the money and valuables.
  
Park's detention is subject to parliamentary consent as sitting lawmakers in South Korea are immune from arrest while the National Assembly is in session. 
  
The Ministry of Justice will submit a motion to arrest the lawmaker, with the approval of President Park Geun-hye, to the National Assembly.
  
The motion must be reported at the earliest plenary meeting and the National Assembly speaker must put the matter to a vote within 72 hours, after waiting a day. The motion is carried if half of the sitting members are present and half of those are in favor.
  
If the motion is passed, only then will a district court hold a hearing to decide whether to issue an arrest warrant for Park. 
  
Prosecutors allege that the 59-year-old Park's key positions on the parliamentary Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs Committee, where legislation on the construction industry is dealt with, during the 18th and the current 19th National Assembly, put him in a favorable position to help Kim.

Moon Jae-in said Wednesday that he is willing to take the Saenuri Party’s proposal to hold open primaries to select candidates for the next general election on the condition that the ruling party agrees to change the current nationwide proportional representation voting system. Moon’s proposal involves dividing the country into multiple proportional representation zones to allocate parliamentary seats according to the percentage of votes obtained by parties in each constituency. It is considered to be similar to Germany’s mixed-member proportional representation system. NPAD Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in(center) made remarks during the meeting at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)“If the Saenuri Party accepts our proportional representation, our party could endorse an open primary system,” said Moon. “I am fine with any platform by which we discuss this. It could be a meeting between the leaders of both parties or among the National Assembly’s relevant committee members,” said Moon. But Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung virtually denied Moon’s proposal. He told reporters that proportional representation and open primaries were two “separate issues,” and the move is not “conducive” to political development. But he left room for discussion, saying “I will take time and give it consideration.” Moon’s proposal was in line with the National Election Commission’s suggestion to amend the current single nationwide proportional representation system. Last February, the election watchdog asked the National Assembly to consider redrawing constituency lines for proportional representation. According to the NEC’s plan, the current single nationwide constituency for proportional representation would be divided into six blocks, with each bloc assigned a number of proportional lawmakers based on its population. These proportional seats would then be distributed according to the rate of votes earned by the party. It suggested 300 parliamentary seats should be allocated for.  Mindful of the impact Moon’s proposal would bring in the next 2016 general election, the parties have clashed over the issue of whether the revised voting system would fit Korea’s political landscape, where two major parties enjoy supremacy and rely on regional biases to muster their votes. The NPAD asserts that the new system would help break the decades-old regional antagonism by giving each lawmaker a chance to be elected in a region where they are treated as underdogs through the new proportional seats that would be represented regionally rather than nationally. The Saenuri Party, on the other hand, refuted, saying the system would inevitably bring about an increase in the number of lawmakers, which many Koreans consider unnecessary, because the plan involves getting more lawmakers elected through proportional representation by different constituencies.  Critics were also split over Moon’s proposal. Lee Nae-young, professor of comparative politics at Korea University, said that the move would contribute to easing regional bias and breaking the two-party dominance in Korean politics.  “Moon’s plan is a step in the right direction,” said Lee. “If Moon’s plan refers to Germany’s mixed-member proportional representation system, it will ease regional bias among Koreans and bring political diversity to Korea’s polarized political landscape,” said Lee. “But, if we want to see Moon’s plan work well, we should increase the number of lawmakers elected through proportional representation. Certainly, it is unlikely to happen now, but we should push for it bit by bit. If not, we wouldn’t be maximizing the benefits of the German model,” said Lee.  Shin Yul, a politics professor at Myongji University, accused the NPAD of failing to make their case for the new voting system. He criticized the party for lacking a strategy to pitch the plan to the public, who may struggle to understand the complexity of the voting system.  “If NPAD’s plan is similar to Germany’s mixed-member proportional representation system, they have to spell out exactly what type of German system they are talking about. There are different categories under Germany’s system,” said Shin. “What is worse, I don’t think they have ever considered how to explain such a complicated system to the public. Back when I was studying in Germany, even their political professors took more than two hours to fully explain it. They have to figure out a plan on how to communicate with the public,” said Shin.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","open primaries new politics ,primaries new politics alliance ,primaries new politics ,pong over electoral reform ,ping pong over electoral","['Saenuri Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Saenuri Party ’s']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.64342707  0.25263032

Kim Tae-ho’s surprise announcement Monday to withdraw his bid for the 2016 general election, lawmakers from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy took a veiled swipe at “privileged” NPAD lawmakers who have served multiple terms in the National Assembly. “We are already losing the game,” Lee Dong-hak, a member of NPAD reform committee, tweeted. “Even if (Kim’s move) is nothing but a political show, we are losing on the show as well. We are frustrated, people are frustrated and Korea is frustrated.” Echoing Lee’s remarks, Cho Guk, who also serves as a reform committee member, said in a media interview that NPAD bigwigs should make a “wise” decision over whether or not to run for the election. The law professor has urged four-term NPAD lawmakers and above to drop their parliamentary election bids to pave the way for fresh faces. NPAD members hold a rally calling for a new proportional representation system in front of the main National Assembly hall on Tuesday. (Yonhap)With four incumbent lawmakers now having bowed out of the race for the election, the Saenuri Party was deemed to take the lead in political reforms aimed at discarding the vested rights, largely held on to by multiple-term heavyweights. Besides Kim, four-time lawmaker Rep. Lee Han-koo, six-time lawmaker Rep. Kang Chang-hee and Rep. Sohn In-chun have decided not to run. Meanwhile, none of the NPAD bigwigs has made similar moves except for the party’s chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, who dropped his bid for the 2016 general election as he ran for NPAD chairmanship in 2014. NPAD lawmakers were, on the contrary, criticized recently for proposing an increase in the number of parliamentary seats as part of their reform plans.Considering Kim and other politician’s high-profile posts, it was widely expected that Kim’s decision would have significant political impact in the run-up to the general election that is set to take place about nine months from now. Critics, however, remained cautious on whether the decision would bring sweeping changes in the local political scene, saying that it is more an “isolated case” of a politician who needs to take time off to prepare for his next political moves. “It is hard to see a unified pattern among those politicians who have decided not to run,” said Lee Jung-hee, a politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “I believe it is exaggerating to say that (Kim’s decision) is a starting point for the ruling bloc’s reform. I think it is a bit of personal decision,” said Lee.Kim said in the statement he could not help recognize that he became “hallow” and “weak” as he began to lose touch with the public. Last July, Kim had infamously traded barbs with the party’s chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung over the resignation of the former whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min.“He has built a bad reputation for slipping his tongue at the party meetings. I believe that Kim’s decision has something to do with his next political move. He may want to take time off to self-reflect before considering his next political career move such as premiership and the presidency,” Lee said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","reelection bid sparked debate ,sparked debate on tuesday ,forgo his reelection bid ,debate on tuesday ,2016 general election lawmakers","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Tae - ho', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43161172  0.09816881

Kim Hyun-sook of the ruling Saenuri Party, an economics professor-turned-politician.“Nominee Chung is the right person to strengthen the nation’s public medical sector, and to bring stability to public health as he holds a deep understanding and insights on Korea’s overall medical sector through his 25 years’ service at Seoul National University Hospital,” said presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook.The new senior secretary has also demonstrated her expertise in the fields of welfare and women policies while serving as a research fellow at Korea Institute of Public Finance, and teaching at Soongsil University in Seoul, Min said.Park’s nomination of a medical professor for the nation’s top post in charge of health and welfare came amid persistent public distrust due to the government’s bungled initial response to MERS. Last week, the country declared a de facto end to the outbreak that killed 36.Calls had been mounting for Park to apologize and to replace incumbent Moon, a former scholar on pension system, saying he lacked leadership while dealing with the virus spread. The government has been under fire for concealing information of MERS-infected patients and the hospitals where they were admitted and treated. The health ministry had rejected calls to disclose names of MERS-hit hospitals, stressing that it would paralyze the nation’s medical sector. Authorities later revealed the names and routes patients traveled. But its belated revelation sparked public anger, with many blaming the government’s slow response for aggravating the spread of the disease.Min also said that the president will deliver a public address on Thursday to present her vision on state affairs.It was not immediately known whether Park will apologize to the public for the government’s slow initial response.Cheong Wa Dae had admitted last month that the government’s response to the outbreak was “insufficient,” but no official apology has been made so far.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","afternoon sacked health minister ,tuesday afternoon sacked health ,new health minister president ,sacked health minister moon ,tuesday afternoon sacked","['Park Geun - hye', 'Health', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Chung Chin - youb']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51375717  0.47311684

Kim Moo-sung, appeared to be having a heyday in his stay in the U.S. over the past week, making comments that would have immediately caused backlash back home, but that nonetheless galvanized his conservative support base. The height of such remarks was his announcement Saturday when he said his party would push for reinstating a system of all schools using government-published textbooks to address what they consider to be a “biased view” imposed by some private publishers’ progressive textbooks. “I think that left-wing flanks have a wrong sense of history and they are trying to instill their biased view in the young people who will lead our country,” Kim said in a meeting with Koreans who reside in Los Angeles, U.S. “We are trying to bring back a state-authorized textbook system to prevent this trend,” said Kim. Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung reviews a speech he is set to give at Columbia University on a train for New York last Wednesday. (Yonhap)His remark came amid his first visit to the U.S. since he became the leader of the Saenuri Party. During the eight-day visit, he has made similar moves that were deemed to consolidate his support base, mostly right-wing voters who value the Korea-U.S. alliance and conservative policies such as state-authorized history textbooks. Not only did he point out that Korea’s alliance with the U.S. outweighs Korea-China relations, he also pulled out all stops to highlight the importance of the ruling conservative party holding on to power. He said he would even sacrifice “his life” for achieving the goal.Critics accused his move of being “outdated” and “inappropriate” as a leader of the ruling party. Chu Chin-oh, history professor at Sangmyung University, compared his move to the rhetoric used by right-wing Japanese politicians in their attempts to whitewash history by revising its textbooks. “A state-authorized textbook system clashes with democratic values,” Chu said. “The reason we teach history is we want (our students) to reflect on what was wrong and learn from it. I think state textbooks could serve as a tool that only serves the values of one side,” Chu said.Other critics, such as Yoon Pyung-joong, political philosophy professor at Hanshin University, said that Kim went “overboard” with his controversial remarks in the U.S. and his lopsided focus on conservative voters would backfire on him in the upcoming 2017 presidential election. Kim continues to enjoy a lead in the latest survey for likely candidates. “(Some of Kim’s remarks) are clearly uncalled for,” said Yoon. “Kowtowing to the U.S. veterans and, most importantly, his comments about China are too much. I believe the second one is big mistake in particular, considering his off-the-cuff speech style,” Yoon said. “Things will be quite different in the 2017 presidential election from the 2012 election where then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye won. Back then, Park was considered to be an epitome of conservative values and faced arguably the weakest contender from liberal parties. But she won the presidency by a narrow margin,“ said Yoon.  “Thus, moderate voters are going to be critical of Kim who doesn’t have the same political assets as Park. If Kim continues to seek conservative political gains by alienating himself from moderate voters, it would be a dangerous move,” said Yoon.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","caused backlash back home ,galvanized his conservative support ,his announcement saturday ,immediately caused backlash back ,his party would push","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'U.S.']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95259446  0.65357369

The new deal still bans Seoul from reprocessing and enrichment, but it opens the way for the Asian ally to begin research into a new technology for spent nuclear fuel recycling, known as pyroprocessing, and to make low-level enriched uranium with U.S. consent.President Barack Obama sent the deal to Congress last month for approval.Since then, the agreement has been under review for 90 congressional days. Should there be no opposition raised during the process, the pact will go into effect. Widespread views are that no objections will be raised, and this week's resolutions reinforced such views.No legislative approval is necessary in South Korea.

Samsung C&T; had initially demanded the military pay about 36 billion won to cover the costs of laborers and construction equipment that had been put on stand-by during the construction delay.The DAPA official said it is also planning to use its right to indemnity, asking the protesters to reimburse the compensation.If completed as scheduled by the end of this year, the 1 trillion won project will allow South Korea a launching point from which to send naval vessels into southern waters, the key trade route for the country.A Navy official said protesters are preparing a major rally near the construction site for Aug. 3, when their demonstration marks the 3,000th day since launching.

Lee Jong-kul, floor leader for the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, urged the government to take “extraordinary measures,” claiming that new evidence was found to link the National Intelligence Service to civilian surveillance charges.“We have to come up with a whole new step if the NIS is unwilling to cooperate with lawmakers’ investigation,” said Lee. “We should push for a parliamentary investigation and a special prosecutors’ probe if the parliamentary committee ends up failing to find out exactly what happened,” said Lee. NPAD Floor Leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. YonhapHis remarks came after Lee’s revelation that supports his claim about NIS wiretapping charges. Lee said in a media interview that local IP addresses were found in a hacked email from Hacking Team, the Italy-based malware surveillance vendor that supplied the NIS with the hacking program, called Remote Control System.Lee also alleged that Hacking Team had contacted North Korea to sell the hacking program, suggesting that security-related intelligence from North Korea and South Korea could have been mixed. He made the comment at the meeting with Citizen Lab, a nonprofit Institute which first report the NIS had purchased the program. Bill Marczak, researcher from the Canada-based institute, on Thursday told NPAD lawmakers that the NIS had asked the Hacking Team to add software that can monitor KakaoTalk, Korea’s largest mobile messenger. He added that the NIS had shown interest in the process of tapping phone calls.Lee went on to criticize the NIS for refusing to submit RCS’s log files, which record every event in the hacking software. The NIS denied access to the files, citing they contain sensitive information that could compromise the nation’s cybersecurity.But the ruling Saenuri Party labeled the NPAD allegation as an attempt at “self-hypnosis” to disrupt the due process of the NIS investigation, urging the NPAD to stop throwing around unverified allegations that “sabotage” national cybersecurity amid the persistent cyber threat from North Korea. “(The NPAD) should stop raising ungrounded allegation to sabotage our national security system,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul. “I am afraid that Korea is going down the wrong path, while other countries are seeking to beef up intelligence capability,” said Won.Won added, “(The NPAD) needs to get the facts right and face the truth, whether it involves on-site inspection or meetings with officials. NPAD should stop hypnotizing itself.” Lawmakers agreed Wednesday to visit the NIS and hold meetings with its officials to address the hacking scandal.

The court ruled in favor of the law, saying the rule was necessary to prevent “distortion of information” and ensure “fairness” in elections. Of the panel of nine judges, five voted in favor of the law, while four deemed it as unconstitutional.  (Yonhap)Under the current Public Official Election Act, news websites have been required to authenticate Internet users’ identity before enabling them to post comments and videos either advocating or opposing certain candidates and parties on their forums during an election campaign.  Those violating the law face a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,600). The court said in the verdict that false rumors and propaganda on news websites can rapidly and widely hamper fairness of elections, given the credibility of media outlets.It also added that the law does not violate press freedom or people’s right to express political opinions, considering that writers’ personal information remain withheld after news sites check their identities. But four judges against the regulation said the public’s right to free speech should be guaranteed at most especially during election campaigns to promote “fairness” of elections. They argued that the real-name verification rule is in place for the sake of the authorities to more efficiently investigate election-related crimes, treating citizens as “potential criminals.”With the ruling, Internet users will still be required to verify their identities with their names and resident registration numbers to make political remarks on news websites during campaigning periods.Rep. Yoo Seung-hee, a head of the free speech committee in the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, called the court’s decision as “retreat in liberal democracy.” “The real-name verification law has been politically abused to discriminate against opposition party candidates and their supporters,” he said in a statement right after the ruling. South Korea ranks 60th among 180 countries in the press freedom index by Reporters Without Borders. Another global indicator by media watchdog Freedom House rated Korea as “partly free” to free speech.The real-name verification law, introduced in 2007, was applied to websites with more than 100,000 visitors a day. The court ruled the so-called “Internet real-name system” stipulated in the information and communications network law unconstitutional in 2012, saying that the system had undermined freedom of speech.Under the elections law, however, the regulation remained intact for campaign periods.Following the 2012 ruling, the government came under growing pressure to change the law to uphold the Constitutional Court’s decision, with the National Election Commission asking the National Assembly to amend the relevant laws.Later in the year, Rep. Jin Sun-mi of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy presented a revised election law, but the amendment has not yet been made.Daum Communications, then the nation’s second-biggest search engine, which provided news on its website, filed a constitutional appeal in 2013 after the authorities imposed a financial penalty on the firm for allowing netizens to make political comments without checking their identification. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","court backs election law ,political comments on internet ,nine judges five voted ,constitutional court on thursday ,internet forums during campaign","['South Korea ’s', 'Constitutional Court']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46491256  0.14540896

Kim Moo-sung said many young Koreans are frustrated because there are not enough jobs in the market, and his party has been working to loosen the nation’s rigid labor market. Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung speaks at Columbia University in New York on Thursday. (Yonhap)“I plan to make utmost efforts to help many young people find quality jobs through labor reforms to ensure they have a better future,” he said.“Unlike the flexible labor market in the U.S., South Korea’s job market is very rigid. That is why we find it difficult to create more jobs for young people, and they are suffering from low wages.” Trying not to miss a cue, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman also underscored his labor polices, saying that reforms must be conducted in a way that the “pains of the laborer” are shared by businesses and the government.The remarks came at a time when rival parties are at loggerheads over the labor reform plans which are aimed at providing greater flexibility and tackling a divide between regular workers and nonregular workers. Labor groups have been opposing the reforms saying they could induce massive layoffs.The ruling party hopes to pass the reform bill during the regular session scheduled for September.The main opposition party, however, appears to be seeking to slow down the Saenuri Party’s momentum in an attempt to highlight the conflicting issues over the reform plans among different interest groups before general election campaigns kick off next year.NPAD chief Rep. Moon Jae-in said his party would seek a broader negotiation platform, consisting of various stakeholders, to better reflect demands from the nation’s two labor umbrella groups. The idea, however, collides with the Saenuri Party’s plan to start a bipartisan negotiation by resuming a stalled tripartite meeting between the government, labor and business.The labor market overhaul is one of the reform measures in President Park Geun-hye’s three-year economic revitalization plan. She and her party argue that labor reform is key to reviving the sluggish economy, improving the business environment for investments and eventually creating more decent jobs.The labor groups have opposed the move, claiming it is intended to force regular workers out and replace them with nonregular workers, which would lower the overall quality of jobs.The NPAD has also played down the reforms, alleging they were drafted in favor of the corporate sector.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","young koreans are frustrated ,koreans are frustrated because ,pledges sweeping labor reform ,koreans are frustrated ,chairman vowed on thursday","['Saenuri Party', 'South Korea', 'Columbia University', 'New York', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Koreans']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59609514  0.69298989

Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee.Tuesday marked the eighth anniversary of the resolution that urged Japan to formally acknowledge, apologize and accept historical responsibility for the atrocity in a clear and unequivocal manner.Kim asked Pelosi to pay greater attention to the issue, according to Na.Na said Pelosi asked her what message Abe should issue in the future, and she responded that the Japanese leader should make a message of apology on the 70th anniversary of World War II next month.Kim also met with Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel and asked the U.S. exercise its influence over Japan to make sure that Abe does not distort history in an upcoming statement he plans to issue next month to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II.Kim also stressed that Japan's distortion of history can never be acceptable.On growing relations with China, Kim told Russel that the strengthening ties with Beijing are based on the solid alliance with the U.S. Russel reaffirmed the strong U.S. commitment to South Korea's defense, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and unification of the two Koreas, according to participants in the meeting.Kim's delegation also met with Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Royce's office said in a statement that the two sides discussed the importance of the U.S.-Korea partnership, including Korea's interest in participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an envisioned free trade deal among 12 Asia-Pacific nations, including the U.S. and Japan.""As a long-time supporter of a strong U.S.-South Korea relationship, I also discussed with Mr. Kim the importance of staying committed to remembering the terrible human rights abuses that occurred during World War II,"" Royce said in the statement, referring to the sexual slavery issue.""I've long fought misguided efforts to minimize the suffering endured by hundreds of thousands of women at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army,"" he said.Kim had planned to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry, but the meeting did not happen as the top American diplomat was tied up with a Senate hearing on the recent landmark deal on Iran's nuclear program, officials said.

Lee Jong-kul. (Yonhap)The partisan showdown came a day after the NIS chief Lee Byung-ho testified before a parliamentary closed-door session. Lee reportedly said the NIS had found no evidence of civilian surveillance after its internal investigation into files deleted by the deceased NIS official who purchased and used the hacking device. “The NIS conducted the investigation on its own and was exonerated by the ruling Saenuri Party,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “As opposed to telling the truth, the NIS claimed innocence. It will be nothing but an insult to the National Assembly if the NIS continues to refuse to submit evidence,” said Lee.NPAD accused the NIS of denying access to key evidence such as log files that contain every event of the usage of the hacking software purchased by the NIS. The opponent believes that the files will prove whether the hacking device targeted civilians.  But the ruling Saenuri Party dismissed the NPAD’s call as an attempt to compromise the nation’s capability to conduct cyberwarfare with North Korea. The Saenuri Party condemned the NPAD for relying on “ungrounded evidence” in seeking political gains at the cost of national security. “NPAD continues to request information that might reveal every detail of NIS cybersecurity capability,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Won Yoo-chul. “Although the NIS chief made abundantly clear that it had never spied on its own people, the NPAD continues to raise doubts over the allegation of civilian surveillance,” said Won.

The proposal prompted different reactions and interpretations from main and minor parties, cautiously tiptoeing around a potential rise in the number of parliamentary seats and the negative public opinion over lawmakers’ prerogatives.Kim Sang-kon, head of the reform committee of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, Sunday unveiled a package of restructuring measures to increase the number of legislators elected through the proportional representation system, which could, in turn, raise the total number of parliamentary members from the current 300 to 369. “I urge the party to begin an in-depth discussion on increasing the number of lawmakers,” he said at a news conference. The rationale behind the drastic reform measure is aimed at breaking down the existing political regionalism and to ensure the election results better reflect the proportion of support gained by each competing group, Kim said.  NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul speaks at a party meeting on Monday. (Yonhap)The proposal is highly sensitive as it could prompt a drastic change in the political landscape here. But some observers say it would be difficult for the opposition party to get the public’s consent, as the measure is widely viewed as allowing more politicians to seek vested interests by acquiring a parliamentary seat.Kim proposed to keep the current number of lawmakers elected through the first-past-the-post system at 246 to represent the constituencies, but sharply raise the number of lawmakers elected through proportional representation to 123. The NPAD at first appeared divided by this proposal. Even NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in put the brakes, saying it is “inappropriate” to discuss the matter now. But the floor leader of the main opposition party voluntarily entered the debate, vowing the NPAD would set the proposal as a plank in its party platform.“This is important for political reforms,” he said. “If it is inevitable to increase the number of lawmakers, then it would be a realistic way to accept that idea,” he added. The ruling Saenuri Party, for the time being, blasted the opposition party, saying it is turning a blind eye to the public’s demand to raise the parliament’s productivity, in terms of legislating laws meant to improve people’s lives. “Quality is more important than quantity,” said Rep. Won Yoo-chul, the floor leader of the ruling party, during a supreme council meeting.“This is the time to push for political reforms by giving the public the right to pick candidates for parliamentary seats,” he said, referring to an open primary system recently proposed by the party.The proposal corresponds to a recent draft revision to laws submitted by the National Election Commission in February. The election watchdog suggested the parliament consider rezoning the electoral constituencies into six zones for the proportional representation seats and mete out the parliamentary seats accordingly with the percentage of votes garnered by parties in each constituency. The proposal was also backed by a Constitutional Court ruling last year that said population discrepancies among some electorates were too high. The nation’s highest court last October ruled that some constituencies were underrepresented in the legislature. Those with populations one-third the size of larger voting districts are granted the same number of lawmakers. The court said the population gaps were unconstitutional.Since then, political parties have geared up for discussion on electoral reforms by creating a parliamentary panel to restructure electorates throughout the country. The two sides, however, have been spinning their wheels instead of making progress, as they have faced widespread public criticism for trying to increase the number of politicians already enjoying exceptional privileges.South Korean legislators are under fire for receiving higher pay and being granted more prerogatives than other elected politicians in advanced countries. The reputation and public trust of legislators have remained low due to a series of corruption scandals involving incumbent lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","heated political debate monday ,reignited heated political debate ,political debate monday ,heated political debate ,party reignited heated political",[],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63601446  0.27143794

The Assembly also passed nearly 60 bills, including amendments to the Criminal Act abolishing a statute of limitations clause for murder cases.The budget bill allows the government to provide farmers hit by droughts last month with funds for irrigation and obtaining water supplies. The bill will also allow officials to offer loans to hospitals that suffered a drop in customers after treating suspected MERS patients. The National Assembly`s main hall, Friday. (Yonhap)The government will offer subsidies and low-interest loans to small and mid-sized businesses struggling from the depressed consumer spending hit by the MERS outbreak. State-owned banks will also offer emergency funds to struggling export firms. The budget bill’s passage comes after over two weeks of partisan fighting over the extra spending plan, submitted earlier this month by the Park administration.Ruling Saenuri Party officials backed passing it as soon as possible, but the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy objected, saying the budget bill included spending plans on regional infrastructure projects trying to appease voters ahead of next year’s general elections.Saenuri officials accepted the NPAD’s objections, cutting related funds to 1.25 trillion won, from the 1.5 trillion that Park officials had initially suggested.The Saenuri Party also accepted the NPAD demands to cut parts of the bill trying to plug holes in lower-than-expected tax revenues, cutting related funds from 5.6 trillion to 5.4 trillion.But persisting disagreements over the corporate tax rate could spark another partisan fight in the coming week, with the main opposition demanding the Park administration to raise the 22 percent corporate tax rate.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","35 lawmakers abstaining the ,with 35 lawmakers abstaining ,35 lawmakers abstaining ,extra budget bill ending ,23 with 35 lawmakers","['the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Assembly']",9,"[ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 ... -6.24170005e-01

Hong Joon-pyo (Yonhap)Lawyers for Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province, denied charges that he received illicit political funds from the late business tycoon Sung Woan-jong during the first hearing held Friday in connection with a high-profile graft scandal.The hearing took place at Seoul Central District Court, about three weeks after the prosecution indicted Hong and former premier Lee Wan-koo without detention for violating the Political Fund Act by accepting illicit political funds from Sung, the deceased chairman of Keangnam Enterprises.Hong did not appear in court for the hearing.But Yoon Seung-mo, the former vice president of Keangnam Enterprises, was present to admit to his charges that he had delivered the money on Sung’s behalf to Hong in 2011 at the National Assembly.During the hearing, Hong’s legal representatives maintained that such a meeting did not take place.The governor is charged with receiving 100 million won ($89,000) from Sung in June 2011, when the four-term lawmaker was running for chief of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.Sung sent shockwaves across the nation in April after he committed suicide, leaving a handwritten note in his pocket that listed the names of eight politicians close to President Park Geun-hye, and the bribe sums he allegedly handed over. Among the eight political heavyweights, only Hong and Lee were indicted, with the remaining six cleared of the bribery charges due to the lack of evidence and expiration of the statute of limitations.In the hearing, the prosecution asked the court to rapidly process the trial, citing the circumstantial evidence that Hong had attempted to bribe Yoon to sway the ruling in his favor.

The current criminal procedure law stipulates a 25-year statute of limitation for those accused of committing homicide. The bill awaits approval at the assembly’s plenary session on July 24.“The bill will give us an opportunity to get to the bottom of unsolved murder cases,” said Rep. Seo Young-kyo of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy in a press conference. Seo took the lead in drafting the bill along with fellow lawmakers.  NPAD Rep. Seo Young-kyo holds a press conference about a revision bill that lifts the statute of limitation on homicide cases at the National Assembly, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The revision, however, does not extend to manslaughter or parricide cases. Other relevant bills, such as extending the statute of limitation for those convicts sentenced to more than five years for crimes with scientific evidence, also failed to get approval at the committee meeting.The move came after a mysterious homicide case failed to find the perpetrator as it reached the end of its statute of limitation. In 1999, a 6-year-old boy was killed by an unknown attacker who doused him with sulfuric acid. The statute of limitation for homicide at the time was 15 years. Even though his parents pleaded for the court to review the case until they found the murderer, Korea’s Supreme Court last year dismissed the request. The case’s statute of limitation then expired and the case was classified as cold. “The bill will help prevent yet another tragedy like an innocent 6-year-boy’s death. It will bring those who committed heinous crimes to justice. The murderers might enjoy a time limit for their crimes, but the pain of the victims of the crimes never has a limit,” Seo said. Experts said the bill is a step in the right direction because those who commit homicide should be subject to different legal punishments from other criminals. “I am in favor of the move,” said Choi Cheong-hak, criminal law professor from Korea National Open University. “Some people suggest that the current 25-year statute of limitation is sufficient to bring pains to perpetrators, because they have to live with the fear of getting caught for a long period of time.

Members of MINBYUN-Lawyers for a Democratic Society and Jinbo Net, two local human rights groups, are likely to back the efforts.“A parliamentary probe into the National Intelligence Service scandal is a must, but a more thorough and forcible investigation is necessary, including raids led by law enforcement officials,” a PSPD official was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying early Wednesday.The report is expected to name incumbent NIS chief Lee Byung-ho and past NIS heads Lee Byung-kee and Nam Jae-joon as the accused, a PSPD spokesperson said later Wednesday, asking not to be named as the person was not authorized to talk to media on the case.“We only have a rough draft, but we are going to file it no matter what. We’re in the middle of finalizing the details, such as the how and when,” the source added.“We’re going to try to file it at least by the end of next week,” MINBYUN spokesperson Park Ju-min said later Wednesday.The announcement by activists from the PSPD comes as local media reported earlier in the day that the NIS had allegedly bugged South Koreans in China for years using malware developed by Hacking Team, a Milan, Italy-based malware surveillance vendor. Hacking Team allegedly produced malware for the NIS since at least 2010, according to leaked emails available on WikiLeaks. The NIS last week confirmed that it had purchased 20 malware programs from Hacking Team, but denied using them to spy on South Korean nationals.Local reports, however, continue to accuse the NIS of bugging outspoken critics of the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, citing the leaked emails.  Activists at a rally criticizing the NIS`s alleged wiretapping in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, Wednesday.

The hearing took place at Seoul Central District Court, over three months after late Keangnam Enterprises chairman Sung Woan-jong shook the country with his suicide memo implicating eight political heavyweights as potential subjects of his bribery.Lee was among the two who eventually took a fall from the memo scandal, as he was indicted earlier this month for allegedly receiving 30 million won ($26,000) in bribes from Sung. Lee did not appear in court as it was not mandatory for those indicted without detention. The ex-prime minister stepped down from the post in April after the allegations were raised. Prosecutors urged the court to promptly proceed the trial process, citing concerns that the memory of testifiers can be affected as time goes by. The prosecution has reportedly submitted the evidence of late Sung’s “bribery memo” and the voice record of the phone interview with a news outlet in which Sung testifies that he had handed over the funds to Lee. The next hearing will he held on July 31, officials said.South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, who was indicted along with Lee for the same charges, will face a separate hearing Thursday. Hong is accused of receiving 100 million won from a high-ranking official of Sung’s company. He was also one of the eight figures listed in late Sung’s memo. Hong has reportedly prepared for the hearing with a group of top-notch lawyers, sources said. The attorney group comprising eight lawyers will be led by L.K.B & Partners’ head lawyer Lee Kwang-bum. Lee was the special prosecutor who indicted three presidential security officials in the probe into the irregularities of former President Lee Myung-bak’s retirement home plan in 2012.Hong will also not appear in the hearing, sources added.Six other high-ranking politicians, who were also listed in Sung’s suicide memo, were cleared of receiving kickbacks earlier this month, citing a lack of evidence.

Park had asked the aide to find out more about Jeong Yun-hoe, who was rumored to have ordered people to keep track of Park and follow him.  According to the presidential documents leaked to the media, Jeong, who served as an adviser to President Park when she was a lawmaker, held regular meetings with several senior presidential officials. He has never held any official position in the current administration.  Prosecutors concluded that Jeong has not met with any presidential aides since October 2013 to receive briefings on state affairs.  There have been rumors the younger Park and Jeong had been in a veiled feud over who would be the heavyweight in Park's administration.

(Yonhap)The move came a week after NPAD approved its reform committee’s draft plans that aim to overhaul the party leadership. The NPAD leadership has been criticized for failing to address the party’s in-house conflicts among different factions. “If power is concentrated in the hands of few people, it will inevitably cause a problem,” said Kim Sang-kon, head of NPAD’s reform committee. “The party’s revised regulation will prevent few party members from dominating the power and give more say to the people and ordinary party members,” said Kim. The revision includes other measures such as holding out the party’s nomination for those NPAD members who lost their post due to corruption charges. Besides, NPAD decided to build a new in-house audit system and remove party members involved in corruption. The party, however, decided to postpone the discussion over other thorny issues such as a plan to abolish the Supreme Council and establish an evaluation committee to assess the performance of its elected officials. “We will discuss other reform measures in the next September session,” said NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in. “If we reach an agreement (on those issues), we will be able to see the party achieve its goal of sharing power with ordinary party officials,” said Moon.

Politicians should also remain quiet until the facts are clearly found. Groundless accusations will only worsen the confusion.”Local reports last week accused the NIS of wiretapping government critics, citing leaked emails exchanged between suspected NIS agents and Hacking Team, an Italian software firm. The NIS had contracted Hacking Team to develop malware to bug South Koreans using Samsung phones produced and sold locally, the reports asserted. The allegations came amid public distrust in the NIS due to the spy agency’s alleged meddling in the 2012 presidential elections. The NIS was accused of conducting a smear campaign against opposition candidate Moon Jae-in. NPAD said that the NIS’ alleged interfering in the election may have contributed to the victory of Moon’s rival, Park.Last week’s apparent suicide of an NIS agent suspected to have been involved in the agency’s deals with Hacking Team only worsened public distrust in the NIS. The agent admitted to deleting digital records related to the case, but added that the NIS had not wiretapped private citizens, according to his publicized suicide note.

(Yonhap) NIS and Saenuri officials though have remained adamant that the country’s spy agency did not use the malware to bug citizens. “The records deleted by the agent are completely restorable according to the NIS,” Saenuri Rep. Park Min-shik said later Monday, citing a meeting with NIS officials on Monday. “Everything will be answered within the week,” he added.The NIS offered to invite lawmakers on the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee to inspect its facilities last week, expressing confidence that no evidence would be found to support the allegations.Parties remain split over the offer.The Saenuri Party says that lawmakers should inspect the facilities now.

(Yonhap)The opposition also alleged that the ruling bloc was using the 11.8 trillion won ($10.3 million) extra budget to fill less-than-expected tax revenues, and to increase fiscal spending to appease voters with less than a year before the 2016 parliamentary elections.The opposition repeated that it would back the bill if up to 5.6 trillion won were cut.The opposition also demanded the cancellation of nine regional public construction projects that the extra budget seeks to fund. The projects were originally cut from the 2015 budget during parliamentary debates over this year’s fiscal bill late last year.“I am sorry, as the man in charge of the country’s finances, for including more into the (extra budget) to make up for low tax revenues,” Choi said at the parliament’s finance committee earlier Wednesday. “But forecasting exactly how well or poorly the economy will do next year is extremely difficult.”Choi’s comments Wednesday followed a meeting Tuesday between the Saenuri Party’s new floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul and the NPAD’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul.

Expectations are high on what roles the two middle-grounders would play amid a deepening internal feud between loyalists to President Park Geun-hye and members of the nonmainstream faction within the party.Rep. Won Yoo-chul, new floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, speaks at a news conference on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Rep. Won Yoo-chul, a four-term lawmaker known as a well-rounded conservative-centrist, was named the new Saenuri floor leader at an inter-party race, taking on the hefty task of mending ties with the presidential office. Won’s running mate, three-term lawmaker Kim Jung-hoon, will serve as the party’s chief policymaker. Like Won, Kim, a lawyer-turned-lawmaker, is known to be a middle-of-the-road politician who forged amicable relationships not only with pro-Park members but also with those in the nonmainstream faction. Rep. Won, representing Pyeongtaek in Gyeonggi Province, won the election uncontested. He replaces his former running mate and former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who resigned from the post last week after resisting blatant pressure from the presidential office and the pro-Park faction. Won urged the easing of tension between the party and Cheong Wa Dae, stressing that it is a critical time for both to restore ties ahead of general elections next year and the presidential election in 2017.“Without the success of the Park administration, there will be no (bright) future for South Korea, nor also for the Saenuri Party,” Won said in his acceptance speech.Kim also vowed to have a weekly meeting between the party and Cheong Wa Dae to immediately respond to issues closely related to people’s lives. The new whip said he also would sit down at the negotiation table with the main opposition party by keeping basic principles in mind, defying concerns that he would follow Yoo in going against Park’s major policies. Park, in a rare strong tone, singled out Yoo for swapping her reform bill with a parliamentary bill pushed by the opposition party. Park’s sharp criticism sparked a brutal in-party feud between her ardent supporters and those who recently opposed the president and her hierarchical stance in the party.Hoping to move beyond the bitter battle between the party and Cheong Wa Dae, the Saenuri’s new whip and top policymaker are set to meet with President Park on Thursday.The decision was made after Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung met with Park’s new political aide Hyun Ki-hwan on Tuesday morning. Hyun, a former Saenuri lawmaker, was named senior presidential secretary of political affairs Friday, demonstrating Park’s hope to restore her relationship with her party.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","ruling party tuesday setting ,the ruling party tuesday ,ruling party tuesday ,party tuesday setting their ,amid deepening internal feud",['Park Geun'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52820784  0.17931753

The party constitution and regulations will also be revised to hold out party nominations for members who have lost their status due to corruption, establish in-house audit system and remove party membership from those involved with corruption.The draft, voted in approval by the administrative committee, will be further dissected at the central committee opening on July 20.The draft, however, excludes testier proposals set by the reform committee, including an option to abolish the Supreme Council and to form an evaluation committee to assess their elected public officials. The reform committee had pointed out that the current Supreme Council made up of the party’s senior members via election has turned into a trench line of factional leaders. But the ideas had been opposed by the so-called non-mainstreamers for allegedly bestowing higher authority to the current party leadership, who will be able to designate members to the newly forming committees.NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, meanwhile, expressed optimism that the reform drive was finally moving. “The reform plans have been accepted after active discussion. We will work for the draft to be settled smoothly at the central committee as well,” Moon told reporters.","reform draft from news ,monday as the party ,the factional disagreements continued ,to overhaul the party ,main opposition new politics",['New Politics Alliance for Democracy'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.89117521  0.16154781

Kim Moo-sung added that the move aims to prevent senior party officials from picking personal favorites to run in major elections and to make the nomination process “more democratic,” during his speech celebrating the first anniversary of his chairmanship.   Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung. (Yonhap)Kim’s statements appeared to be designed to deflect recent criticism from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy denouncing an ugly in-house fight in the Saenuri Party that peaked last week. President Park Geun-hye had pressured the Saenuri whip Rep. Yoo Seong-min to resign, after Yoo sponsored a bill that Park objected to. Yoo quit last week, saying he had tried to uphold democratic principles. The NPAD said the feud showed how “undemocratic” the ruling party was.Rep. Yoo Seong-min. (Yonhap)“One year ago, when I was elected party chair, I promised you I would make this party fair and democratic,” the Saenuri Party’s Kim said, as dozens of seated party officials and reporters listened on behind flashing news cameras.“If there is one thing I would like to leave behind, it is the creation of a truly democratic candidate-selection system,” Kim added. The current nomination process only worsened factionalism by compelling junior politicians to choose an influential senior to pander to, Kim said.The main opposition party’s spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok said the party would “favorably consider the idea,” adding the NPAD had agreed that the nomination process for candidates to major elections had to become fairer.Saenuri Rep. Kim also proposed ditching the 2012 revisions to the National Assembly Act that allowed the minority party to stall bills from going to a plenary vote, saying they hampered the core principle of majority voting. The NPAD disagreed, saying that the revisions had prevented the tyranny of the majority.The Saenuri Party chair also pledged to kick-start the economy, citing recent tallies from the Bank of Korea that lowered this year’s expected growth rate from 3.1 percent to 2.8 percent last week.“I will stick to the ‘three goes’ during the remainder of my term as chair,” Kim said. “I will democratize the candidate selection system, revive the economy, and win in next year’s general elections.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","candidates before major polls ,parliamentary elections on monday ,party officials from picking ,hold nationwide open primaries ,elections on monday","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41685173  0.01499221

Kim Moo-sung. Kim and Hyun, both from Busan, are seen as having built close relations over the years, calling each other “brother.”Citing the amicable relationship between Kim and Hyun, some officials at the ruling party said that his first job at Cheong Wa Dae will be arranging a meeting between the president and the party chief -- a prerequisite for showing the public that they have come to a settlement after the bickering that has roiled the conservative bloc for weeks.  Hyun Ki-hwan (Yonhap)Hyun also faces a pressing issue of reactivating stalled trilateral talks among the presidential office, the government and the ruling party. Park has come under great pressure to support those affected by Middle East respiratory syndrome and revitalize the nation’s economy, which has been hit hard by the public fear over the disease. To do so, she needs to have her bill on a supplementary budget approved by the legislature, and thus the support of the majority Saenuri Party. Cheong Wa Dae and the Saenuri Party have drifted apart since May, when the Saenuri leadership, then headed by the former party whip Rep. Yoo Seong-min, signed a controversial legislative deal with the main opposition party. Under the deal, the Saenuri Party extracted a promise from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy to pass a reform bill on the civil servants’ pension in exchange for accepting the opposition party’s demand to endorse a revision to a National Assembly law. The bill was to enable lawmakers to challenge the government’s administrative power. This 2009 file photo shows President Park Geun-hye, the then chairwoman of Grand National Party, talking to Hyun Ki-hwan who was also a parliamentary member. (Yonhap)Tensions peaked when Park vetoed the National Assembly Act revision on June 25 and lambasted the Saenuri floor leadership for neglecting their role. It led to weeks of heavy in-house feuding and eventually the resignation of floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min last week. Park’s fierce criticism, however, generated strong resistance from her party and bolstered Yoo’s clout.The interparty feud appears to be settled for the time being after Yoo’s resignation. However, questions remain whether Hyun, a steadfast pro-Park politician, can bridge the two factions and initiate smooth cooperation with the new Saenuri floor leadership. Rep. Won Woo-cheol, regarded as a nonmainstream lawmaker, is likely to assume the post of Saenuri floor leader, suggesting the power game between the two factions in the party is only beginning.It is also doubtful whether Hyun will be a versatile enough mediator to resolve the different needs and demands between Park and her party. Upon being named to the position, Hyun described his job as “a mere messenger” to Park, whom he treasures as “a mother-like figure” in his political career.Hyun was elected for the 18th National Assembly, serving 2008 to 2012. He has been an ardent supporter of Park since she ran for the party’s presidential candidacy in 2007. Before entering politics, Hyun worked for the Federation of Korean Trade Union, one of South Korea’s two largest labor umbrella groups.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","new top political aide ,park new political aide ,new senior presidential secretary ,new political aide faces ,new political aide","['Park Geun - hye', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Saenuri']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78836811  0.17861979

The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy backs a smaller budget, saying the proposed bill includes funds unrelated to boosting the economy.But the parties agree the extra budget bill must be passed this month if it is to boost the struggling economy within the year, suggesting a compromise could come before the final vote on the bill scheduled for later this month, as agreed upon by the parties last week. The National Assembly's main hall during last Friday's plenary meeting. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn can be seen on the screen addressing lawmakers on the proposed supplementary budget. (Yonhap)“The budget bill needs to be passed within the month for it to have any effect on the economy after the MERS outbreak,” NPAD Rep. An Min-suk said. “But that doesn’t mean we should give it a cursory review.”The Bank of Korea last Thursday reported the expected growth rate for this year at 2.8 percent, down from a prediction of 3.1 percent in April. Officials here have cited slumping consumer spending that worsened in the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak and droughts that have mostly affected the northern parts of the country as major sources for the lagging growth.The Park administration announced the supplementary budget bill to provide relief to the affected areas and hospitals. But critics of the government budget bill have asserted the supplementary spending plan includes money irrelevant to the relief plans and equivocal plans that appear to hint that the bill was hastily written by Finance Ministry officials.The National Assembly Budget Office reported Sunday that the 400 million won earmarked in the budget for loans to medical centers that treated MERS patients had “unclear” financing plans. The same report added that 16 spending proposals in the budget bill “seemed difficult to complete this year.”The NPAD also asserts that the ruling party sneaked in spending plans that appear to be aimed at appeasing regional voters ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections. The NPAD pointed out the 1.2 trillion won planned for funding 18 roads and 15 railroad construction projects.The main opposition party charged that 5.6 trillion won, nearly half of the supplementary budget bill, was inserted by Park officials anxious to plug tax revenue shortfalls.NPAD Rep. Kang Gi-jung, the main opposition party’s policy committee chief, said his party would support the government’s budget bill if the Park administration offered an apology for the shortfalls and a raise in corporate taxes. Saenuri Party Rep. Won Yoo-chul (left) meets reporters at the National Assembly, Sunday, after submitting his application to run in Tuesday’s floor leader election. (Yonhap)Saenuri Party officials call the main opposition’s stance irresponsible, and say Park has no reason to apologize, as the opposition also voted for this year’s budget last December.The budget bill’s approval also depends on how the new floor leader for the ruling party will conduct related negotiations with the main opposition.The Saenuri Party is expected to elect a new whip Tuesday, with Rep. Won Yoo-chul expected to win the spot. Won and running mate Rep. Kim Jung-hoon submitted their application to run Sunday.

179,179,Minimum wage to increase 8% in 2016,"The minimum wage for next year has been set at 6,030 won ($5.30) per hour after weeks of debate, despite complaints from both labor and business circles. 　Though it marks the highest raise in eight years, labor unions said it was still insufficient to improve low-wage workers’ lives, while employers claimed it put a strain on smaller businesses. 　Employers’ representatives, labor experts and government officials ...","The minimum wage for next year has been set at 6,030 won ($5.30) per hour after weeks of debate, despite complaints from both labor and business circles. Though it marks the highest raise in eight years, labor unions said it was still insufficient to improve low-wage workers’ lives, while employers claimed it put a strain on smaller businesses. Employers’ representatives, labor experts and government officials of the Minimum Wage Council agreed to increase the minimum wage by 8.1 percent next year at the final negotiations that continued into early hours of Thursday.  (Yonhap)The labor bloc boycotted the meeting in opposition to labor experts’ earlier suggestion to put a cap on how much to raise the minimum wage.At a previous round of talks that dragged on until early Wednesday, labor experts proposed that the rate for the minimum wage hike should be between 6.5 percent and 9.7 percent, prompting the workers’ representatives to walk out of the negotiations in protest. The Minimum Wage Act stipulates that at least one-third of representatives from trade unions and employers should participate in a vote to decide the minimum wage. But if one party refuses to attend the negotiations more than once, the vote can go ahead without that party. Out of 27 representatives, the remaining 18, including nine labor experts and seven employers, put the revised proposal to a vote Thursday morning without laborers, where 15 voted in favor, one against and two abstained.The 8.1 percent wage hike marks the biggest jump since President Park Geun-hye took office in 2013. This year’s minimum wage saw a 7.1 percent rise from a year earlier, while last year‘s rate was raised by 7.2 percent from the previous year.  The hourly wage of 6,030 won translates to 48,240 won a day and 1.26 million won a month for those who work eight hours a day. The pay raise will affect an estimated 3.42 million low-income workers, according to the Minimum Wage Council.But the 8.1 percent hike immediately sparked protests from both the labor and business blocs. “The 70 million low-income earners, who have expected a double-digit growth in the minimum wage as proposed by Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, feel betrayed and disappointed by the decision,” the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the nation’s largest trade union, said in a press release. Choi has supported a “fast-paced” hike in the minimum wage to spur wage-led economic growth through increased domestic spending. The Korea Employers Federation, for its part, expressed deep regret over what it viewed as a “drastic increase” in the minimum wage. “We regret the decision to drastically raise the minimum wage, defying small and medium-sized employers’ complaints of (the need of help for) survival amid worsening economic conditions,” the employers’ organization said, pointing out that the 8.1 percent increase was far more than the inflation rate of 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, labor and business circles agreed to stipulate both hourly and monthly wages in the employment contract to protect laborers’ right to be paid for 48 hours of labor when working 40 hours a week. Currently, only hourly wages are written in the contract, which labor experts and workers in the council saw as giving leeway for employers to dodge legal obligations.Negotiations among employees, employers and labor experts collapsed several times due to continued clashes over the extent of the hike, failing to meet a June 29 legal deadline. The labor unions initially demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum wage at 5,580 won to 10,000 won, while employers campaigned for a freeze.But after the negotiations failed to meet a legal deadline, both sides presented revised proposals to secure a deal through additional discussions. At Wednesday’s meeting, the business leaders suggested that the minimum wage be 5,715 won, while laborers proposed 8,100 won.The Korea Employers Federation has claimed that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and it needs to be stabilized, voicing concerns over possible job losses and soaring production costs, especially for smaller companies. The nation’s trade unions have maintained that the hike would curb the nation’s income inequality, improve living conditions for low-income workers and revitalize the faltering domestic economy by boosting consumer spending. Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of employers, employees and labor specialists including labor-related government officials, has set the minimum wage through discussion. This year, the discussion began in early June. There is still room for a change to the rate as the Ministry of Employment and Labor offers a 20-day period for both labor and management to express their objections before making public the agreed minimum wage rate for next year on Aug. 5. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","highest raise in eight ,after weeks of debate ,eight years labor unions ,minimum wage to increase ,won 30 per hour",[],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37073824 -0.09047259

Yoo Seong-min leaves with a higher political profile according to local polls, particularly among voters frustrated with the ruling bloc officials who had hoped that Yoo’s departure would end the intraparty feuding between the pro-Park and non-Park forces. Yoo appeared to hint that he would continue to oppose policies of the Park administration that he disagreed with, saying that South Korea was a democratic country that took orders from the people. Rep. Yoo Seong-min announces his resignation as the Saenuri Party`s floor leader at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald)“The reason I did not step down for the past two weeks, despite the pressure, was that I wanted to uphold our Constitution that declares the Republic of Korea a democratic country, whatever ramification that could have had on my political career,” Yoo said. “I will continue to pursue my belief that our politics can go beyond partisan differences, that I can achieve my dream of becoming a just and warm conservative, always striving to compromise on differences, and stand by the citizens of this country.”The embattled third-term lawmaker had been under pressure to forfeit his post since late last month when President Park Geun-hye called him a “traitor” who should be voted out of office during a nationally televised Cabinet meeting.Park was referring to Yoo’s sponsorship of a bill she vetoed that proposed giving the legislature the power to ask for changes to executive decrees that appeared to undermine existing laws. Park had called the bill unconstitutional as it violated the principle of checks and balances.Park loyalists in the Saenuri Party, widely known as the “pro-Park” faction, thereafter repeatedly demanded Yoo’s resignation for his role in sponsoring the possibly unconstitutional bill.Yoo sympathizers, though, said the president’s followers were trying to kick out anti-Park legislators from key party posts before next year’s parliamentary elections. Yoo sympathizers called Park a bully trying to commandeer the party.The high-profile feud raised Yoo’s popularity according to a weekly poll by Realmeter in the fourth week of June that surveyed 2,500 adults nationwide.Yoo rose to fourth from sixth on the list of possible presidential candidates in the ruling bloc, ahead of former Saenuri Party lawmaker Chung Mong-joon and South Gyeongsang Province governor Hong Joon-pyo.The poll had a 95 percent confidence level and a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.The tit-for-tat verbal war between the two factions continued for 13 days before tensions climaxed early Wednesday when the Saenuri Party convened a closed-door party caucus in Seoul’s National Assembly. After a four-hour debate the caucus presented Yoo with a resolution urging him to resign “for the sake of the party and the Park administration.”No confidence vote on Yoo was taken, despite such requests from Yoo sympathizers including second-term Rep. Kim Yong-tae. Pro-Park legislators and party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung cited the absence of party rules that authorized a confidence vote on an incumbent floor leader.Yoo apologized for the recent in-house fight.“I would like to foremost apologize to the ordinary citizens of our country struggling to make ends meet. I have disappointed many.”“But I was also able to ask myself why, for the past 16 years, I have remained in politics,” Yoo said.“I have always believed that in the end, it is politics that brings change, despite the fact that we politicians are consistently criticized, satirized and denounced.”“I am ready to face any criticism of my stubbornness during the last two weeks to uphold justice, the rule of law and principles.”The party is now to decide how to elect the next floor leader, with party rules specifying that the successor must be named within seven days.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","frown the ruling party ,whip announced his resignation ,resignation in monotone wednesday ,voters frustrated with the ,leader quits under pressure","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Yoo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59055907  0.48196152

Yoo Seong-min on Wednesday said he will accept the party’s recommendation for him to resign from the post after days of heavy in-party feuding sparked by President Park Geun-hye’s veto of a controversial bill last month. Rep. Yoo Seong-min pauses while announcing his resignation as the ruling party floor leader at the National Assembly on Wednesday. Yonhap“I wanted to uphold the rigorous values of our Article 1 of the Constitution that declares the Republic of Korea shall be a democratic republic, even if it costs my political career,” Yoo said in a press conference.“The reason I held on to the post of floor leader, which I would have otherwise thrown away way beforehand, was because there were the values that I wanted to protect. Those are the law, principles and justice,” he said in an apparent rebuke to the president and fellow party members who pressured him to resign.Yoo had been singled out by President Park during a speech on June 25 as a force that hindered the smooth passage of her policies in the legislature. She also vetoed the National Assembly Act revision that would have given more leeway for lawmakers to request changes to government ordinances. Pro-Park members had since demanded Yoo resign to take responsibility. The party leadership, which had initially remained undecided, opened debate on Yoo’s fate by holding the party’s general assembly Wednesday as internal feuding aggravated.Yoo is stepping down five months after he was elected to the post on Feb. 2.(khnews@herarldcorp.com)","while announcing his resignation ,party call to resign ,announcing his resignation ,assembly on wednesday yonhap ,announcing his resignation as","['Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the National Assembly']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32719153  0.49359715

But I think sometimes (freedom of expression) should be limited if it goes against public security and social norms,” the nominee said, before adding that he supported laws outlawing same-sex marriages here. Justice Minister nominee Kim Hyun-woong attends his confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The experienced prosecutor also denied the main opposition’s claims that prosecutors unlawfully neglected to charge top Park administration officials accused of graft in the Sung Woan-jong scandal earlier Tuesday.The Sung scandal had been investigated justly and fairly, Kim said, refuting charges by NPAD officials that the six ruling bloc officials acquitted of taking bribes had been let go for being Park supporters.The NPAD had called investigations into the Sung scandal “cursory” as they appeared to be highly politicized, with known Park allies such as former Cheong Wa Dae chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok being absolved of bribery charges.Sung allegedly gave illicit political funds to eight ruling bloc officials. Two -- former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo -- were indicted. The rest were acquitted for lack of evidence.Kim vowed he would clamp down “without limitations” on corruption and violent crimes once he assumes the reins of the Justice Ministry in the coming days.“I will carry out the duties of my office according to the law to the fullest of my capabilities,” Kim said in the opening minutes of his hearing.“Murder, rape and other violent crimes are still very much existent on our streets.

New Politics Alliance for Democracy floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul (center) urges Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung (sitting) to cast his vote on the National Assembly Act revision at the plenary session Monday. YonhapThe remark came after National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa declared that the vote failed to meet the quorum of 149 lawmakers, with only 130 lawmakers attending.The boycott of the revote prompted the main opposition New Politics Democratic Party to deride the ruling party for succumbing to pressure and abandoning the will of the people and their legislative authority.Cheong Wa Dae hailed the parliament‘s decision that it, once again, confirmed the value of the Constitution. Despite the ruling party’s decision that effectively discarded the bill, the latest hullaballoo appeared to have pushed the Saenuri Party and President Park to cross the Rubicon, with both losing momentum to restore their estranged relationship, experts said. Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling party have been drifting apart with the party remaining divided over the fate of its floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. The Saenuri whip has been resisting calls initiated by Park and her loyalists in the party to step down for not cooperating with her major state agenda. The intensifying strife between Park and her party has so far resulted in a massive delay in her reform drive and also severely damaged her leadership in state affairs, even before she has reached the halfway point in her five-year term. Piles of contentious bills needed to resolve urgent matters, such as a supplementary budget drafted to help the victims of Middle East respiratory syndrome, remain deadlocked at the parliament, alongside Park’s bill seeking to revive the nation’s sluggish economy. The communication channel between the government and the ruling party has been shut down since May, when the Saenuri Party made a legislative deal with the NPAD to pass a reform bill on the civil servants’ pension system in tandem with the revision to the Assembly law. The bill was to empower lawmakers to request a change in government decrees.Park, who blasted politicians for pursuing their own political interests, has also been suffering from a severed relationship with the party leadership. The president keeping her distance from the Saenuri chief on Friday at the opening ceremony of the Gwangju Universiade Games clearly exposed her strained ties with the chairman, despite his repeated pledges that the party would work only for the success of her government. She appeared to have decided to wait until the party makes a decision on the fate of Yoo, whom she directly called a “betrayer” for publicly opposing a number of her state agenda items, including her controversial welfare expansion.Despite Park’s denouncement and constant verbal threats from her loyalists, Yoo refrained from commenting on his fate Monday, a de facto deadline for him to make a final decision on his position.Yoon Pyeong-joong, a political professor at Hanshin University, illustrated the internal feud between the pro-Park faction and a group of nonmainstream members including Yoo’s sympathizers as a power struggle between old and new conservatives who both feel an urgent need to transform the entire conservative bloc.“Whatever Yoo decides of his fate, whether he would stay or quit as Saenuri’s floor leader, it won’t put an end to the ongoing conflict between Cheong Wa Dae and the Saenuri Party,” he said. “It would only lead to a second round of confrontations.” The power struggle between the two factions lays bare Saenuri lawmakers’ insecurities that in the future they won’t be able to remain a mainstream political force if they don’t abandon the vision and political philosophy previously pursued by old conservatives like Park, he explained.A growing number of voters, especially among those who consider themselves conservatives, are seen expressing disappointment with Park and her leadership over a series of crises involving the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome and the sinking of the Sewol ferry last year, as well as her economic reform drive that has shown no significant progress so far. “The reason some Saenuri lawmakers are resisting Park, an imperialistic president whose term has not reached halfway yet, is because they know if they don’t make significant changes within themselves right now, they will lose their parliamentary seating in the next general elections and also their political position,” he said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","automatically scrapped as lawmakers ,bill vetoed by president ,assembly bill scrapped saenuri ,bill scrapped saenuri party ,bill was automatically scrapped","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51882875 -0.1223821

Park Young-sun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and nine other party lawmakers presented the bill last Friday to revise the Foreign Investment Promotion Act to authorize a government board to bar foreign investors from buying and selling companies here if the transaction is deemed speculative.The draft law comes as South Korean corporate giant Samsung Group is involved in a lawsuit with Elliot, a U.S.-based hedge fund, over the merger of two of the conglomerate’s affiliates. Elliot owns 7.1 percent of Samsung C&T;, which the group plans to merge with Cheil Industries. Elliot objects to the merger.Rep. Park Young-sun, former floor leader and former acting chair of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. (Yonhap)The bill’s submission to the legislature also comes amid a multibillion-dollar lawsuit involving the South Korean government and Lone Star, a U.S. private equity firm, over the fund’s purchase and sales of Korea Exchange Bank, a Korean bank. Lone Star asserts Seoul owes it $4.68 billion as officials here had levied unfair taxes and barred the fund from selling its KEB shares at the optimal time. KEB union members, on the other hand, have said Lone Star’s purchase of the company led to unfair layoffs. “The new bill will prohibit the selling of Korean companies if the sale is considered detrimental to the overall Korean economy,” Park said in a press release.Park’s bill will aim to strengthen Seoul’s say over such sales in the future.“The U.S. and Japan have similar corporate laws,” Park added. “Japan authorizes state interference in sales of (Japanese firms) if they are considered ‘detrimental to the overall Japanese economy.’ The U.S. government runs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.”“We must set up similar laws curbing foreign investment if the investors could affect the welfare of the entire Korean economy,” Park said.The new bill will come into effect six months after receiving approval from the legislature and the Cabinet, if at all.Park is a third-term lawmaker and the former floor leader and acting chair of the NPAD -- the second-most dominant party in Seoul’s 298-seat unicameral parliament with 130 seats.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","nine other party lawmakers ,opposition lawmakers is seeking ,group of opposition lawmakers ,of opposition lawmakers ,opposition lawmakers","['Park Young', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Foreign Investment Promotion Act']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82737601  0.13229126

Yoo Seong-min has been under severe pressure from Cheong Wa Dae and Saenuri lawmakers loyal to the president to resign for not cooperating with Park’s major state agenda. The pro-Park members sent Yoo a verbal ultimatum to step down as soon as the party abandons the vetoed bill during a plenary session Monday. They claimed that it would offer the public an impression of him leaving the post to take responsibility for causing political chaos over the bill. It would be his opportunity to “honorably” resign from the post, they added. Yoo has since refused to step down, backed by a group of nonmainstream lawmakers and his sympathizers who accused pro-Park members’ attempt as a mere political witch hunt. He also refrained to comment on his fate Sunday, but reiterated that the party would not participate in the revote.“We have decided not to vote tomorrow,” he said. “This is what we concluded at a previous general meeting on June 25.”Despite the vehement demands from the pro-Park faction, Yoo may choose to resist and seek a political breakthrough by keeping his position, some party officials said. Yoo has already announced that he would preside over a parliamentary meeting Tuesday, a day after the deadline pronounced by Park’s loyalists.If Yoo resists the demand, the pro-Park members could hold a general meeting to oust him from the Saenuri leadership. Exercising her first veto, Park blasted Yoo for succumbing to the opposition’s demand to pass a revision to National Assembly law, which enables lawmakers to challenge the government’s administrative power.Yoo led a legislative deal with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy to pass the bill on the condition of agreeing on the passage of a reform bill on civil servants’ pension, a crucial part of Park’s reform drive.By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","the president to resign ,president to resign for ,president to resign ,parliamentary revote on president ,saenuri floor leader strife","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Cheong', 'Saenuri', 'Park ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24937382  0.13440128

Yoo Seong-min, the Saenuri floor leader urged by the president to step down.  The National Assembly's House Steering Committee chamber remains empty early Thursday. (Yonhap)The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is also expected to question Park’s secretaries over her veto of a bill enabling lawmakers to request changes to government decrees.No easy mediation appeared in the offing, with the ruling party’s in-house feud escalating earlier Thursday when Park loyalists and Yoo sympathizers threw expletives at one another, and with the NPAD renewing its pressure against the ruling bloc to repeal Park’s veto.Park last week vetoed the bill that Yoo had sponsored. Park called it unconstitutional, and demanded voters vote against Yoo in the 2016 general election. Park loyalists approved. Yoo sympathizers branded Park a bully.Park’s comments also sparked criticism in the NPAD. Main opposition officials said the president had violated electoral laws prohibiting officials from meddling in public elections by suggesting voters oust Yoo.  Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung leaves the party's daily morning meeting, Thursday, in apparent frustration over Rep. Kim Tae-ho. (Yonhap)NPAD officials earlier Thursday requested the electoral commission to check if Park had broken such laws when Park criticized Yoo. Main opposition officials also criticized the ruling bloc’s in-house fight, saying the power struggle between Park and Yoo had strangled the parliament.“We are dumbfounded by the president’s decision to hold hostage the public and the legislature to her fight (with Yoo),” NPAD Rep. Kang Dong-won said. “The Park loyalists in the Saenuri Party seem to me like worker bees trying to protect their queen,” Kang added. “But Park must know that every queen bee eventually dies at the hands of her workers.”The NPAD’s senior lawmakers held impromptu street rallies the same day, to raise awareness about the ruling bloc’s fight and Park’s veto that started it. NPAD officials urged the ruling party to attend next Monday’s plenary session when Park’s veto will be put to a revote. The NPAD is mulling whether to link Park’s veto to a supplementary budget bill that the ruling party motioned if the Saenuri Party does not attend next week’s vote. NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in (second from right) at a street rally protesting President Park Geun-hye's veto, Thursday. (Yonhap)Meanwhile, the ruling party’s Park-Yoo feud worsened. Rep.

Kim Tae-ho to “cut it out.”The meeting room erupted in fury, with Yoo sympathizers exiting behind chairman Kim.Saenuri Rep. Kim Hack-yong, another Yoo sympathizer, could be heard cursing at Rep.

Yoo Seong-min should resign for backing a bill that would have given the legislature the right to request revisions to government decrees. Park vetoed the bill, saying it had violated the principle of checks and balances in government.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min attends a party meeting at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)But Yoo sympathizers say Park went too far in demanding his resignation, calling her demand a bullying tactic against Yoo, a rising figure in the governing party. Park appears focused on avoiding premature lame-duck status, critics said, by replacing Yoo with one of her supporters in the wake of multiple policy crises that have cut her approval ratings, and with a nationwide parliamentary poll looming next year.Park’s anti-Yoo actions, however, could backfire, pundits added, and accelerate her lame-duck status. Experts cited recent polls showing popular opposition to the president’s calls for Yoo to resign.“I’m not sure if Park is a lame duck right now. But she could be asking for it, if she goes further with her anti-Yoo campaign,” said Lee Nae-young, Korea University professor of politics, citing a Jowon C&I; poll of 700 adults last week showing 58 percent of respondents opposed Park’s stance on Yoo.Park’s approval ratings fell to 29 percent on June 18, during the height of the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak here, from 40 percent in late May, before rebounding to 33 percent last week, according to Gallup Korea. Gallup’s weekly polls generally survey 1,000 adults nationwide and have a 95 percent confidence level on a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.“I think Park’s already a lame duck,” Yang Seung-ham, professor at Yonsei University said, citing her lack of policy success stories.“Her credibility just fell too much after the Sewol ferry accident last year, and the MERS outbreak (this month),” Yang added.“The latest fight is a sign that Park loyalists are doing everything they can to hold on to their power before the president’s influence disappears.”The Park-Yoo fight began last week when Park urged voters to vote against Yoo in next year’s parliamentary elections. The comment sparked public outrage, as the president appeared to be overstepping her constitutional authority. The opposition said Park’s statement constituted election meddling.“One way of resolving this is by giving Yoo some kind of justification for him to resign, so that he can save some face,” Lee said. “But that option runs the risk of sparking mass protest from Yoo supporters,” the Korea University professor added.“The best way out for Park now is to invite Yoo to the presidential office and show the public that she is taking a more conciliatory stance toward him,” Yang said.“That way, she can give off an impression of remorse for her earlier statements, and minimize the image that she is a bully trying to have her way,” he added.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","resign for backing bill ,park vetoed the bill ,the ruling party feud ,feud persisted on tuesday ,government decrees park vetoed","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62142986  0.19330873

The Assembly’s regular session will be postponed for five days, he added. The parliament was to hold a regular session Wednesday.Chung said the decision is in accordance with the relevant laws that require the Assembly to reconsider a bill sent back by the president. Chung’s decision came days after the Saenuri Party lawmakers decided not to put the bill up for a revote in a gesture of reconciliation toward the president who had strongly lambasted the party last week for approving the bill pushed by the opposition. National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa (Yonhap)Chances appear to be slim for the Assembly to override Park’s veto, as the governing party with a majority 160 seats are likely to boycott the vote. Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung said the party would attend the regular session to comply with the Assembly speaker’s decision. The party’s floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min later elaborated on Kim’s remark that they didn’t mean that Saenuri Party lawmakers would cast votes on the bill.To override a vetoed bill, more than two-thirds of the vote is required. If the vote fails to meet the quorum of 149 lawmakers, the bill is automatically scrapped.With the Assembly speaker putting the bill to a vote again, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy withdrew its decision to boycott parliamentary sessions for the last five days. But opposition leader Rep. Moon Jae-in blasted the Saenuri Party for objecting to a revote of the bill, calling the party “a coward.” “Lawmakers are obligated to participate in a vote on a bill that was returned for reconsideration,” Moon told reporters at a party event. “There won’t be other choices.” Moon also slammed the ruling party for rolling back its decision to pass the bill, following President Park’s scathing criticism of lawmakers attempting to challenge the government’s administrative power.“The bill was (previously) approved by the Saenuri Party. They should participate in the vote again fair and square.”The bill, which enables lawmakers to request the government to modify its decree, returned to the parliament Thursday after Park exercised her first veto, citing unconstitutionality. Park criticized both parties, particularly the Saenuri leadership, for passing the bill, saying that they were “betraying the people” in pursuit of their political interests.Her remarks apparently were aimed at Saenuri chief whip Rep. Yoo, who led a legislative deal with the main opposition party to pass the Assembly bill along with a reform bill on civil servants’ pension. The Saenuri Party appears to be rejecting a revote of the Assembly bill in a dire effort to mend ties with Cheong Wa Dae, but also to help the embattled floor leader step down “honorably.” Yoo has been resisting demands from Saenuri lawmakers loyal to President Park, saying that he needs more time to think.

Yoo Seung-min. The escalating internal strife continued to paralyze the National Assembly as the main opposition party jumped into the fray by blasting the hierarchical relations between Cheong Wa Dae and the governing party.After an emergency supreme council meeting, Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung apologized to the people for causing concern and vowed that he would prevent the party from falling apart. Yoo, however, said he would spend time thinking deeply about his fate. The meeting was held after loyalists to Park, including Reps. Seo Cheong-won and Lee Jeong-hyun, battered floor leader Yoo to resign for disrupting ties between Cheong Wa Dae and the party over a controversial assembly law. Yoo apologized to the president Friday following the president’s expression of her blunt dislike of him last week, but has been resisting calls to leave the post. Park also remained mute on Yoo on Monday, appearing to have passed the baton to the party to make a decision on him.“I believe Yoo would make a decision from a broad point of view,” said Seo before attending the emergency supreme council meeting.“He used to say that he hopes for the success of the Park Geun-hye administration, and now is a good opportunity for him to help her government be a success.” Rep. Lee, who served as Park’s top political and press aide, urged Yoo to quit, stressing that he has to take responsibility for causing the political chaos. “Politics is about holding responsibility for the outcomes (of actions). Now is the time for the floor leader to take that responsibility,” he said in a radio interview. Ruling Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min attends the Navy’s 2nd Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, on the 13th anniversary of the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong, Monday. YonhapCalls have been mounting among the Saenuri members for Yoo to resign after Park vetoed a revision to the National Assembly Act on Thursday, citing unconstitutionality.Park blasted both parties for overstepping their boundaries and neglecting their duties by passing the bill that enables lawmakers to seek changes to government ordinances. Park also slammed lawmakers for “betraying the people” and said their act should be judged by voters in the next election.Her sharp criticism exposed cracks in the relationship between Park and her own party as she directly blamed the Saenuri leadership for succumbing to the opposition party’s demand to revise the National Assembly Act on the condition of passing a reform bill on the pension of civil servants.Meanwhile, nonmainstream members and sympathizers of Yoo were seen uniting against the pro-Park faction. They accused the president’s loyalists for driving a political witch hunt.“Even a criminal under sentence of death won’t be executed right away,” said Rep. Kim Seong-tae, a Saenuri legislator regarded as being out of the party’s mainstream.A group of 20 nonmainstream lawmakers of the party released a statement, urging the supreme council members not to make a unilateral decision to throw Yoo out.“The floor leader has been elected through a party caucus accordingly with the party’s constitution,” read the statement. “The supreme council should not make a decision on its own, ignoring the consensus of all the (Saenuri) lawmakers over (the fate of Yoo), elected through a democratic procedure,” it added.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","internal feud between lawmakers ,feud between lawmakers ,escalating internal strife continued ,main opposition party jumped ,an intensifying internal feud","['Supreme council', 'Park Geun', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'the National Assembly']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84669596  0.2202329

Rhee In-je of the ruling Saenuri Party has refused to show up for questioning over his allegations despite an earlier promise to meet with prosecution investigators on Saturday.   The six-term lawmaker is suspected of receiving 20 million won (US$17,800) in illicit political funds from the late business tycoon Sung Wan-jong just before the 2013 general elections.   The summons came as part of the prosecution's investigation into a suspected ""bribery list"" left behind by Sung, the late chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises Inc., who committed suicide in April.   Sung suggested in a memo that he had given illegal political funds to eight people, including Hong Moon-jong, a ruling party lawmaker who served in a key post in the election camp of President Park Geun-hye, as well as Yoo Jeong-bok and Seo Byung-soo, the current mayors of Incheon and Busan.   Rhee was part of the now-dissolved minor conservative Advancement and Unification Party when Sung served as the party's floor leader.   Prosecutors had also sought to question Rep. Kim Han-gil of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy for allegedly taking tens of millions of won from Sung while running for the main opposition party's top position in May 2013.   Kim has twice refused to answer prosecution summons, they said.   The officials from the prosecution said they will consider all ""available means"" to summon the two lawmakers, though they noted issuing an arrest warrant was currently not an option as parliament is in session.   According to legal experts, available measures may include pressing charges against the two without questioning them.

The revisions, which could have given lawmakers authority to request changes to government decrees, violated the principle of checks and balances, Park had said.The National Assembly on Sunday. (Yonhap)In-house feuding continued to escalate at the Saenuri Party posing Park loyalists against sympathizers of Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min.The pro-Park members stepped up their demand for the resignation of Yoo, who reluctantly agreed to the president’s veto. Yoo had agreed to sponsor the amendments as part of a legislative deal with the NPAD, which agreed to vote on the public service pension reforms, a bill that the main opposition had formerly opposed. President Park had criticized Yoo for the logrolling scheme.“People in support of the position of Cheong Wa Dae are set on taking Yoo down from his post no matter what it takes,” a Saenuri Party lawmaker was quoted as telling Yonhap News on Saturday.“The president’s demand, in simpler words, was that since Yoo is no better than a traitor, he should step down from his post and quit politics.”On Thursday, Park vetoed the Assembly Law revision and sharply denounced the legislation, saying that the lawmakers were attempting to challenge the government’s administrative power. She also singled out Yoo for a betrayal that should be judged by voters in the next election.The main opposition party criticized Park’s statements against Yoo.“Each and every lawmaker is a constitutional organ,” Rep. Moon Jae-in, the NPAD’s chair, said later Sunday. “Intervening in parliamentary politics and exerting pressure on (Yoo) to resign and apologize is nonsense,” Moon added.NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul expressed his party’s determination to “do everything” it could to hold the revote, saying it would take priority over other pending high-profile bills.“Right now, putting the amendment to a revote at the plenary session on July 1, is extremely important,” Lee said. “We will do our best to make that happen at our meetings with Saenuri Party officials (this week).”To put the legislation to a revote this Wednesday, the main opposition party needs the approval of the majority Saenuri Party. If the ruling party refuses, the NPAD must get a nod from National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa.But NPAD officials cast doubt on the likelihood of either, throwing jibes at the accentuated power struggle at the Saenuri Party.“I have to say at this point that (the NPAD) would prefer a Park loyalist as a negotiating partner, rather than having Rep. Yoo,” the NPAD’s chief deputy floor leader Rep. Lee Choon-suak said later Sunday.“Having a Park loyalist (as a negotiating partner) would mean we won’t have to worry about them saying one thing and changing it the next time after we seal a deal,” Lee said, adding that a Park loyalist would be in constant contact with Cheong Wa Dae officials over controversial legislation.“We would be able to negotiate with the person who is really in charge, the president,” he added.The NPAD also remained pessimistic about the possibility of the bill actually going up for a vote at the decision of the Assembly speaker, a former member of the Saenuri Party.“(Speaker) Chung will keep the bill pending, citing the lack of any agreement between us and the ruling party over the amendments,” Lee said.“I suspect that the speaker will use the Saenuri Party’s refusal as an excuse to keep the bill from a revote, holding out until this parliamentary session ends on July 6,” he added.  By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","feud deepens after park ,main opposition party sunday ,after park veto political ,party sunday repeated calls ,opposition party sunday repeated","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park ’s', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65845579 -0.10300552

Yoo Seong-min due to his role in last week’s legislative crisis that is widely viewed as a power struggle between him and the president.President Park Geun-hye last Thursday vetoed a bill, chiefly sponsored by her former chief of staff Yoo, that would have given lawmakers the right to ask for revisions to government decrees. Park said the changes violated the principle of the division of powers and blasted Yoo for causing a political crisis. Yoo apologized, but resisted pressure from Park-loyalist lawmakers to resign.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min apologizes to President Park Geun-hye last Friday. (Yonhap) The latest friction between Park and Yoo was nothing new, with Park’s veto of the bill only adding another chapter to their love-hate relationship, analysts said, by sparking an in-house feud in the ruling Saenuri Party that pitches Park loyalists against Yoo sympathizers.President Park Geun-hye. (Yonhap)Yoo and Park began their political relationship amicably, when Park in 2005 named Yoo as her chief of staff during her tenure as the chairwoman of the Grand National Party, the forerunner to the Saenuri Party. Yoo later served in Park’s presidential campaign team in 2007.But the relationship soured in late 2011 when Yoo opposed Park’s plans to change the party’s name from the GNP to the Saenuri Party, saying the newly proposed name lacked “identity.”Yoo has also consistently opposed Park’s policies since rising to the ruling party’s floor leadership in February, including his criticism of Park’s “welfare without taxation” approach, which Yoo said was an impossibility.“(President Park’s) 134.5 trillion won ($120 billion) campaign promise has turned out to be false,” Yoo said at a parliamentary speech in April in reference to Park’s welfare pledges. “Politicians must be more honest about our fiscal reality,” Yoo added, citing government tax revenues that had come short of initial expectations.Yoo had also released critical statements against Park’s foreign policy and national security policies and passed downsized versions of Park’s proposed reforms on the public service pension in May, drawing the ire of the president and her followers in the ruling party.Park loyalists threatened to renew requests to hold a confidence vote on Yoo on Monday. Several Saenuri lawmakers traditionally not considered to be in the pro-Park camp also urged Yoo to resign despite his apologies to Park last week.Yoo sympathizers, on the other hand, urged the embattled whip to stand his ground. They also accused the president of trying to commandeer the party for her political agenda, instead of using negotiations to convince dissenters.“Respecting the presidential veto (by not putting the veto to a parliamentary vote) is one thing,” Saenuri Rep. Park Min-shik said. “But using this crisis to worsen strained ties between the party and President Park is something else,” he said, hinting that pressuring Yoo to resign was going too far.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","last thursday vetoed bill ,thursday vetoed bill chiefly ,last week legislative crisis ,hye last thursday vetoed ,thursday vetoed bill","['Yoo Seong - min', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Yoo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45563382  0.04611876

Boycotting all parliamentary sessions, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded the president apologize for her “malicious” remarks and disparaged her veto as a mere political show. The NPAD vowed not to cooperate with the ruling party for an indefinite period, except for issues related to Middle East respiratory syndrome.“President Park’s exercise of her veto is nothing more than a dirty political trick to evade the government’s responsibility over (the outbreak of MERS) and to turn the public criticism to something else,” said NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in at an impromptu news conference held at the National Assembly. “The president is the one who should be judged by the people.”Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in and other lawmakers protest President Park Geun-hye’s decision to veto the revised National Assembly Act at the National Assembly on Friday. (Yonhap)Moon was firing back at Park who bashed politicians both from rival parties Thursday for pursuing their own political interests, instead of legislating urgent bills aimed at improving their livelihoods. In a rare lengthy statement delivered in a strong tone, Park blasted both parties for overstepping their boundaries and neglecting their duties for passing the bill that enables lawmakers to seek changes to government ordinances. Park also slammed lawmakers for “betraying the people” and said their act should be judged by voters in the next election.Her sharp criticism also exposed cracks in relationship between Park and her own party as she directly blamed the Saenuri leadership for succumbing to the opposition party’s demand to pass the revision to the National Assembly act.Rumors also swirled around Friday that Park may defect from the ruling party ahead of general elections next year. Cheong Wa Dae denied, saying it is “a novel-like story.”In an all-out effort to salvage the deteriorating relationship, the governing party on Thursday evening decided to reject the opposition’s demand to override Park’s veto. The bill requires the approval of more than two-thirds of attending lawmakers. If the vote fails to meet the quorum of 149 lawmakers, the bill will automatically be scrapped.Rep. Yoo Seung-min, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, also offered a public apology to the president forcausing her concern. But he defended himself, saying he had done his best to pass a reform bill on civil servants’ pensions for the success of the Park government.“I feel truly sorry to President Park Geun-hye. I owe an apology to the president for the ruling party’s lack of support to her devoted drive on state affairs,” Yoo said.“But I, as well as the party chief and other lawmakers, truly wanted to support the Park government by passing the (pension) bill by any means. … I expect that she will open her heart to us,” he said.Despite his apology, Cheong Wa Dae also turned a cold shoulder to the party ― a move seen as pressuring the chief whip to resign. An official told Yonhap news agency that Saenuri Party seems to be unaware of the gravity of the president’s remark.Factional feuds within the ruling party appeared to be intensifying with pro-Park lawmakers demanding Yoo to step down and nonmainstream lawmakers confronting the idea. Park’s approval ratings, meanwhile, rebounded to 33 percent this week, a 4 percentage points increase from the previous week, according to a local pollster Gallup Korea. Signs of a slowdown in the MERS spread may have played a part, it noted.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","boycotting all parliamentary sessions ,brutal denouncement of lawmakers ,power boycotting all parliamentary ,boycotting all parliamentary ,veto of controversial parliamentary","['Park Geun - hye', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29768294 -0.17451212

YonhapAdmitting that the government’s early response to the outbreak was “insufficient,” the official said Cheong Wa Dae is not trying to evade its responsibility over the crisis, but concentrating on the ongoing mission to fight against the virus that had killed 27 and infected 179 as of Wednesday. The remark came amid mounting demands from both rival parties for the president to deliver a public apology over the government’s slow initial response.The government has been under fire for concealing information of MERS-infected patients and the hospitals where they were admitted and treated. The health ministry had rejected calls to disclose names of MERS-hit hospitals, stressing that it would paralyze the nation’s medical sector. They had expressed concerns that hospitals could refuse to treat patients suspected of MERS and also suffer huge losses of income if other patients stopped visiting those clinics. More than 90 percent of South Korea’s hospital beds are at for-profit institutions, which the government does not hold absolute control over. Authorities later revealed the names and routes patients traveled. But its belated revelation sparked the public’s anger, with many blasting the government, saying that its slow move aggravated the spread of the disease.A ruling party lawmaker told Yonhap News agency that the president may deliver an apology later over the government’s bungled response, after the disease has come under control.Observers also said that Cheong Wa Dae may mull offering an apology at an appropriate time as it fears the opposition party throwing the issue into a political contest.Park was under massive pressure to apologize for the Sewol ferry crisis last year. Park delivered an official apology over the government’s poor response more than a month after the ferry sank off the nation’s southwestern coast and killed more than 300 passengers, mostly teenagers on a school trip to Jejudo Island.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","political circles to apologize ,presidential office said wednesday ,senior presidential official admitting ,park office snubs calls ,snubs calls to apologize",[],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25472778  0.32203412

There are currently 3,103 people kept in isolation as a precaution to prevent the spread of the disease.  In a meeting with medical personnel and administrators at Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Hearts Hospital in southern Seoul, Choi Kyung-hwan said the government will reimburse direct losses caused by a drop in patients and cover all treatment costs for MERS patients.In addition, MERS-hit hospitals and clinics will be allowed to get low-interest loans through the Industrial Bank of Korea. They can also draw money from the 20 billion won (US$18 million) emergency business stabilization fund.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, also said the government is open to suggestions made by front-line medical personnel that have been trying to cope with the respiratory illness.""There have been growing calls from all sides demanding a wholesale overhaul of the way the country handles contagious diseases,"" Choi said. ""Experts are looking at ways to update procedures to better identify, transport, treat and care for patients with contagious illnesses.""While there has been a decline in the number of people contracting MERS, it is too early to let down the country's guard, Choi said.He, in particular, asked medical personnel to take all possible precautions not to inadvertently pass on the illness to other people.

They claimed Park focused on scapegoating and creating partisan wars while shirking efforts to contain the outbreak.But the ruling Saenuri Party’s chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung rejected the NPAD’s proposal later Monday, saying the National Assembly’s special MERS panel the was already serving as a bipartisan work group.“The (special MERS panel) is already functioning. The panel is a group dedicated to creating possible solutions, while staying as far away from party politics as possible,” Kim said. “It is my job as a senior party official to ensure that the already existing bipartisan panel works.” New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in (left) and floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul attend a news conference to announce the party’s statement on MERS at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)The Assembly’s special MERS panel was formed by leaders of the main parties earlier this month. The committee includes nine opposition and nine ruling party lawmakers.The NPAD’s proposal included plans to increase government spending in areas most affected by the deadly respiratory virus, including Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the first MERS patient was reported to have stayed and spread the virus. NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in also suggested increasing spending beyond this year’s budget, and raising the corporate tax as a possible way to obtain funds to tackle MERS.The MERS outbreak left 27 dead while over 3,800 remained quarantined as of Monday. The number of confirmed patients rose to 172 earlier in the day. But the overall outlook appeared positive as the virus’ spread was expected to be contained in the coming days.President Park’s approval rating rose by 0.3 percent to 34.9, the local pollster Realmeter reported Monday. The rise ended two weeks of continued falls likely caused by the administration’s apparent failure to stem the growth in the number of MERS-related deaths.The weekly survey polled 2,500 adults nationwide from June 15-19, using automated and computer-automated phone interviews.

Two lawmakers abstained.  (Yonhap)The passage reflects the ruling Saenuri Party's unilateral support for the confirmation, with all of the 156 of its 160 members present in the session presumed to have voted in favor.President Park Geun-hye instantly presented an appointment letter to Hwang, allowing him to spearhead the country's fight against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus.Hwang chose the National Medical Center, where many MERS patients are being treated in quarantine, as his first destination for anti-epidemic efforts. ""The life and safety of people are the foremost value in a nation's raison d'etre and I am feeling the heavy responsibility for the continuing anxieties over MERS,"" Hwang said in his meeting with the head of the medical center. ""As a control tower, I will stand in the vanguard of the eradication of MERS."" The fight against the virus will be the overriding focus of Hwang's service down the road, officials of the Prime Minister's Office said. Hwang will take over from Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who has been acting as prime minister, as the chair of the government's daily anti-MERS meeting while continuing his public outings to quell public jitters about the virus, according to the officials. Other daunting tasks awaiting Hwang include reviving the stagnant economy, further sagged by the outbreak of the MERS virus, as well as Park's reform and anti-corruption drives.In a press conference held right after his nomination last month, Hwang vowed to ""make utmost efforts to reform the country's fundamentals including efforts to reset what is not normal."" Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo stepped down in late May amid bribery allegations.The government and the ruling party have called for speedy parliamentary approval of a new prime minister, who takes charge as the control tower in the government efforts against the spread of the MERS virus.Since the outbreak of the first case here May 20, the acute respiratory virus had killed 23 South Koreans as of Thursday. The total number of local MERS cases reached 165.""It is a great relief that the new prime minister won his chance to perform his duty not too belatedly, at a time every second is dearly cherished to end the MERS situation,"" Saenuri spokesman Rhee Chong-hoon said in a briefing. ""The people expect the new prime minister to be accommodating, respectful and to be a well-performing prime minister,"" Rhee noted.Since the three-day confirmation hearing last week, the opposition bloc has objected to the nominee, whom they labeled ""unfit"" citing influence-peddling and draft-dodging allegations.The opposition, however, gave into Saenuri's call for the parliamentary vote after eliciting a promise from Saenuri for a reform of the parliamentary confirmation hearing system, as well as an apology from Hwang over the allegations.""(NPAD's) Stance that he is an unqualified candidate has not changed. But the party will keep a close eye on whether he faithfully carries out his duty as the control tower for MERS,"" NPAD spokesman Park Soo-hyun said.Five lawmakers of the minor opposition Justice Party boycotted the vote. The 58-year-old Hwang is widely known as a champion of the National Security Law, which prohibits sympathizing with or circulating the communist ideology of North Korea.He had been the justice minister ever since Park took office in early 2013, before he offered to resign last week to take the country's second-highest government position.

The ruling Saenuri Party said it would unilaterally approve Hwang’s confirmation at an upcoming National Assembly plenary session unless the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accepted the nomination. The Assembly is slated to gather for an interpellation session on Thursday and Friday. But Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min said Tuesday that the party may push to expedite the process by pushing to open a separate plenary session on Wednesday.“We must complete Hwang’s confirmation no later than tomorrow,” Yoo said. “In the meantime, we will continue our efforts to beat the NPAD. Even if we fail, we will convince the speaker to put the confirmation to a vote and unilaterally approve it.”Yoo sent out a text message to the fellow lawmakers and urged them to attend the vote -― a move to secure enough votes for Hwang’s confirmation bill, which requires the majority’s approval. The Saenuri Party could unilaterally pass the bill as it holds a majority 160 of 298 parliamentary seats.The NPAD, however, criticized the move and repeated its objection to an “unfit” candidate for the nation’s second-in-command. NPAD asserts that Hwang has failed to give sufficient explanations to the allegations such as influence-peddling and lobbying attempts when he faced the parliamentary hearing.“(The Saenuri Party) is blackmailing us and it is wrong,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. “I think they are self-conscious about how Cheong Wa Dae would react. Both political parties need to discuss and coordinate on (Hwang’s confirmation),” said Moon. Meanwhile, acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan urged the lawmakers to fill the post for his replacement, criticizing them for delaying the confirmation process “without obvious reason” amid the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak that has dampened the nation’s economy.“I don’t understand why the Assembly is dragging its feet (over the confirmation),” he said. “The longer we delay the confirmation, the less likely we will address the MERS outbreak and its economic fallout.

The delivery came after a compromise reached between the ruling and main opposition party in the wording of the revision. The changed wording of a clause in the bill says that the Assembly could “request” the government review its ordinances. The earlier version said that the lawmakers could “demand” a revision of government-enacted ordinances. Park had stood in stern opposition to the bill, pressuring the parliament saying she would use her veto power if no changes were made to the bill before it reaches the stage of her endorsement. She said it clearly violates the constitutional principle that stipulates the division of powers. The bill could also paralyze the function of the executive branch, she said.The ball is now back in President Park’s court, but her spokesman expressed discontent with the latest version, indicating that it still has issues with unconstitutionality. “The bill was sent with (just) one word being fixed. There’s no change in our position,” he said at a daily press briefing.The president can constitutionally exercise a veto within a 15-day period after the parliament sends a bill to receive the president’s signature. If the president returns the bill, the parliament is required to put the bill up for vote again. To override the president‘s veto, the Assembly would require approval from more than two-thirds of attending lawmakers. If it fails to meet the quorum, the bill would automatically be scrapped.Min, however, refrained to answer when the president would exercise her veto.Observers said the matter is likely to be discussed during a weekly Cabinet meeting next week, or even at a later time, as the president is at the moment struggling to resolve growing public resentment toward the government’s bungled responses to the Middle East respiratory syndrome. The president exercising her veto over the bill would further intensify the feud between her and the parliament, particularly with her own party, observers said.Complaints have been growing within the Saenuri Party with Cheong Wa Dae publicly denouncing the ruling party for succumbing to the opposition’s demands to pass the bill.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","government ordinances monday afternoon ,park aides still opposed ,revision the political battle ,government ordinances monday ,lawmakers to seek changes","['National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45873186  0.2468082

It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points with a confidence level of 95 percent.“The growing number of MERS deaths and the confirmed cases of the disease as well as the rising concerns that the virus may have transmitted to the general public appear to have played a part in a steep drop in Park’s ratings,” said Realmeter in a statement.The MERS crisis has also pulled down the popularity of the governing Saenuri Party and its chairman Kim Moo-sung, widely regarded as one of strong contenders for the next presidential race in 2017.The approval rating for the Saenuri Party fell 1.8 percentage points to 36.5 percent, the lowest mark since it won a landslide victory in the April 29 by-elections, while the rating for the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy rebounded 2.3 percentage points to 30.3 percent.Kim was ranked second in the list of the most-favored presidential hopefuls, trailing Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who blasted the central government for keeping the information of hospitals and patients confidential.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","hye approval ratings last ,further dragged down president ,decline from 40 percent ,last week the lowest ,ratings last week despite","['Park Geun - hye', 'the United States', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76020068  0.63050264

Chung Ui-hwa’s mediation over the bill. Chung had proposed to amend contentious words to bridge the partisan gap and prevent potential clashes with the Constitution. “(My proposal’s) whole purpose is to eliminate the bill’s unconstitutionality,” said Chung. “Therefore, I believe there will be no unnecessary clashes between the legislature and the executive branch. I sincerely appreciate both parties’ cooperation,” Chung said. The bill initially stated that the assembly can “demand” the government change an enforcement decree, but Chung had asked the lawmakers to replace the word “demand” with “request” to prevent constitutional violations.The NPAD agreed Monday to accept the speaker’s proposal at a meeting where key NPAD lawmakers attended. The party pointed out that the speaker’s version is “virtually” the same as the original one, arguing it is “merely” the change of a phrase. “We have agreed to accept the speaker’s proposal,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “The change is only limited to the word choice, basically replacing the word ‘demand’ with ‘request.’ We have decided to stop political bickering (over the issue),” said Lee. Lee urged the speaker to ask the president to stop threatening to veto the bill, demanding the speaker’s commitment to bringing the bill to the floor once again for a vote even if the president vetoed the bill. The speaker said it is “unlikely” that the president would veto the bill.

Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae has yet to rule out the possibility of vetoing the bill. “(The speaker’s proposal) could still violate the Constitution.

Hong Joon-pyo -- without detention on charges of violating the Political Fund Act. The result of the probe into the graft scandal will also follow. The indictment comes nearly two months after investigators launched a probe into the allegations that eight senior officials from the Park administration accepted illicit political donations from Sung, the deceased chairman of Keangnam Enterprises. Sung claimed in a media interview that he offered campaign money to eight politicians close to President Park before committing suicide in April. The police found a handwritten note in his pocket that listed the names of the politicians and the bribe amounts he allegedly handed over. The former premier Lee, who stepped down from the post on April 27, is suspected of having received 30 million won ($27,000) from Sung in April 2013. Sung allegedly offered 100 million won to Gov. Hong in June 2011, when the four-term lawmaker was running for chief of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.The prosecution sent inquiry letters late last month to the remaining six politicians listed in Sung’s memo, requesting information on their relations with Sung, as well as their roles at the ruling party in 2012. The six include ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Hong Moon-jong, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo, incumbent Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee and his two predecessors ― Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","office prosecutors will indict ,prosecutors will indict two ,indict two political bigwigs ,ex governor this week ,political heavyweights without detention","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Lee Wan - koo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50609481  0.21760501

The NPAD boycotted Friday’s adoption of Hwang’s parliamentary report, leaving the meeting in protest just before the panel adopted the report by a vote of seven to six. The adoption allows the National Assembly to put the confirmation to a vote in a plenary session. “(The unilateral adoption) was an inevitable decision,” said Saenuri Party floor spokesperson Rep. Min Hyun-joo on Saturday in a statement. “We need to build a robust governance system to address the public fear over the MERS outbreak,” said Min. Min urged the NPAD to attend the Assembly’s plenary session next week and put Hwang’s confirmation to a vote. Saenuri Party can push through the confirmation as they hold a majority with 160 out of 298 parliamentary seats. The NPAD, however, has repeated its objection to Hwang and continued to dismiss him as “unfit” for the nation’s second-in-command. “Saenuri abandons its right and duty as lawmakers,” said NPAD vice floor spokesperson Rep. Kim Jung-hyun. “Saenuri has compromised the role of the National Assembly by adopting the report. If they continue to do this, they would end up being a rubber stamp to support Cheong Wa Dae’s decisions,” said Kim. The NPAD also said Sunday that it would amend a parliamentary law to mandate high-profile candidates like Hwang submit relevant information for their confirmation hearing. The NPAD criticized Hwang for being “insincere” in response to its request for information, failing to prove Hwang’s qualification for the post. Meanwhile, the NPAD on Sunday urged President Park Geun-hye to withdraw her threat to veto the revised parliamentary law that allows lawmakers to demand the government make changes in decrees. As the rival parties continued to clash over the bill, Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa offered mediation by changing contentious language in the bill.Chung suggested watering down the language to prevent any further debate of it potentially violating the Constitution, such as by stating that the Assembly can “request” instead of “demand” changes to government ordinances. The Saenuri Party has decided to accept Chung’s proposal, while the NPAD continued internal discussion of whether to consent.“Despite the concern that the speaker’s proposal could encroach upon the legislative branch, we have continued to discuss with party members and the speaker. We ask Cheong Wa Dae to give a sincere response to (our efforts),” said NPAD floor speaker Park Soo-hyun.

The adoption of a confirmation report allows the National Assembly to put a confirmation bill to a vote in a plenary session.    Six other members who are affiliated with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and the minor opposition Justice Party did not attend the committee meeting in protest against the nominee.   In a three-day confirmation hearing earlier in the week, NPAD has dismissed Hwang as unfit for the country's second-highest government position on grounds that Hwang undertook some illegitimate legal cases while he was working as a lawyer in the past.    NPAD has also denounced the nominee after Hwang delayed submission of records on his legal career despite repeated opposition demand.    Still, the ruling party has vowed to push the confirmation through the parliament with or without cooperation from the opposition block.    The ruling party has 160 of the 298 seats, a majority that will allow it to unilaterally confirm Hwang.   ""It is impossible to leave the prime minister seat empty even for one more day in the face of the MERS situation,"" a ruling party official said, asking not to be named. ""The efforts to persuade the opposition party will continue, but the confirmation report should be adopted anyway in accordance with law.""   The Saenuri Party plans to have negotiations to hold a plenary session for the confirmation early next week, but opposition party members said that it is not going to happen until at least Thursday, when a parliamentary interpellation session kicks off.   Currently the justice minister, Hwang was nominated in May, a month after then-Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo stepped down amid allegations of bribery.

The governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy failed to agree on a parliamentary procedure to confirm the nominee. The Saenuri Party urged for Hwang’s confirmation at the plenary session on Friday, while NPAD opposed it. “Both parties couldn’t reach an agreement over the parliamentary schedule for Hwang’s confirmation,” said Rep. Lee Choon Suak of NPAD. The main opposition party insisted that the three-day hearing this week had failed to shed any light on allegations of Hwang’s ethical lapses.The remark came after the Saenuri Party hinted at a “unilateral” push to put the nomination to a vote. “We will convince the National Assembly’s speaker to put it to a vote unless the NPAD comes for negotiation,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min on Thursday.Yoo pointed out that Friday is “virtually” the deadline for the approval because the law dictates that lawmakers complete the process by Saturday.But NPAD repeated its rejection of the nominee, who they claim is “unverified.” The party has been claiming that Hwang is unfit for the premiership as he had given “insincere” and “insufficient” explanations to the allegations against him. The P.M. nominee faces allegation that he dodged military service and violated the code of conduct as a lawyer. The NPAD also charges that he pretended to have a rare case of hives to avoid mandatory military service and was involved in a controversial pardon when he was a lawyer in 2012. He has denied the allegations. “We were not able to begin the procedure for Hwang’s approval right now,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “We couldn’t adopt the final report for the hearing and I don’t think the assembly is likely to hold a plenary session tomorrow in a smooth manner.” Lee added that the party would continue its efforts to block Hwang’s approval.

He also faces allegations of lawyering cases under the jurisdiction of local prosecutors’ offices that he had once headed, in violation of conflict of interest rules.Former opposition lawmaker Roh Hoi-chan (right) answers questions as a witness during the confirmation hearing of Prime Minister nominee Hwang Kyo-ahn at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Most witnesses repeated what Hwang had offered as explanation to the opposition’s claims or reiterated, “I do not know.”Opposition lawmakers expressed frustration at the answers and threatened to boycott the final vote on Hwang’s appointment. They added they could not vote on Hwang as he refused to provide papers disproving allegations of ethical lapses.“So far, we can only say that (Hwang) is not fit to serve as the next prime minister,” main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said earlier Wednesday.But ruling Saenuri Party officials argued that the opposition’s lack of evidence disproved the allegations against Hwang. Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min added that his party would hold a vote on Hwang’s nomination “hopefully by (this Friday).”The Saenuri Party holds 160 of the unicameral National Assembly’s 298 seats. Meanwhile, Roh Hoi-chan, a former lawmaker of the minor opposition Justice Party, was an exception to the witnesses’ silence. Roh repeated allegations that Hwang had tried to cover up the so-called Samsung X-file case in 2005, while serving as the case’s lead prosecutor.Government intelligence officials had allegedly recorded a scene showing prosecutors taking bribes from Samsung officials. But Hwang, the lead prosecutor probing the case, had indicted only Roh, the lawmaker who had leaked the scandal to the press.Roh received a suspended one-year sentence, and lost his parliamentary seat.“The case greatly hurt the public’s trust in state prosecutors, and also the public’s trust in officialdom,” Roh said. “I do not agree that Hwang is fit to serve as a leader of any anticorruption drive.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","as opposition lawmakers struggled ,confirmation hearing wednesday denied ,lawmakers struggled to highlight ,opposition lawmakers struggled to ,opposition lawmakers struggled","['Hwang Kyo - ahn ’s', 'Hwang']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43597162  0.66375387

Park added that continued public fear over the disease would likely hurt consumer spending and the tourism industry.“MERS is a controllable virus that we can contain. I understand that the public is alarmed at the disease’s spread. But I urge citizens to refrain from excessively reacting to MERS for the sake of the economy,” Park said.“I also would like to urge the Finance Ministry to ensure that the MERS outbreak does not hurt our tourism industry,” the president added. Acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan (right) gets his fever checked during his visit to one of the affected hospitals in Daejeon, Tuesday. (Yonhap)Park has been under strong public criticism for failing to contain the MERS virus after the first MERS patient was confirmed late last month. She has also been denounced for withholding key information from the public, such as the names of the hospitals where MERS patients have visited.The government finally released the names of the hospitals last Sunday, after resisting public pressure to do so for two weeks.Park’s approval rating slipped this week by 4.4 percent to 40.3 percent according to a public survey by Realmeter announced on Monday. The poll asked 2,500 adults across Korea from June 1 to 5, and had a margin of error plus or minus 2 percent at a 95 percent confidence level.“We have a history of overcoming national crises. I am confident that we will do the same now,” the president said.“But the government needs your help. We are doing our best, but we are forced to rely on self-reports from citizens.

The president has done her best to address public safety concerns consistently and vigorously, and she will continue those efforts based on a government-centered approach (to the MERS crisis),” Hwang said. P.M. nominee Hwang Kyo-ahn. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)Park named Hwang, the incumbent justice minister, to serve as her new prime minister last month after then-Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo resigned due to growing suspicion that he had accepted illegal campaign funds during campaigning for the April 2013 parliamentary by-elections.Hwang’s appointment is subject to parliamentary approval. But opposition lawmakers have accused Hwang of a series of ethical lapses during his public career, including accusations that he had illegally avoided military service in 1980 and that Hwang had illicitly meddled in recent investigations into sensitive politicized cases.Hwang had kept silent on the accusations until his hearing began Monday.“I assure you my skin disease (made me) medically designated unfit to serve (on active duty) by a medical officer,” Hwang said, in response to questions on whether he had lied about having hives.“I suffered from (hives) for 17 years after entering college,” Hwang added. “There was a rule (in 1980) saying that I had to receive three months of treatment. If it did not heal in that time I was exempt. I received up to six months of treatment but was not able to get rid of (the disease).”Opposition lawmakers also accused Hwang of meddling in the state probes into the 2012 presidential election electioneering scandal by exerting pressure as the incumbent justice minister on prosecutors to partially cover up the case, a claim that the former prosecutor denied.Former National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon is facing charges of having spread unconfirmed rumors that opposition candidates running against President Park during the 2012 election were pro-communist and pro-North Korea officials.Hwang also added that he would quit his job as the justice minister if lawmakers vote against his appointment to the Prime Minister’s Office, an unlikely possibility, as the governing party holds a majority in the legislature.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers to overrule presidential ,on monday denied allegations ,presidential decrees possibly unconstitutional ,three day confirmation hearing ,monday denied allegations","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the National Assembly', 'Hwang', 'Park Geun - hye']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15721653  0.4050577

On Monday, Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said that his ministry is also considering the establishment of a disaster hospital. “We (the ministry) do believe that the hospital is necessary. I promise to come up with specific plans,” he told the National Assembly.The hospital will function as a “control tower” in case of disasters that require large-scale medical support. Unlike other hospitals, it will have the capacity to mobilize medical staff as well as house special quarantine facilities such as negative pressure isolation rooms, critical for preventing cross-contamination from room to room. The decision came amid growing criticism over the government’s management of calamities that have occurred in the past few years.The idea for the hospital first surfaced in 2009 when H1N1 flu virus landed in Korea, but was scrapped due to budgetary constraints. It resurfaced again as a slew of emergency situations ― such as the MERS outbreak and last year’s deadly sinking of ferry Sewol ― underscored the need for state-backed medical support.In March, Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung met with Yonsei University chief Jeong Kap-young, who suggested that such a hospital should be actively considered. The two met after visiting U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert who was attacked by a leftist extremist.“Right after the Sewol accident, local health care staff had difficulty in providing medical assistance due to the lack of manpower and hospital wards,” Rep. Shin Eui-jin told local media Sunday, adding that the same problem occurred during the MERS outbreak.As of Monday afternoon, 88 people have been infected by MERS, six of whom died. A total of 2,508 people have been quarantined.

Critics say hearings frequently end up humiliating the nominee mainly over his or her past records or ethical lapses, and do not focus on the skills required for the job.

They also decided to pass relevant laws in an upcoming parliamentary session while urging the government to consider raising the MERS alert level and to better communicate with local municipalities and relevant ministries.The move came as part of lawmakers’ efforts to prioritize the outbreak during the June parliamentary session which had been widely expected to become a battlefield over the new prime minister nomination and a controversial new legislative law.“At a time of national emergency, the ruling and opposition party should join hands to dissolve the public fear and overcome the crisis,” said Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung. NPAD leader Moon Jae-in also voiced his support and said the meeting was productive. “Now we are able to relay information between the central government and local municipalities in real time. And we agreed to do the information sharing quickly and accurately. It is a huge step forward,” said Moon. NPAD had demanded the government publicize relevant MERS information to the public and share it with local authorities. The government, on the same day, disclosed the names of six hospitals with confirmed MERS cases and 18 others that MERS patients had visited.Rival parties also agreed to pass MERS-related laws in the June parliamentary session. The laws are designed to beef up measures for quarantine, refine the government’s manuals for an outbreak of diseases and formulate aid programs to the victims, according to a statement released after the meeting.They also decided to provide assistance to the MERS patients and medical workers. They will give financial aid to the patients and provide medical workers with technical assistance, such as giving to them masks and other protective gear and medical equipment.Despite commendable bipartisan agreement, rival parties have continued to quarrel over the new legislative law that empowers lawmakers to demand an amendment of government decrees. The Saenuri chief reportedly raised the issue during the meeting. He asserted that the law does not have a mandatory clause to force the government to review its decrees, but the NPAD rejected his argument. Meanwhile, the NPAD demanded the Saenuri Party postpone the scheduled parliamentary hearing of Prime Minister-designate Hwang Kyo-ahn, saying that the nominee had failed to submit relevant documents for the hearing. Saenuri Party, however, rejected the request immediately.By Yeo Jun-suk  (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","sunday to make bipartisan ,new politics alliance for ,main parties agreed sunday ,south korea main parties ,parties agreed sunday","['South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4630408   0.36352134

Parliamentary floor leaders of each party, Saenuri Rep. Yoo Seong-min, NPAD Rep.

The number of confirmed patients has steadily risen since the first patient was confirmed late last month. Those under quarantine rose to over 1,800, the Health Ministry said earlier Friday.Sunday’s gathering also comes amid escalating calls from the public that the government disclose more information regarding the MERS threat. The government has refused to publicize the name of the hospitals where MERS patients have been found except for the hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the first patient was found.“We must cooperate to come up with a plan to counter the MERS outbreak and the public fears that continue to grow,” Moon said. “The plan must be an all-out effort, including a unified team from local governments, the central government, the legislature and education ministries.”Moon also met Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil of the Saenuri Party earlier Friday to discuss possible plans to counter MERS. The outbreak has been worse in Gyeonggi Province, with over 1,000 under isolation there.“The governor and I agreed that interparty efforts are necessary and that taking care of the situation must come before we start blaming officials for incompetence,” Moon said.Kim Moo-sung, meanwhile, urged the people to be calm, saying, “Excessively dealing with MERS will be a huge loss for the country.”While attending an event in Busan, he added, “While it is true that the (government) took poor initial response, and they must be held accountable, we must also quickly remove the fears.”He urged the government to better publicize that MERS is less contagious than swine flu and that it has the similar level of fatality as pneumonia.“Our economy went through an extremely difficult time after last year’s Sewol (accident). If the fears of MERS get out of hand, the impact will be worse than Sewol by tenfold,” he said referring to the ferry sinking that claimed the lives of more than 300 passengers.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","emergency meeting on sunday ,hold an emergency meeting ,attend parliamentary floor leaders ,000 under quarantine reps ,meeting on sunday","['Kim Moo - sing', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38426593  0.07908578

Lee Jang-woo on Wednesday urged the party’s floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, to step down from his seat to take responsibility for the passage by giving in to the opposition’s demands that Cheong Wa Dae strongly opposed later as being unconstitutional.“Yoo should be held accountable,” said Lee in an interview with a local broadcaster. “Despite his title as a floor leader, he has expressed his personal views too often. He should mitigate the difference between the party and the president, but he has instead triggered the conflicts,” said Lee. The pro-Park members held a closed-door meeting Tuesday to discuss their calls for Yoo’s resignation. The argument, however, was rebuked by such members as senior member Rep. Lee Jae-oh.Lee instead said Yoo should be applauded for successfully finalizing negotiation with the opposition party.“We need to give Yoo a word of encouragement,” said Lee. “Yoo did not unilaterally passed the law. We, the supreme council, have gathered before to give endorsement to him. I understand there is controversy over the law, but what we should do first is to tell him that he did a good job,” said Lee. The former rival to President Park in the run up to the 2012 presidential candidacy, Lee also took aim at Cheong Wa Dae, saying, “Does this government even have any common sense by instigating internal conflict at such a time when it should be dealing with the (MERS spread)?” Meanwhile, Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung urged the lawmakers to stop the blame game, stressing there are no factions within the party.The latest feud, meanwhile, highlighted the ups and downs in relations between President Park and Yoo.Yoo, the third-term lawmaker, began his political career by working for Park when she was serving as the leader of Grand National Party, a forerunner to Saenuri party. He served as a top aide to support Park’s party leadership and her bid to be the party’s presidential candidate in 2007. Their relations began to sour in 2011 when Park served as chief of the party’s emergency panel. He publicly criticized Park’s positions, including her decision to change the party’s name from Grand National Party to Saenuri Party. Even though he vowed to do his “utmost” to support Park in his election to be floor leader, he has continued to clash with the president over her welfare policies, such as by dismissing a policy as a false commitment.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","ruling party factional feud ,floor leader to resign ,party factional feud ,party factional feud intensifies ,legislators to demand amendments","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Lee Jang - woo', 'Wednesda']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57293767 -0.02994992

Ahn Cheol-soo on Tuesday confirmed his plan to run in the 2017 presidential election.In a radio interview, Ahn said “of course” to a question on his bid, after repeatedly trying to dodge a direct response such as by saying, “The decision is not up to me, but the people.” Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. YonhapAhn’s confirmation signaled a looming rivalry with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, who is considered the front-runner for the party’s next presidential candidacy.The two have shared love-hate relationship since the 2012 presidential race, when independent candidate Ahn withdrew his bid and threw his support behind Moon to jointly go up against Saenuri Party candidate Park Geun-hye. Their last-minute collaboration, following a tumultuous negotiation, was considered inevitable as Moon was suffering from lagging ratings, while Ahn, a novice politician, lacked partisan backing despite his high popularity. Their ostensible partnership, however, has remained rickety as Ahn often butted heads with Moon, who became the party leader in March, over key controversial issues. Most recently, Ahn turned down Moon’s public proposal for him to lead the party’s reform after its crushing by-elections defeat. Ahn’s rejection dealt a blow to Moon, who was already facing mounting criticism from the party’s nonmainstreamers for his leadership.Later, Ahn’s associates said the former entrepreneur’s presidential bid remarks were a “theoretical” one and that no significant meaning should be placed.Ahn’s interview was carried out on the same day when the NPAD members led by Moon attended a workshop to review party reforms and policies. Ahn’s absence at the event illustrated internal discord within the party suffering from deep-rooted factional feud between former President Roh Moo-hyun’s loyalists and the non-mainstreamers.During the interview, Ahn said he turned down Moon’s offer to head the reform team because he deemed he was not fit for the post. The party leadership later picked Kim Sang-kon, former head of the Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office, to chair the committee.Ahn also took the opportunity for a swipe at Moon.“Didn’t he win the (party leadership race) by pledging reform? In order for the reform chairman to succeed, the party chairman must stand in the front and work to narrow the differences when reform ideas are met by opposition,” Ahn said.“A failure by the reform committee chair would be equivalent to a failure of the party chairman.”Latest surveys show Moon leading Ahn among the potential next presidential candidates.In the Gallup poll conducted on May 12-14, Moon received 15 percent of approval ratings, while Ahn collected 10 percent.Another survey by Realmeter on May 26-29 showed Moon leading Ahn by a larger margin with 18.3 percent against 7.7 percent.(jhl@heraldcorp.com)","confirms 2017 presidential bid ,2017 presidential bid former ,bid former presidential candidate ,2017 presidential bid ,the 2017 presidential election","['Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn', 'Ahn Cheol', 'YonhapAhn ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39666     0.25604227

It also released a list of 14 government decrees that it claimed were inconsistent with upper laws, pledging to take issue with them in a blunt rebuttal against President Park Geun-hye’s threat to veto the new parliamentary powers the day before.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy asserted that the legislature has the “legitimate” authority to demand changes to the executive’s enforcement decrees, refuting Park’s argument that the bill would “paralyze” the government’s activity. The move was expected to escalate the tension between the National Assembly and Cheong Wa Dae in the lead-up to upcoming parliamentary session. Park said Monday that she would reject the bill unless the assembly revised the bill. The rival parties passed the bill last Friday after reaching a bipartisan agreement.  Members of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy including chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in (front, right) attend a party lawmakers workshop in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)“The president doesn’t need to make a fuss out of (the bill),” said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul on Tuesday. “The National Assembly has the mechanism to verify whether the bill is right or wrong. I urge the president to trust the Assembly, so that it can do its job,” he added.On Monday, the NPAD said that it would seek changes to a total of 14 government decrees that they said undermined the legislature’s efforts by falling short of serving their intended purposes. Among them are decrees for the special Sewol law, child care subsidies and compensation for victims of the Gwangju democratic movement. The NPAD has claimed the government used the decree to bypass the law. “Those are examples of the government violation of upper laws,” said NPAD Rep. Kang Gi-jung on Monday. “If the president vetoes (the revised assembly law), it would violate democracy and reflect her views that the executive branch is beyond the Constitution,” said Kang.The ruling Saenuri Party, for its part, downplayed the forcibleness of the revised parliamentary rule, saying the government does not have an obligation to abide by the Assembly’s demand. The party pointed out the law lacks specific clauses to force the government to accept the amendments suggested by the lawmakers. “(The NPAD)’s rationale is a bit exaggerated,” said Rep. Chang Yoon-seok of Saenuri Party. “It is a critical issue as to whether a branch can force other branches to do something and, thus, the law should spell it out in specifics. Obviously, the law does not spell it out, so the NPAD is interpreting the law in its favor,” said Chang.The revision to the Assembly Law’s Clause 2 of Article 98 stipulates that the parliament can demand a revision or change to an enforcement ordinance and the head of the relevant ministry must “handle” the demand and report back with the result. Previously it had stated that in cases where an ordinance is deemed to conflict with a higher law, the parliament could notify the head of the relevant ministry.Meanwhile, the NPAD on Tuesday held a workshop to review the causes of their crushing defeat in the April by-election and discuss action plans for this month’s parliamentary session. “We attained our goals at the last parliamentary session,” said NPAD Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. “We have come up with a measure to address wrongdoings such as a decree for the Sewol bill. I am confident that we will achieve the same result in the next session,” said Moon.

(Yonhap)The president’s rejection was widely seen as indicating her intention to use her veto if no changes are made to the bill before it reaches the stage of her endorsement. It was also viewed as showing Park’s willingness to block the bill at all costs despite it being a crucial time for her to earn the cooperation of the National Assembly in getting her reform bills and the new prime minister approved.The president can constitutionally exercise a veto within the 15-day period after the parliament sends a bill to receive the president’s signature. If the president returns the bill, the parliament is required to put the bill up for vote again. To override the president‘s veto, the Assembly would require approval from more than two thirds of attending lawmakers. If it fails to meet the quorum, the bill would automatically be scrapped.Citing that similar bills in the past have failed to pass the Assembly as it was viewed as unconstitutional, Park urged the lawmakers to revise the bill.She also slammed both parties for “hastily passing” the bill in exchange for reaching a compromise on a separate reform bill on civil servants’ pension system.The controversial parliamentary law was revised in a plenary session last week as a condition to pass a reform bill on public servants’ pensions proposed by the ruling party. The bill requires government agencies to review their ordinances upon a request by the parliament. The bill was pushed by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as it was seeking for a change to the government’s decree that allows public officials to take part in an independent probe into the sinking of the Sewol ferry last year.Cheong Wa Dae instantly opposed the revision, calling it a violation of the constitutional principle that stipulates the division of powers. The bill could also infringe on the executive branch’s right to enact laws, it said. The presidential office also urged the rival parties to clarify their positions over the exact requirements set by the bill, namely the forcibleness the parties’ “demand” would have on the government enforcement ordinances.The ruling party has said the clause would only enable the lawmakers to voice their concerns over any controversial ordinance, while the opposition argued it would have a binding force for the government to make due changes upon legislative opposition. Park’s strong wordings also exposed widening cracks among the ruling camp. Saenuri lawmakers from the Pro-Park faction publicly slammed the party’s non-mainstream leaders, chairman Kim Moo-sung and floor leader Yoo Seung-min, for succumbing to the opposition’s demand at the cost of risking a violation to the Constitution.Saenuri chief Kim, for the time being, is keeping a low profile, saying that the party remains in sync with the president. “The president and the party cannot have different views,” he told reporters after a supreme council meeting. The NPAD, meanwhile, denounced Park for rejecting the bill, saying she was declaring a war against the legislature.NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in criticized the president, saying her remarks were “too much” and urged the government to draft ordinances in accordance with the law as legislated by the parliament in the future.“Legislation rights basically belong to the National Assembly. The government needs to draft an enforcement ordinance within the authority delegated by the law in the first place,“ he said.The issue drew mixed views from legal experts here with some claiming that the bill violates the Constitution because it carries legal binding power that allows the lawmakers to force the government to revise its ordinance. Officials would have no right to veto the request, they added.Law professor Lee Sang-don of Chung-Ang University in Seoul, however, said the bill does not carry unconstitutional elements because it is not about using “the legislative veto.” “The bill does not give the parliament the right or legal force to invalidate the government’s ordinances. I hardly see that the bill violates the Constitution,“ he said.

But Kim appears to be attempting to boost his credentials as a possible 2017 presidential candidate through the trip, observers commented. If confirmed, Kim’s visit to the U.S. will be his second overseas trip since taking the party chairmanship last year. In October, he visited Beijing and met Chinese President Xi Jinping.“(Conservative) party politicians (in South Korea) have gone to the U.S. before bidding for a presidential run,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University.“Presidential bid-seekers (on the right) are often interested in showing their party that they are respected internationally, especially in the U.S., as they often have the South Korea-U.S. alliance at the center of their foreign policy platform,” Choi added.Kim is expected to stop at major U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Washington. The five-term lawmaker will hold round-table meetings with leaders of the local Korean communities there and also possibly meet with senior officials of the Obama administration as well as U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and other congressional leaders in Washington, according to reports.Whether Kim will hold a meeting with U.N.

Lawmakers are also expected to lock horns over Park’s reform bills, which have remained stalled for months, as well as the controversial passage of a government decree over the Sewol probe.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has pledged a “thorough” screening of Hwang and pending bills, but the ruling Saenuri Party has vowed to block the NPAD’s attempts to “undermine” the legislative process.Lawmakers are expected to wrangle over the scope and authority of a bill that gave them the right to demand an amendment to the government enforcement decree of the special Sewol bill. The decree stipulates that a number of public officials will be a part of an independent probe into the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014.According to the revised bill, however, lawmakers are authorized to “demand” changes to a decree issued by the executive branch. The government has expressed objection to the law, saying that it would violate the rule of separation of powers.The Saenuri Party has also vowed to complete the parliament’s evaluation of the prime minister as early as possible in the upcoming session to end an administrative impasse. The post has remained vacant for more than a month since former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo stepped down under political pressure over his involvement in a bribery scandal.Hwang, the incumbent justice minister, was named the new prime minister late last month. President Park selected Hwang for the post, calling him “the best one for delivering national unity and accomplishing an administrative overhaul.”The NPAD, however, has vowed to take as much time as necessary to determine whether Hwang is the best fit for the premiership. The party has alleged that Hwang failed to report his use of business allowances to the authorities and has made politically and religiously biased remarks. “Hwang should be held accountable for the allegations against him,“ NPAD spokesperson Park Soo-hyun said Sunday. “Ever since Hwang was nominated, a series of allegations has surfaced and the public has demanded answers from him. Yet, he has refused to explain himself.”With dozens of bills pending at parliament, rival parties are expected to continue their legislative tug-of-war over economic-related bills, including a list of draft laws aiming to legalize crowdfunding, to allow large corporations to engage in subcontracting and to foster tourism and the medical industry. President Park and the Saenuri Party accused the NPAD of blocking the passage of the bills, saying they would boost the economy and create jobs. “The bills will do nothing but good for our nation,” said President Park last Wednesday. “It is not the National Assembly’s job to block young Koreans from getting help and creating their own companies. I believe the legislature’s job is to pass good bills as soon as possible,” said Park. The NPAD, however, asserted that the party would determine whether the bills would bring expected economic benefits to the nation, refuting the president’s allegations that the party has been blocking legislation of the bills.“We will determine whether the bill is in the interest of the people,” said Park. “The president and Saenuri Party will continue to make their case for economic benefits, but we will make sure to find out exactly whether the bills are truly for the people,” said Park.

Shim Jae-kwon told The Korea Herald in a recent interview. “They think that putting up something that will gain public attention, like a remembrance day, will continue that kind of strained relationship.”In April, Shim, a senior opposition member of the legislature’s foreign affairs panel, proposed a National Assembly resolution urging the U.N. to establish a comfort women remembrance day resembling the Holocaust Remembrance Day created in November 2005.The Foreign Ministry, however, expressed its concern over the bill, saying that the international body had too many memorial days and countries with victims have different positions over Japan’s sexual enslavement. New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Shim Jae-kwon. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)The term “comfort women” refers to the thousands of Asian, and some Dutch, females forced into sexual slavery by Imperial Japan in the 1930s and ‘40s. Most came from Korea and China, but there were others from the Philippines, Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia, historians have said.The issue has gained increasing attention in Korea due to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s comments hinting that senior Tokyo officials still deny that women were forced into sexual slavery.Abe’s failure to issue an explicit apology for the issue on his trip to Washington in April also reinforced such beliefs here.South Korean President Park Geun-hye cites Abe’s stance as one of the main reasons Seoul-Tokyo ties remain frosty.The foreign ministry objects to the move as calls to set up a comfort women’s remembrance day could risk alienating key U.N. members already fatigued by the issue, according to Shim.“The foreign ministry said there are already some 120 U.N.-designated anniversaries. And it said it was already difficult to organize cooperation among other comfort women victims’ countries.”Those are ridiculous reasons not to pursue a comfort women remembrance day, Shim said.“(A U.N.-backed comfort women remembrance day) is something that has a high possibility of being established, and something that could clearly express our government’s stance on the issue,” he added.The second-term lawmaker added that key disagreements between his liberal party and the conservative Saenuri Party over a North Korea human rights bill persisted. Close to 20 versions of the bill have stalled in Seoul’s unicameral parliament since 2005 due to partisan disagreements.“Let me make this clear: Our party does not oppose a North Korea human rights bill. Nor are we hesitant about writing one,” he said.“But it is our stance that the human rights bill must be a practical one ― something that genuinely enhances rights in the North, not something that worsens tensions.”The Saenuri Party and Shim’s NPAD are at loggerheads over three points, Shim said.The NPAD says the human rights bill must not be misused as a source of funds for potentially provocative activities such as the sending of anti-Kim Jong-un leaflets by activists from the South to the North.The Saenuri Party says the leaflets should be protected under the freedom of expression clause in the Constitution.The two parties are also at odds over which government bureau should be in charge of the human rights bill. The NPAD supports putting the Unification Ministry, Seoul’s main North Korea policy bureau, in charge. The Saenuri Party backs a plan dividing the many functions of the bill among multiple government organizations.The NPAD and the Saenuri Party also disagree over the use of a human rights records office to be established by the North Korea human rights bill, Shim said.The main opposition says that the records office must be put under the Unification Ministry and primarily used as an information source for policymakers.The Saenuri Party says it should be put under the Justice Ministry, and used to prosecute North Korean violators of human rights after unification. The office could also deter North Korea officials from committing more crimes, Saenuri officials have said.“I am not against penalizing North Korean officials who have violated human rights,” Shim said. “But I believe that such a role must come second to information gathering for policymaking.”“And you must remember that North Korea’s human rights issue cannot be approached purely from a humanitarian, or a philosophical point of view,” Shim said.The human rights predicament there has political ramifications in inter-Korean relations, Shim said. That makes it different from the civil rights issue in the U.S. or the aborigines’ plight in Australia, the lawmaker added.The main opposition lawmaker also expressed his opposition to possible U.S. plans to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in Korea, even if Washington decides to fund the deployment on its own.“I am not opposed to placing (THAAD) in Korea if it can block North Korean missiles. But I think THAAD is the wrong answer to intercepting North Korea weapons.“North Korea is likely to fire missiles far below the THAAD’s reach,” Shim said.“And the diplomatic cost of bringing the system here outweighs the system’s defense capabilities,” the lawmaker added, noting China and Russia’s opposition to the deployment of THAAD here.THAAD is a missile system designed to intercept incoming missiles at altitudes between 40 and 150 kilometers. U.S. officials have raised the possibility of placing the system here, although South Korean officials assert there has been no request to do so from Washington.Shim, 68, is a second-term lawmaker representing the Gangdong-gu district in eastern Seoul. The lawmaker is a former aide to the late President Kim Dae-jung. He holds a doctorate in international politics from Australia’s Monash University.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","korean main opposition lawmaker ,opposition lawmaker blasted the ,strained relations new politics ,main opposition lawmaker blasted ,opposition lawmaker blasted","['south korean', 'Japan', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Shim Jae - kwon', 'the Korea Herald']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86383414  0.49839154

(Yonhap)The parties hastily extended the on-going extra parliamentary session, originally set for closure Thursday, by one more day as their negotiations dragged on.The legislation ended months of bipartisan wrangling over the pension reform drive championed by President Park Geun-hye.Park has repeated calls for the passage of the reform bill aimed at reducing growing deficits in the civil servant pension fund as the administration pushes for reform and deregulation in a bid to invigorate the stagnant economy.The civil servant pension reform bill requires government employees to contribute 9 percent of their monthly income to their pension scheme, raising the rate from the current 7 percent over the next five years, while shaving their pension payment rate to1.7 percent from 1.9 over the next two decades. In connection with the civil servant pension move, a special National Assembly committee and a social consultation group will be established to explore ways to revamp the broader national pension fund, including whether to improve pension benefits from the fund, according to a parliamentary rule also passed in the general meeting. South Korea is facing a growing fiscal burden on its pension management due to the country's fast-aging population, the result of grim birth rates. The government warned that by next year it will be forced to use 10 billion won (US$9 million) of taxpayer money every day to backfill deficits stemming from civil service pensions unless the parliament passes the reform bill by early May.In the face of the growing urgency, the rival parties had initially agreed to pass the bill through the National Assembly in early May, but the efforts fell through due to gaps over the issue of reforming the broader public pension system.Both parties hailed the passage of the much-awaited reform bill, with ruling party leader Kim Moo-sung saying, ""I am very grateful to have come up with a successful conclusion after so much tough processes."" NPAD leader Moon Jae-in said, ""I want to praise our party for leading the proper reform that will prop up the fiscal economy while properly guaranteeing post-retirement income.Also approved in the early-morning voting session was a revised national health bill that requires tobacco sellers to put pictorial warnings about the dangers of smoking on cigarette packs.

Senior members of the Saenuri Party criticized the so-called “National Assembly Advancement Act” for blocking the passage of key draft bills such as a national pension reform bill. The law requires the approval of more than three-fifths of lawmakers to put contentious draft bills to a final vote on the floor. “The National Advancement Act is a main culprit (for the Assembly’s impasse),” said Rep. Suh Chung-won of Saenuri Party on Thursday. “I will do whatever it takes to revise the act. If necessary, we should file a constitutional appeal or revise the National Assembly law,” said Suh. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, had asserted that the accusation was an attempt to cover the governing party’s uncompromising attitudes during parliamentary negotiations. “(Saenuri Party) is shifting the blame over the assembly act,” NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jung-gul said earlier this month. “I understand there are some issues with the act, but the act itself was an agreement between us and Saenuri Party. Saenuri Party should reflect on what they have done,” said Lee. The act, introduced in 2012, aims to prevent the majority party from unilaterally attempting to bulldoze through bills, while keeping in check any attempt by a party to violently block a passage of bills. According to the act, a parliamentary speaker is not allowed to put a bill to a final vote unless there is a national emergency, an act of God or a consensus between the speaker and each party’s parliamentary representatives.Instead, the act introduced a faster legislative process for bills pending in the Legislative and Judiciary Committee, the last stop before a floor vote, for more than 120 days. The fast-track vote would take place when demanded by at least half of the attending lawmakers of a relevant committee or lawmakers of the plenary session, to be approved by three-fifths of the lawmakers in a secret ballot vote. The act, widely hailed at the time as a step towards an improved parliamentary culture, was expected to foster committee-level dialogue and trade-offs among lawmakers. Some members of the Saenuri Party, many of whom also expressed doubt over the efficacy at the time, blamed the act for obstructing the legislative process because it requires the consensus of three-fifths of lawmakers to bring key draft bills to the floor. They asserted the provision is unconstitutional. Some party members filed a constitutional appeal to the court in January. According to the Korea constitution, majority rule shall be applied at the National Assembly unless otherwise stated in the law or Constitution.Experts gave mixed views to the act’s constitutionality. “The act agrees with the balance of power principle,” said Lee Sang-don, legal professor at Chung-Ang University, in an op-ed to a local daily. “The rationale for (the act) is based on the principle, so is the president’s right to veto,” he said.Shin-yul, a political professor at Myongji University, on the other hand, said, “The bill could be unconstitutional.” “But I doubt whether the National Assembly would be fully functional. I am not sure if there is sufficient legislative mechanism to hear the minority voices,” said Shin. The public is squarely divided on the effectiveness of the act. According to a Gallup poll conducted from May 19 to 21 involving 1,400 adults, 42 percent of respondents said they approved the revision of the act, while 41 percent opposed the revision, well within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

The party has been beset by factional feuds since its crushing defeats in the April by-elections. “From this moment on, there are no such things as factions and interests,” said Kim. “I strongly demand the party members stop holding factional meetings. The panel will not tolerate any attempts to sabotage our reform drive,” said Kim. Kim Sang-kon. (Yonhap)NPAD leader Moon Jae-in showed his support by echoing Kim’s remarks at Wednesday’s supreme council meeting. He said Kim would successfully spearhead the party’s overhaul the same way as he had done while serving as education chief.Kim was elected as a superintendent of Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office in 2009. He was thrown into limelight as he defied then-president Lee Myung-bak’s conservative education policy and won the election. It was the first direct vote by residents in Gyeonggi Province.Kim, a strong advocate of liberal education policy, implemented free meal policy for all students, irrespective of their family’s income level. The policy caused a stir among conservative policymakers. A labor expert and a former university professor, he also focused on preparing policies to improve students’ rights. During his tenure, he laid out a so-called “student human right ordinance” to ban corporal punishments and hair length limitation. NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Chong-gul gave credit to Kim’s leadership when he reportedly first proposed the post to him. He said on Friday Kim enjoyed wide support across the region and had strong commitment to reform. After being reelected in 2010 for Gyeonggi Province superintendent, Kim became an NPAD member. He resigned from the post in 2014 to run for the governorship of Gyeonggi Province but failed as he lost party nomination.Experts said that Kim would serve his post better even though he is not an elected lawmaker. “The fact that Kim is not a lawmaker will help him in the long term,” said Chung Hae-gu, political professor at Sungkonghoe University.“NPAD members should not sabotage Kim’s leadership. If they keep questioning whether he is the right one, the reform will fizzle out as it had done before several times,” Chung said.

They are written by the government as part of the final steps of the legislative process.The NPAD’s protest focused on the decree for the special Sewol bill, a law creating a government-sponsored probe into the Sewol ferry disaster of April last year when a ferry sinking in the West Sea left 304 dead.Victims’ families had voiced concern that the Park Geun-hye administration would likely meddle in the investigations by placing officials on the probe team’s top executive board, in accordance with the special Sewol bill’s enforcement decree.The NPAD also earlier demanded that the Saenuri Party do “something to guarantee” Moon’s exclusion from future pension debates in the parliament. The NPAD charges Moon with disrupting the assembly’s pension debates by making “factually erroneous” comments earlier this month.“There’s no telling what Moon will say to disrupt talks again,” NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said on a local radio show on Wednesday. “The governing party must guarantee that the welfare minister will not be able to make provocative public statements in the future.”The welfare minister had likened NPAD proposals on raising the national pension’s income replacement rate to 50 percent, from the current 40, to “pirating,” earlier this month. The income replacement rate is a coefficient multiplied by lifetime average income levels for pensioners. The higher the rate, the higher the pension for beneficiaries.Moon had reasoned that raising the rate of the national pension, without raising taxes, would inevitably lead to tax hikes for future generations.The NPAD disagreed with Moon’s statements, saying the National Pension Service, the public institution managing the national pension, would be able to give increased allowances to pensioners with only a minimal tax hike on today’s taxpayers. The welfare minister, a former pension expert at a public think tank, declined to retract his comments Wednesday.“I have not made a factual error. I will stand by my words,” Moon said, refusing to apologize.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, repeated its disagreements on muting the welfare minister. But Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min offered a compromise deal to the NPAD, in which Moon would “express regret.”Negotiations continued throughout the day.The reforms to the civil service are aimed at reducing the public debt. Aggregate debt levels of public companies amount to about 520.5 trillion won ($470 billion) while total government debt, the sum of central and local government debts, stands at about 570 trillion won, the latest Finance Ministry tallies showed.The parties have made agreements on other outstanding issues. The NPAD earlier Wednesday agreed to retrieve its stranglehold on some 50 draft bills it had withheld from plenary voting. They include a bill legalizing anti-smoking images on cigarette packs, a bill legalizing crowdfunding and a bill aiming to boost investment for private equity funds.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","political parties agreed wednesday ,democracy protest against government ,officials day before lawmakers ,reform bill lowering pension ,bill lowering pension allowances",['New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3799372   0.05152499

The majority ruling party hopes that the bill will be put to a final vote at a plenary session set for Thursday, Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min said.But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which has been reluctant to the degree of reform proposed by the government, could hold the bill from a final vote using the parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee. The committee chair, NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, can block bills from going to a plenary vote.Lee is likely to keep the reform bill on hold unless the Saenuri Party gives in to the NPAD demand that the parliament submit a request for removal of Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo to President Park Geun-hye, NPAD lawmakers said. The Saenuri party has balked at the proposal.NPAD officials accuse the minister of making groundless arguments against the party’s stance on pension reforms.The minister opposes the opposition’s proposals to raise annuities of the national pension scheme, which covers most taxpayers. The minister earlier this month called the NPAD proposal “pirating” from future generations, as the increase would hike the national tax burden.Moon said the NPAD’s idea of raising pension annuities without raising contributions from taxpayers now would increase taxes on future generations.The NPAD called the minister’s remarks inflammatory and stated that they were based on bad information.Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung repeated his reluctance to consider the main opposition’s demands against Moon earlier Tuesday.“I just don’t understand. If you keep adding new negotiating points on top of the agreements (the parties) have made (on the civil service pension), it keeps those agreements stalled in the National Assembly,” he said.“We have to pass (civil service pension reforms) as soon as possible.”President Park also urged the main opposition to agree to pass the civil service pension reform bill at a Cabinet meeting.“I plead with lawmakers to pass the reform bill this week,” she said. “If such an option is impossible, I plead that they at least pass bills targeting youth unemployment,” she added, in reference to bills that aim to boost the economy by encouraging entrepreneurship, among others.The proposed changes to the civil service pension will save the government 333 trillion won ($303 billion) over the next 70 years, tallies by a nonpartisan expert panel of local university professors showed.Critics assert though the tallies do not consider possibilities such as improved healthcare elongating the lives of retired civil servants and the expansion of the civil service.The NPAD and the Saenuri Party have been at loggerheads over the reforms. The NPAD has demanded that the civil service pension reforms be linked to revisions that would increase annuities from the national pension. The Saenuri Party is against the idea, and supports discussing national pension reforms after passing the civil service pension reforms this week.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers on tuesday ,its lawmakers on tuesday ,lawmakers on tuesday the ,thursday saenuri floor leader ,session set for thursday","['South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Floor', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'New Politics Alliance']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36979493  0.43929633

The New Politics Alliance for Democracy said Sunday that Kim Sang-kon, the former chief of Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office, would chair the “innovation committee,” a reform body to overhaul the party, which has been beset by factional confrontations since its defeat in the April by-elections.Kim, 63, will exercise full authority to lead the reforms, party officials said. He will organize panels on the reform committee and oversee the process of nominating candidates for the next general election. Both were seen as thorny issues that would likely worsen infighting. “I agree with some people saying my position will be a poisoned chalice,” said Kim on Sunday during his acceptance speech. “But somebody should step up and do the job. I gave the proposal a lot of thought and finally decided to accept it.”The NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in vowed to give Kim his full support in his task. In an interview after talks with Seoul Mayor Park Woon-soon late Sunday afternoon, he told reporters that the party agreed to grant Kim “virtually” unfettered discretion on party reform. Moon also urged him to end factional infighting and create a fair nomination process for the next general election. Moon has been accused by nonmainstream party members of inciting factional feuds and failing to address conflicts during the nomination process for the April by-elections.Kim accepted the chairmanship a week after the party announced a plan to launch the reform committee. The chair has been left vacant since Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the former cochair of the NPAD, rejected the post. Among other candidates, Seoul National University professor Cho guk was discussed as an alternative to Ahn. However, NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul raised objections and instead proposed Kim, saying the committee chair should have ties to the party. Kim is a party member. “He has solid understanding of what is going on inside the party,” said Lee on Friday. “Besides, he has enjoyed wide support across different regions and built extensive networks while serving as a university professor. That is why (I) offered him the post.” Kim, a former university professor and a prominent labor expert, was elected as Gyeonggi education superintendent in 2010 and served until 2014. He advocated for a liberal school system and free meals for all students, irrespective of how well-off they were, defying former President Lee Myung-bak’s conservative education policy.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","opposition party on sunday ,election the new politics ,sunday named the chair ,rebuild the party ahead ,factional feuds and rebuild","['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim Sang - kon', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Education Office']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72995502  0.1032589

Kim Moo-sung a political opportunist in a sarcastic speech Saturday at a service commemorating his father’s death in 2009.The senior Roh killed himself amid a politicized graft probe targeting his family, largely pushed for by conservatives such as Kim. Roh had rightly vouched for his father, supporters said. But critics of the late president said Roh had wrongfully attacked a conservative who attended the service in good faith. Kim was the first conservative party chairman to attend the memorial service of the liberal Roh.But the domestic debate surrounding Roh’s Saturday speech seemed to miss the point. Roh’s speech wasn’t about hitting back, although the junior Roh did little to conceal his hatred for Kim. Whatever his true intentions, and whichever political inclinations it belied, Roh’s words were echoed by many regardless of their political standing.Ultimately, it was more of a request to Kim ― a leading contender for the presidency in 2017 ― or the current administration, to think of the bigger picture, amid an ever-changing Northeast Asian order triggered by a rising China, a revisionist Japan, a nervous U.S., and an unpredictable, nuclear-armed North Korea.Roh began his speech by sarcastically thanking Kim for “making the difficult trip” to attend the event. He then accused Kim of falsely calling President Roh a pro-North Korean politician to woo centrist and conservative voters during the 2012 presidential race.But the words that followed these initial expressions were what mattered.“Please don’t take my words the wrong way,” Roh said. “I am not asking for an apology. Nor am I asking for words of contrition.”“I am merely asking you to consider the reality. The reality that we are surrounded by more powerful countries,” he added. “A leader who uses ideology and regional domestic rivalries to divide and conquer votes for political power cannot lead.”“China has risen high during the past three decades. Nothing says we cannot fall just as swiftly in the next 30 years,” Roh said. “Please think of the larger picture.”Roh appeared to touch on Korea’s history of becoming the unwanted center of great power struggles in Northeast Asia, often fought between a rising power and an established one. Those wars were often fought in Korea, due to the absence of a balanced foreign policy able to convince opposing powers that Korea would stay neutral.That absence, in turn, was based on factionalist politics, not unlike the politics of modern Korea, where differences of opinion are shelved as either “ultraconservative” or “pro-North Korean.”In 1592, Korea was invaded by an assertive Japan with ambitions of conquering China’s Ming Dynasty. In 1627 and 1636, the Manchus, the immediate forefathers of China’s Qing Dyansty, invaded Korea, to force them to their side against the Mings, the then-most powerful Asian nation.The first Sino-Japanese War, fought for influence over Korea between the dominant power at the time, the Qings, and a swiftly rising Imperial Japan in 1894-5, resulted in more Korean civilian deaths than those of the main combatants.These conflicts were preceded by factionalist domestic politics in Korea. Before the 1592 Japanese invasions, officials were split between those arguing a Japanese invasion was imminent and those arguing against. These arguments were based more on party loyalty than on deep, discerning analyses.Before the 1627 and 1636 Manchu invasions, Korean politicians were similarly split between factions supporting the Mings and those supporting the Qings. Again, these loyalties had more relevance in domestic political affiliations than insightful foreign policy thinking.In 1894, Korean leaders were split into the pro-Japanese, the pro-Qing, the pro-West and the pro-Russian factions.Today, Korea is likewise split into the left and right, into the liberals and the conservatives. Differences of political opinions are shunned, rather than embraced.Korea is facing a growing security and foreign policy dilemma. Its dependence on China for exports and animosity toward Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s revisionist views on World War II draws Seoul closer to Beijing. But Seoul’s security requirements against Pyongyang compel South Korean officials to stay under the U.S. security umbrella, and appease Washington officials.Roh’s speech has a point. Factionalist politics will only worsen this dilemma. A relatively united Korea on the other hand will be free to design a well-thought foreign policy, able to implement a subtle but effective balancing act.

Calls have been mounting for the New Politics Alliance for Democracy to undertake party reforms ahead of the general elections next year. The party decided to form a “Panel for Innovation,” but it was struggling to find a suitable figure to lead the committee.“Chairman Moon Jae-in officially proposed (Kim) to accept the chairman post of the reform committee today,” NPAD spokesperson Kim Sung-soo said. “Kim told him that he needs more time to consider the offer. We believe that he will give the answer no later than Sunday,” he said. Kim, 65, was elected as Gyeonggi education superintendent in 2010 and served until 2014. Having worked as a university professor and a labor expert, he advocated a liberal school system and free-meal initiative, defying the former President Lee Myung-bak’s conservative education policy.“I anticipate a positive outcome,” said Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader of NPAD. “I was told that NPAD chairman Moon Jae-in met Kim last night and shared a common understanding. I think the result will come out by the end of Friday.” The move came two days after Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo rejected the same proposal. The former cochair of the NPAD said that it would be “inappropriate” for him to assume the post even though he shared the need for the panel.The rejection has dealt a blow to NPAD’s efforts to regroup itself after the April by-election defeats and the ensuing factional infighting. The party set up the reform panel last week, but they have failed to find the right person to chair it. Among the likely candidates were Cho Guk, professor at Seoul National University. As a prominent advocate of liberal values, he enjoys popularity among left-wing supporters who often asked him to join politics. He has rejected the offers. “Kim is much better than me in every sense of the word,” Cho wrote on Twitter. “I have respected Kim for being reform-minded and fair-minded. I sincerely hope he will play a significant role in the party.” In an interview with a local TV network on Monday, Cho said he would assume the panel chairmanship under the condition that he agreed to the party’ overhaul plan and received corresponding authority to do his job. But Rep. Lee expressed his objection to Cho on Thursday, saying that a party insider would better serve the chairmanship than an outsider. He asserted that insiders were more knowledgeable about the party’s affairs and could help contribute to the unity.

Prime Minister nominee Hwang Kyo-ahn answers reporters’ questions at the Gwacheon Government Complex in Gwacheon, South of Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)“Hwang has a deep understanding of the president’s philosophy on state management, and is the right man to build a new Republic of Korea by eradicating corruptive practices and achieving political reform,” said Senior Press Secretary Kim Sung-woo.“Now we need to root out corruption and irregularities that have been tolerated from the past in order to revive the economy and achieve sustainable development.”Shortly after the announcement, Hwang vowed to propel social integration and embrace vulnerable members of society.“I will do my best to uphold the people’s wishes, with an understanding that taking care of the socially weak is also a crucial national task while achieving people’s harmony and social integration,” the nominee said at a press conference.The nomination of a prime minister requires parliamentary endorsement. Hwang is expected to go through a tough confirmation session within two weeks with the opposition party already resisting Park‘s nomination.Born in 1957, Hwang spent more than 30 years serving as a public prosecutor. He has held key posts within the prosecution throughout his career and has served as the justice minister since the Park administration began in early 2013.Though he was approved by the parliament to take the justice minister’s post two years ago, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is also expected to take issue with his expertise in public security.“President Park Geun-hye naming minister Hwang is an overt declaration that she would reign over the country with a public security-focused (government),” NPAD senior spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok. The opposition lawmaker claimed that Hwang’s past career went against the efforts of democratization by curbing opposition forces, and that he was not fit to be prime minister, a role that must bring the people together and revive the economy.The staunch constitutionalist, who has been advocating a need for early education of the Constitution, is well known for his public security-focused career at the prosecution. While serving as the justice minister, Hwang spearheaded the arrest of former leftist lawmaker Lee Seok-ki and the dissolution of his party for supporting the North Korean regime. He, as justice minister, was also in the position of handling the ongoing prosecution’s investigation into the eight politicians involved in the Sung Won-jong scandal. Hwang is also likely to face questions over allegations that he received preferential treatment in courts and also a large income while working as a senior attorney upon finishing his service as civil prosecutor.Park’s press secretary also said that the president would pick a new justice minister to replace Hwang as soon as he gets the parliamentary approval.“The nomination of justice minister will proceed through the necessary legal and political procedures, and it won’t be delayed,” he said, adding that the procedures would begin only after the P.M. nominee was able to officially take the post.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","new president park geun ,thursday nominated justice minister ,new prime minister calling ,new president park ,the new prime minister","['Park Geun - hye', 'Justice', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Lee Wan - koo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80371648  0.57586443

Kim Moo-sung decided to leave, a decision that prompted debate here between those sympathetic to the five-term lawmaker, and those who criticized him for not understanding diplomatic affairs.Indian officials had invited Kim to the meeting with Modi on Tuesday afternoon. But they left him waiting, as Modi was running late due to an earlier meeting with Indian expats here.As the wait grew longer, Indian officials proposed that Kim meet Modi at the sidelines of the premier’s meeting with Indians here, for a brief photoshoot, instead of the prescheduled one-on-one meeting.Kim refused, saying the request went against diplomatic protocol.“It does not fit in with diplomatic protocol that the chief of a country’s ruling party is treated this way,” Kim said.But the Saenuri Party chairman later added that it was understandable for Modi to be on a tight schedule as he was here for “only two days.” Kim also said the Indian embassy’s frontline staff had likely made scheduling mistakes.Modi arrived in Korea on Monday before leaving on Tuesday.Kim’s critics blasted him, saying that Modi, the leader of a nation, outranked Kim, who was a chief of a political party.A South Korean foreign ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity added support to critics.“Indian staff likely made scheduling errors.

Park approved Cho’s resignation Monday. Cho cited her failure to persuade parties to pass the civil service pension reforms.Cho’s sudden resignation stoked speculation that the former gender equality minister was preparing to run in next year’s general election.Cho Yoon-sun. (Yonhap)Her close ties to Park supported rumors that the president would be unlikely to dump Cho. Cho was Park’s spokeswoman in early 2013, and served as her gender equality minister before being picked as the first female political affairs secretary to the president last June.Praised for her gentle yet effective communication style, the lawyer-turned-politician’s political career saw smooth sailing despite her serving only one parliamentary term between 2008 and 2012. Cho failed to earn the party’s nomination for the general elections in 2012, but returned to spotlight when Park picked Cho as her spokesperson during the campaign and presidential transition period. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, called Cho’s resignation a de facto sacking, and a gesture of the president’s determination to have her way in the proposed reforms. Cho’s removal was deliberately timed to pressure the NPAD to agree to the reform plans, they said.“Reports said Ms. Cho resigned. But it was sacking, no matter how you look at it,” NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul said early Tuesday.“Keeping the welfare minister at his post while removing a nominal secretary that even ruling party officials say had no fault in the (stalled pension reforms) is, in effect, a threat against the National Assembly,” Lee added. NPAD Reps. Lee Seok-hyun (left) and Lee Jong-kul (right). (Yonhap)Park, her Saenuri Party and the NPAD have been locked in a cat-and-mouse political game over the reforms that aim to vastly downsize pensions dealt out to retired civil servants. Reforms backers say the pension has enlarged the public debt by as much as 524 trillion won ($480 billion). Leaders of the main parties agreed earlier this month to pass Park’s reform plans. But the deal also included NPAD-backed measures to strengthen the national pension ― a public scheme for almost all taxpayers.President Park expressed her objection to the compromise. Her gesture pressured the Saenuri Party to ditch the agreement, creating the current impasse, Park critics said.Cho’s Monday resignation was timed to add pressure on lawmakers to “get on with” the president’s demands, which do not include reforms to the national pension and the basic pension, some analysts said.“I don’t know what (the president) is thinking, but I would advise her to step into the negotiations herself instead of adding unnecessary pressure on lawmakers to agree to her demands,” said Chung Jin-min, professor of politics at Myongji University.“If someone had to be fired, it shouldn’t have been the senior secretary for political affairs,” Chung added. “Cho is under the command of Presidential Chief of Staff (Lee Byung-kee) and ultimately President Park herself.”Another observer cautioned against making “unnecessarily broad” interpretations of Cho’s resignation based on unconfirmed rumors.“Park’s removal of Cho is not a threat against anyone. I think that the removal was due to Cho’s perceived inability to communicate the president’s stance to the ruling party negotiators at the front lines,” said Yang Seung-ham, professor of Korean politics at Yonsei University. The chief reason that the pension remains stalled is due to 2012 amendments to the National Assembly Act that allow the main opposition to indefinitely stall legislation, using its position as the party in charge of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, Yang said.The committee chair, NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, reserves the right to keep draft bills from going to a main vote.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","presidential aide resignation worsened ,top presidential aide resignation ,korea top lawmakers struggled ,aide resignation worsened tensions ,worsened tensions on tuesday","['Korea', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Cho ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48176584  0.55618799

Cho Yoon-sun. (Yonhap)Cho’s sudden resignation came amid heavy wrangling among the rival parties over the conditions to be attached to the bill. Cho in her statement stressed that the reform bill was a matter that should have been approached “regardless of political gains.” “I feel a grave sense of responsibility for disappointing the president and failing to prevent the reform process from being distorted.”Cho was named to the post in June when Cheong Wa Dae was facing a deepening partisan feud after a series of Park’s failed nominations for a new prime minister. Before the post, she served as the Park administration’s first minister for gender and equality.Cho has been one of Park’s most entrusted aides since the 2012 presidential campaign, accompanying Park on most of her campaign trails as her spokeswoman. Cho, a lawyer-turned-politician, entered politics in 2002 as a spokesperson for Lee Hoi-chang, former chief of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the Saenuri Party. She won her first parliamentary seat in 2008, but failed to receive the party’s nomination for the 2012 general elections.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","aide quits over pension ,park political aide quits ,political aide quits over ,political aide quits ,monday accepted the resignation","['Park Geun - hye', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Cho']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46526927  0.13485681

Moon Jae-in seeks to devise “innovation plans” through panel discussions sometime next month, party officials said.  Rep. Moon Jae-in (right), the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, shakes hands with his fellow party member Rep. Chung Sye-kyun at a wedding ceremony for Chung’s son in the National Assembly complex on Sunday. (Yeo Jun-suk/The Korea Herald.)At the panel, party officials will discuss the conflict-laden party’s personnel overhaul, ways to ensure transparency and fairness in the candidate nominations for the general election and other reforms.The officials have not yet decided whether an outsider will lead the panel and how to fairly reflect the voices of all competing party factions in the reform process, NPAD officials explained. “The basic aim of the (innovation committee) will be to defuse tensions among the party’s factions,” NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo told reporters. “We agreed that the party must finish forming this panel as soon as possible.” The latest reform efforts came amid a worsening factional crisis in the NPAD.Moon has failed to tackle feuds between the party’s leading faction, the “pro-Rohs,” political proteges of the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, and another crucial group ― the “non-Rohs.” The latter group holds the pro-Rohs liable for recent election losses and dwindling public support. Moon, who served as Roh’s presidential chief of staff, is widely seen as the leader of the pro-Roh faction. He was elected to the party’s top post in February, defeating non-Roh rivals Reps. Park Jie-won and Lee In-young.The non-Rohs want Moon to resign to “take responsibility” for the party’s defeats in the April 29 parliamentary by-elections. Moon has refused, accusing the non-Rohs of initiating a power struggle within the party.The ruling Saenuri Party won three of the four contested regions, including a constituency in Seoul long considered a safe liberal seat. The NPAD won none, even losing to independent candidate Chun Jung-bae in Gwangju, another voting district the party was expected to win.The Saenuri Party’s wins also came in spite of ongoing prosecutorial probes on leading ruling bloc officials accused of graft. The corruption charges were expected to sway public opinion against the NPAD. But the comprehensive defeats sparked blame-trading between the non-Rohs and pro-Rohs.The factions continued their feud online over the weekend.“Even baseball managers take responsibility for defeats,” Park wrote on his Facebook account on Saturday, criticizing Moon’s objection to calls to surrender his chairmanship.“We are getting further and further away from winning the next presidential race,” Park added. “Losing (in elections) leads to division (among the party’s factions), which in turn leads to more losses.”Pro-Roh Rep. Kim Kyung-hyub tweeted his objections to the accusations calling them of being “hegemonic” on Friday.“Hegemony means violently, unilaterally, taking someone else’s things. I find the (non-Rohs’) accusations groundless.”Moon left for the southwestern city of Gwangju later Sunday to prepare for ceremonies commemorating the 35th anniversary of the May-18 Gwangju protests. Citizens there in 1980 clashed with paratroopers backing ex-President Chun Doo-hwan, leaving hundreds dead.Before leaving Seoul, Moon also reportedly reviewed plans proposing to devolve the party leadership’s authority to senior party officials of opposing factions. He also repeated plans to privately visit senior non-Roh lawmakers demanding his resignation.By Jeong Hunny and Yeo Jun-suk(hj257@heraldcorp.com) (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","opposition party on sunday ,next april general election ,party on sunday decided ,weekend npad chair rep ,party on sunday","['Korea', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Supreme Council', 'npad', 'Moon Jae']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62816715  0.13921815

Moon Jae-in, chair of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, to suspend Rep. Jung Cheong-rae from the party’s top decision-making body, aims to address the negative public attention since Jung’s statements last Friday, observers said.Jung has faced severe public criticism since he accused NPAD Rep. Joo Seung-yong of trying to trying to cause friction within the party. Rep. Jung Cheong-rae. (Yonhap)“I have decided to give Rep. Jung some time to spend alone,” Moon said.“This is a de facto suspension on (Jung’s) activities within the party,” NPAD Rep. Yoo Eun-hae, a party spokesperson, said. “(Wednesday’s) decision to (suspend Jung) was a unanimous decision among members of the Supreme Council,” Yoo added.Jung, famous for posting critical comments against fellow lawmakers on Twitter and Facebook, vowed to remain quiet in the coming weeks.Mainstream media and old-guard NPAD lawmakers asserted that his words had sparked unnecessary infighting in the main opposition party.Jung accused Joo of “blackmailing” the party in front of news cameras after Joo had repeated his intent to resign from the party’s Supreme Council to “take responsibility” for the crushing defeats in the April parliamentary by-elections.The ruling Saenuri Party had unexpectedly trounced the NPAD in polls, winning in three of the four contested districts. The NPAD did not win any seat.“Threatening to resign while not actually resigning is the same as blackmailing the party,” Jung had said. Adding, “Stop sabotaging the unity of this party and join efforts to rebuild it before next year’s general elections.”Joo resigned immediately afterward, denying the accusations.Jung ignored calls from party officials and local media to apologize, although he urged his colleague to return to the council.Later in the week Jung posted comments on social networking sites boasting that his supporters had sent more political donations to him after he had made the strong statements.But his apparent lack of remorse angered NPAD officials. Junior NPAD officials filed a formal protest against Jung to the party’s ethics committee on Tuesday. Rep. Kim Dong-cheol, a third term lawmaker, also threatened to exit the party if no action was taken. NPAD Rep.

He is the second of the eight politicians to be grilled by the prosecution over the burgeoning graft scandal. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo was questioned by investigators for 17 hours last week. Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-kooThe nation’s former second-in-command has been one of the primary targets in the graft scandal touched off by Sung’s posthumous disclosure made via an interview with a local daily shortly before his death.The scandal involves several of President Park Geun-hye’s confidents and members of the ruling Saenuri Party.In the face of political pressure and public resentment, Lee quit his post last month. He has become one of the shortest-reigning premiers in the country’s history.Before stepping down, Lee denied allegations saying that he would take his own life if found guilty. The ex-premier also claimed that he and Sung were not even close.Despite his repeated denial of wrongdoings, the public became skeptical as evidence overturning his claims emerged. Phone records showed that the two had made calls to each other more than 200 times a year. Authorities have been working to verify whether Lee had a private meeting with Sung at his election campaign office in 2013 when he was running for a parliamentary seat, and if the supposed illegal transaction did take place. Last week, they called in Lee’s former driver who told local media that he witnessed the meeting. A volunteer from Lee’s camp was also questioned as a witness, as well as Sung’s former driver and his secretary who are believed to have accompanied Sung on the visit.Investigators have acquired toll gate records of Sung’s car that implies he visited Lee’s office at the cited time, along with testimonies from the businessman’s former aides, according to sources.Prior to calling Lee in for questioning, the prosecution is expected to summon his former aide who allegedly attempted to pressure Lee’s former driver not to give unfavorable testimonies. Meanwhile, Gov. Hong on Tuesday continued to claim his innocence via social media and press conferences. Hong said Monday that the money suspected to be an illegal political fund from Sung was actually raised by his wife, who secretly pooled the special allowance he had received as a floor leader of the ruling party. Hong’s explanation, however, sparked criticism that the money ― once mounting to 300 million won ― was not reported to the authorities, coupled with attacks from the opposition that he embezzled government funds.He refuted by saying he had no knowledge of what he called his wife’s “secret fund” prior to the investigation, and that the talks of embezzlement was “absurd” since the special allowance is essentially part of his salary as a floor leader.On Sung’s claim that he gave him 100 million won to be nominated as a parliamentary candidate, Hong said it was not even enough to be nominated as a candidate for a provincial council. “Someone came up to me (in 2004) and offered 500 million won for a nomination. When I told him ‘they used to give 2 billion,’ the person immediately offered me 2 billion,” he said in a press conference Monday.But the comment induced new criticism from the opposition that the nominations process for the ruling party is tainted with bribes.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","eight politicians before killing ,businessman officials said tuesday ,prosecutorial summons on thursday ,politicians before killing himself ,thursday former prime minister","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37111482  0.44963232

Jung Cheong-rae over his verbal attacks last week, revealing the deepening intraparty division.Jung is at the center of an intensifying factional feud as he accused his colleague Rep. Joo Seung-yong of “blackmailing” the party while trading blame over the defeats in the April parliamentary by-elections. “As a senior member of the party, Jung made comments that that he should not have,” said the members in their request delivered to the party’s ethics committee. People who filed the petition are reportedly non-mainstream members, raising speculation that their actions were taken to confront the pro-Roh faction within the party. Jung criticized Joo, at a public meeting on Friday, for “blackmailing” the party, saying that he was issuing empty threats to step down from his position at the NPAD Supreme Council. He added that Joo was undermining the party’s unity amid falling approval ratings after the electoral defeats. The attack followed Joo’s demand that Rep. Moon Jae-in step down as party chairman to take responsibility for the defeats. Infuriated by Jung’s remark, Joo walked away from the meeting and said he would resign from his post as a supreme council member. NPAD chair Moon apologized for the incident, saying it was an embarrassment for the party. Despite Jung’s efforts to meet Joo to apologize, he could not.The party’s ethics committee said it would start looking into the facts and decide later whether to begin an investigation.“We are trying to verify the relevant facts regarding the case,” Rep. Kang Chang-il, chairman of NPAD ethics committee said.“Once we complete the fact-checking process, we will take necessary steps such as giving (Jung) a chance to make his case,” he said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","feud deepens over verbal ,verbal attacks last week ,blackmailing the party while ,party lawmaker rep jung ,npad feud deepens over","['Jung Cheong - rae', 'Jung', 'Joo Seung - yong']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60501117  0.09756305

Jung Cheong-rae and Joo Seung-yong of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy gave no reason for their absence. They had exchanged heated words last Friday, continuing to trade blame over the party’s defeats in the April parliamentary by-elections.NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in apologized for the incident.“Last Friday’s brawl was an embarrassment. How can we criticize the Park Geun-hye administration if we fail to show unity, and fail to gain the trust of our citizens?” Rep. Moon Jae-in (center), chair of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, speaks at the party’s morning meeting, Monday. (Yonhap)Analysts said the Jung-Joo altercation represents a fight between the NPAD’s two main factions, as Jung and Joo are senior members of the pro-Rohs and the non-Rohs, respectively.How the feud ends will affect which faction comes out with more clout in the party. How fast the feud ends will affect the NPAD’s public approval ratings, and its ability to compete with the ruling Saenuri Party on policy issues, such as the public service pension reforms, observers said.The clash began after Joo repeated his desire to resign from the party’s Supreme Council last week. Joo had urged other council members to resign, especially Moon, the leader of the pro-Rohs, in order to “take responsibility” for the party’s losses in all four of the April 29 by-elections.Analysts had expected the NPAD to win in the by-elections, due to ongoing prosecutorial investigations into leading ruling bloc figures accused of taking bribes. But Jung called Joo’s criticism “blackmail” that threatened to destroy the party’s unity amid falling approval ratings and the electoral defeats.Joo marched out of the meeting room after the brawl and has since been at his home in Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. On Monday, Joo turned away Jung who had traveled to Yeosu to meet Joo, refusing to meet him.“I will not retrieve my resignation letter,” Joo said after his refusal to meet Jung.Moon and most of the pro-Roh group have faced heavy criticism for the April 29 electoral defeat. Joo and the non-Rohs accused them of pursuing “divisive” and “factionalist” party politics, by dominating the party’s key posts, and excluding other factions.“Joo’s comments last week represented the brewing dissatisfaction of the pro-Roh led party leadership,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University.The pro-Rohs is a group of NPAD lawmakers who began their political careers during the Roh Moo-hyun administration. The faction is the NPAD’s dominant group. Moon is the faction’s de facto leader.Joo is a senior member of the non-Rohs, a coalition of NPAD lawmakers who oppose the pro-Rohs. Most trace their political roots to those who began their careers under ex-President Kim Dae-jung and other South Korean liberals based in the Jeolla region. The feud between the party’s leading groups has contributed to the party’s falling ratings, one analyst said.“There are many voters who are against the Park Geun-hye administration and the governing Saenuri Party,” said Chung Jin-min, professor of politics at Myongji University in Seoul.“But that doesn’t mean they will start supporting the NPAD if the main opposition fails to offer policy alternatives to voters,” he added.The ongoing in-house feud is impeding efforts within the NPAD to design policies that can compete with those of Park and the Saenuri Party, experts said.“Having factions and ensuing feuds within a large party is natural,” Chung said. The NPAD is South Korea’s No. 2 party with 130 of the country’s 298 lawmakers under its banner. The Saenuri Party has 160 legislators.“But Korean politics is too figure-based. The factionalist infighting between the pro-Rohs, largely supporters of Moon, and the non-Rohs, largely those against him, is causing an unproductive chain of events that prevents the NPAD from coming up with policy alternatives to the ruling bloc,” Chung added.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","verbal fight last week ,monday following verbal fight ,month election whitewash reps ,fight last week ,fight last week highlighting","['Jung Cheong - rae', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45678928  0.26436689

But the partisan standoff over the pension reform bill is likely to be a stumbling block as the rival parties continued to wrangle over the conditions to be attached to the bill.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min on Sunday said he would “respect” an agreement made by party leaders on the bill. But he didn’t elaborate on whether the ruling party would accept the opposition’s demand.Last week, parties failed to pass the bill as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded that the revision explicitly state that the income-replacement rate of the national pension would be raised to 50 percent, from the current 40 percent. The income-replacement rate is the figure multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income.The ruling Saenuri Party rejected the demand in the face of fierce criticism from Cheong Wa Dae, making a U-turn from its agreement with the opposition party to affiliate the issue of raising the payout rates to the bill. Saenuri Party Floor Leader Yoo Seung-min (left) shakes hands with Lee Jong-kul, newly-elected counterpart of New Politics Alliance for Democracy at the National Assembly, Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)Cheong Wa Dae pressured both parties on Sunday to pass the bill during the extra session, and urged them not to mention any changes to the national pension system in the bill. Senior press secretary Kim Sung-woo explained that the increase of the income replacement rate to 50 percent would require an infusion of 1,702 trillion won in taxpayers’ money over the next 65 years.“An increase of even one percentage point (in the income replacement rate) may pass a disastrous burden on to future generations,” said Kim at a press briefing.“It is not appropriate to link the national pension to the civil servant pension because such changes require prior agreement from the citizens,” he said.NPAD’s newly-elected floor leader Lee Jong-kul, however, refused to step back and held the ruling party accountable for failing to pass the pension reform bill. “We should honor our agreement on the pension reform bill. If not, those involved need to be held accountable” said Lee in his first official meeting with Rep. Yoo.On May 2, leaders of rival parties ― Kim Moo-sung of Saenuri and Moon Jae-in of NPAD ― agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. Because of this agreement, the bill on civil servants’ pension reform was widely expected to be passed at the plenary session last week. But another, unexpected condition attached to the agreement involving a change in national pension system instantly sparked concerns from the government. Top officials, including Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, blasted the parties for acting outside their authorities and said it was a matter that required public approval to even begin discussions. Other than the pension bill, lawmakers from rival parties are facing demands to pass the tax-code revision bill. It is aimed at allowing taxpayers to receive deserved tax refund by the end of this month. The bill, designed to alleviate the undue tax burden, needs to get parliamentary endorsement by Monday to allow the government to implement the plan as it promised the people.“It is regrettable that the bill failed to pass the National Assembly in April. We might not deliver on our promise to the taxpayers unless the Assembly passes the bill no later than May 11,” said Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan. Next in line is a bill for free child care program. It aims to fund an education subsidy, called Nuri Curriculum, a government-sponsored free child care program for children aged 3 to 5. The bill has been awaiting approval since last year.Other economic-related bills, such as legalizing crowdfunding and allowing corporates to engage in subcontracting, are expected to be discussed at the plenary session. Those pending bills, however, are likely to face partisan bickering as rival parties have debated the details of the bills. Lawmakers will also discuss whether to legalize putting graphic images of tobacco’s side effects on cigarette packs. The Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee approved the bill on May 1 to mandate tobacco companies put images to highlight the dangers of smoking.

The resignation of Rep. Joo Seung-yong dealt yet another blow to the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which has been faltering under deepening factional infighting that was aggravated by the party’s defeats in parliamentary by-elections on April 29. His decision to step down appeared intended, in part, to express his discomfort over NPAD Chair Rep. Moon Jae-in. Joo has accused Moon of “favoritism and incompetence.”Joo’s resignation will likely worsen tension among the NPAD’s multiple factions, observers said, as Moon and Joo are senior members of the party’s opposing groups.  Rep. Joo Seung-yong (left) of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy speaks during a session of the party‘s Supreme Council in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)“All of us in the Supreme Council must resign. We must take responsibility for last week’s election losses,” he told reporters. “Not taking responsibility for the defeats is another form of factionalism, favoritism, and unfairness.”The governing Saenuri Party trounced the NPAD last week, winning three of the four contested districts in the parliamentary by-elections. The NPAD failed to win a seat, losing to an independent in Gwangju, a city long considered an NPAD stronghold. Joo has accused Moon of favoritism toward the pro-Rohs, the leading faction within the NPAD, named after the late ex-President Roh Moo-hyun. Moon served as the presidential chief of staff for Roh. Joo is a member of the non-Rohs, a coalition of NPAD lawmakers who blame the pro-Rohs for the party’s falling approval ratings and last week’s election losses.They said Moon was politically incompetent as he had failed to win an election that was projected as an assured NPAD win due to the escalating graft allegations against some senior officials of the ruling bloc, who are suspected of taking bribes from a deceased construction mogul. “Continuing work under current conditions mean we will fail to win the general elections and the presidential election,” Joo said. South Korea holds nationwide parliamentary polls next year and a presidential race in 2017.“The citizens of our country and members of our party have asked for an explanation on the pro-Roh’s domination of our party,” Joo said. “The pro-Rohs have given none. I hence resign from the Supreme Council.”Joo’s comments Friday came after a verbal fight with Rep. Jung Cheong-rae, an outspoken pro-Roh lawmaker.“Threatening to resign, while not resigning, is the same as blackmailing,” Jung said of Joo.“I have blackmailed no one. I have, on multiple occasions, restrained from responding to Rep. Jung’s online criticism against me,” Joo said in response.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","factional fight senior lawmaker ,party leadership to resign ,debacle late last month ,hit by factional fight ,electoral debacle late","['Supreme Council', 'Joo Seung - yong', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37851018  0.04850878

They should also secure the financial sustainability of the national pension fund by collecting public opinion,” said senior press secretary Kim Sung-woo in an impromptu news conference.Parties failed to pass the bill as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy demanded that the revision explicitly state that the income-replacement rate of the national pension would be raised to 50 percent, from the current 40 percent. The income-replacement rate is the figure multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income. The ruling Saenuri Party rejected the demand, raising concerns that such a plan would place a huge financial burden on 20 million national pension subscribers, nearly half of South Korea’s population, as it requires a substantial hike in their contribution to the fund. The bill, drafted by the ruling party on the request of President Park Geun-hye, was widely expected to be passed at the plenary session on Wednesday as the rival parties had agreed on a set of reform measures over the weekend.They agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years.The two sides also agreed to raise the payout rates of the national pension. But the surprising decision drew fierce opposition from Cheong Wa Dae due to the fear of increased burden on taxpayers. Top officials, including Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, blasted the parties for acting outside their authorities and said it was a matter that required public approval to even begin discussions. The presidential office’s remarks on Thursday were seen as an expression of urgency to push forward Park’s reform drives with less than three years of her term remaining. The president, in her three-year economic reform plan unveiled last year, vowed to eradicate corruption and overhaul four sectors including the civil servants’ pension, labor and education markets. The plans, however, have been put on hold due to the Sewol crisis last year as well as a series of political scandals. Cheong Wa Dae officials expected that the reform bill on civil servants’ pension would set in motion her reform drive, if it gets parliamentary approval.The fate of the civil servants’ pension reform bill, however, remains unclear as the opposition NPAD is sticking to its demand to combine the issue of national pension system with the bill, while the ruling party is walking on eggshells in the face of vehement opposition from Cheong Wa Dae and some from pro-Park factions within the Saenuri Party.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","for failed pension bill ,presidential office on thursday ,parties for failed pension ,presidential office blames parties ,thursday urged rival parties",['Dae'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61231005  0.20788802

Lee Jong-kul. (Yonhap)The veteran politician faces numerous challenges during his one-year term, observers said.The imminent task for Lee is to stamp out growing factionalism in the wake of crushing defeats to the Saenuri Party in parliamentary by-elections late last month. The NPAD lost in all four of the contested districts, sparking a blame game among the party’s multiple factions.Lee will also undertake the daunting task of leading negotiations with the Saenuri Party over proposed public service pension reforms, which is generating significant public attention and criticism.The proposed amendments to the civil service pension aims to cut the pension’s growing deficit, which must be shouldered by government coffers. Supporters of the reforms assert that the civil service pension is the source of more than 523 trillion won ($480 billion) in public debt.The main parties had agreed to approve the reform bill at a plenary session Wednesday, but last-minute fissures within each party and President Park Geun-hye’s objection to details of the draft bill derailed efforts to reach an agreement late that day. Lee will have a voice in picking candidates to run in next year’s parliamentary elections. The polls will decide if the main opposition party can dismantle the governing party’s parliamentary majority.Lee represents a district in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, a city of 600,000 south of Seoul. NPAD officials generally consider Lee a moderate. He is a grandson of Lee Hoi-young, an anti-Japanese activist in Manchuria during Japan’s 1910-45 occupation of the Korean Peninsula.

(Yonhap)The governing party unilaterally approved the appointment of a controversial Supreme Court Justice nominee on Wednesday using its majority, ending a weekslong partisan fight over the nomination.The National Assembly voted 151 to 6 in favor of the appointment of Park Sang-ok to the Supreme Court. One vote was counted as invalid. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, numbering 130, boycotted the vote in protest.Persisting disagreements on public service pension reforms between the main parties held off a plenary voting on related amendments and scores of other economy-related bills.The nomination of Park has been pending in the Assembly since January due to the opposition’s objection. The NPAD says the ex-prosecutor actively participated in the alleged cover-up of the torture death of Park Jong-chul, a student protester under police custody, in January 1987.Park denied the accusations, saying he had been a junior prosecutor following orders from higher-ups.Many of the NPAD’s lawmakers have ties to the deceased Park, as they were also student protesters during the 1980s.“In the cold winter of 1987, a college student was found dead, naked, tortured,” NPAD Rep. Park Wan-ju,” said. “Official investigations later found that he had been killed by five police officers through torture,” the former activist added, before walking out of the main parliamentary hall before voting. NPAD lawmakers stage a sit-in protest against the Saenuri Party's nomination of Park Sang-ok after the appointment was approved late Wednesday. (Yonhap)Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa put the nomination up to a vote urging the opposition to express its objection through the “legislative process.”“The opposition is free to vote against Park’s nomination,” Chung had said Monday. “If you are against his appointment, convince the (Saenuri Party) to vote against him,” he added.Last-minute disagreements on public service pension reforms between the rival parties also delayed Wednesday’s plenary meeting, holding off voting on dozens of economy-related bills.The impasse left dozens of bills awaiting plenary approval. They included a draft law aiming to legalize crowdfunding, another legalizing images of tobacco’s side-effects on cigarette packs, and a bill allowing large corporations to engage in subcontracting, among others.The NPAD demanded that the revised texts of the public service pension bill should specifically state that the income-replacement rate of the national pension would be raised to 50 percent, from the current 40 percent.The income-replacement rate is the figure multiplied to a pensioner’s average lifetime monthly income. The governing Saenuri Party’s Rep. Yoo Seong-min agreed to put the wording in the bill’s addenda. Yoo’s agreement came after initial refusals, stating any specific statistic should be finalized during later talks among lawmakers and pension experts.Yoo’s agreement though will depend on the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council’s final approval. The Supreme Council consists of the party’s most senior incumbent lawmakers.Over the weekend, the rival parties agreed on a set of reform measures for the civil servants’ pension to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. The two sides also agreed to raise the income-replacement rate of the national pension, but faced opposition from Cheong Wa Dae due to the fear of increased burden on taxpayers.“I don’t want to talk much right now,” Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Moo-sung said as he came out from a closed-door meeting among Saenuri lawmakers earlier in the day.“But it’s been weeks and months since we started talks on the public service pension reforms,” Kim added in apparent frustration. “And (party leaders) signed an agreement (last Saturday).

Moon Jae-in’s leadership is being put to the test with mounting pressure to reorient the opposition’s political alignment and policy disposition following last week’s electoral defeat.The beleaguered leader’s approval rating has been declining. Realmeter survey said Wednesday that his ratings stand at 24.8 percent, down by 1.9 percentage points from last week, while his rival, Rep. Kim-Moo sung, enjoyed 19.2 percent, 5.7 percentage points higher. On Wednesday last week, his party lost four parliamentary seats in by-elections, three to the Saenuri Party and one to party defector Chun-Jung-bae. They include two seats in Gwangju and Gwanak District, Seoul, which are considered to be NPAD’s stronghold. Moon Jae-inBut despite the crushing defeats, Moon is expected to lead the party until 2016 general elections as his party struggles to search for a heavyweight to challenge Moon as the 2017 presidential candidate. At the postelection press conference, he said he felt “grave responsibility,” and vowed to rebuild his party “from the very beginning,” implying that he would retain the chairmanship.His commitment, however, did not resonate with his fellow party members. Rep. Joo Seung-yong, third-time lawmaker of NPAD, challenged his leadership, saying “(Moon) needs to articulate how he is going to hold responsibility for the election results.”Now he is tasked with bringing together party members, particularly loyalists to late President Kim Dae-Jung and late President Roh Moo-hyun, while embracing newcomers such as Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, former rival to Moon at the party’s primaries for 2012 presidential election. Until now, he has focused on applying what he considers to be “fairness” to his party. Instead of nominating heavyweight politicians to gain an easy victory, he decided to provide every candidate with an equal opportunity to contest elections.His move, however, was fiercely opposed by NPAD bigwigs such as Rep. Chun Jung-bae. He criticized Moon, who served as a former chief of staff during the late Roh administration, saying it was yet another attempt to reinforce the pro-Roh faction. He left the party afterward and won the election. As party members urge Moon to bring the party back on track and steer it toward victory in the general elections, experts believe that the focus should be on strategic solutions, not procedural measures to overhaul the beleaguered party. “I think the selection of candidates for an election is a minute issue,” said Lee Jung-hee, professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Fair election in itself is a step in the right direction, but NPAD should put more attention on structural reasons why it was defeated (in the by-elections),” said Lee.Political pundit Jeon Won-chaek pointed out that NPAD should resolve ideological differences among different factions to address intraparty feuding. “Pro-Roh factions and other factions are ideologically different,” Jeon said in a radio interview with local broadcaster TBS. “Both factions have different views about politics and thus they need to bridge ideological gaps, no matter how long it will take.” By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","last week electoral defeat ,main opposition party chief ,electoral defeat the beleaguered ,week electoral defeat the ,opposition party chief rep","['Moon Jae - in', 'Rep']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5371384  -0.02797104

Na Kyung-won, chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and unification. “If we fail to pass the bill again, we would be abandoning our historical duty.” The first draft of the North Korean human rights bill was introduced in 2005. Rep. Kim Moon-soo of the Grand National Party, predecessor to the Saenuri Party, and fellow legislators submitted the bill to the Assembly’s committee on foreign affairs and unification, but the committee failed to pass the bill in time as ruling and opposition lawmakers locked horns over the content.The bill was resubmitted in 2008 and passed the committee. But it made no headway at the plenary session as opposition parties blocked the passage, saying it would provoke North Korea and damage already strained inter-Korean ties.The bill was put back into the spotlight last year when the United Nations adopted a landmark resolution against Pyongyang, calling for a referral of North Korea to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations. Boosted by the U.N. resolution, Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party and fellow lawmakers repackaged previous legislation and proposed a comprehensive version of the North Korean human rights bill last November. The updated bill calls for the government to appoint a special ambassador for North Korea’s human rights; to establish a comprehensive archive to investigate and collect human rights abuse cases; and to offer support for activities by human rights groups. The progressive bloc, however, criticized the conservatives’ version as not comprehensive enough. The liberals pointed out that the bill lacks direct support for North Korean people such as food and medical aid, while the conservatives place importance on transparency over assistance. The opposition also claimed the bill could cause unexpected clashes with the North. They believe it would encourage anti-North groups to “further provoke” Pyongyang, such as by sending leaflets to the North. In October last year, North Korea responded by shooting down the balloons carrying the leaflets.The opposition proposed their own version of the North Korean human rights bill earlier this year. It highlighted improving the livelihood of North Koreans by providing direct humanitarian support. It also planned to build a dedicated agency to oversee the distribution of assistance. As political bickering continued over the bill, other countries have come forward by addressing the North’s human rights abuses.The U.S. passed the North Korea Human Rights Act in 2006 and extended it until 2017. It aims to help North Korean refugees by providing humanitarian and legal assistance to them and grants to organizations to promote human rights in North Korea. Japan also enacted a similar act in 2004. It is designed to resolve the abduction of Japanese nationals to the North while bringing the public and international community’s attention to North Korea’s human rights conditions. Unlike the bills by the U.S. and Japan, experts believe that Seoul’s version will take on a more profound and significant meaning. They pointed out that South Korea has a higher stake with the inter-Korean relationship.“As for the South Korean government, the bill will serve a different purpose from the U.S. and Japan,” said Hong Seong-phil, a law professor at Yonsei University. “The bill will help the Korean government formulate its reunification policy, so that it can prepare for the two Koreas’ reunification.” Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies, suggested the government take a cautious approach in legislating the bill. “Even if the bill were to be passed, the (Korean) government should apply it carefully as to not provoke the North. Until then, the government should serve as a middleman between the North and regional powers such as the U.S. and Japan,” Yang said.

The remark came three days after rival parties agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years. The reform measure is expected to save about 333 trillion won from 1,980 trillion won in public funds estimated to be spent to operate the pension system over the next 70 years. President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)The president’s discontent came as her party had originally pushed to raise the contribution rate to 10 percent and cut the entitlement to 1.65 percent to garner savings of nearly 429 trillion won.Park, who returned to work Monday after a week of bedrest, welcomed that the parties could strike a deal before the deadline, saying it was a step forward for her reform drive both in public and private sectors. She, however, voiced her opposition over the agreement to increase payouts from the national pension system for the general public, which many fear will raise the burden on taxpayers. She stressed that the matter required the people’s consent first and needs to be discussed separately from the reform bill on public servants’ pension system. While her remark did not imply that she would use her veto powers to block the plan, she clearly disapproved of the parties’ decision that was made beyond their authorities. “An institutional change to modify the nominal income replacement rate of the national pension, which has about 20 million subscribers, would place a huge burden on the people,” she said.“It is something that must seek the people’s consent beforehand and also a matter that should be decided carefully after forming a social consensus.”As per the unexpected bipartisan agreement the nominal income replacement rate ― the percentage of a subscriber’s annual income that is paid out each year on retirement ― will be raised to 50 percent from the current 40 percent. This means an employee would receive about 50 percent of his annual income as pension after retirement. But Cheong Wa Dae and the government have complained to the ruling party that this would require a massive injection of public funds and that the decision was made without proper consultation with the government.Meanwhile, the president’s remarks is expected to spark a heated debate in parliament with the ruling party seeking to avert criticism for reaching an agreement with the main opposition party without consulting the government. The inclusion of the national pension system ― that has about 20 million subscribers ― in the agreement was the major demand of the main opposition party, and the ruling party is being criticized for blindly accepting it for political reasons just to get endorsement for reform of the public servants’ pension system that has only 1.1 million subscribers.The rival parties agreed to form a special parliamentary committee to draft a bill on modifying the payout rate of the national pension and put the bill to a vote in September. They also agreed to inject 20 percent of the funds saved from the civil servants’ pension reform into the national pension fund. Welfare minister Moon Hyung-pyo, former senior researcher on the nation’s pension system, lashed out at the decision saying that that the funds saved from public servants’ pension fund won’t be enough to cover the cost of raising the income replacement rates of the national pension system. The ministry has claimed that subscribers need to spend an average of 18 percent of their income to fund a 50 percent income replacement rate. A subscriber is obliged to pay 9 percent of their monthly income to the national pension fund.The ruling party chief tried to contain the fallout by admitting there were shortcomings.“I humbly accept the criticism over the civil servants’ pension reform bill and I agree to many parts of (the deal that drew criticism),” he said.“But we will put efforts to reflect the public opinion in the course of the negotiation.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, pressed the ruling party to keep its promise and pass the bill by fully reflecting the agreement reached on Saturday. “It is a meaningful work to raise the income replacement rate to 50 percent along with the reform of civil servants’ pension reform,” said NPAD leader Moon Jae-in.The meeting on Monday was Park’s first with her aides since she returned to work from her recent Latin American tour. During the meeting, the president touched on a wide range of contentious issues including her drive to reform the political sector as well as ways of granting proper presidential pardons. On the outcome of the by-elections last week, Park said it carried the people’s message for the government to initiate radical reform and eradicate corruption in public and political sectors. Her Saenuri Party achieved an unexpected victory in the parliamentary by-elections amid growing criticism over her top aides involved in a snowballing graft scandal.

Moon Jae-in, chair of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, pledged to consider changing “everything from the party’s people to the party’s day-to-day functioning” to achieve victory in the 2016 general election. Next year’s nationwide polls will decide if the governing party maintains its long-held parliamentary majority.“Voters delivered a strong message to us in (last Wednesday’s) polls,” Moon said in reference to the four parliamentary by-elections that the governing Saenuri Party won, increasing its parliamentary majority to 160 in the 298-seat National Assembly, from 156.“I will never forget this loss. I will use it as an opportunity to launch our party to victory in 2016,” Moon added. NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in shakes hands with a resident during his visit to Gwangju, Monday. (Yonhap)The defeats came amid a public uproar over a corruption scandal involving top Saenuri Party officials. Analysts had predicted the scandal would give easy wins to NPAD candidates running in the four contested districts in Seoul, Incheon, Gwangju, and Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province.The NPAD’s most surprising loss was to independent candidate Chun Jung-bae in Gwangju, a region long considered an NPAD stronghold. Chun is an ex-NPAD official who left the party in February after twice failing to secure a spot as a party candidate in Gwangju ― first in last July’s parliamentary by-elections and in the by-elections last week.Moon flew to Gwangju on Monday to meet voters for the first time since the electoral defeat to Chun, reportedly appealing to former NPAD voters who had turned their backs on the polls. Moon met senior citizens at a community center in Korea’s fifth-largest city, bowing his head in deference and folding his hands together in front of him.“I consider your votes as calls urging our party to get our act together,” he said in his deep monotone voice in a speech marked by brief pauses.Senior NPAD figures have not shied away from expressing their discontent at Moon’s leadership, despite his efforts to unite the party’s many factions after the losses last week.“If I were Moon, I’d step down,” former liberal lawmaker Chung Dai-chul said. Chung is a senior adviser to the party and also the father of incumbent NPAD Rep. Chyung Ho-joon. “A politician must take responsibility for electoral results,” the ex-legislator said.NPAD Rep. Joo Seung-yong accused Moon of favoritism.“Rep. Moon must resign. If he doesn’t resign, he’d better promise to do away with his factionalist policies,” Joo said Monday.Joo appeared to be criticizing Moon’s alleged favoritism of members in the NPAD’s most dominant faction, which consists of politicians who started their careers under former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.Moon was Roh’s presidential chief of staff and is considered the “big brother” of the pro-Roh group.But Moon’s approval ratings still lead those of his counterparts in the Saenuri Party. A Realmeter nationwide poll conducted from April 27 to May 1 with 2,500 respondents showed Moon’s endorsement rating at 24.8 percent. Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung came in second at 19.2 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus 2 percent, with a 95 percent confidence level.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition leader monday vowed ,main opposition leader monday ,leader pledges drastic reforms ,opposition leader monday ,pledges drastic reforms south","['South Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.61050344  0.30783275

272,272,Parties agree on pension reform bill,"The reform bill for civil servants’ pensions will be put to a vote at the National Assembly this Wednesday, but Cheong Wa Dae and the government say the deal has not gone far enough to address shortfalls in the nation’s pension funds.The ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Saturday agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from the 7 percent to ...","The reform bill for civil servants’ pensions will be put to a vote at the National Assembly this Wednesday, but Cheong Wa Dae and the government say the deal has not gone far enough to address shortfalls in the nation’s pension funds.The ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Saturday agreed to raise the contribution rate of public service pensions from the 7 percent to 9 percent in the next five years, while reducing entitlements from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent in stages over 20 years.But they also agreed to increase payouts from the national pension system, a different government-run pension scheme for the general public.The agreement would raise the nominal income replacement rate ― the percentage of a subscriber’s annual income that is paid out each year on retirement ― to 50 percent from the current 40 percent. This means an employee would receive about 50 percent of his annual income as a pension after reaching retirement age. If the bill passes, public officials will be required to pay more in premiums while in service and receive less in payouts after retirement. The parties predict that some 333 trillion won ($309 billion) would be saved in the next 70 years thanks to the reform plan.Under the revised system, a public servant who worked for 30 years with an average monthly salary of 3 million won will have to pay 270,000 won in monthly premiums, which is 60,000 won more than before. After retirement, the official will receive 1.71 million won in monthly payouts, which is 180,000 won less than in the existing scheme.According to the parties’ agreement, 20 percent of the funds saved from the civil servants’ pension reform will go toward the national pension fund. This is designed to help pay for the increased payouts in an effort to combat senior poverty.But even with this injection, the government will still need to find more money to cover the costs of increasing national pension benefits, either through taxation or by raising premiums. The Welfare Ministry predicts that Koreans would need to spend an average of 18 percent of their income on national pension premiums to fund a 50 percent income replacement rate. Currently, 9 percent of incomes go toward national pension premiums. Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo on Saturday visited Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung to complain the parties’ decision to increase the nominal income replacement rate of the national pension, claiming they exceeded their authority. Cheong Wa Dae also reportedly complained to the ruling party about the same matter.“We estimate that at least 70 trillion won is needed to raise the nominal income replacement rate (of the national pension) to 50 percent, regardless of inflation,” Moon told reporters. “The cost (of increasing the income replacement rate) may exceed the funds saved from the civil servants’ pension reform.”According to the National Pension Research Institute, the number of national pension recipients will exceed that of those paying into the scheme by 2060, as the senior population is grows and the nation’s fertility rate remains low. The Welfare Ministry also predicts that the national pension fund will be completely depleted by 2060.Amid Cheong Wa Dae’s growing concerns, the leaders of the rival parties agreed to establish a task force to improve the current government-run pension system, which has been ridden with growing deficits as the elderly population rapidly increases. A special National Assembly committee will be formed to draw up a relevant bill to be passed by September.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","for democracy on saturday ,national assembly this wednesday ,democracy on saturday agreed ,democracy on saturday ,agree on pension reform","['the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33372459  0.29269284

But it faced mounting calls for a leadership overhaul to seize the political agenda.The NPAD was seen moving to demand new legislation to create an independent unit to investigate the scandal, which was sparked after claims by late businessman Sung Woan-jong that he gave money to top aides to President Park Geun-hye. Among the listed names are former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and former and incumbent presidential chiefs of staff.The NPAD suffered an embarrassing defeat in last Wednesday’s by-elections for four parliamentary seats, losing three to the Saenuri Party and one to an independent candidate.The surprise defeat prompted calls for a complete party overhaul, including discussions on whether to align with other opposition forces ahead of next year’s general election.“If the Park administration attempts to divert public attention from the graft scandal, NPAD will do what it is supposed to do as an opposition party. We will respond in a firm and stringent manner,” said NPAD leader Moon Jae-in at a press conference Thursday.The party is slated to select a new floor leader this Thursday to steer the party until next year’s general election. Five candidates have so far entered the race. Reports said that the party members would favor a candidate who can embrace Rep. Chun Jung-bae, a party defector who won by a landslide victory in the NPAD stronghold of Gwangju. Besides resolving potential intraparty feuds, the leadership is also pressured to work out a legislative standoff with the ruling party. The governing party has been pushing for legislation to provide free child care to children aged 3 to 5 and revamp business laws in Korea ―- both are still pending in the National Assembly.The opposition party is likely to oppose the legislation unless the ruling party accepts their proposal. NPAD has been demanding that additional government officials be assigned to support the free child care policy. The ruling party has refused this demand, branding it a waste of taxpayers’ money. Meanwhile, reports said President Park was likely to return to work this week. She has been missing from the political stage since she fell ill after a visit to Latin America last month. During her time off, Park accepted the prime minister’s resignation and issued a statement on the graft scandal. Now that the governing party has won the by-elections and concluded a plan for pension reforms for public workers, it is expected that the president will push ahead with the government’s labor and public sector reforms.

A special National Assembly committee will be established in a bid to pass a relevant bill in September under the agreement. South Korea's public pension has been ridden with growing deficits as its society is fast aging.Both parties stressed that the process of reaching the deal is of significance as well.""This agreement minimizes social conflict. Most of all, it is meaningful as a compromise of the people,"" Kim Moo-sung, head of the Saenuri Party said, apparently referring to the joint work of representatives from related groups. ""It is of big significance that (we) opened a way to resolve the problem of public sector reform through public consensus.""Moon Jae-in, leader of the NPAD, echoed his view.""This pension reform was made possible via social consensus agreed on by parties involved on top of pain-sharing by civil servants,"" he said. It would serve as a good model for reform of other sectors including the labor market, he added.But unionized public workers and teachers voiced strong opposition to the bill. ""We have never agreed to the proposed plan to change the contribution rate to 1.7 percent and the payments to 9 percent and any other changes,"" the Korean Government Employees' Union said in a statement. ""We cannot accept the proposal that would worsen the current pension system.""The Korean Teachers and Educational Workers' Union also said it will fight against what it calls the ""evil pension bill.""

The law goes into effect starting September. The parliamentary approval ends months-long debates over child safety and teachers’ privacy and human rights.“It was a shame the bill was rejected in February,” said Rep. Shin Yee-jin of the ruling Saenuri Party. “I believe the bill will present us with an opportunity to prevent child abuse and improve quality of life for those working at child care centers” she said. The government will cover the costs of installing the CCTV.Under the bill, child care centers must install surveillance cameras and keep the recordings for at least 60 days. The footage will only be disclosed when parents and authorities request their disclosure. The bill also allows child care centers to install Internet-linked cameras to allow parents to check on their children in real time. But Internet cameras can only be installed with the agreement of both parents and teachers.The bill stipulates the government should make efforts to reduce teachers’ stress and workload by providing counseling services and increasing the child care staff, as their heavy workload has been cited as a cause of child abuse at day care centers.The bill was pushed earlier this year after a series of child abuse cases outraged the public. Last January, a 33-year-old worker at an Incheon day care center was caught on CCTV beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her meal.But the bill was rejected by the Assembly in March. Some lawmakers reportedly raised concerns that the CCTV might infringe upon students’ privacy and violate the rights of teachers at child care institutions. Alongside the bill, lawmakers approved the legislation for banning online media outlets from posting obscene advertisements and pictures on their websites. Lawmakers also unanimously approved the resolution to send money to Nepal, where a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck Saturday and claimed thousands of lives. The National Assembly will collect money from staff members and lawmakers to raise $100,000.

YonhapThe opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy suffered crushing defeats in constituencies where political liberals had shown strong showings in past elections. It lost its stronghold of Gwangju to a defector of the party.The ruling party was hit hard by the snowballing bribery scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s close confidants, providing a strong political weapon for the opposition party to attack just before the by-elections.The performance is expected to not only cement Kim’s leadership in the party but also raise his status as a promising candidate for next president, analysts said. ""The ruling camp now has the mandate to push the political reform of the entire spectrum, effectively overshadowing the opposition’s push to use the graft scandal against the Saenuri Party,” said Bae Jong-chan, senior analyst of Research and Research.“The win is also expected to elevate the ruling party’s position in future discussions with Cheong Wa Dae,” he added.Opposition leader Moon Jae-in, on the other hand, is expected to face demands to take responsibility for the defeat, the pundits said. The party is expected to face mounting calls to rethink its policy agenda and fix the internal power struggle among those loyal to former President Roh Moo-hyun and loyalists of former President Kim Dae-jung.The by-elections were held in four constituencies ― Seoul, Incheon, Gwangju and Seongnam of Gyeonggi Province ― to pick lawmakers for the 298-member National Assembly.Electoral officials count the votes in Seoul’s Gwanak district late Wednesday. YonhapThe election, dubbed as “ultra mini-general election,” would not have significant impact in changing the current political landscape, pundits said. But the winner of the election was expected to take a lead in the partisan fight over the escalating graft scandal and in ongoing discussions over pending issues such as pension and labor reform. Earlier in the day, Saenuri leader Kim urged voters to pick the party’s candidates, stressing that all the four constituencies need reliable support from the governing party.“To achieve regional development, we need talented lawmakers and above all, the power of the governing party,” he said during a supreme council meeting.Opposition leader Moon, on the contrary, urged voters to give a referendum on the scandal-stricken Park administration through the by-election.“Only votes can give an answer to the Park Geun-hye administration’s failed economic policies, personnel appointment and corruption,” he said at a meeting.Analysts said the election was crucial for leaders of the rival parties, as it was their first major test.The snowballing graft scandal involving President Park’s key aides had set up a favorable environment for the main opposition party ahead of the election, said a Seoul-based political analyst Yoon Hee-woong. But the scandal failed to serve as a winning factor for NPAD in the election, he said, citing systematic limitation of the mini election.Voter turnout stood at 36 percent, 3.1 percentage points higher than last year’s by-election. But the slight changes in the turnout had little to do with the number of liberal voters aged between 20s and 40s ― crucial groups for the opposition party.Yoon Pyeong-joong, political professor of Hanshin University, also played down the impact of the election, stressing that it doesn’t have any of decisive factors expected to bring changes in political landscape. “I don’t think the election would become a barometer of public sentiment. The scale of the election in which parties are competing with each other for four (out of 298 parliamentary) seats is not big enough to have an impact,” he said“The election is taking place with complex feelings toward the Park (administration) conflicting together,” he said.Park continued to show her authoritative leadership through a message announced on Tuesday, Yoon pointed out. “Park’s counterattack against the opposition party could stimulate liberal voters and further disappoint swing voters who may have wanted to see her take responsibility over the burgeoning graft scandal involving her close confidants,” he said. “But at the same time, her illness caused by overwork, could garner more sympathy votes from conservative voters.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","election win the ruling ,political momentum with election ,wednesday parliamentary by elections ,momentum with election win ,ruling party regains political","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Yoo Seung - min']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.93247414 -0.03839629

Hong Joon-pyo to gather information on their whereabouts when deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong claimed to have given money to them.Lee, who resigned upon mounting pressure last week, and Hong are two of the eight politicians on the list left by Sung before his apparent suicide earlier this month, suggesting he had given illicit political funds to them. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo heads to his office in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, Wednesday. (Yonhap)The investigation, slowed by a lack of evidence, appeared to hit another snag Tuesday following a message from President Park Geun-hye calling for an investigation into her predecessors’ special pardon on Sung.Her remarks, given through her chief press secretary, came under fire from opposition and local observers as an attempt to sway the investigation. Sources from the prosecution were quoted as saying in reports that Park’s message tightened their discretion as any investigation outcome may appear to be directed by Cheong Wa Dae.They also cited current laws that make it impossible to investigate a past pardon decision.Under the law, a presidential pardon is an act of the state that is not legally binding. If it is suspected of having a criminal motive ― such as the president or his or her confidants receiving money or favors in exchange for the pardon ― it can be subject to investigation. But in such cases, investigators must prove that the money or favors were provided in exchange of the promise of the pardon.Rep. Jun Byung-hun of the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy claimed Park’s argument lacked substance as there was no evidence suggesting a deal was made for Sung’s pardon.The NPAD has tried to shift the blame over Sung’s pardon to the Saenuri Party, claiming that the businessman was pardoned in early 2008 at the request of then-President-elect Lee Myung-bak.The Saenuri Party dismissed the argument and demanded NPAD leader Moon Jae-in ― who was chief of staff to then-President Roh Moo-hyun ― to explain exactly why Sung was pardoned.Yang Seung-ham, a politics professor at Yonsei University, pointed out that because the incident happened several years ago and Roh no longer alive, it is very unlikely that either side will be able to provide enough evidence to prove their case.Contrary to Park’s emphasis on rooting out corruption, observers said Park’s public address was designed to raise support ahead of Wednesday’s by-election while dodging responsibility for the graft scandal. The eight suspected of receiving money from Sung consist of her former and incumbent chief secretaries and ruling party members. “Park appears to be trying to ‘water down’ suspicions against her and her staff with political intent for the by-election,” Yang said.Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, meanwhile, underscored that the investigation would stay neutral.With regard to any probe into the pardons, Hwang said he was looking into all possibilities, but added that an investigation was unlikely if evidence of wrongdoing did not turn up. “I’m just saying that we are not confining the scope of the investigation to any specific party,” he told the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee.

The victory effectively gives the party a mandate to push through the administration’s reform plans and economic initiatives. The conservative party prevailed in three of the four contested districts, dealing a crushing blow to the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy, which won none.Independent Chun Jung-bae (left) and the Saenuri Party`s Shin Sang-jin celebrate after their wins. YonhapThe liberal opposition was defeated even in its traditional stronghold of Gwangju by Chun Jung-bae, an independent candidate who defected from the party. Chun’s win, with 52.37 percent of the votes, leaves the NPAD with an uphill battle to realign its policy drives and mend its factional struggles.Three Saenuri candidates won comfortable victories in Seoul and nearby cities. Shin Sang-jin won in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, taking 55.9 percent of the votes. Ahn Sang-soo won in Incheon with 54.11 percent.In the most closely contested district of Gwanak, Seoul, Oh Shin-hwan triumphed with 43.89 percent of the votes, as liberal votes were split by the NPAD’s Jung Tae-ho and Chung Dong-young, a former opposition presidential candidate running as an independent. The majority governing party increased its seats in the 298-member National Assembly to 160, while the main opposition holds 130.Turnout was 36 percent, with 256,232 voters showing up at polling stations, the National Election Commission said. The polls were held to fill four seats vacated by members of a defunct leftist party and a Saenuri official found guilty last month of violating election laws in 2012.Analysts said the Saenuri Party’s win has secured it a stronger position to lead future talks in the Assembly on reforms pursued by the Park Geun-hye administration.Voters line up to cast their ballots in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapThe party also showed some recovery from negative public opinion against it sparked by a graft scandal involving the party’s top officials. Eight Saenuri officials were accused of taking illegal campaign funds from the late Sung Woan-jong, who claimed to have given billions in unlisted funds to them since 2007.The win also offered Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung a chance to expand his clout within the conservative party as an alternative force to the mainstream pro-Parks, the faction backing the president, pundits said.The political reform initiative, reiterated by Park through her chief press secretary a day before the elections, also gained momentum.The bills pushed by Park and the ruling party include one aiming to invigorate crowdfunding in South Korea’s conservative business culture and another draft amendment targeting the public service pension, a source the ruling bloc has blamed for the snowballing national debt.Voters cast their ballots in Seoul on Wednesday. Yonhap“The election does not change the majority party. Nor will it change the president’s attitude,” said Chung-Ang University professor Choi Young-jin.One of the most heated competition took place at Gwangju, the traditional stronghold of the liberals. The seat was heavily contested by opposition-turned-independent Chun Jung-bae, Jung Seung of the Saenuri Party and Cho Young-teck of the NPAD, among others.“I will eradicate regional discrimination, reform the opposition and fundamentally change Korean politics,” Chun said in his victory speechThe overall outcome of the by-elections, however, would be lesser than anticipated, as the elected lawmakers will only serve a one-year term before next year’s general elections.“If you take out Gwangju, an area the opposition fought over amongst themselves, there were only three districts the ruling and opposition blocs were contesting,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University. “That means it will be difficult to gauge public opinion of the Park administration.”“Moon has always been viewed as a Roh lieutenant,” Yoon said in reference to former President Roh Moo-hyun. “That image of being under Roh’s shadow has always been a weakness for him.”The disappointing results will consequently weaken Moon’s foothold in the opposition party, but he will still hold onto the leadership position as the bloc lacks an alternative figure who can be projected as the next presidential candidate, the pundits said.Moon served as Roh’s chief of staff and secretary before running in the 2012 presidential race against Park. Analysts view him as a leading opposition candidate in the 2017 presidential election.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","corruption scandal the victory ,overall winner in parliamentary ,elections wednesday despite suffering ,scandal the victory effectively ,parliamentary by elections wednesday",['Saenuri Party'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68041438 -0.14717166

All but one listed on the memo are close associates of the president.  Park accepted Lee's resignation offer earlier this week.  The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which fielded candidates for all the four seats, is running on its election campaign to pass judgment on the scandal-stricken Park administration.  Expressing regret over Lee's resignation, Park vowed to root out corruption and push for a fresh political reform.  Another major intrigue in the by-elections is the fate of two heavyweight politicians who defected from the main opposition party to run for the parliamentary races.  The two former NPAD members -- Chung Dong-young and Chun Jung-bae -- are each running for the race at the B constituency of the Kwanak district in southern Seoul and the B constituency of the Seogu district in the traditionally left-leaning southwestern city of Gwangju.  The bids by Chung, a former presidential candidate, and former Justice Minister Chun are expected to split opposition votes.  Both the ruling and main opposition parties are running toward the goal of each winning at least two seats, although ceding all four seats to the opposition bloc will not weaken the ruling party's 157-strong majority held at the National Assembly.  The Saenuri Party is largely seen as holding sway over the B constituency of Ganghwa county, Incheon, with the rest of the three, including the Jungwon district in Gyeonggi Province, preferring the opposition bloc.   Voter turnout during the two-day early voting, held last week, stood at 7.6 percent, according to the National Election Commission.

""I am determined to eradicate the time-honored irregularities and corruption so we could achieve a new political reform.""  Park could not appear in public due to an illness. She is still receiving medical attention due to stomach cramps and a sore throat after her recent trip to South America.  Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, who is at the center of an alleged corruption scandal, delivers his resignation speech in Seoul on Tuesday, April 28, 2015. (Yonhap)Park's message came a day after she accepted Lee's resignation offer over the scandal involving Lee and some of her key aides.  Lee is accused of taking 30 million won ($27,000) from a businessman at the center of the bribery scandal in 2013, when Lee was running for a parliamentary seat.  Before hanging himself earlier this month, the businessman, Sung Wan-jong, left behind a memo listing the names of Lee and seven other high-profile politicians he claimed to have bribed. All but one listed on the memo are close associates of the president.  Still, Lee has flatly denied the allegation.  Park called on the prosecution to carry out a thorough probe into the scandal and said the ruling and opposition parties should launch an independent counsel probe if any suspicion is left after the prosecution's investigation.  Park also called for the truth behind two special pardons Sung received in 2005 and 2007 when President Roh Moo-hyun was in office, noting the special pardons undermined the rule of law.  Her remarks are seen as a push to punish not only the ruling party politicians but also those from the opposition party if they are found guilty of bribery.  Lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party have raised suspicions of irregularities involving Sung's pardons given under the Roh government of the now major opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.  In South Korea, presidents usually grant special pardons in commemoration of major national holidays, though the practice has long been under fire for being abused to give favors to their friends and associates jailed for corruption.  ""This is the last chance to sever the cycle of corruption and eradicate it in our politics,"" Park said.

The parties set a May 2 deadline to finalize the plan.The committee, comprising government representatives, public servants and pension experts, has mapped out a tentative plan, which would decrease pension payments for civil servants by 10 percent and increase their financial contribution by 30 to 40 percent.“The pension reform plan has nearly come to a close as there were agreements on many aspects,” said Rep. Kang Gi-jung from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The government has pushed to restructure the loss-making pension system for government employees in an attempt to deal with snowballing national debt. According to the revised scheme, the government’s pension payment rate will be lowered to between 1.65 and 1.75 percent from the current 1.9 percent. This will raise the insurance rate from 14 percent to between 18 and 20 percent.Government workers currently receive 57 percent of their average income when they retire, but it is expected to drop to between 49.5 and 52.5 percent. It would mean under the revised plan, public servants will be required to pay 30 to 40 percent more from their income, but receive 8 to 13 percent less when they retire.The government and pensioners have so far agreed to put a cap on the maximum pension public servants can receive. The working group for the pension overhaul agree that the new plan will be based on a pay-more, receive-less proposal, but the details are yet to be finalized, sources said.Issues such as implementing a wage peak system and realigning the pension payment between higher-earning public servants and lower-earning government officials were some of the remaining sticking points in the negotiations.Unionized workers have resisted the changes. About 260,000 workers, including 60,000 government employees and 10,000 teachers, staged a one-day strike Friday last week to protest the government’s drive for reforms to the pension system and labor market.About 100 members from 90 trade unions from the Confederation of Korean Government Employees’ Union vowed to go on a hunger strike for five days starting Monday.

Mike Honda and Ed Royce, issued the appeal in a joint letter to Japanese Ambassador to Washington Kenichiro Sasae, just days before Abe begins a visit to the U.S. that includes an address at a joint session of Congress.“We are at a critical juncture in America’s rebalance to Asia, and we firmly believe that enhanced cooperation between the United States, Japan and Korea will serve as a linchpin of peace and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific region and the broader global community,” they said in the letter. Shinzo Abe“In this regard, we sincerely hope Prime Minister Abe’s visit will lay the foundation for healing and humble reconciliation by addressing the historical issues,” they said. The lawmakers also called for Abe to “formally reaffirm and validate the conclusions expressed” in Japan’s two previous statements of apology ― the Murayama and Kono statements ― saying they represent “important chapters in Japan’s efforts to improve relations with its neighbors.“We fervently hope Prime Minister Abe will take advantage of this auspicious milestone during his visit to Washington to enhance Japan’s relationships with its neighbors through a vision of long overdue healing and reconciliation which will contribute to future-oriented cooperation,” they said.The letter came days after four lawmakers, including Honda, took to the House floor Tuesday to strongly press for an apology from Abe for Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women for its troops during World War II.The letter appeared meaningful in that Royce, the Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, cosigned it. Royce, though he has a critical stance of Japan’s perception of history, has taken a neutral position on Abe’s visit in consideration of his title as chairman.(Yonhap)","25 lawmakers including reps ,lawmakers including reps mike ,past apologies washington bipartisan ,cooperation the 25 lawmakers ,the 25 lawmakers","['WASHINGTON', 'U.S.', 'the House Foreign Affairs Committee', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'South Korea', 'Mike Honda', 'Ed Royce', 'japanese', 'Washington', 'Kenichiro Sasae', 'Abe']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71269244  0.33572772

Moon, from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, denied speculations Thursday that former late President Roh Moo-hyun granted a special pardon to deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong in his last days in office, even though he was not eligible for the pardon. Moon was Roh’s chief of staff at the time.Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung on Friday intensified a verbal attack against Moon, stating he has failed to clarify the speculation. “The person who knows about (how Sung was granted a presidential pardon) is Moon,” Kim said after a government-party meeting on rice supply. “Why did he hold a press conference if he was not going to talk about it?”The governing party raised the speculation, suggesting that Roh’s aides, including Moon, might have questionable ties to Sung, who has been at the center of the graft scandal.Moon flatly denied the speculation and accused Saenuri of trying to divert public attention from the burgeoning graft scandal, which involves political heavyweights in the ruling party.The opposition leader also demanded the establishment of a special probe, saying it is not appropriate for the president to appoint the investigative team when it is her aides that are being investigated. “President Park Geun-hye should give a clear answer about whether she would keep her promise to launch an independent counsel,” said Moon. The opposition leader also demanded Park’s top aides including her Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee step down from the post for his alleged involvement into the case. Prior to his apparent suicide earlier this month, former Keangnam chairman Sung left a list of eight high-profile politicians who received bribes, including Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Park’s Chief of Staff Lee. Prime Minister Lee has since offered to resign.The presidential office has rejected Moon’s demand.“We are concerned that Moon’s remarks could invite suspicion that he is trying to influence the probe,” said presidential spokesperson Min Kyung-wook in Chile, where Park is on a three-day state visit.Park has said she is willing to consider the measures necessary to completely resolve the suspicions.“I have no reason to rule out an investigation by an independent counsel if the adoption of it can help find the truth,” Park was quoted as saying, according to the ruling party chief ahead her four-nation swing to South America.By Cho Chung-un, news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","clash over corruption probe ,rival parties friday collided ,democracy denied speculations thursday ,parties clash over corruption ,pardon to deceased businessman","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Moon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Sung Woan - jong']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.47860399  0.23168229

How the illegal money was spent should be clearly ascertained. Only then can we end the politics of money and the vicious circle of corrupt politics,” Moon said during a press conference. Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in holds a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Moon also pressured President Park’s Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee to step down, and urged Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and senior civil affair secretary Woo Byung-woo to take their hands off the ongoing prosecution’s probe.“The truth can’t be uncovered when those who are suspected of corruption still remain in their current positions. They should bow out,” he said.Before committing suicide earlier this month, former Keangnam Enterprises chairman Sung left a list of eight high-profile politicians including Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and presidential chief of staff Lee, indicating they took bribes. The prime minister offered to resign on Monday.Touching on speculation about the special pardon in 2007, Moon stressed that no officials in the Roh administration received kickbacks from Sung.“I hope that political strife will not emerge again over the issue of the special pardon. I can say for certain that no one in Cheong Wa Dae during the Roh administration received any dirty money,” he said.Speculation erupted earlier this week after a ruling party lawmaker argued that former President Roh included Sung on the list of special presidential pardons at the last minute, despite opposition from the Justice Ministry. The argument indicated there were corrupt ties between the Roh government and the disgraced businessman.The NPAD has countered that Roh’s decision to include Sung on the list was made because of calls from then-President-elect Lee Myung-bak’s transition committee. Lee’s side has rejected the claims.Regarding the special probe, ruling party leader Kim Moo-sung told reporters, “If (Moon) is that confident, I will welcome a probe into the case (to see if anyone in the Roh government had received any bribes).”During the press conference, Moon demanded that an independent probe be launched to investigate the scandal surrounding the so-called resource diplomacy policy conducted by the former Lee government. The opposition parties have argued that corruption in the implementation of the policy wasted taxpayers’ money.Moon also called on President Park to craft viable legal and institutional frameworks to stamp out corruption and push for political reform. He asked Park to provide answers to his demands after she returns from her four-nation trip to Latin America next week.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","resignation of president park ,corrupt politics moon from ,quit opposition leader moon ,top aide quit opposition ,aide quit opposition leader","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun', 'Moon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Roh Moo - hyun']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.40302566  0.17165066

Kim Moo-sung proposed high-level talks on public service pension reforms to main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in. President Park urged prosecutors Tuesday to use ongoing graft probes to end corruption.The comments came amid an escalating graft scandal involving Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and three past and current presidential secretaries among others accused of accepting illegal campaign funds from the late construction mogul Sung Woan-jong multiple times since 2007.The governing party’s efforts to stress reforms also come a week before parliamentary by-elections on April 29 at four constituencies -- one in the nation’s southwest, another in its capital Seoul and two more in Seoul’s surrounding cities.The Saenuri Party appeared keen to distance itself from the scandal at its campaign rallies Wednesday. Party leaders shook hands with voters in early traffic hours, emphasizing its job creation platform.“There has been much commotion about the Sung Woan-jong scandal,” Kim said. “But we remain strong and determined in our belief that only members of the ruling party will bring more growth to these areas.”The main opposition, on the other hand, vowed the scandal “was only getting started.”The New Political Alliance for Democracy reiterated their calls for a parliamentary hearing on the scandal before the by-elections. Saenuri Party lawmakers have opposed the proposal and have expressed holding the hearing after the polls, apparently worried the scandal could adversely influence voter sentiments.The Sung scandal began on April 9, when Sung claimed in an interview with a local daily to have given illegal campaign funds to officials with close ties to Park, hours before police found him dead in an apparent suicide in the woods of northern Seoul.Prosecutors had been probing Sung, the ex-chief of Keangnam Enterprises, for allegedly swindling government subsidies. Sung had denied the allegations and called the investigations against him a witch-hunt sponsored by corrupt Park officials such as Lee.Investigations into Sung’s claims intensified in the early hours Wednesday when prosecutors detained Park Joon-ho, a former top Sung aide, for allegedly tampering with evidence. Park had tried to erase evidence backing Sung’s graft allegations, authorities said. Authorities also suspect Park could be withholding information on how and when Sung had allegedly given illegal campaign funds to the accused Park officials.Prosecutors also raided the home and car of Sung’s first son in search of evidence supporting Sung’s claims. Authorities also obtained the original suicide note Sung had left at his home, hours before law enforcement found him dead.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, criticized the opposition’s alleged links to Sung during the Roh Moo-hyun administration. President Roh had pardoned Sung in 2005 and 2007, after the businessman had been charged with embezzlement and misappropriation of corporate funds.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","scandal south korea governing ,governing bloc on wednesday ,graft scandal south korea ,vowed to accelerate political ,main opposition new politics","['South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.52760357  0.34714773

I express my deepest regrets to everyone at the university,” Park said in a statement released Tuesday. Park had prompted an uproar from university professors after he threatened to fire those opposing the board’s plans to alter the university’s admission process through vulgar remarks made in an email sent out to the president of CAU and some 20 professors at the university.The outgoing Doosan Heavy chairman had written, “It isn’t good manners to not strike ones neck when one has asked for it” and that he “would strike in the most bloody and painful way possible,” vowing to use his “authority over faculty appointment to take revenge” on those opposing the board’s plans.Chung-Ang University is scheduled to convene an emergency board of directors meeting soon to discuss Park’s profanity.The prosecution plans to summon Park for his ties to former CAU president Park Bum-hoon, who has been under investigation for allegedly abusing his power to grant special privileges to the university while he worked as a senior secretary for education under the former President Lee Myung-bak.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","chairman resigns doosan heavy ,threatening university professors who ,for threatening university professors ,olympic committee park resignation ,doosan heavy chairman resigns","['Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction', 'Park Yong - sung', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Seoul', 'the Korean Olympic Committee', 'Park ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5869813   0.46968126

Kim Moo-sung is seen expanding his clout with the backing of nonmainstream members.While the scandal involving former and incumbent aides of President Park Geun-hye has become the biggest stumbling block for the party ahead of the April 29 by-elections, Kim’s approval ratings have soared. Analysts attributed Kim’s rise to conservatives’ growing demand for an alternative to the pro-Parks.“(Kim’s rise) was only a matter of time,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. “Even though there are other political heavyweights in the ruling party, Kim is practically the only one capable enough to navigate the party through crises. Therefore, Kim’s rise is inevitable,” said Yoon.Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sungThe survey by Realmeter released on Monday showed that Kim received 13.2 percent of support among the potential presidential candidates, behind longtime front-runner Moon Jae-in of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy with 27.9 percent.By category, Kim beat Moon in the Saenuri strongholds of Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province and Gangwon Province, as well as among voters in their 50s.Kim’s prominence was exhibited by last week’s one-on-one meeting with Park, as she sought his help in sustaining the opposition’s pressure to sack Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, one of eight people accused of having received money from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong. The prosecution is currently investigating the allegations.While Kim had urged the opposition to wait until Park returns from her Latin American tour, by Monday he reportedly decided that Lee’s resignation would be inevitable in the wake of worsening public opinion and the opposition’s move to impeach the premier. Hours after Kim’s comment, Lee tendered his resignation.Kim had also beat Park to take the initiative when the scandal broke out earlier this month by holding a press conference calling for a “thorough prosecutorial probe” into the allegations. It was only hours after Kim’s briefing that Cheong Wa Dae managed to release a statement reiterating the same position.Kim also wasted no time in canceling a scheduled high-level meeting with Cheong Wa Dae and the government, in an apparent move to distance the party from the officials embroiled in the allegations including presidential chief of staff Lee Byung-kee.Fifth-term lawmaker Kim, 63, won the chairmanship in July last year by defeating Seo Chung-won, a longtime confidant of Park, and vowed to forge “healthy tension” with the administration. While Kim was not necessarily considered an anti-Park member, he had had a “love-hate relationship” with her throughout the Lee Myung-bak administration when the rift between the pro-Parks and the pro-Lees peaked.When the party went through an internal power struggle during the 2012 presidential campaign, it was Kim who Park had sought to head her campaign headquarters. Kim, however, grew apart from Park upon the launch of her administration, as the staunch pro-Park members secured top posts within the party and Cheong Wa Dae.Now, Kim, empowered by reformist floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, is expected to continue to butt heads with Cheong Wa Dae over critical issues such as a Constitutional revision and the introduction of the open primary system that is feared by the pro-Park members to disadvantage them in the run up to next year’s parliamentary elections.Earlier this year, he urged the government to raise taxes for financing welfare ― seemingly a veiled swipe at Park as she promised welfare without a tax increase during her presidential campaign.“It appears to be a struggle between current power and future power,” said Yoon of Hanshin University. “Former presidents pulled out all stops not to lose control to party leaders. “But they ended up giving in as the presidency entered the lame-duck period,” said Yoon. The most immediate test of Kim’s leadership will be the by-elections next week, as he faces the first competition with his rival Moon in the parties’ contest for four constituencies.

Kim Moon-soo. Both members of the Saenuri Party, they are likely to pass the parliamentary hearing as Hwang has already done so and Kim is considered to be relatively neutral.Among the bureaucrats is former Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun. Yoon served as chief of the Financial Supervisory Service during the Roh Moo-hyun administration and Minister of Strategy and Finance during the Lee Myung-bak administration. He is considered a veteran administrator.“I think politicians are likely to get nominated (for the Prime Minister),” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University. “Candidates require parliamentary support ― mostly from the ruling party ― to get through parliamentary hearings. Plus, the president will need someone who can secure the ruling party’s support in her third year of presidency.” Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo stepped down late Monday, posing a challenge for the government over the premiership that has been a source of frequent political tension.The president is expected to accept his resignation after she returns. In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan will serve as an acting prime minister.Lee’s offer of resignation came only 63 days after he took office, potentially marking him the shortest-ever-serving prime minister. Five prime ministers or prime minister-designates have so far resigned during the Park administration.

YonhapPrime Minister Lee Wan-koo’s resignation will be subject to President Park’s approval. The president is expected to make a decision after her return from a tour of Latin America on Monday.Lee had faced intense media scrutiny and criticism from the opposition for allegedly accepting illegal campaign funds worth 30 million won ($28,000) from the late Sung Woan-jong in the April 2013 by-elections.Sung, a construction mogul and former lawmaker, claimed that he had handed the money to Lee in a phone interview with a local daily hours before police found him dead on April 9 in an apparent suicide at a mountain in northern Seoul.Sung had been facing charges of swindling government money from authorities, which he denied.Sung left a note on his body listing politicians who had accepted illegal campaign funds from him since 2007. The note sparked public uproar as it apparently divulged the extent of corruption still haunting South Korea, a country that observers had considered as a nation that had come a long way from its military dictatorships that ruled it before a civilian government grabbed power in 1992.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","resignation tuesday to president ,resign over graft scandal ,submitted his resignation tuesday ,his resignation tuesday ,korean prime minister submitted","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Seoul', 'YonhapPrime', 'Lee Wan - koo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35101244  0.52585614

Moon Jae-in, chair of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, urged the governing Saenuri Party to agree to an impeachment motion to be submitted by as early as Wednesday. If the ruling party accedes, it appears likely the motion will pass.“Lee’s (alleged) involvement in a graft scandal has paralyzed the government,” Moon said earlier Monday. “The longer the scandal drags on, the more burden it will be on the Park Geun-hye administration. The Saenuri Party must agree to vote on impeaching Lee,” he added. Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)Many of the majority Saenuri Party lawmakers and almost the entire opposition are expected to support the motion, parliamentary sources said. President Park must approve the motion for it to take effect.“I don’t think the scandal will even last that long,” Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University, said, suggesting that Lee could either succumb to the pressure to resign, or Park would be forced to sack him. “Not only would (the Assembly impeaching) a prime minister be unprecedented, but the president would need to distance herself from Lee unless she wants to risk becoming a lame duck with still more than half of her term left.”South Korea has considered impeachment motions for eight of its past prime ministers, and has put three of those motions to a legislative vote since the country’s founding in 1948. However, the Assembly has never approved an impeachment against a prime minister.Lee allegedly accepted 30 million won ($28,000) in unlisted campaign funds in the April 2013 parliamentary by-elections from the late Sung Woan-jong according to a local newspaper’s interview with the businessman on April 9, hours before the police found him dead in an apparent suicide.The prime minister has denied accepting any black money from Sung. Lee has also denied having close relations with the deceased. But prosecutors on Sunday said phone records showed Lee and Sung had up to 210 phone conversations since March last year, adding to the mounting evidence against Lee.Sung is the former chair of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises and a former governing party lawmaker.Prosecutors had been probing Sung in the days before his death, on allegations that the mogul had swindled government subsidies, a charge that he vehemently denied. Sung had called the investigations against him a witch-hunt at a press conference on the eve of his death.One day later, hours before his death, Sung alleged giving illegal funds to Lee and other Park administration officials, in the run-up to the 2012 presidential race and also before the 2007 Grand National Party presidential primary. The GNP is the Saenuri Party’s forerunner.Authorities on Sunday added they had evidence backing allegations that Sung had also bribed financial regulators when Keangnam Enterprises had been under a workout program in 2013.Park officials linked to Sung’s graft claims have denied receiving money. They include South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, former presidential chiefs of staff Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon, Saenuri Rep. Hong Moon-jong, and Lee, among others.Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn expressed concern on Monday at a hearing in the Assembly that the ongoing probes were challenging, as Sung’s allegations dated back to 2007, and also because he is no longer alive to provide further testimonies.The growing scandal is also expected to adversely influence the Saenuri Party candidates running in the parliamentary by-elections on April 29, observers said. Four parliamentary seats are on the line.Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung appeared to renew efforts to minimize the scandal’s impact on the coming polls when he apologized to voters on Monday.“The (Sung Woan-jong scandal) has shown how much politicians have lost the public’s trust,” Kim said. “I take this moment to apologize as one of those politicians.”“The Saenuri Party will ensure that ongoing prosecutorial probes into the scandal will be carried out justly. We will agree to any special prosecution probe if current investigations fail,” the five-term lawmaker added.The alleged bribe scandal is impeding the Park administration’s efforts to implement its policy agenda this year as lawmakers shift focus to the scandal, and away from legislative revisions to South Korea’s public service pension and other initiatives Park calls “key reforms.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","on impeaching prime minister ,party leader on monday ,election rep moon jae ,impeaching prime minister lee ,had accepted illegal campaign","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.28998032  0.40699038

The prime minister is in no position to carry out normal official duties, Moon said, adding it would be unprecedented if Lee undergoes a prosecution probe in his capacity as a sitting prime minister.The NPAD will soon hold a meeting to decide on the impeachment action, the opposition party leader said, calling for the ruling Saenuri Party's cooperation in setting a parliamentary schedule to process the motion.Despite calls for his resignation from the opposition bloc as well as some ruling party members, the prime minister has insisted he will retain the second-highest official job, denying the bribery allegations.President Park Geun-hye has said she will make a decision on Lee's fate after returning home from her 12-day trip to South America early next week.The Park administration and the ruling party have been roiled in the bribery scandal which erupted earlier this month when Sung Wan-jong, the former head of a mid-size construction firm, left a list of heavyweight politicians whom, Sung claimed, he has given money. Sung hanged himself amid a widening prosecution investigation into embezzlement allegations. A prosecution probe is underway over the bribery scandal, which also involves Park's former and incumbent chief secretaries and ruling party bigwigs.The scandal comes to the fore as the parties are campaigning for parliamentary by-elections slated for April 29 where four seats are up for grabs.A group of seven ruling party lawmakers pressured the prime minister to step down.""Prime Minister Lee should file for resignation even before any evidence comes out from the judiciary because he is heavily burdening the president's state management and the ruling party's reform drive,"" Rep. Ha Tae-keung said during a morning meeting of the first- and second-term lawmakers.The parliament can initiate an impeachment motion against a prime minister if one-third of the lawmakers endorse it. The impeachment proceedings would be referred to the Constitutional Court if half of the 294-strong National Assembly votes in favor.Eight impeachment bills have been proposed against prime ministers, but none of them passed through the National Assembly.

Moon Jae-in, chair of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said accusations that Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo took 30 million won ($28,000) from the late Sung Woan-jong justified an impeachment motion at the National Assembly. Lee has denied taking the money.“Prime Minister Lee must resign. His involvement in the case is taking up his time and energy,” Moon said. “That impedes him from running this country. This is also eventually harmful to the Park administration.”The comments come after President Park announced plans to make a decision on Lee after her return from a Latin America tour ending on April 27. Some governing Saenuri Party officials also back sacking Lee.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, said it opposes any motion for Lee’s impeachment, and urged the opposition to wait until Park returns.“If the prime minister were to step down immediately, an administrative vacuum is inevitable ... we should wait as the president has pledged to (decide on Lee) once she returns,” Saenuri spokesman Rep. Park Dae-chul said.Sung alleged that he gave Lee illegal campaign funds in the April 2013 parliamentary by-election during an interview with the Kyunghyang Shinmun on April 9, hours before police found him dead in an apparent suicide. Sung was the former chair of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises and an ex-legislator with the Saenuri Party. Prosecutors had been probing him for allegedly swindling government subsidies in the weeks before his death. Rain fell in the Supreme Prosecutors' Office in Seocho-gu, Seoul, Sunday. (Yonhap)In the interview, Sung accused prominent Park officials of taking illegal funds from him in the run-up to the 2012 presidential race. They include presidential secretaries, South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, and Lee, among others.Authorities plan to summon past aides of Sung this week, to verify his accusations.“It is hard to tell how this case will turn out. Although we may need a lot of time considering the way the probe is going, we may encounter help along the way if we continue to exert all efforts,” an official was quoted as telling reporters on Friday.Among those aides is Park Joon-ho, an ex-Sung aide and current chief of Onyang Hot Spring Hotel, a subsidiary of Keangnam Enterprises. Prosecutors suspect Park could be withholding testimonies supporting claims that Sung gave illegal funds to LeeProsecutors will also question 52-year-old Yoon, whose given name prosecutors did not publicize. Sung claimed that Yoon had delivered 100 million won to Hong in 2011 under his orders.Hong has denied taking the money. Prosecutors will seek testimonies from another aide to Sung surnamed Han, suspected to have knowledge of the whereabouts of illegal funds at Keangnam Enterprises amounting up to 3.2 billion won. Prosecutors think the money could have been used for bribes.Sung’s accusations sparked a public uproar this month against the Park administration and the Saenuri Party, as many of their top officials are alleged to have taken billions from Sung.The unexpected scandal poses risks to the government’s ability to implement its proposed changes to South Korea’s public service pension, labor market, and initiatives aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship, as public attention sways lawmakers’ focus to the scandal.The scandal is also expected to shake the prospects for Saenuri Party candidates running in this month’s parliamentary by-elections, set to contest four seats at the National Assembly.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","sunday threatened to impeach ,accepting bribes in 2013 ,impeach the prime minister ,leader on sunday threatened ,opposition threatens to impeach","['Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.45442384  0.05535908

Hong Joon-pyo, according to reports. The former ruling party chairman is one of eight whose names appeared in a memo left by former Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong before his apparent suicide last week.  An official enters the office of the National Digital Forensic Center as the prosecution focuses on recovering data from devices owned by those linked to Sung Woan-jong on Friday. (Yonhap)Hong, a former ruling party leader, is accused of accepting 100 million won from Sung through a middleman.The special investigation team has seized a 30-page secret document from Sung’s aides. It reportedly includes 14 names of political officials, including up to eight from the main opposition party. Authorities said Friday they were looking into 34 pieces of evidence, including hard drives and cell phones confiscated from Keangnam Enterprise and the late chairman’s aides. The investigation team has sent material to a digital forensic department to restore deleted files, which are believed to contain a list of lawmakers who Sung and his company delivered money to. Authorities have also reportedly secured surveillance footage of Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo’s campaign office when he was running for a by-election in 2013. Sung claimed he delivered 30 million won to Lee. The prime minister, however, has denied the claim and his ties with Sung. Authorities have refused to elaborate on plans to summon politicians, citing a lack of evidence.“For now, we are trying to restore (deleted) files as much as possible in order to go to the next level,“ said an official at the team. “Questioning of (witnesses or suspects) could only start after reviewing documents.”Amid the prosecution’s widening probe, Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung urged the nation to root out rampant political corruption and praised President Park Geun-hye, saying she can effectively lead the anti-graft mission. Kim and Park met in a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon before the president left for a 12-day Latin America trip.The president said she would take every possible means to resolve escalating graft allegations, including launching an independent probe. She also said she would determine the fate of the embattled prime minister after she returns from her trip. Lee, one of the eight on the graft memo, has been pressured from both parties to step down from his post. But Rep. Moon Jae-in, chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, lashed out at the prosecution over reports the authorities could include opposition lawmakers as part of their graft probe.The prosecution has raided former Keangnam executives who managed finances for the firm between 2002 and 2008, when former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun was in power. He said the prosecution is diluting its ongoing investigation into ruling party members. “(The prosecution) appears to be attempting to water down the investigation by dragging the opposition party to it. I feel outraged,” said Rep. Moon.He also urged the prime minister to voluntarily step down from the post, saying it would keep his honor intact and release the political burden from President Park. Despite mounting calls, Lee told reporters Friday he would focus on state affairs “more diligently” than before during the president’s trip to South America.Park’s approval rating dropped to 34 percent this week, down 5 percentage points from the previous week, according to local polls by Gallup Korea.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","graft scandal the prosecution ,fresh list of politicians ,main opposition parties investigators ,questioning political heavyweights late ,dragged into graft scandal","['South Gyeongsang', 'Hong Joon - pyo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59799606  0.15451807

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday denied having close relations with deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong, who has claimed he gave large sums of money to prominent Korean politicians.Sung, formerly head of Keangnam Enterprises and a lawmaker for the ruling Saenuri Party, was found dead last week in an apparent suicide. He was being investigated for corruption and embezzlement. In an interview with local newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun shortly before his death, he claimed he was framed due to his alleged friendship with Ban.“This case has nothing to do with me. I’ve met (Sung) at official events and I knew him, but not well,” Ban said in a recent interview. “I have no interest in Korean politics, and I barely have time for it. I’m perplexed, since I’ve made this perfectly clear.”Sung has accused Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo of directing a corruption probe. He claims he and his company were unfairly targeted due to the prime minister’s concerns about a close relationship with Sung and Ban. Sung had reportedly contacted several politicians to raise support for Ban while his brother had worked for Keangnam Enterprises. Ban, a former foreign minister, has often been considered a prospective candidate for the next presidency, although he has officially denied he has such ambitions.In the aftermath of Sung’s accusation, Lee and seven others on the supposed corruption list have come under pressure. Lee, in particular, has received mounting calls to resign from opposition lawmakers and even some Saenuri members.The prosecution, which is investigating the graft scandal, has reportedly found another list of 14 politicians suspected to have received money from Sung.

The result came as the Park government and the ruling Saenuri Party have become embroiled in the scandal that erupted last week following the suicide of a businessman.Before his suicide, Sung Wan-jong, a former head of a mid-size construction firm, claimed he gave money to eight heavyweight politicians, including former and incumbent presidential chiefs of staff, and Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo.""More respondents took issue with personnel and leadership problems in assessing the president's job performance as several ruling party bigwigs were mentioned in the broadening Sung Wan-jong list scandal,"" an official of the research firm said.

(Yonhap)During Thursday’s interpellation, Lee said he did not remember meeting Sung during his run for a parliamentary seat in 2013. The comment ran counter to his earlier remarks to local media that he never met him alone. When Rep. Yoo Dae-un of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused him of flip-flopping, he replied, “What I meant was that I have no recollection of such a meeting.” Lee said he could have been misunderstood because of his Chungcheong Province dialect.Lee’s comments came after several of Sung’s former employees and aides testified that the two had a private meeting. Prior to his death, Sung claimed that he handed Lee 30 million won ($28,000) during the supposed meeting at his campaign office two years ago. Lee had denied having a personal relationship with Sung, but after a memo surfaced showing that the two had met 23 times over the past 20 months, he said that Sung could have been one of the Saenuri Party members that he met several times a day as he was floor leader of the party.In what has been viewed as an attempt to undermine his relationship with Sung ― who was formerly a member of a President Park Geun-hye’s 2012 election committee ― Lee claimed that he did not participate in the campaign as he had blood cancer. But after a video of him urging support for Park at a rally emerged, he admitted that he participated in “two or three” rallies. Lee’s unconventional choice of words has also hurt him. He pledged Tuesday to “end his life” if any evidence of him receiving money from Sung turned up. These words sparked a cold reaction from opposition lawmakers and even some ruling party members.“I think was I too emotional when I said it, and I’ve already apologized yesterday (for the comment),” he said Thursday. Despite mounting pressure to step down, Lee maintained that he would continue to carry out his duties as the premier.The NPAD stepped up their offensive and said they could choose to push for Lee’s impeachment.“If (the prime minister) himself does not step down and the president continues to do nothing about the situation, our party has no choice but to take a more drastic decision,” NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in told reporters. Under Korean law, one-third of National Assembly members have to consent to propose a premier’s dismissal, and a majority has to agree in order for it to be passed.As the graft scandal shook the political circles, the prosecution stepped up its probe into Keangnam Enterprises by raiding the company’s headquarters along with residence of 11 of Sung’s aides. They also summoned a 43-year-old confident of Sung surnamed Lee, who worked as his secretary and aide during Sung’s tenure at the National Assembly.The investigation focused on tracking the money flow that leaked from the company, which may have been used for illegal lobbying.Meanwhile, additional release of Sung’s interview with the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper showed that Sung believed he became the target of the prosecutorial investigation for his close relationship with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is often considered a prospective candidate for next presidency. Sung had reportedly contacted several politicians to raise support for Ban while Ban’s brother had worked for Keangnam Enterprises.

306,306,P.M. under siege in graft scandal,Calls for Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo to resign intensified Tuesday amid a burgeoning graft scandal involving a deceased businessman who reportedly testified that Lee took a large sum of money while he was running for a parliamentary seat two years ago.Korean daily the Kyunghyang Shinmun released a lengthy script and audio file of the late Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong accusing Lee of taking 30 million won at his c...,"Calls for Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo to resign intensified Tuesday amid a burgeoning graft scandal involving a deceased businessman who reportedly testified that Lee took a large sum of money while he was running for a parliamentary seat two years ago.Korean daily the Kyunghyang Shinmun released a lengthy script and audio file of the late Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong accusing Lee of taking 30 million won at his campaign office in 2013. Lee was seeking to reenter politics through a by-election at the time after suffering from blood cancer. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo responds to a lawmaker’s question at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Lee denied the claim, reiterating that he was neither close to him nor received the money. The premier also said he would take part in the prosecution’s probe, amid opposition lawmakers demanding he step down from his post.“If any evidence that (I) received the money show up, I will end my life,” he said during an interpellation session at the National Assembly.The newspaper raised the fresh allegation by releasing a third part of the 50-minute telephone interview carried out before his apparent suicide last Thursday.“I gave him 30 million won in cash during the previous by-election,” Sung was quoted as saying. When asked if he was aware whether the money was officially submitted as campaign funds, Sung said: “What (official) report? He gobbled it up.”In an apparent effort to distance itself from Lee, the ruling Saenuri Party held an emergency meeting in the afternoon and pressed the prosecution to question the prime minister first. The party leadership, however, said they failed to reach a conclusion on whether to urge Lee to resign before he responds to the prosecution’s summons.The party also vowed that it would not protect any members on the list.“Regardless of ranks, (officials) should face stern investigation if they are accused of corruption,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min.Yoo said earlier in the day that the party could establish an independent counsel if the prosecution fails to satisfy the public’s demand of a transparent investigation. Lee was one of eight political heavyweights whose names were written on a memo left by the late businessman. He wrote the amount of money next to the names, except for Lee and Lee Byung-kee, the incumbent chief of staff at the presidential office. Sung was found dead on a mountain last week after facing charges of irregularities over his involvement in failed energy projects during the Lee Myung-bak administration. The businessman also accused the prime minister of directing the prosecution’s investigation into Keangnam Enterprises, suggesting the probe began a month after he delivered a public address to eradicate corruption in Korea. Sung claimed his company had been unfairly targeted. The prosecution has launched a special investigation into Sung’s testimonies, which have rattled political circles. Suspicions intensified that the people on the list, most of whom are close confidants of President Park Geun-hye, accepted money from Sung and used it to support her election campaign in 2012. The eight politicians include Park’s two former chiefs of staff ― Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon ― as well as the current mayors of Busan and Incheon.Calls have been mounting from the main opposition party to set up an independent probe, arguing that the prosecution has failed to stay politically neutral. All the politicians on the list have said they will cooperate with the prosecution’s investigation. But critics and the opposition party argued that the prosecution won’t be free from the influences of Cheong Wa Dae, or the Prime Minister’s Office, citing the tradition of authorities reporting the investigation processes of high-profile cases to the upper offices.The presidential office maintained its earlier position, reiterating that it would wait for the prosecution’s probe.“Cheong Wa Dae has nothing to say,” said presidential spokesperson Min Kyung-wook.“The prosecution’s probe has begun and the prime minister has said that he would cooperate with the investigation.”Rep. Moon Jae-in, chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, pressed the prime minister and chief of staff to step down from their posts and urged President Park to speak up.“The case of a sitting premier and chief of staff facing the prosecution’s probe as suspects is unprecedented in history,” he said. “The two have to decide on their fate before additional suspicions are raised.”South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, who was also on the list, denied allegations that he accepted 100 million won from Sung through a mutual friend.The former chairman of the Grand National Party, the predecessor of the Saenuri Party, wrote on his Facebook page that he had never met Sung in private, except for a meeting in Seosan in 2011 where they just exchanged greetings. Hong is one of the first to be investigated by prosecutors. He is suspected of receiving 100 million won from Sung through his former aide in 2011 while running in the party leadership race.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","to resign intensified tuesday ,scandal involving deceased businessman ,resign intensified tuesday amid ,resign intensified tuesday ,was running for parliamentary","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Kyunghyang', 'Keangnam', 'Sung Woan', 'Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15059496 -0.11024

The resolution was put to a vote four days after a special parliamentary panel on history supported it.“We strongly condemn repeated provocations by the Japanese government that infringe on our territorial sovereignty and fabricate history,” said the resolution.“We express our regret over (Tokyo’s) two-sided approach: On the surface, it talks about fostering a future-oriented relationship on the 50th anniversary of the normalization of ties, but behind the scenes, it distorts and fabricates history, and encroaches upon our territory.”The resolution came after Tokyo recently published a set of foreign and defense policy papers in which it described Dokdo as part of its territory. It also approved elementary and middle school textbooks in which Dokdo was described as Japan’s islets.“The issue of distorted history in school textbooks is fostering conflicts not only for the current generation, but also for future generations of both countries. And we express our serious regrets over it,” the resolution reads.The resolution also lashed out at Tokyo for approving middle-school history textbooks that contain arguments about the “Imna Japanese Headquarters.”Some in Japan have argued that Japan advanced into the southern part of the Korean Peninsula during the late fourth century and ruled part of the peninsula with the Imna Japanese Headquarters in Korea’s ancient Gaya Kingdom (A.D. 42-562). “Talk about the Imna Japanese Headquarters represents Japan’s intention to return to its past militarism. Tokyo should immediately repent for it. We call on it to rectify (the historical distortion),” the resolution said.The passage of the resolution reflected the growing anti-Japanese sentiment here, which has made it difficult for both governments to pursue practical cooperation in security and other areas. Washington’s push for the trilateral security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo has also been stymied by historical animosities between the two countries. Amid deepening public resentment, President Park Geun-hye and her Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe have not been able to arrange a bilateral summit yet. Since her inauguration in February 2013, Park has met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping six times.The conservative Tokyo government has shown a revisionist view of history, refusing to accept calls from Seoul and Beijing for more contrition regarding its wartime atrocities including the sexual enslavement of Asian women during World War II.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday passed resolution condemning ,assembly resolution condemns japan ,passed resolution condemning tokyo ,lawmaker abstained the resolution ,resolution condemning tokyo repeated","['the National Assembly', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61963952  0.28188011

Lee was one of the eight political heavyweights whose names were written on a memo left by Sung before his apparent suicide last Thursday. The late businessman, who was under prosecutorial investigation over a failed energy project implemented during the Lee Myung-bak administration, claimed that he delivered the money to them.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy intensified the attack, urging the prime minister to step down from the post and raising speculation that he may attempt to control the prosecution’s probe. Lee defended himself, saying there would be no sacred ground in the investigation and that he was no exception. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo (left) listens to a question at a parliamentary interpellation session at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung also refuted the NPAD’s attack, saying he was willing to cooperate with the prosecution if the authorities zeroed in on campaign finances of the 2012 presidential election.The Saenuri leader affirmed that he had been in charge of the presidential election and that there were no illegal campaign funds. He retorted that the prosecution’s probe should also cover the NPAD’s finances.The burgeoning scandal also appeared to show a rift within the ruling party, with the Saenuri Party chief implying he would not hold a trilateral meeting with Prime Minister Lee and Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee for the time being. The list included the names of the president’s two former chiefs of staff and her current one. Kim Moo-sung was not among the list. The Saenuri leader was a campaign manager in Park’s camp during the 2012 presidential election, but reportedly was not one of the pro-Park members who directly managed the party’s funds and personnel organization at the time. “I cannot raise more suspicions by meeting with the people whose names are on the list,” Kim told reporters on Monday. “I have no plans to hold (the trilateral meeting).” The ruling party leader also dismissed the possibility that he collaborated with Cheong Wa Dae before he held an emergency news conference on Sunday urging the prosecution for a thorough probe.“In a situation where Cheong Wa Dae’s chief of staff is on the list, I wasn’t able to consult on the matter with him,” he said at the news conference.Some suggested that Kim moving separately from Cheong Wa Dae reflects his plan to distance himself from the presidential office during the scandal to protect the party as well as his prominence as a presidential hopeful. Saenuri lawmakers expressed concern that the scandal would have a negative impact on the party ahead of the April 29 by-election. The election, set to fill three vacant parliamentary seats, is seen as a barometer of public sentiment, as well as a pre-test for the 2016 general election and 2017 presidential election. Speculations, meanwhile, are escalating that the Park camp used illicit and unregistered funds delivered by local businessmen for her election in exchange of favors.The Park camp notified the election watchdog that it spent 47.91 billion won ($43.48 million) for the presidential election ― 500 million won less than her rival Moon Jae-in’s camp reported. Pundits pointed out that Park’s camp may have spent massive amounts of illegal funds to micromanage both small and large electoral constituencies across the country by operating unofficial organizations there. Political parties have been widely reported to use illicit funds delivered by businessmen like Sung in order to build and manage such networks. Such practices are usually kept secret, according to local reports.Saenuri Rep. Hong Moon-jong, Busan Mayor Seo Byung-soo and Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok ― whose names were on Sung’s list ― played central roles in raising and managing funds for Park’s camp.On the memo, “200 million won” was handwritten next to Hong Moon-jong’s name. Hong served as Park‘s campaign manager in the 2012 presidential election.

No won figures were written next to Park's current chief and the prime minister.

Authorities launched a special investigation team Sunday to probe the bribery allegations into the political heavyweights, most of whom are regarded as pro-Park figures. Later in the afternoon, the president, in a statement released by her spokesperson, urged the prosecution to “sternly deal with the case without sanctuary in accordance with the rule of law and principle.” Observers say the investigation into the memo, as well as the full script of the phone interview still unreleased by the Kyunghyang Shinmun, will likely have massive political repercussions and could possibly tarnish Park’s image as a clean leader.This image is a strong weapon that has given her an implicit political cause to drive massive reform efforts so far. The president has been pushing ahead with overhauling four sectors ― labor, education, public offices and finance ― by calling them “a must” for the country’s economic revitalization. However, the scandal could hold back Park’s reform drive as it centers on her long-time political aides ― those who played pivotal roles in elections that Park ran before becoming the president. According to the newspaper, Sung said he gave about $100,000 to Kim Ki-choon in 2006 and 700 million ($640,000) to Huh Tae-yeol in 2007, when Park ran in the presidential primary held by the Grand National Party, the predecessor of the ruling Saenuri Party. Both Kim and Huh served as chiefs of staff for the Park administration. The memo also includes the incumbent chief of staff Lee Byung-kee. All of the officials have denied the allegations.Some also suggest that the scandal could put her into early lameduck status, as the attention could shift to the general election to be held next year and also the presidential election in the following year.The scandal comes at a time when Park is looking to stabilize her leadership and draw attention to her sales diplomacy to Latin America. She will tour Brazil and three other South American countries from Thursday for 12 days. Political pundits say the possibility is high for Park to speak out on the bribery scandal to quell angry sentiments before she leaves for Latin America. She could urge the prosecution for a thorough investigation, while stressing that she has remained clean from corruption and bribery attempts.Since last year, Park has been struggling to restore public confidence over criticism about her government’s botched rescue missions as well as her response, which was seen as lacking sincerity. A series of political scandals involving conflicting groups of aides, as well as the government’s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance, have also damaged her credibility. Presidential documents were leaked to the media late last year raising speculation over lax discipline within Cheong Wa Dae. Park also came under fire after she refused to abandon her aides who were involved in a related influence-peddling scandal. Her popularity plummeted to below 30 percent early this year.Her approval rating bounced back to the 40 percent mark in the first week of April as she tried to break away from her image as an uncommunicative leader by appearing at a series of public events in recent months.

The April Revolution in 2010 ousted former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and established a new constitution and parliament as the first Central Asian country. Bakiyev replaced his predecessor Askar Akayev in a landslide election victory in 2005 after the Tulip Revolution.“Since 2010, our country embarked on a path of democracy and development. There’s no turning back,” the ambassador echoed Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev’s address on Tuesday, which paid homage to the revolutionary achievements, in an interview with The Korea Herald. Kyrgyzstan, where 28 percent of the population is ethnic minority, is taking steps to integrate multiethnic groups and rebuild housing and infrastructure. To end corruption, the government implemented the Istanbul Action Plan at the OECD meeting in Paris in March. It also adopted the National Strategy for Sustainable Development aimed at achieving social integration; establishing the rule of law; improving business environment; and eliminating poverty.A string of market reforms has been installed by privatizing state companies; setting up fair rules of competition; and opening doors to foreign investment through free economic zones. Agriculture, mining, transport, communications and tourism sectors have potential for collaboration. “Unlike the Chinese, Russian, Turkish and Iranian companies, which have long operated in our country, trade and investment between Kyrgyzstan and Korea do not adequately reflect the two economies’ growth prospects,” Chotonov said. The ambassador added that Korean companies can invest in hydropower and infrastructure construction. A delegation from the Kyrgyzstani Parliament and Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration is participating in the World Water Forum 2015 in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. Kyrgyzstan is the third-largest producer of hydropower in the Commonwealth of Independent States, generating over 14 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually from its 252 rivers. The country also produces 840 million tons oil-equivalent of renewable energy through hydro, solar and wind powers.The Kyrgyz government signed an agreement with the Korea International Cooperation Agency last year to receive official development assistance. Korea’s POSCO and Mineral Resources Authority and Mine Reclamation Corporation are operating in the capital Bishkek.

The party will soon begin talks with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as the implementation of the new nomination system requires a legal revision.Calls have been mounting from both parties to allow more rank-and-file party members and ordinary voters to participate in the process of nominating candidates, as part of political reform to guarantee more transparent nomination process and to give more opportunities for newcomers.“The only way to restore public trust and eradicate irregularities in political circles is to establish party democracy,” Saenuri chairman Kim Moo-sung was quoted as saying by lawmakers who attended the meeting. “The party democracy begins with returning the nomination rights to the people,” he said.The plan, however, is expected to continue to face resistance from within and outside the party.The scheme has been pushed by the leaders of the rival parties, but their proposal has drawn mixed views.Proponents say the new system would reflect a wide range of voter sentiment and help resolve feuds between party groups wanting to secure more nominations ahead of elections. Opponents, however, raised concerns that the new measure would limit parties’ election strategies and that it may protect the vested interests of incumbent lawmakers and other elected officials.The system, though in a limited way, was tried in previous elections. But parties have so far failed to adopt the system on a full scale.According to the rules suggested by the Saenuri Party, the open primaries will be held on the first Saturday, 60 days before the elections. Candidates seeking nomination through open primaries should also register themselves a year before the election from the current rule of 120 days in advance.

Lawmakers from the ruling and the main opposition party are also expected to intensify attacks on each other ahead of the by-elections scheduled later this month, as the event is seen as a barometer of public sentiment.The ruling Saenuri Party has set its priority on passing a bill aimed at overhauling the current pension system for public officials, a plan proposed by President Park Geun-hye to reduce the hefty financial burden on future generations. The plan, however, has been facing vehement resistance from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The NPAD has been taking sides with public servants, lashing out at the government and the ruling party for failing to convince officials to endorse the plan that forces them to increase their contribution and receive less by the time they retire. Supreme Court judge nominee Park Sang-ok attends a hearing at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)“The (Saenuri) party has been threatening to pass the bill within a deadline, without putting efforts to persuade public servants,” said NPAD Rep. Seo Young-kyo.Lawmakers engaged in a war of nerves on the first day of the extraordinary session as they held a controversial confirmation hearing on Park Sang-ok, a nominee for Supreme Court judge.NPAD lawmakers pressed Park during the grilling session to withdraw his nomination, saying the former prosecutor was unqualified to represent the top court. The hearing was held after more than two months of political wrangling over the candidate’s alleged ethical misdeeds.The opposition lawmakers had refused to hold the session citing his role in the 1987 investigation of police officers accused of torturing a student activist to death. The prosecution had come under fire after a revelation by Catholic priests that there were more police officers involved in the torture than those it had indicted. The NPAD has claimed that the justice nominee was responsible for the cover-up and urged him to voluntarily withdraw his nomination.Park expressed regret to the family of the student activist, but said he was not aware of the police’s attempt to whitewash the incident at the time.“I want to deliver words of consolation (to the victim’s family) and blame myself that I had no power at that time to identify (the cover-up),” he told lawmakers at the grilling session.The rival parties agreed to continue the parliamentary probe into resource diplomacy until early next month. The probe has hit a stumbling block as parties failed to agree on the witnesses to be called for the parliamentary hearing since late last month.The NPAD called on former President Lee Myung-bak, and his older brother Lee Sang-deuk, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan who was then energy minister, former Vice Energy Minister Park Young-june and Energy Minister Yoon Sang-jick to appear as witnesses.The Saenuri Party rejected the demand and in turn urged NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in, former chief of staff at the presidential office during the Roh Moo-hyun administration, to appear as a witness. The opposition party is also expected to escalate its criticism against the ruling party over the government’s botched response for the Sewol crisis. April 16 marks the first anniversary of the tragic accident that left more than 300 killed last year. Some of the victims’ families have demanded that the government scrap its ordinances drafted for the Sewol special bill that passed late last year. They claimed the ordinances would hurt the neutrality of a planned probe into the government’s rescue operation during the ferry disaster. The Maritime Ministry has proposed to include a number of its officials on the investigative team.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","assembly faces arduous april ,tragedy lawmakers ,battlefield for rival parties ,sewol tragedy lawmakers ,lock horns over contentious","['the National Assembly ’s', 'Sewol']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54323727  0.11744222

The discussions focused on the issue of the labor market’s dual structure ― the huge gap between full-time regular employees and nonregular workers ― pending topics like wages, working hours and retirement, the issue of partnership among tripartite partners, and other policy and institutional improvements. Kim Dae-hwan (center), chairman of the government-labor-management committee for labor reforms, preside over the plenary meeting at the Seoul Government Complex in central Seoul on March 30. (Yonhap)In particular, in light of the importance and urgency of the pending issues such as the reduction of working hours and ordinary wages ― whether to include regularly-paid bonuses in ordinary wage calculations ― they agreed to come up with “principles and direction for a solution of the pending issues and labor market structure improvement.” Details are expected to be arranged in the first half of the year.The trilateral meetings reportedly reached some agreement, especially on ordinary wages, plans to reduce working hours and an extension of the retirement age. However, labor unions strongly resisted a government proposal to grant employers more discretion in firing underperforming regular workers. News reports also suggested that management opposed the labor groups’ suggestion to force them to give nonregular workers regular status if their work is similar to that of regular workers.The presidential office took the unusual step of reminding the panel to find common ground, stressing “it is necessary for the nation’s economic growth and future generations.”The overhaul of the labor market is one of the reform measures President Park Gyeun-hye is pushing as part of her three-year economic revitalization plan. She has argued that labor reform is key to job creation.To increase labor market flexibility, the government and management have urged labor groups to accept the idea of lifting some labor regulations for employers so they can replace underperforming workers. But labor groups oppose the idea, saying it would eventually allow businesses to seek massive lay-offs and pressure poorly performing workers to accept salary reductions. The idea is intended to force regular workers out and replace them with nonregular workers, which would lower the overall quality of jobs, they claim.Given the continued mistrust between the concerned parties, it is unlikely that they will reach an agreement anytime soon. Unions have even threatened a general strike if the government and management push for reforms without consent from workers.Therefore it may be prudent to take a look at Korea’s labor market from a historical perspective, before we analyze what, exactly, are some of the current problems.Seeing eye-to-eyeSince the 1960s, Korea has achieved remarkable economic growth, mainly due to cheap labor and diligent and skilled workers. Labor policies during this period were intended to guarantee the basic livelihood of workers and provide sufficient workers for industrial development. But it was not until the mid-1970s that the government recognized the importance of labor issues.Until then, industrial relations were not viewed as a major social and economic issue, but in the following years, when the country’s labor market saturated, the problem of working conditions replaced that of job creation as the central social and economic focus. Many fierce labor disputes erupted, which resulted in severe government crackdowns.In the early 1980s, workers’ awareness of their rights became widespread, especially with regard to claiming their fair share of the fruits of the economic growth achieved in the past two decades. However, the government cracked down on the labor movement. As a result, in spite of the marked increase in the number of workers from 1980 to 1987 and the growing awareness of their rights, the number of unionized workers remained at around 1 million.With rapid democratization in 1987, Korea underwent significant changes in its labor movement. A number of new labor unions were formed, and many businesses saw a dramatic increase in disputes.The shortage of manual workers in the construction and manufacturing sectors became acute as workers became less willing to take on difficult, dirty and dangerous jobs.Labor was no longer cheap, as wages rapidly increased. These changes forced the nation to transform from a labor-intensive economy a more technology-based one.The labor policy underwent dramatic changes through the reduction of government intervention based on the principle of labor-management autonomy and the revision of labor-related laws to meet international standards.The government also made efforts to actively promote the interests of workers with the institutionalization of the minimum wage system, the reduction of working hours and the abolition of legal restrictions on strikes.Trade unions called for the introduction of new labor laws in the early 1990s to ensure that job seekers received appropriate vocational training to meet the demand for new skills generated by structural changes in companies. When the nation was hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the urgent need to reform both the social and economic sectors was recognized.While making continuous efforts to reach a consensus on major labor issues, the government revised labor laws to meet international standards in 1997 with the founding of the Labor-Management Relations Reform Committee, thereby achieving remarkable improvements in the area of basic labor rights. However, it had its own side effects.The Tripartite Commission was formed as the need to draw a national consensus for the sake of overcoming the economic crisis became clear after Korea had to introduce reforms after being bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. A historic consensus was reached among labor, management and the government over structural reforms and burden-sharing in February 1998. On the basis of this consensus, many businesses could implement corporate restructuring measures, including employment adjustments and pay freezes.Since 2000, there have been both legislative reforms such as shortening working hours, enacting the Law on Nonregular Works, and structural reforms such as the spread of industry-level unions and the expansion of labor’s political activities.Thanks to such efforts, the economy rebounded quickly. Industrial relations, however, worsened as expectations ran high and more structural reforms got underway. The number of factors that contributed to labor-management conflicts, such as lay-offs, a decrease in new hiring, a larger number of nonregular workers, a widening gap between labor and management positions on wage hikes, compensation and provisional seizure claims against strikers etc., has been on the rise, in line with worsening economic conditions.Experts have pointed out that despite this, when comparing Korea’s labor standards and regulations to those of advanced economies, it is important to keep in mind that the core labor standards have developed through an evolutionary process over more than a century, and it has been less than 30 years since the democratic movement in 1987 began to free Korea from its long past of oppression and autocratic control. It can be safely said that Korea’s labor movement is still in a transitional period, in which the labor structure is slowly converging with global labor culture and practices.Trade unionsTrade unions in Korea are broadly divided into three organizational types: enterprise-level trade unions, federations of trade unions and nationwide federations of trade unions. There are 42 federations of enterprise-level unions and two nationwide federations.The Federation of Korean Trade Unions was formed in 1961 after a military coup, and the dissolution of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions and its affiliates. It was placed under the guidance of the military authorities and was the sole legal trade union center in Korea until the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions was recognized in November 1999. Of the two, the KCTU is generally considered to be more militant.As of the end of 2013 ― the latest available government estimates ― the number of unionized workers in Korea was 1.848 million, up 66,000 from the previous year. The unionization rate was 10.3 percent, meaning that 1 in 10 Korean workers is a member of a trade union. According to a report on trade unions published by the Ministry of Employment and Labor, Korea’s unionization rate fell from 19.8 percent in 1989, and declined to single digits (9.8 percent) for the first time in 2010. In 2011, the figure bounced back to 10.1 percent, due to the law allowing multiple unions to operate within one company, and has stayed around 10.3 percent for the past few years.Segmenting the number of unionized workers by umbrella organizations shows that the FKTU had the largest membership of 819,755 members (44.4 percent); the KCTU had 626,035 members (20.7 percent); the Korean Labor Unions Confederation had 22,221 members (1.1 percent); and the remaining 381,575 workers (20.7 percent) belonged to independent trade unions. The number of members climbed by 11,000 (1.4 percent) for the FKTU; by 21,000 (3.5 percent) for the KCTU; by 2,000 (12.9 percent) for the KLUC; and by 32,000 (9 percent) for independent unions.At end-December 2014, it was announced that the FKTU and the KLUC would merge. They claimed that the decision to reconstitute as a single organization was “to eliminate unnecessary conflict between labor organizations, make themselves more reliable for the public, and play a bigger role in social issues based on a higher unionization rate.”As a result of the merger, the FKTU will take on 15,000 government workers belonging to the KLUC to reach 960,000 members.The number of independent unions, meanwhile, went up eightfold, compared with 2003, perhaps due to a new tendency emerging among workers to pursue practical interests, instead of politically-charged labor movements, the report noted.According to sectorial classification, private sector labor unionization is 9.1 percent, the government employee unionization rate is 63.5 percent, and the educational worker unionization rate is 16.8 percent.It is important to mention that the ESDC has been seriously disrupted by the KCTU’s struggles against the government and the withdrawal of the FKTU. However, in mid-August 2014, the FKTU returned to the ESDC and the urgent labor issues of ordinary wages, working hour reductions and the retirement age are currently under discussion.Labor relations As per the latest available figures, in 2014 there were over 100 labor disputes and 551,305 lost working days. Given the stalemate in the ESDC talks, one can only expect the conflict between labor and management to degenerate this year.For that matter, according to a recent survey of 306 companies by the Korea Employer’s Federation, 63.1 percent of respondents said “industrial relations will worsen in 2015 than last year.” Being more specific, 11.4 percent of companies responded that “industrial relations will worsen much,” “industrial relations will worsen a little” (51.7 percent), “similar to last year” (33.5 percent), and “more stable” (3.4 percent). The most common answer from companies was “industrial relations will worsen” due to conflicts surrounding industrial relations regarding ordinary wages, the reduction of working hours, and in-house subcontracts and partner firms (outsourcing).The major risk factor in industrial relations in 2015 are legal conflicts surrounding pending industrial relations issues, conflicts over the improvement of the wage system, and the improvement of labor related law and systems.The companies which projected unstable industrial relations in 2015 pointed out legal conflicts surrounding pending industrial relations issues, conflicts over the improvement of the wage system, and the improvement of labor-related law, and systems. In particular, companies viewed the expansion of legal conflicts surrounding pending industrial relations issues as the biggest risk factor since the burden on companies increased due to lawsuits regarding ordinary wages on industrial sites, ruling on additional payments for holiday work, and ruling on the violation of illegal dispatches.Companies projected that the major issues in the 2015 wage negotiation and collective bargaining would be wage increases, extended scope of ordinary wages, welfare expansion and employment security like prohibiting reconstruction. In particular, it is presumed that many companies would carry out only wage negotiations and trade unions would focus on demanding wage hikes and welfare expansion that are the major interests of union members.Moreover, the government announced its Comprehensive Measures for Nonregular Workers in 2014, stating its intention to work on structural reform of the labor market ― enhancing flexibility within the labor market and reforming wage systems.Furthermore, discussions on changes to labor law and regulations will not be easy since labor is strongly opposed to the government’s policies in this area. Conflict between the government and labor may well intensify as the government plans structural adjustments to public institutions and public pensions. Under these circumstances, collective bargaining this year is likely to be difficult.Issues on handOn Dec. 29, the government submitted comprehensive plans for nonregular workers to the ESDC aimed at eliminating the abuse of and discrimination against nonregular workers, and narrowing the gap in terms of working conditions between regular and nonregular workers. To achieve these goals, the plans focus on reducing the differences between workers of different status, enhancing job security, and improving regulations for the labor market.As of end-2014, the number of nonregular workers was about 32.4 percent of the total paid workforce, a 53.5 percent of female workers. The percentage of nonregular workers among workers aged 60 or older was 68.7 percent.The government has proposed a measure to amend the fixed-term work act and the temporary agency work act so that employees of either status aged 35 years or older can, if they want, work for the same company for up to four years, as opposed to the current two. Also, it would become much easier for workers to be eligible for severance pay. It wants to make employees eligible to receive severance pay if they work for a company for three months or longer, as opposed to the current one year or longer, so 1.95 million workers are expected to benefit from this relaxation in requirements. In addition, the government recommended that employees should be able to receive a transition benefit worth 10 percent of their wage for the two-year period of extended service, along with severance pay if they fail to become regular workers after the extension.So far, temporary agency work has been permitted in 32 business categories, and such work is now allowed for those aged 55 years or older, and for highly paid professionals as well. The Labor Ministry said it would take measures to rationalize the regulations on temporary agency work following discussions with the ESDC. The ministry will also allow six special types of worker to be covered by work injury and employment insurance.The requirements for layoffs will become more specific, making it easier for businesses to dismiss underperforming regular workers, and the layoff process will become more demanding, requiring companies to hire people for positions that were lost due to financial difficulties. The government will formulate “Layoff Guidelines,” which will specify what efforts companies should make before dismissing underperformers, such as assigning them to different positions. Currently, nonregular workers have to appeal to the Labor Relations Commission as individuals if they believe they have been discriminated against in terms of wages or welfare benefits, but they will be able to use a trade union to appeal on their behalf. Businesses will be prohibited from the practice of paying only 90 percent of the full salary for menial workers, such as convenience store clerks or gas station workers, for a training period, which is usually three months. Also, for those whose performance is closely linked to human safety, such as captains or chief engineers on cruisers, train engineers, airport controllers and airplane pilots, nonregular work will not be allowed as a matter of principle.However, both business and labor communities have expressed their concerns about the “side effects” of the government plans.The corporate sector has argued that “The government plans will expand the scope of nonregular workers too much, and have focused on strengthening regulations relating to the use of nonregular workers, ignoring the real situations of employers and of the labor market. The plans will put significant burdens on business operations.” In an official statement, the KEF noted that the reforms “disregarded the circumstances of corporates that are the main agents for job creation and the reality of the labor market. It is deeply concerning that these opinions are written in a way that it mainly represents the labor stance on important issues that possibly influence decisions on directions for the Korean labor market.”The barriers to labor market entry should be lowered in order to create jobs and improve the dual structure of the labor market, it said. However, the current policy will “strengthen the vested rights of workers who are already in the labor market.”Major causes for polarization of the labor market are the overprotection of regular employment and the excessive hike of wages based on a seniority-based wage system. Therefore, it is almost impossible to expect an improvement of vulnerable workers’ labor conditions unless these issues are solved in the first place.However, these new regulations may shift the burden to companies by disregarding the improvement of reasonable human resource management such as resolving the current overprotection of regular employment and alleviating requirements for changing working conditions.Also, it is not appropriate to intensify the burden through introducing such systems as living wages and market wage prices at a time when minimum wage stability is urgent, since minimum wages surged rapidly after 2000.Trade unions point out that “The government is seeking to massively increase the number of nonregular workers by extending how long companies can hire a nonregular worker for a position, by introducing a new status of ‘semiregular worker,’ which falls between regular and nonregular workers, and by allowing temporary agency workers aged 55 years or older in more business categories.”Kim Dong-man, president of the FKTU, which is negotiating in the trilateral commission, stressed, “The government is pushing ahead with full-scale strategies for labor flexibility without making an effort to reach an agreement among social partners. We have no option but to stop social dialogue if the government continues to do so. The unilateral plan will be faced with strong protest by the FKTU and we are ready to stage a general strike.”He went on to say, “We are demanding the government drastically change the economic structure and policy directions for the achievement of income-led growth. To this end, we will step up our efforts for the alleviation of discrimination against precarious workers, the eradication of unfair subcontracting practices and the achievement of fair taxation.”It now remains to be seen whether the government can get labor groups and management on the same page in the near future, so the Park administration can focus on economic revitalization. The next few weeks are surely going to be very dramatic.

Lee, who was in office from 2008-2013, is affiliated with the ruling Saenuri Party.According to the results of an inspection by the state audit agency announced Friday, three state-run energy companies -- Korea National Oil Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. -- have invested a total of 31.4 trillion won ($28.7 billion) since 2003 in energy projects abroad. Those projects, however, have resulted in a confirmed net loss of 3.4 trillion won so far, with further losses expected down the road.Moon Jae-in, chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, proposed that both he and Lee testify before the National Assembly. Moon was chief of staff to Lee's predecessor, Roh Moo-hyun, who also carried out similar projects overseas.""The Saenuri Party says former President Lee Myung-bak will appear as a witness if I appear as a witness,"" Moon said during a party meeting. ""Fine. I will step forward. Former President Lee, please come forward.""Moon's demand comes one day before the parliamentary investigation is due to end.

With Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe scheduled to make a congressional address later this month, Seoul is forecast to focus chiefly on rallying U.S. lawmakers behind its efforts to extract a sincere atonement for Tokyo’s atrocities during World War II, such as sex slavery involving Korean and other women.Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who was the first female speaker of the House of Representatives from 2007-11, played a key role when the lower chamber unanimously endorsed a resolution in 2007 calling for Japan’s formal apology for the wartime sexual enslavement, initiated by Rep. Mike Honda.  President Park Geun-hye welcomes U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae Thursday. (Yonhap)“Park will request the Congress’ active cooperation and understanding about major pending issues between South Korea and the U.S.,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters ahead of the meeting, without elaborating further. The third-term lawmaker touched down in Seoul on Wednesday for a three-day stay with a group of about 10 politicians from both the Democrat and Republican Parties, including Reps. Charles Rangel (D-New York), Sander Levin (D-Michigan) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pennsylvania).She also visited South and North Koreas in 1997 as a member of the House intelligence committee. Pelosi also met with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa and other ranking officials and lawmakers here. The delegation is scheduled to leave for Tokyo on Thursday. The visit came shortly after Abe was invited by the incumbent speaker John Boehner to address a joint session of the Congress on April 29. However, criticism is growing for what is seen as his ongoing attempts to whitewash Japan’s imperial past, with the premier depicting the so-called comfort women as victims of “human trafficking” in an apparent effort to dilute Japan’s direct involvement in the issue. During a lunch meeting earlier in the day, Chung expressed regret that Abe’s failure to face up to history poses a hurdle for not just a thaw between the two old foes, but also greater three-way collaboration, including with the U.S. “The history issue is not just a matter of the past ... I hope that Prime Minister Abe will use his address at the U.S. Congress to ‘acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility,’ as requested in H. Res. 121, and make the event a turning point where the countries concerned leave the past behind and move forward to achieve peace in the region and beyond,” he said, referring to the watershed resolution. In response, Pelosi introduced two Japanese-American lawmakers who are accompanying her on the trip ― Doris Matsui and Mark Takai ― and praised their contribution in the lead-up to the text’s passage. “When we put forth the resolution, the strength of it was the Japanese-Americans, who are putting forth the resolution on the comfort women,” she said. “Again, high priorities for us and one of the first pieces of legislation that we passed in a strong bipartisan way, signed by the president.” On the bilateral front, the sides were predicted to change their views over ongoing negotiations to amend a nuclear energy pact, a proposed bill in the House designed to raise the quota of professional visas and South Korea’s potential participation in the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership. Yun, for his part, briefed lawmakers on Seoul’s efforts to mend ties with Tokyo, such as through a trilateral partnership including Beijing, while stressing the need for Japanese leaders to correct historical perceptions, ministry officials said.

Park Sang-ok, who served as a public prosecutor, was nominated as a Supreme Court judge in January. But his confirmation hearing was put on hold for 76 days, with a group of opposition lawmakers refusing to hold the session, citing his role in the 1987 investigation of police officers accused of torturing a student activist to death.The prosecution came under fire after a revelation by Catholic priests that there were more police officers involved in the torture than those it had indicted. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has claimed that the justice nominee was responsible for the cover-up and urged him to voluntarily withdraw his nomination.The rival parties, however, reached an agreement to hold the hearing session after a meeting held between their floor leaders Tuesday. On Wednesday, members of a special parliamentary committee on personnel hearings finalized the date, although they continued to wage a war of nerves. Lawmakers from the ruling party accused the opposition party of neglecting their duty, saying they have delayed the confirmation process and undermined the function of the judiciary. Meanwhile, NPAD lawmakers continued to label Park as a disqualified nominee and warned that they will press him to withdraw the nomination during the grilling session.“We are not accepting his nomination just because we agreed to hold the confirmation hearing,” said Rep. Jeon Hae-cheol of NPAD. The lawmaker warned that his party could boycott the session again if the prosecution and the court do not present a full investigation report and the court record of police officers involved in the torture of the student 28 years ago.Rep. Lee Han-sung of the ruling Saenuri party vowed to cooperate with NPAD in securing the relevant documents, but criticized the opposition party for hastily jumping to the conclusion that Park, who was then a junior prosecutor, was disqualified because he was part of the investigation team at the time.A bench in the 14-member Supreme Court has been left vacant since a justice retired last month.

The government and ruling Saenuri Party have already made their joint proposal.Kang Gi-jung, NPAD's chief policymaker, said his party's proposal centers on keeping pensions at the current level for middle- and lower-class public officials and raising the contribution rate for a sustainable pension scheme.""The core of our proposal is the strengthening of public pensions and the restructuring of civil service pensions,"" he said in a press briefing at the National Assembly.The NPAD's proposal calls for a partial application of the national pension plan to civil service pensions. Under the national pension plan, low-income workers receive more in entitlements relative to their contributions compared to the high income bracket. This system would apply to 4.5 percentage points of the 7 percent public servants set aside from their income in contributions toward pension. For the remaining 2.5 percentage points, civil servants would receive entitlements proportionate to their income.Under the proposal, civil servants would receive about 50 percent of their average salary over their lifetime in monthly pension payments, down from the current 57 percent.The NPAD estimated that the proposed reform would save a total of 321 trillion won ($291 billion), or 55 trillion won more than the 266 trillion won expected to be saved under the government and ruling party's proposal.It also proposed the formation of a body for social compromise on reforming public pensions.The ruling party called for a clearer proposal.""As was expected, (the NPAD) is confusing (the public) with vague figures,"" Saenuri Chairman Kim Moo-sung said.

Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling party at first and second, respectively, in the approval ratings as potential contenders for the upcoming 2017 presidential election.Observers said the by-elections would serve as a barometer of Kim and Moon’s leadership as the parties wrangle over President Park Geun-hye’s economic and social reform measures.Up for grabs are four constituencies ― Gwanak-B district in Seoul, Jungwon district in Seongnam of Gyeonggi Province, Western Ganghwa-B district in Incheon and Seo-B district in Gwangju.The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy are expected to fight especially hard in the three Seoul metropolitan constituencies. The NPAD faces a tough challenge in Gwangju, its traditional home turf, following a decision by Chun Jeong-bae, a party heavyweight during the Roh Moo-hyun administration, to run as an independent candidate.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, chose Oh Shin-hwan to run in the Gwanak-B district, while Shin Sang-jin, who represents Jungwon will run for reelection. In Gwangju, Chung Seung, the minister of food and drug safety, has confirmed his bid to run, and former Incheon Mayor Ahn Sang-soo has joined the race for the Ganghwa-B district.The NPAD selected Jung Tae-ho to run in Gwanak-B, while Jung Hwan-seok will run in Jungwon and in Seo-B of Gwangju, Cho Young-teck will run for the party. Shin Dong-keun will confront the ruling party’s Ahn in Gwanghwa-B.Though the by-election results have conventionally been favorable to opposition candidates, the Saenuri Party recently broke the jinx by winning in the July 30 by-elections in 2014.Political researchers said that winning at least two out of the four seats will be inevitable for both Kim and Moon to secure their statuses as party leaders.Kim Moo-sung said the governing party would encourage voters in their 20s and 30s to take part in the election. The Saenuri Party also plans to consolidate the conservative votes by stressing the need to “expel followers of North Korea from the National Assembly” via speeches at colleges including Seoul National University in Seoul.Moon Jae-in, for his part, plans to highlight “the incumbent administration’s failure in economic policies” and the widening income gap between the haves and have-nots.For the Saenuri Party, it is considered a tough challenge to win in Gwangju and is instead focusing on winning the three metropolitan constituencies, pundits said.Kim received 11.8 percent of the approval ratings according to the latest poll by Realmeter as of March 23.Moon, who topped the list for the 11th consecutive week garnered 24.9 percent of support. The NPAD faces a daunting task of placating the voters in Gwangju by quelling widespread disapproval among the Jeolla residents regarding the current party leadership held by figures hailing from the politically hostile Gyeongsang Province.South Jeolla-based heavyweight Hahn Hwa-kap has publicly claimed that Jeolla Province should revive the region’s leadership status in the party, expressing his support for Chun, the former justice minister.

Ahn has not received any call from prosecutors or other law enforcement bodies,” an aide to the lawmaker said. “We suspect that the controversy (over Ahn) began a few days ago after some right-leaning television broadcasters ran some stories related to the matter.”Most of the stories in South Korean news outlets do not mention an attributable source.The charges come as prosecutors are accelerating the probe into POSCO’s former executives for allegedly running a slush fund oversees to evade taxes here and for allegedly misappropriating company funds.

Hong Joon-pyo declared an end to universal free school lunches in his region, saying he would spend the extra money on education vouchers for poorer students.  The decision sparked an outcry within the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which has argued that poor students could feel ashamed for accepting free meals.  On Wednesday, NPAD Chairman Moon Jae-in visited Hong at the governor's office in Changwon, 398 kilometers southeast of Seoul, but the two failed to narrow their differences on the issue.  ""Giving free meals to all children is part of compulsory education,"" Moon said during his meeting with Hong. ""South Gyeongsang children shouldn't be discriminated against over school meals due to political reasoning.""  Hong refuted Moon's claim, citing a 2012 Constitutional Court ruling that meals do not fall within the range of compulsory education.  ""The (central) government is taking care of meals for children from truly poor backgrounds, so we mean to use our budget to help children of working-class families study,"" he said.  As Moon left the provincial government building, he told the governor he is ""going down the wrong path,"" to which Hong replied they would have to wait and see.  ""I felt as if I was speaking to a wall,"" Moon added.  ""I felt the same,"" Hong replied.

He is set to replace Lee Byung-ki, who will now serve as Park’s chief of staff.But lawmakers from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy raised concerns that Lee’s “right-leaning” political philosophy could steer the NIS toward political meddling again as the agency allegedly did during the 2012 presidential election. Lee Byung-ho, who was nominated to serve as the nation’s next spy chief last month, answers questions from lawmakers at his confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Monday. (Yonhap)Former NIS head Won Sei-hoon was found guilty by local courts of having led the spy agency in an online smear campaign against then-opposition presidential candidate Rep. Moon Jae-in, who now serves as the NPAD’s chair. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the case.Lee vowed he would prioritize national security in his management of the NIS, and that he would prevent the agency from meddling in domestic politics.“Accurate and timely intelligence serves as the cornerstone of national security. I will make sure that our institution does that job,” Lee said at his hearing.“I consider political meddling by the NIS to be a dangerous proposition,” he added, in an apparent attempt to assuage the worries of NPAD lawmakers. “I do not wish to be remembered as a criminal in future history books.”Lee is a member of the Korea Military Academy’s class of 1963, and a combat veteran of the Vietnam War. He went on to serve in the spy agency until 1997 when he was picked to be Seoul’s ambassador to Malaysia. He taught at the University of Ulsan after his posting in Kuala Lumpur.Lee, however, refused to answer opposition lawmakers’ questions on the controversial interpretation of the military coup by former President Park Chung-hee, late father of the current president.“Do you agree that the May 16 coup, was a military rebellion?” NPAD Rep. Kim Kwang-jin asked Lee, referring to the 1961 coup led by Park Chung-hee. “I have my own thoughts about that incident,” Lee answered, refusing to give a straightforward response.Lawmakers from the governing Saenuri Party expressed support for Lee’s nomination, saying the former Army officer, intelligence agent, and diplomat had the “right credentials” to serve as the nation’s top spy.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","meddling south korea spy ,nominee on monday pledged ,political meddling south korea ,chief nominee on monday ,vows to prevent political","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee Byung - ho', 'Park Geun', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Cabinet', 'Lee Byung - ki', 'Park ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39430085 -0.01358671

It said about 300 civic groups would join the rallies.The KCTU, in particular, has already vowed to take the initiative in staging sit-in protests or going on general strike before politicians pass the bill.While the union of civil servants claims the government is seeking to fill its budget deficit with money from the pockets from civil servants, ruling party lawmakers stress that the nation has to act to government debt from ballooning.Meanwhile, the Saenuri party also clarified that it would pass the bill on mandating CCTV installation at all day care centers, aimed at preventing child abuse, in the April session.It also plans to carry out coordination with opposition parties to seek ways to pass the motion on human rights conditions in North Korea in the coming parliamentary session.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","servants are threatening protests ,employees pension in april ,next month the party ,april extraordinary parliamentary session ,protests against the ruling","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Saenuri Party']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54293245  0.09888338

""Abe could use the occasion of his visit to the American Congress to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historic responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for the historic human rights violations committed against the Comfort Women,"" he said.Though most victims have died, survivors deserve justice and closure in their final days, the former lawmaker said. ""They have waited too long. It is time for Japan to apologize,"" he said.Abe could also reaffirm Japan's 1995 statement of apology, known as the Murayama Statement, where the country apologized for its imperialistic past. The nationalist prime minister has been accused of trying to revise the apology statement.""A reaffirmation of this official apology for the aggression of the Pacific War at the site where President Roosevelt spoke would make a deep impression not only on members of Congress but on the American people, the Comfort Women survivors and other neighbors in Asia,"" Faleomavaega said.""Such a sincere apology would be an act of true statesmanship.

Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

Pyongyang flatly denies the accusations as a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.""We propose merging and reviewing the Saenuri Party's five bills related to North Korea's human rights situation and NPAD's three North Korean human rights bills at the (relevant) standing committee in April,"" Park Wan-joo, NPAD's floor spokesman, said during a press briefing.Park stressed, however, that his party is opposed to the ruling party's proposal to assist civic groups engaged in sending anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets via balloon across the border.The leaflet campaigns have been a source of renewed tension between the Koreas in recent months, leading to a brief exchange of machine gun fire across the border in October.NPAD believes the North should make efforts to improve human rights conditions for its people as the South promotes the North Korean people's rights to freedom and life, Park said. Such efforts should be made in a way that helps improve inter-Korean ties and bring peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula, he added.""We hope a reasonable alternative will be found through careful discussion and consultation (at the standing committee),"" the spokesman said.

Yoo Seong-min, dismissed Moon's proposal, saying the government's Minimum Wage Council is responsible for setting the rate.""Labor, management and government are all represented there, so politicians can offer their opinions,"" he told reporters after a party meeting.

338,338,Ex-anti-corruption chief voices regret over 'scaled-down' law,"The former rights commission chief who proposed a controversial anti-corruption law expressed regret Tuesday that the law has been partly scaled down from the draft before passing the parliament.""It's regrettable that the law regressed from its original draft,"" Kim Young-ran told reporters after examining details of the law that passed the National Assembly early this month.Kim proposed the so-called Kim Young-ran La...","The former rights commission chief who proposed a controversial anti-corruption law expressed regret Tuesday that the law has been partly scaled down from the draft before passing the parliament.""It's regrettable that the law regressed from its original draft,"" Kim Young-ran told reporters after examining details of the law that passed the National Assembly early this month.Kim proposed the so-called Kim Young-ran Law in June 2011 when she worked as head of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.The law subjects public officials, journalists and private school faculty to a maximum penalty of three years in prison or a fine of five times the amount they accept in money or valuables if they take money or valuables worth more than 1 million won ($908) from one person in one installment, regardless of whether it is in exchange for favors or related to their work. She said the draft included three key elements of banning unjust business favors and bribe taking and preventing public officials from pursuing private benefits in handling their given work. But the last element was omitted from the final law, she said.Commenting on the controversy over the law's constitutionality for including journalists and private school teachers among those subject to it, Kim said, ""I don't think this goes against the Constitution."" She cited a recent public survey in which nearly 70 percent of South Koreans answered in favor of the inclusion. ""I think we can't just criticize this as wrong at a time when there are already moves to reform in the civilian sector,"" she said. ""The law, in particular, expanded its scope to fields with strong social responsibilities, so I also don't think this violates people's rights for equality.""Last week, the Korean Bar Association filed a petition with the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of the law, arguing that it has elements that possibly go against the Constitution and problems of fairness.The association said the law's inclusion of journalists among those subject to it can infringe on freedom of the press and people's rights for equality and the law's articles requiring people to report their spouses' acceptance of a bribe or expensive gifts to the authorities or face criminal punishment go against principles of freedom of conscience and self-responsibility in the Constitution.During the news conference, Kim also voiced regret for the law's limitation of the scope of family members with duty to report acceptance of bribes to ""spouse.""The event comes amid rival parties' moves to amend the newly passed anti-corruption law among mounting questions over its scope and constitutionality.The bill's hasty passage is widely seen as an attempt by lawmakers to please voters ahead of next year's parliamentary elections as public demand for the legislation has been high in a country where corruption involving public officials causes national outrage.The law is scheduled to go into effect in September 2016 with a grace period of one and a half years from the day when it is promulgated.

Yoo Il-ho, the minister-designate for land, infrastructure and transport, along with Rep. Yoo Ki-june, the nominee for oceans and fisheries minister, were the first to be grilled by the National Assembly in this week’s confirmation hearings of Park’s new Cabinet. Yoo Il-hoThe main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said it doubted the nominees’ “sincerity,” pointing to their reluctance to state their position in running for reelection in next year’s general election. Doing so would leave them a maximum of 10 months in their ministerial posts.“Both nominees have at best about eight months to serve in their positions, excluding the time it takes for them to adjust to their new jobs. The nominees will have little time to carry out any meaningful policy initiatives,” NPAD Rep. Lee Un-ju said. Yoo Ki-juneAll candidates running for legislative seats must resign from public office at least 90 days before the vote. NPAD Rep. Hwang Ju-hong said, “Former Prime Minister Nam Duk-woo once said two years were far from enough time to get anything done. … I can’t help but ask, what you will do in 10 months.”Both appointees refused to comment on whether they would run in 2016.As criticism mounted over the two appointees’ credentials with the opposition accusing the designation as deriving from their political affinity to the president, some of the ruling party members joined in.“How will you lead an organization knowing that you will likely vacate your position in the near future?” Saenuri Rep. Lee Jong-bae asked the nominee for oceans and fisheries minister.The two also face allegations of property speculation, tax evasion and other “morally questionable” actions in the past.Yoo Il-ho is accused of evading up to 7.64 million won in taxes ($6,870) when he sold an apartment in 2005. Yoo Ki-june is also questioned for his vote in 2012 in favor of disbanding the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.Both Yoos have also admitted to illegally having changed the home addresses of their children so that they could attend schools in wealthier neighborhoods.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition lawmakers on monday ,lawmakers on monday grilled ,to withdraw opposition lawmakers ,withdraw opposition lawmakers on ,withdraw opposition lawmakers","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Yoo Ki']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71989346  0.28399688

He also cited the “worsening business environment.”While the business sector is likely to demand a restricted hike of between 0 and less than 5 percent, the Finance Ministry is reportedly pushing for a hike of about 10 percent.The 2014 minimum salary in Korea is 5,580 won per hour, up 7.2 percent from a year earlier. When an employee works eight hours a day, he or she is paid 1.16 million won a month and 13.99 million won a year.Some labor groups demand a hike of 20 to 30 percent, reiterating that the current minimum wage does not even meet the minimum cost of living in the nation.Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon, meanwhile, supported the wage hike, saying Monday that the ministry would “reflect President Park Geun-hye’s instructions to narrow the income gap” between the haves and the have-nots in its fine-tuning of the hike level.While the labor sector welcomed the minimum wage hike in theory, some also stressed that the policy should not eventually target the more flexible labor market in which businesses will be allowed to increase the ratio of temporary workers and have authority to dismiss them easily.Moon Jae-in, chairman of the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, argued that it was necessary to increase the minimum monthly income. “The business sector should seriously review the situation that a four-family member household manages to live with a monthly income of just 1.1 million won,” he said.According to the Employment-Labor Ministry, the Roh Moo-hyun administration raised the minimum wage by 13.1 percent between 2005 and 2006, the Lee Myung-bak administration by 2.75 percent between 2010 and 2011 and the Park Geun-hye administration by 7.2 percent between 2013 and 2014.Meanwhile, Samsung Group downplayed speculation that its flagship Samsung Electronics had frozen workers’ pay, arguing that the freeze only applied to basic pay. “Considering the hike in performance-based pay and various allowances, the real increase comes to 4.2 percent on average.”The minimum wage for 2015 will be determined in early August.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","minimum wage debate heated ,heated debate over hike ,pressure businesses to accept ,politicians industry lock horns ,wage debate heated debate",['the Finance Ministry'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44150326  0.29975602

Lee Byung-suk of the Saenuri Party proposed a bill that calls for punishing those who take part in terrorist acts or organize or join terrorist groups.Speaking in a press conference at the National Assembly, he claimed the attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert could not be prevented because there were no legal grounds to keep watch over the assailant, Kim Ki-jong, despite his questionable background.""In order to stop a terrorist incident, such as the attack on Ambassador Mark Lippert, from happening again, not only the (ruling) party, government and Cheong Wa Dae, but also the ruling and opposition parties should work together,"" Lee said. Cheong Wa Dae is the name of South Korea's presidential office.Under current laws, the only way to punish terrorist activities is through forced deportations, the lawmaker said, claiming there have been more than 50 incidents in the past five years in which a foreigner has been deported for terrorist acts.His call comes ahead of a trilateral policy coordination meeting between Cheong Wa Dae, the government and the ruling party.During the meeting scheduled for Sunday, officials are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, including Lee's anti-terrorism bill and two other related bills pending in parliament, a key party official said on condition of anonymity.

Chung Ui-hwa, the Speaker of South Korea’s National Assembly, proposed the plan to U.S. House Speaker John Boehner last week. Chung was to discuss it at the Center for Strategic & International Studies last Saturday until snowstorms canceled the event. Boehner called it a “great idea.” But writing the resolution may spark unexpected disagreements between and within both countries, as it would be forced to mention, or ignore sensitive issues such as North Korea’s nuclear program, Japan’s World War II atrocities and territorial disputes.“The letter will praise the relative peace in Northeast Asia over the past 70 years after World War II, which gave rise to prosperous economies in China, South Korea and Japan,” a South Korean parliamentary source familiar with the proposal said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“The resolution will urge North Korea to forfeit its nuclear weapons, and the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas,” the source added, noting it could also ask Japan and its neighbors to “resolve disagreements” over history.The source said it was uncertain if the resolution would explicitly mention the comfort women issue. It was also highly unlikely to mention territorial disagreements among Japan and its neighbors.Many in China and South Korea have been demanding Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reissue “more sincere” apologies for Imperial Japan’s sexual imprisonment of thousands of Asian women during the war, euphemistically known as the comfort women issue.Abe’s apparent denials of the atrocities have sparked anger among Chinese and South Koreans, and worsened ties among the nations. Territorial disputes between Japan and China over islands in the East China Sea, and Japan’s contestation of a set of islets held by South Korea have worsened the situation. The U.S. is expected to be reluctant to take actions that could provoke Japan, a key ally, by openly siding with South Korea and China in the issues of such a resolution, analysts have said.Chung’s potential resolution could also spark protest from constituents in South Korea, who could ask for much stronger wording in any joint resolution with the U.S., against North Korea.If the U.S. ultimately declines to write the joint resolution, South Korea’s legislature is considering writing an exclusive one before Aug. 15, the date marking the end of World War II and Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 35-year occupation of the country.Discussions on the details of the resolution have been initiated by Chung and the foreign affairs committee chief of the South Korean Assembly, Rep.

Yoo Seong-min sparked a public backlash, as he hinted at the possibility that there were lobbying activities from owners of day care centers to hamper passage of the bill.Though Yoo stressed that many Saenuri lawmakers held firm convictions that human rights could be breached if the surveillance cameras are installed, he neither denied nor confirmed pressure from the child care center industry. Ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep.

(Yonhap)“(I don’t know) if the pressures from nurseries or kindergartens somewhat affected (the parliamentary rejection),” Yoo said in the meeting of party leaders.Saying that the Saenuri Party should also be held accountable for failing to pass the bill, he promised to offer more opportunities for debates in the coming April extraordinary session of the National Assembly.While the main opposition New Politics Alliance for New Democracy also apologized, young parents’ anger at politicians appeared to grow.Parents’ groups denounced lawmakers for not taking appropriate countermeasures against abuses by nursery employees on young children despite a series of high-profile child abuse incidents.“(Many lawmakers) are not ignorant of children’s human rights as they regard the day care centers as part of teachers’ private lives,” parents’ group Haneul Sopoong said in a statement.Some raised the speculation that lawmakers made a dubious “political decision” ahead of the April 29 by-elections. “It seems that the Saenuri Party was seeking to take the initiative in passing the CCTV bill in the April session right before the elections,” one netizen claimed. Opponents of the bill cite the cost of installing CCTV at all nurseries ― estimated at about 60 billion won ($54.5 million) ― and doubts of its efficacy in preventing child abuse.Nationwide concern about child abuse by day care staff erupted in January after a 33-year-old female worker at an Incheon day care center was caught on CCTV beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her meal.Similar cases followed, including one in which three female workers hit children under 5 for not finishing meals or following the class. One of them was found to have put wet tissues in the mouth of a 22-month-old, according to police.On Tuesday, the bill was voted down in the plenary session of the Assembly as the yes vote of 83 failed to reach the majority of 86 among the 171 attendees. The number of dissenting votes and black ballots came to 42 and 46.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","main parties apologized wednesday ,min sparked public backlash ,parties apologized wednesday ,two main parties apologized ,parties apologized wednesday to","['Korea', 'CCTV', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Yoo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53147393  0.47452387

For gifts that are work-related and worth 1 million won or less, the penalty is a fine of up to five times the gift's value.The bill was drawn up to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.On Wednesday, both the ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy acknowledged the need to review the details of the law.""We will humbly listen to all opinions about loopholes or side effects and in the one and a half years of preparation, if there is a need to supplement the legislation, we will do so,"" Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the floor leader of the ruling party, said during a party meeting.The ruling party especially raised concerns about excluding civic groups from those subject to the law and the vagueness of what constitutes an illegal request for a favor.The main opposition party, meanwhile, expressed concern about the possibility of ""targeted investigations"" by prosecutors and the police, and excessive legislation.""There must be parallel efforts to build an institutional guarantee against the prosecution's abuse of authority through prosecution reforms,"" Rep. Kang Gi-jung, NPAD's chief policymaker, said in a phone interview with Yonhap News Agency.In a press conference at the main government complex in Seoul, the ACRC's current chief, Lee Sung-bo, vowed to do all he can to ensure the new law takes root at an early date.""We will work hard to resolve the controversy by supplementing the areas the public is concerned about in the process of drawing up relevant enforcement ordinances and rules,"" he said. ""We will do our best to ensure that this law, which carries the people's desire for integrity, becomes a new milestone that makes our society more transparent and clean.""A survey conducted by polling agency Realmeter showed that 64 percent of those surveyed approved of the bill's passage. The survey was conducted on 500 adults on Tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.The bill's passage had been delayed amid wrangling over various details, including a clause that requires public officials to report a family member's acceptance of a bribe.Critics argued that the clause infringes on the constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of conscience and destroys family relationships.Ahead of the bill's passage, the rival parties agreed to keep that clause but limit the scope of another clause to apply the law only to public officials and their spouses, not their other family members. The official, not the spouse, would be subject to the relevant punishment.The parties also agreed to allow an 18-month grace period for enforcement of the law from the date of its proclamation.Last year, South Korea climbed three notches in an international corruption awareness ranking to 43rd out of 175 countries, according to Transparency International, the Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog.South Korea scored 55 out of 100 in the 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, with high scores meaning low corruption.

Private school owners were also included on the list at the last minute. But other groups including lawmakers, civic group activists, lawyers and conglomerate executives were excluded, stoking criticism.Further, spouses will also be penalized if they accept more than 1 million won in cash, gifts or services.The legislation is expected to curb the scale of gifts, congratulatory money, condolence money and cash given in an attempt to build cozy relations with government officials, employees at private schools and employees in the media.Major civic groups have welcomed the bill, claiming that it will improve transparency in areas including personnel policy.But some lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties continue to question the bill’s feasibility and a possible breach of the Constitution.Rep. Lee Sang-min of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the law was influenced by conflicts of interest.Lee was quoted as criticizing his fellow lawmakers for neglecting clauses that would directly affect them, citing conflict of interest.Some lawmakers are also prone to pressuring companies to hire their relatives, while arranging adviser posts at various private entities, he claimed.Lee and some other critics also denounced the Assembly for omitting civic group activists from the target list, claiming they were also subject to scrutiny considering past cases. They cited a leader from a citizens’ right advocate group monitoring speculative capital, who was recently taken into custody for taking bribes from the U.S.-based Lone Star Funds. Rep. Kwon Sung-dong of the ruling Saenuri Party also pointed out possible abuse of power by authorities due to the wide scope of fields that the bill targets.According to current laws, prosecutors must prove that a suspected official received monetary gifts for a specific purpose. The new anticorruption law, however, states that all those who accept more than 1 million won, regardless of the purpose, will be subject to punishment.Kwon raised the possibility of violation of the Constitution, stressing that the law restricts the nongovernmental sector too tightly. In addition, he cited the issue of fairness, saying that there were many private sectors “with public functions” like private schools and the media.He also said the law went against the freedom of conscience, pointing to the obligation to report to investigative authorities any irregularities committed by a spouse.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","services will be jailed ,won 900 in cash ,the national assembly tuesday ,will be jailed for ,will be jailed",['the National Assembly'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40162936 -0.02950737

(Yonhap)The move came after two deadly shootings in Sejong and Hwaseong cities last week. During their talks on Monday, lawmakers and policymakers agreed to enhance regulations on hunting rifles, including introducing tougher screening procedures for gun permits and better training for gun owners.The mandate requires that all guns be tracked with GPS devices. Further, anyone with a prison record would be banned from possessing rifles, according to participants at the meeting.In addition, ammunition will only be available near hunting grounds, and any unused rounds must be returned to police. Guns must now be stored at designated police stations with jurisdiction over the registered user.Meeting participants included Saenuri lawmakers and officials from the National Emergency Management Agency and the National Police Agency.They shared the view that current regulations on rifle usage were relatively lax. Guns can be taken out of any police station in the country and transported freely. The present law also allows ordinary citizens to possess air rifles with a caliber of up to 5.5 millimeters and up to 400 live bullets. The number of 5.5-millimeter air rifles that are held by individuals is estimated to reach 60,000 units nationwide.On Feb. 25, a shooting at a GS25 convenience store in Janggun district, Sejong City, left four people dead including the suspect. Police said the suspect set the store on fire before fleeing and was later found dead next to a river in an apparent suicide.On Feb. 27, a man shot dead two relatives and a policeman with a hunting rifle before killing himself in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","police to track guns ,saenuri party agreed monday ,track guns via gps ,gun violence the ruling ,to curb gun violence","['Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yoo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61779487  0.05986531

We were only trying to uncover the truth behind the NIS's illegal electioneering,"" an attorney said on behalf of the four at the hearing held at the Seoul Central District Court.South Korea's Public Official Election Act prohibits NIS officials from voicing their political opinions ahead of the presidential election.While agent Kim was never charged with violating the act, two former ranking NIS officials and the former head of the NIS, Won Sei-hoon, were found guilty of illegal electioneering by an appellate court last month. Won has since requested a Supreme Court trial.The election victory of President Park Geun-hye, the then ruling party candidate, over her main opposition candidate came at a slim margin of 3.6 percentage points. The neck-and-neck result has unnerved opposition lawmakers, who claim the NIS's alleged online smear campaign against their candidates is what turned the tide in Park's favor.""Even if what we did comprises illegal confinement, the fact that the NIS meddled in the election should exempt us from punishment,"" the lawmakers' attorney said.The second hearing is scheduled for March 23.

But such provocations produce paralysis, not progress,"" she said during a seminar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank, in what appeared to be a reference to South Korea and China. ""To move ahead, we have to see beyond what was to envision what might be.""Rep. Kim Eul-dong of the ruling Saenuri Party warned that Washington would soon lose its status as the world's police if it turns a blind eye to victim states.""For stability and peace in Northeast Asia, the United States should abandon its vague stance and take a fundamental approach to conflict resolution,"" she said during a party meeting.The main opposition party New Politics Alliance for Democracy expressed regret at Sherman's remarks and accused the South Korean government of incompetence. ""(Sherman's) complacent view is beyond regrettable and truly deplorable,"" Rep. Jun Byung-hun of the NPAD said during a party meeting. ""I cannot help but blame our government's diplomatic incompetence.""Seoul's foreign ministry said that it has exchanged views with Washington's authorities over the issue, saying the U.S. notified Seoul that ""There is no change in the U.S. stance over the history issue"" involving Northeast Asia.The U.S. has been supportive of previous Japanese governments' apologies for Tokyo's wartime sex slavery and its colonial rule. In April 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama called Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women a ""terrible and egregious violation of human rights.""But Sherman's recent remarks stirred controversy here as Washington may have changed its course due to its own interests by apparently tilting toward Japan, which is in talks with Washington over a U.S.-led trade deal dubbed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.An official at the foreign ministry said that the U.S. has maintained the stance that countries in Northeast Asia need to develop future-oriented relations after healing the wounds from the past.""We understand that Sherman's remarks were made based on this basic U.S. stance,"" the official said. ""Sherman also mentioned in detail that Seoul is also Washington's ally and friend that shares core values with the U.S.""Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers that Seoul will deal with this issue ""with a sense of gravity.""""Seoul's foreign ministry does not take her comments lightly,""Cho said. ""But the Korean government has found that there is no change in the U.S. stance over the history issue. The two countries plan to exchange views over the issue more closely (in the near term).""

Revisions to cut pension payments have been raised as ways to secure the sustainability of the civil servant pension fund.  ""Seoul Mayor Park has recently made a remark that goes against the pension reform, saying that pensions are the only hope for low-paying civil servants,"" Kim said in the meeting of senior party members earlier in the morning.   ""It was very inconsiderate of him to make the improper remark as someone well-aware of the financial difficulties of the country,"" Kim said, adding that such a dissenting remark lets down those preparing for public employment.  Claiming that Park indicated the need to push back the April deadline set for the outlining of the reform, the party leader also noted that the reform drive will lose momentum if that happens.   ""Mayor Park should know the scale of the public pension's shortfall before making such remarks,"" he also said, bitterly criticizing the mayor.  Park immediately hit back, releasing the recording of the interview and clarifying that he didn't oppose the pension reform plan.   ""As shown in the recording, it was nothing more or less than the opinion that anything wrong in the civil workers' pension plan should be addressed, although prudence is needed (in doing so),"" Kim In-chul, the city government's spokesman, said.   The full sentence of what Park said in the interview carried out three days earlier was ""(The reform) should be well discussed as (pensions) are the only hope for civil workers.""   Touching on the April deadline, the mayor noted, ""I understand that the reform should be implemented when the momentum is in the air, but the process for social consensus is important as well.""  The recent bickering between the two president hopefuls reflects their subtle cleavage over the reform drive.   Park and Kim have been widely cited as the most promising presidential candidates from the liberal and conservative blocs for the next presidential election set for late 2017.

Baek Jae-hyun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy wrote in response to his inquiry that there was no behind-the-scenes agreement and U.S. beef imports were resumed following a year of bilateral negotiations on the safety of the meat.  ""The government, under the premise of guaranteeing public health and food safety as much as possible, concluded negotiations based on scientific grounds, international standards and the national interest,"" the trade ministry said, according to the letter disclosed by Baek.  The ministry's response comes amid controversy over former President Lee Myung-bak's claim in his recently published memoir that his administration resumed U.S. beef imports in his first year in office due to a prior secret agreement between his predecessor, late President Roh Moo-hyun, and then U.S. President George W. Bush.  The decision to start imports sparked weeks of massive anti-government street protests as many viewed it as a hasty move without the guarantee of safety checks against mad cow disease.  ""As former President Roh said in a statement in April 2007 that (the negotiations) would be concluded within a reasonable period in line with the recommendations of the World Organization for Animal Health, we understand that there was no behind-the-scene agreement,"" the letter said.  The agriculture and foreign ministries also confirmed that there was no secret agreement, it added.  Baek accused Lee of making false claims in his memoir in order to escape responsibility for his decision.  ""The government has officially confirmed that the content of the memoir is false,"" he said.

""Shutting down the Wolsong-1 and Gori-1 reactors would be symbolic of her sincerity.""  In 2007, the government extended the life span of the 580-megawatt Gori No. 1 light-water reactor, which began commercial operations in 1977, by 10 years.  ""If the life span of the Wolsong-1 reactor is extended, it would be a betrayal of President Park's promise,"" Moon said.  The state-run Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety in October completed inspection of the reactor and concluded it can be operated for another 10 years. However, the NSSC has delayed its decision on mounting questions over the reactor's safety, especially after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.  The decision is being closely watched as it could affect reviews of the nation's other reactors nearing retirement.  According to a survey of 1,000 adults conducted on Monday, 60.8 percent said the Wolsong-1 should be shut down for safety reasons, environmental group Friends of the Earth Korea said in a news conference.  Of the remainder, 30.4 said the reactor can be restarted if it passes safety tests, while 8.8 percent gave other answers. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.  ""According to the results of the survey, the majority wanted the Wolsong-1 to be shut down and felt a lack of communication in the current review process,"" an official of the organization said. ""The government should not push ahead with extending its life span but reflect such public opinion.""  South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply, and is building several more.

Though she conducted a partial Cabinet reshuffle last week, the president has invited fresh criticism from opposition parties as she delayed her decision to name a new chief of staff. Incumbent chief secretary Kim Ki-choon has been under pressure to resign for months over allegations that he exercised too much power over state affairs and personnel appointments. Park appears to have struggled to find suitable candidates to replace Kim. According to local news reports, the president could announce his successor Tuesday, but officials at Cheong Wa Dae have remained mute.“I’d like to ask you to seek active and strong impetus to help the Cabinet push for new (reform) policies,” Park said during a weekly meeting with senior secretaries held without Kim in attendance.“For the success of the reform, it is important to complete the legislation of (related) bills by the government and party dealing the process with one voice,” she said.Recently, Park has been losing momentum for her proposed reforms aimed at bringing about economic revitalization. Since early last year, she has been calling for massive restructuring of the private and public sector, including the reform of the public servants’ pension system, education, labor and financial markets. However, the president has encountered a series of setbacks, including political scandals, nomination debacles and the Sewol crisis.The trilateral committee, representing the government, the presidential office and the party, was launched last month as part of Park’s efforts to address the deteriorating situation. The president believes that enhancing communication between the legislative and executive branches could help speed up the implementation of her reform policies. The presidential office said later in the afternoon that the government has picked 24 major agenda to better facilitate economic reform and preparation for unification during Park’s remaining three years in office. Park also urged officials to expand economic cooperation with Middle Eastern nations, stressing that massive construction and infrastructure projects in the region could become a new growth engine for South Korea’s economy.“We should make aggressive efforts to use the second Middle East boom as a new growth engine for our economy,” Park said.In the 1970s, South Korea sent tens of thousands of engineers and workers to the Middle East during a construction boom in the region.The South Korean president plans to visit Saudi Arabia and three other Middle Eastern countries next week to discuss a wide range of issues including security, energy and information technology. Park is also set to sign a memorandum of understanding with her Saudi Arabian counterpart to introduce her mantra of a creative economy.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","cabinet reshuffle last week ,for economic reform monday ,celebrate her third year ,economic reform president park ,last week the president","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53752536  0.27579606

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said the government has decided not to pursue the proposal further due to differing opinions.  ""It also backtracks from our policy to ease regulation,"" the transport ministry said.

But contradictory tax policies and debates over constitutional reforms threaten to derail Park’s proposed economic restructuring reforms.Many of Park’s initiatives were initially welcomed by the public. Her catchphrase during the 2012 presidential race, “welfare without taxation,” received particular applause. Support for her proposed reform of the national pension for retired civil servants has also been high.  President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)Multiple polls dating back to last September have shown public support for the pension reforms ranging from 60 to 80 percent.Pension reforms could save the government up to 55 trillion won ($49.5 billion), government statistics show. Park has said that money could be used to finance her welfare policies.Scandals involving Park’s top aides and former National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon have dominated debates in the National Assembly, though, impeding moves to discuss and legislate Park’s proposed reforms. Park aides were accused of monopolizing access to the president, to the frustration of top Cabinet officials. Won is accused of having illegally swayed public opinion in the weeks leading up to the 2012 election by posting online comments. The tobacco tax hike last December likewise hindered Park’s reforms by sparking a public uproar against her government, as the policy appeared to go against Park’s pledges to increase welfare without increasing taxes. The public mood worsened in January when tax settlement calculations showed taxpayers this year would have to forfeit much of their returns or even pay more taxes.Many of the legislations considered “critical” to Park’s efforts to boost economic growth here have been left pending. These include the pension reforms, bills aiming to energize tourism and bills facilitating crowdfunding for start-ups.And although prosecutors found accusations against Park’s aides “factually erroneous,” public trust in the Park administration appears low. The Feb. 9 guilty ruling against Won by an appellate court in Seoul did not help.Gallup Korea reported that only 30 percent of the public supported Park as of Feb. 12, in a survey of 1,010 adults nationwide. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent on a 95 percent confidence level.“Park must begin prioritizing policies, and seriously start thinking about what kind of president she wants to be remembered as,” Seoul National University professor Kang Won-taek said.“Simply reforming the pension for retired civil servants is going to be a big challenge,” Hong-ik University professor Chung Goon-gi said. “The Park administration must become more efficient in its policymaking.”But prioritizing may not suffice for Park if rumors that lawmakers could begin discussing constitutional reforms in the coming months turn out true. Lawmakers have backed moves to reduce the president’s power over domestic affairs by revising the Constitution.Analysts say any debate on such changes is likely to hijack discussion on Park’s reforms, further lowering hopes for advocates of Park’s reforms.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","3rd year president park ,political scandals raging tax ,wednesday overshadowed by political ,enters 3rd year president ,in office wednesday overshadowed","['Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'Park']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43607473  0.55751503

Yoo Seung-min, floor leader of the Saenuri Party, on Feb. 17 instructed the party’s policy-setting committee to review ways to introduce cheap tobacco products, though he said that nothing had yet been determined.Yoo reportedly cited the burden of the price hike on low-income citizens.His opposition counterpart Jeon Byung-hun seemingly echoed his remarks. Jeon said in a press release on Feb. 19 that it was necessary to release hand-rolling tobacco, which is cheaper than ordinary cigarettes.Government officials, however, expressed skepticism at the proposal.An official of the Health and Welfare Ministry expressed concern that an adoption of low-priced products would elevate public anger, as it could signal that the cigarette price hike was simply a way of increasing tax revenue.Ministries, including the Finance Ministry, and the ruling party have continued to argued that the price increase was a matter of public health, rather than tax revenues.In some countries, hand-rolled tobacco is sold in pouches that also include rolling papers or cigarette tubes. The products are favored by young and low-income smokers.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","lawmakers under fire for ,fire for cheap tobacco ,low earners discontent over ,earners discontent over january ,party faces public criticism","['the Saenuri Party', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Yoo Seun']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4035801  -0.09423446

The recently appointed vice minister of education, Kim Jae-choon, was to announce the government’s official position on the issue. “The general consensus around the ministry was that we need to gather more public opinion before announcing our position,” explained a ministry official. Kim acknowledged the reporters’ inconvenience but did not elaborate. But the ministry was unable to provide even a rough outline of the briefing upon inquiry on Monday morning, raising doubts about whether the officials had a firm grasp of the issue. Reporters were notified about the briefing just two days in advance ― unusually short notice for a press meeting on such an important issue. Furthermore, meetings held by such high-ranking officials are seldom canceled at the last minute.Another ministry official said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea had not yet reviewed the content, and that he would mull things over during the Lunar New Year’s holiday. He added that officials may have hastily scheduled the briefing in the hope that Hwang would have had time to study the plans during the weekend.The Education Ministry rolled out plans last month to gradually expand the role of personality evaluations in the college admissions process, particularly for teaching courses. The move came after a spate of child abuse cases raised concerns about the ethics of teachers and child care workers.The initial response was a flurry of complaints by teachers and students, who were perplexed about having to deal with another admissions process. Authorities explained that they were not creating a new model for college admissions, but were simply looking to accredit colleges that use personality tests effectively and expand that model to other schools.But few parents were reassured by the ministry’s explanation. Only 8.7 percent of Korean adults said they had faith in the government’s education policy, according to a survey results announced last week by the Korean Educational Development Institute.

He is expected to be sworn in Tuesday.Legislators in his Saenuri Party were likely to have supported him in the secret ballot. The New Politics Alliance for Democracy likely opposed Lee.The close vote means Lee’s political clout in his first months as prime minister is likely to be limited. Allegations lodged mainly by the NPAD that Lee evaded conscription, speculated in real estate and collaborated with the juntas of the 1980s will also curb his influence, analyst said. Lawmakers vote on Lee Wan-koo’s nomination as prime minister at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)The vote came after a tense partisan deadlock. The plenary vote on Lee’s appointment was originally set for last Thursday. But the NPAD expressed its opposition to Lee, and threatened to boycott the Assembly indefinitely, unless the Saenuri Party agreed to delay the vote. Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min acceded.Lee’s nomination late last month had initially received bipartisan support. Lee had earned the opposition’s trust through his role in mediating divisive partisan bills such as the special Sewol bill, as the Saenuri Party’s floor leader last year. The tables were turned, however, after reports of draft evasion and property speculation arose during Lee’s confirmation hearing last week. Avoiding the military draft is considered especially detrimental to public office seekers here as the nation is still technically at war with North Korea.NPAD Rep. Jin Sun-mee cited Military Manpower Administration records from the 1970s to assert that Lee had dodged the obligatory draft, possibly by taking advantage of his position as a civil official.Lee first denied the accusations under oath, saying he had received his first military medical test in Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province. But Jin charged that MMA papers showed Lee had received his medical exam in Seoul, raising concerns that Lee had committed perjury.Lee suffered another blow during his hearing when the NPAD divulged a voice recording of him apparently trying to intimidate journalists. He can be heard telling reporters that he “knows” higher-ups in the media industry who can get them fired if they write critical reports about him.Lee apologized, but public dissatisfaction with him appears to have risen due to the disclosure, according to pollsters Gallup Korea and Realmeter.In a Gallup poll of 1,010 adults nationwide from Feb. 10-12, only 29 percent approved Lee’s nomination. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. A Realmeter survey of 1,500 adults from Feb. 11-13 found that 38.7 percent of respondents supported Lee, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent.“Putting Lee in the Prime Minister’s Office may benefit us in the short term,” NPAD Rep. Hong Jong-haak said before the Monday vote. “But Rep. Lee is a consistent liar as was shown in last week’s hearing,” he added.President Park Geun-hye is likely to have picked Lee to serve as the Cabinet’s second-in-command for his skills as a deal-broker, as he could help break through the NPAD’s opposition to draft bills that Park has labeled “critical” for economic growth.

All five sitting lawmakers of the party immediately lost their seats in the parliament.The decision was based on the assumption that Lee Seok-ki, one of the UPP lawmakers, planned to overthrow the South Korean government in case of a war with North Korea.In a ruling that apparently contradicts this assumption, however, the Supreme Court last month partially sided with Lee, finding him not guilty of plotting a rebellion but guilty of encouraging other members of his secret organization to do so. The top court said there was no proof that such an organization existed.The UPP has latched onto this discrepancy as a basis for their request for retrial. Its legal representatives said they submitted the request earlier in the day.""How the majority treats a minority shows how mature a democratic nation is,"" read the request. ""It's about time that South Korea returned to being the mature democracy that it once was.""Last month, former UPP lawmakers filed a petition with the Seoul Administrative Court to reverse the constitutional ruling that resulted in their loss of parliamentary seats.Those designated as members of Lee's secret organization also filed a damages suit against the Constitutional Court, saying they'd been falsely accused.

Lee Wan-koo as new prime minister amid the main opposition’s continued disapproval of the nominee, who has been plagued by allegations of draft dodging, plagiarism, real estate speculation and other misdeeds.The ruling Saenuri Party vowed to approve Lee’s nomination during Monday’s plenary parliamentary session, raising the possibility that the majority party will railroad the motion despite vehement objections from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy.The Saenuri Party argued the partisan bickering over Lee would only create a “vacuum in state affairs” at a time when the Assembly should focus its legislative attention on revitalizing the sluggish economy.“The biggest reason why we are making all-out efforts (to approve Lee) is that we are concerned about the possible vacuum in state affairs,” said Saenuri Party spokesperson Min Hyun-joo. “We are calling for the opposition’s cooperation in focusing our energy on improving people’s livelihoods.” Lee Wan-kooHowever, the NPAD renewed its calls for Lee to withdraw his nomination, warning that should the ruling party unilaterally approve Lee, it would face a backlash that would “leave the new premier in a vegetative state” and complicate the procedures to approve Supreme Court Justice-designate Park Sang-ok.The rival parties agreed last week to delay the Assembly’s full-house session ― initially set for last Thursday ― to Monday as they had failed to narrow their differences over Lee’s nomination. But later, the NPAD called for a public opinion poll on the nomination, further escalating the partisan dispute. The Saenuri Party dismissed the proposal as a move to ignore the legislature’s role to endorse the nomination of the government’s No. 2 post.The Saenuri Party currently holds 158 seats in the 295-strong parliament, meaning the party could unilaterally approve the nomination even if NPAD lawmakers boycotted Monday’s full-house vote. Should Lee be approved only by the majority party, it would be the first such case since Lee Young-deok was unilaterally endorsed as prime minister in 1994.It may not be an easy decision for the Saenuri Party to press for unilateral approval given that it could suffer a severe backlash from the NPAD at a time when it has piles of legislative issues which require cooperation with the main opposition, analysts said.The ruling party hopes to pass the motion quickly as public opinion about Lee has deteriorated due to the NPAD’s offensive. After this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, a time when family gatherings play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, public sentiment could worsen, observers say.The NPAD is expected to hold a general meeting of its lawmakers on Monday morning to decide how to demonstrate its strong opposition to Lee’s nomination without any political repercussions.Observers say NPAD lawmakers are likely to boycott the plenary session or refuse to join the vote since if any of them were to vote in favor of Lee, it could deal a blow to the authority of its new leader Moon Jae-in.Cheong Wa Dae has been anxiously watching the developments concerning Lee’s parliamentary confirmation, as it could face more criticism of a “poor” personnel vetting system should he fail to pass parliamentary scrutiny. Two prime minister designates have so far withdrawn their nominations over alleged past wrongdoings ― the reason why the current Prime Minister Chung Hong-won remains in office although he has offered to resign several times.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","nomination during monday plenary ,vote monday on motion ,during monday plenary parliamentary ,monday plenary parliamentary session ,lee nomination during monday","['the National Assembly', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18636838  0.00502515

Rep. Jin Sung-joon (Yonhap)Lee Wan-koo, former floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party tapped for the post, said during last week's confirmation hearing that he asked the National Assembly Secretariat to correct his assets report after learning that he mistakenly omitted his 2003 purchase of the Tower Palace apartment. Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance said the secretariat has confirmed this was not true.The opposition has raised suspicions that Lee had accepted illegal political funds in 2002 that could have been used to purchase the high-class apartment in southern Seoul and that the nominee omitted the property from his assets list to hide the source of the money.The fresh allegation was raised on the eve of the parliamentary plenary session during which lawmakers would vote on whether to approve Lee as prime minister.After the hearings, the rival parties agreed to postpone the vote, initially expected Thursday, to Monday. Since being nominated last month, Lee has come under fire for alleged ethical lapses that include real estate speculations, attempts to control the press and the dodging of mandatory military service.By law, the candidate for prime minister must earn parliamentary approval.Bashing Lee for ""lying (about the transaction) in front of the people,"" Rep. Jin urged the nominee ""to make a decision"" in an apparent demand that he withdraw.The nominee did not comment on the fresh allegation.On Sunday, a group of opposition lawmakers issued a statement calling on Lee to ""expect no more leniency from the people and to voluntarily withdraw before the plenary session.""Lee is President Park's third nominee for prime minister since May, after the first two quit over allegations of ethical and other lapses. Lee's failure to win the approval could cause another major setback for the Park administration in running state affairs. Her approval rating has been nearing an all-time low for her administration.In South Korea, the prime minister is the second-highest position after the president, but the job has largely been a ceremonial role as power is concentrated heavily in the president.

Security Council have loudly accused Russia of backing separatists in Ukraine, but the threat of a Russian veto has blocked them from taking action in close to 30 meetings on the crisis. Now, Russia is asking for their support. Russia circulated a surprise draft resolution, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, endorsing the new cease-fire agreement on Ukraine and calling on all parties involved to fully carry it out. U.N. diplomats said the council is expected to meet Sunday to vote on the resolution, just hours after the cease-fire is to take effect at one minute after midnight.Russia, as a permanent member of the 15-seat council, can veto any proposed resolution it dislikes. It has denied backing the separatists in eastern Ukraine, who made a late grab for territory Friday before the cease-fire takes effect.The brief draft resolution expresses ``grave concern at the tragic events'' in the region. It says a solution to the conflict is possible ``exclusively'' by peaceful means. Russia last year offered a few resolutions calling for a cease-fire, but they were unpopular with council members who were angry over its annexation of Crimea early in the crisis. The United States quickly denounced one draft that called for establishing humanitarian aid corridors in the region as ``hypocritical.''This time, Russia's draft includes a reference to the ``sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,'' something that Western diplomats have insisted that any U.N. resolution reaffirm. The latest cease-fire agreement was reached Thursday after long overnight talks among the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. Its terms include the formation of a sizeable buffer zone between Ukrainian forces and the rebels, while Ukraine regains control of its border with Russia.A previous cease-fire called in September never fully took hold. When asked Friday whether he thought this new deal would fall apart, Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, Yuriy Sergeyev, said, ``We are not naive, you know.'' More than 5,300 people have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine since April, while the United Nations has warned of a ``frozen'' conflict that could linger for years or decades.","threat of russian veto ,russian veto has blocked ,russia circulated surprise draft ,have loudly accused russia ,backing separatists in ukraine","['UNITED NATIONS', 'AP', 'the United States', 'the U.N.

Moon Jae-in came a day after the main parties agreed to delay a plenary vote on approving Lee’s nomination to early next week.“We asked to push the plenary session to next week as we wanted to give Rep. Lee time to think about his future,” Moon said, suggesting that he step down. “I propose conducting a public poll (on Lee). We are ready to accept any result that reflects the will of our citizens.”Governing Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min expressed “regret” at Moon’s suggestion, saying that the opposition leader had reneged on Thursday’s bipartisan agreement to hold a plenary vote next week. The floor leader vowed to hold the vote as scheduled on Monday.If lawmakers go ahead with Monday’s vote, the Saenuri Party’s majority guarantees Lee’s nomination, analysts said. Moon appears to have proposed the poll to pressure Lee to resign as his party has no legal means to block the vote.Yoo said the Saenuri Party had already “yielded much” to the opposition when the party agreed to postpone the plenary vote after the NPAD asked for a delay.“I see no problem in holding the vote on Monday. Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa has promised he would attend to oversee the vote. Our party will be there,” Yoo said.Yoo’s statements come despite worsening public opinion against Lee. The nominee faces allegations of speculating in property, evading the mandatory military draft, and threatening faultfinding reporters.Over 40 percent of the 1,010 respondents in a Gallup Korea poll conducted from Feb. 10 to 12 said they are against Lee’s nomination to the Cabinet’s No. 2 job. The tally is a rise from 20 percent in a survey conducted during the last week of January. The Gallup count echoes similar results of a tally conducted by the NPAD on Thursday. The results showed up to 55 percent of the 1,000 respondents opposed Lee’s appointment.NPAD officials initially expressed confusion at Moon’s remarks, saying the new party chair had proposed the poll without consulting his top advisors. NPAD representatives later tried to downplay their party chief’s proposal.“Rep.

John Kitzhaber on Friday said he broke no laws and said in a lengthy statement that his resignation would be effective on WednesdaySecretary of State Kate Brown, a Democrat like Kitzhaber, was expected to assume the office and become the first openly bisexual governor in the U.S. Kitzhaber handily won re-election in November to a fourth term, a rare feat for American governors, who hold considerable power in most states.But the allegations surrounding his fiancee Cylvia Hayes' work dominated headlines in the state following his victory.The spotlight on Hayes led to her revealing that she accepted about $5,000 to illegally marry a man seeking immigration benefits in the 1990s. Later, she admitted she bought a remote property with the intent to grow marijuana.Kitzhaber's decision capped a week in which he seemed poised to step down, then changed his mind, but ultimately bowed to calls from legislative leaders that he quit the state's top job.The announcement is a stunning fall from grace for the longest-serving chief executive in Oregon history.By Thursday, the leaders of the state Legislature said he had to go. Other top officials in the overwhelmingly Democratic state also said Kitzhaber should resign.A series of newspaper reports since October have chronicled Hayes' work for organizations with an interest in Oregon public policy. At the same time, she was paid by advocacy groups, she played an active role in Kitzhaber's administration, a potential conflict of interest.Though questions about Hayes have swirled for months, the pressure on Kitzhaber intensified in recent weeks after newspapers raised questions about whether Hayes reported all her income on her tax returns.","governor announces his resignation ,resignation amid scandal salem ,governors announced his resignation ,enrich herself oregon gov ,his resignation amid scandal","['SALEM', 'Oregon', 'AP', 'U.S.', 'Oregon', 'John Kitzhaber', 'State', 'Kate Brown', 'Democrat', 'Kitzhaber']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65409517  0.08562674

The former Saenuri Party floor leader was nominated late last month by President Park Geun-hye. But allegations of conscription evasion, real estate speculation, and the disclosure of a recording of a recent conversation in which the lawmaker appeared to threaten reporters who wrote critical stories of him brought criticism of his appointment.A plenary meeting to vote on Lee’s nomination was scheduled for Thursday. But worsening partisan strife over the appointment compelled lawmakers to postpone the full session to Monday.Even though it appears Lee will receive parliamentary approval in Monday’s plenary vote, it will be difficult for him to wield any genuine authority as prime minister in the foreseeable future, experts said, as public opinion against the third-term lawmaker is unlikely to fade quickly. (Yonhap)The majority Saenuri Party supports Lee’s nomination. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is against the move.The NPAD threatened Thursday to boycott the parliament and indefinitely stall the passage of some dozen bills strongly supported by the governing party and President Park if the Saenuri Party uses its majority to railroad the confirmation motion. The Saenuri Party holds 158 seats in the 295-strong parliament.The bills are central to President Park’s proposed economic restructuring policies. The draft laws include those aiming to facilitate crowd-funding, legalizing telemedicine, and revisions to laws that currently ban the construction of casinos near public schools.The NPAD has the ability to resist the bills as NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min holds the chairmanship of the Assembly’s Legislation & Judiciary Committee. The committee chief is authorized to indefinitely block bills from being forwarded to a final legislative voting.“The recent public backlash at allegations against Lee and a boycott by the opposition is likely to force the prime minister nominee into an involuntary silence on policy issues,” Yonsei University professor Yang Seung-ham said.But NPAD officials must also risk political damage if they resist Lee’s nomination, analysts say.At stake is the Chungcheong region, the home provinces of Prime Minister nominee Lee. He also served as South Chungcheong Province’s governor from 2006 to 2009. The swing region is a usually heated electoral battleground in South Korean elections.If the NPAD continues to stall Lee’s nomination, the party must risk losing votes in Chungcheong in future elections, including next year’s parliamentary polls, which could affect the 2017 presidential race.The NPAD’s chair, Rep. Moon Jae-in, elected to his post last Sunday, is also under pressure to resist Lee’s nomination by party hard-liners. Moon must appease them while simultaneously ensuring that his party is not seen as an overly dogmatic group that is impeding government efforts to revive a struggling economy.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","assembly delays nominee vote ,thursday to postpone vote ,minister following heated disputes ,delays nominee vote ,delays nominee vote rival","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2429736  -0.11609369

Lee Wan-koo’s nomination scheduled for Thursday. Majority governing Saenuri Party officials said they could unilaterally pass Lee’s nomination if the NPAD boycotted the session.Lee was nominated to serve as the Cabinet’s second-in-command by President Park Geun-hye last month. Lee’s reputation as a moderate and a mediator among lawmakers across the partisan spectrum appeared to guarantee parliamentary support for the appointment. But a recording of Lee allegedly intimidating journalists was publicized late Tuesday. Lee can be heard saying he “helped journalists get jobs in universities as professors and presidents,” and that he can “get rid of” reporters who write critical stories about him.  Lee Wan-kooSenior main opposition lawmakers urged Lee to step down. “Two nominees have already failed to receive the National Assembly’s approval. So I was going to let this one pass,” said Rep. Moon Jae-in, newly appointed NPAD leader and former 2012 presidential candidate. “But I fear that is no longer possible. Rep. Lee’s nomination requires reconsideration,” he added. Opposition lawmakers have laid out a series of allegations against the third-term lawmaker. Suspicions that Lee had profited in real estate dealings and questions regarding the money used for the property speculation were discussed at Wednesday’s hearing.NPAD Rep. Hong Jong-hak alleged that Lee had received up to 180 million won ($164,000) in bribes in 2002. The money could have been used to purchase the Tower Palace apartment Lee owned in 2003, before he sold it for profit, Hong said.Lee denied the charges but said he had received 50 million won from the Grand National Party, the forerunner of the Saenuri Party. “The money was given to every GNP lawmaker, as funds to be used as campaign assistance during the 2002 presidential elections,” Lee said. Lee failed to clear up allegations that he had pretended to have flat feet to dodge the country’s mandatory military service in the 1970s.Lee is strongly suspected of lying under oath about his military service during Tuesday’s hearing. Lee initially said he had received his first medical exam in 1971 in Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province, where X-ray technology was not available to show he had flat feet.Documents showed, though, that Lee’s first medical exam had been in Seoul, where X-ray machines were available, according to NPAD Rep. Jin Sun-mee.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday citing controversial comments ,nomination scheduled for thursday ,withdraw on wednesday citing ,on wednesday citing controversial ,minister nominee to withdraw","['the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28034517  0.09613752

Lee Wan-koo came under severe attack by opposition lawmakers at his parliamentary hearing on Tuesday as they disclosed voice recordings of him allegedly trying to intimidate journalists.Rep. Lee, the ex-floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, was nominated by President Park Geun-hye last month. But accusations including real estate speculation, draft-dodging and intimidating journalists have endangered his appointment. The disclosure of Lee’s voice recordings was expected to intensify a partisan fight over whether the appointee was fit to serve in the nation’s second-highest official post.Lee, who has acknowledged the voice in the recordings was his, will have to convince legislators of his eligibility by Thursday, when a plenary vote decides his nomination.  Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo speaks at his confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. (Lee Gil-dong/The Korea Herald)In the recording divulged by New Politics Alliance for Democracy legislators, Lee can be heard telling reporters that he had “enough power to handpick” the presidents and professors of local universities.Lee can also be heard saying in an apparently threatening tone that he would vote for a strict anticorruption bill that would incriminate civil servants and reporters if they or their families received gifts, however small. The draft bill is known as the Kim Young-ran bill, named after a former Supreme Court judge who initially pushed for the bill.“You know what? I’ll just let (the anticorruption bill) pass,” Rep. Lee says in the taping. “Then you’ll know what we (public officials) have to deal with.” Lee appears to be protesting a story that mentioned allegations of Lee having speculated in real estate.Lee initially received bipartisan support when he was picked to serve as prime minister on Jan. 23. The third-term lawmaker’s reputation as a moderate compromiser and deal broker had won the political trust of some senior main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy legislators.But reports that the appointee had made successful investments in Gyeonggi Province and a luxury apartment in Seoul’s posh Gangnam district in the early 2000s raised eyebrows. Lee was also accused of helping his son dodge the country’s mandatory military draft in 2006 and of having evaded service himself by pretending to have flat feet.Parts of the leaked recording were already publicized last week by public broadcaster KBS, showing him making threatening comments to journalists writing critical stories about him. Lee can be heard saying he “knows people” in the media, and that he could “get certain (reporters) fired.”Lee tried to extinguish the growing political wildfire during his hearing by defending his comments as being made in an informal gathering.“I would like to first apologize. But everything I said (in the recording) was during a luncheon with a few young journalists that I personally meet from time to time.”“And as to my remarks on the KYR bill, I would like to emphasize that I am a believer in the freedom of the press. If the bill passes, reporters could be subject to harsh restrictions that limit their freedom,” the lawmaker said.“But I beg your forgiveness.”If the National Assembly votes against Lee, Park’s prospective Cabinet shake-up could be delayed or canceled altogether as her “welfare without taxation” policy continues to take fire from critics, including members of her own party.Park’s tax policies have been dismissed by critics as unrealistic, with lawmakers stressing lower-than-expected tax revenues. On Tuesday, the Finance Ministry announced that the government had collected 10.9 trillion won ($10 billion) less than expected in tax revenues last year.A dozen bills aiming to boost economic output will likely remain pending if Lee’s nomination is stonewalled and exacerbates partisan strife. The bills include one designed to stimulate crowd-funding and one legalizing the construction of tourist attractions such as casinos near public schools.Analysts say that the Park administration badly needs Lee’s political acumen as her public ratings have fallen to new lows, with polls suggesting less than 30 percent of the public approve of her performance.

The prime minister is the second-highest position after president, but the job has been limited to a largely ceremonial role as power is concentrated heavily in the president.Outgoing Prime Minister Chung Hong-won will remain in the job until Lee is confirmed by the National Assembly, where Park's conservative party commands a majority.

Kim Moo-sung and the newly elected floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min last week voiced their opposition to the government’s plans, saying that it was impossible to expand welfare policies without increasing tax rates.“It keeps nagging at me, how our politics could make such a demand of the people ― that the government has to collect more money from taxpayers simply because we are short of tax revenues,” Park said at a weekly meeting with her senior secretaries.Park accused the ruling party of abandoning its duty to support the government’s policies on economic revitalization, saying that the work is aimed at creating jobs and reducing the tax burden on the people.“The economic revitalization is meant to create jobs, to impose less burden on the people and revive the economy. If (the party) turns away from these efforts, wouldn’t it be an act of betrayal to the people?”The remark came a week after Saenuri leader Kim directly resisted Park’s welfare policies. Rep. Kim, known as a longtime political rival of Park, claimed that they were populist pledges that were impossible to realize.Park had remained mute over Kim’s criticism until Monday.On Park’s cold criticism, Kim took a step backward from his previous stance later in the afternoon, stressing that the president and the Saenuri Party are on the same boat.“The Saenuri Party and the Park Geun-hye government share a common destiny,” said Rep. Kim in a meeting with foreign correspondents in Seoul. “The party is the president’s confident supporter and will help her to (overcome) difficulties.”On welfare and tax disputes, Rep. Kim said the problem could be solved through reaching a social consensus. “But it is not an easy job,” he said.Welfare expansion was the centerpiece of Park’s presidential campaign.Park promised to provide free child care and a higher monthly allowance for elderly citizens and to revise the current health insurance program to fairly impose fees based on subscribers’ income levels. Instead of raising taxes, Park vowed to create new income sources from the underground economy and curtail unnecessary and costly state-led projects. The Park government, however, recently came under fire as it raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform public servants’ pensions and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, which were seen as attempts to collect more money from workers to pay for the costly welfare policies.The president’s rejection of the party’s demand is expected to spark a heated controversy on tax hikes and further strain her ties with the party.Rep. Yoo, a nonmainstream lawmaker, became the new floor leader in the party’s primary vote last week. His victory was seen as the party starting to make critical approaches to the president’s policies, at a time when she suffers from deepening public distrust. Her ratings plummeted to below 30 percent late last month. To restore public trust, Park said she will carry out reshuffles of the Cabinet and reorganize Cheong Wa Dae. So far, Park has nominated former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Lee Wan-koo as her new prime minister and is to announce another batch of ministers after the appointee gets parliamentary endorsement. Rep. Lee’s two-day confirmation hearing kicks off Tuesday and his nomination will be put to a vote Thursday. His nomination, however, is expected to face fierce opposition from the main opposition New Alliance Politics Alliance Party.The opposition lawmakers have accused him of abusing his power over media firms to stop publishing negative stories on him.The latest controversy follows a series of other allegations including academic plagiarism and real estate speculation.

Moon Jae-in, elected to head the New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Sunday, slammed Park’s so-called “welfare without taxation” policies, which sparked a public uproar after her administration raised the tobacco tax and decreased tax returns in this year’s settlements, while corporate taxes for conglomerates stayed the same, according to critics.Moon also visited the graves of past authoritarian presidents Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee, breaking an unofficial moratorium by left-wing figures. But the conciliatory nature of Moon’s visits were downplayed, due to his criticism of Park.“Park’s policies have divided and fractured our nation,” Moon said only seconds after visiting the graves of Rhee and Park, the incumbent president’s father.“President Park’s policies have created divisions domestically. Externally, her policies have led to troubled South-North relations,” Moon said. Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung (left) shakes hands with main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in on Monday. Moon was elected to the post on Sunday. (Yonhap)Later during a meeting with governing Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung, Moon echoed the opposition’s demands to raise corporate taxes for funding Park’s welfare plans. Park administration officials have balked at the idea, citing an economy with inflation rates in the 1 percent range. The governing party welcomed Moon’s visit to the resting places of presidents Rhee and Park but disagreed with Moon’s tax policy proposal.“Rep. Moon did the right thing,” governing party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo said. “But Moon must cooperate with the Park administration for our country to move forward,” he said in response to Moon’s critical remarks.South Korea’s political left has generally maintained a critical stance toward Rhee and Park. Its leaders have often refused to pay respects at their tombs in the New Year, on Independence Day or on other symbolic holidays.Rhee is credited with contributing to Japan’s defeat in World War II and leading the nation in the Korean War. But he is also known as an authoritarian who violently repressed political opponents and allegedly committed war crimes.Park is often credited with boosting South Korea’s economic output in the 1960s and ’70s, but is also remembered for using a security apparatus to silence dissidents such as the late former President Kim Dae-jung, a figure revered as one of the godfathers of the South Korean left.“Every past administration has its deeds and misdeeds,” Moon had said after winning the NPAD convention on Sunday. “President Park (Chung-hee) is remembered for the economic growth he fostered. President Rhee is remembered for his work in founding our country. I will visit them.”Saenuri leader Rep. Kim told Moon he would reciprocate by visiting the grave of former President Roh Moo-hyun, a left-leaning figure who died in 2009. Moon served as Roh’s chief of staff.Moon also later stopped by the tomb of Kim Gu, an anti-Japanese independence activist during Japan’s rule of Korea.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","monday dismissed president park ,democracy on sunday slammed ,on monday dismissed president ,monday dismissed president ,party on monday dismissed","['Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park ’s']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.47364175  0.41395292

Kim, known as a long-time political rival of Park, claimed that they were populist pledges that were impossible to realize.Park had remained mute over Kim’s criticism until Monday.Welfare expansion was the centerpiece of Park’s presidential campaign.Park promised to provide free child care services and a higher monthly allowance for elderly citizens and to revise the current health insurance program to fairly impose fees based on subscribers’ income levels. Instead of raising tax, Park vowed to create new income sources from the underground economy and curtail unnecessary and costly state-led projects. The Park government, however, came recently under fire as it raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform public servants’ pensions and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, which were seen as attempts to collect more money from workers to pay for the costly welfare policies.The president’s rejection on party’s demand is expected to spark a heated controversy on tax hike and also to further strain her ties with the party.Rep. Yoo, a nonmainstream lawmaker, became the new floor leader in the party’s primary vote last week. His victory was seen as the party starting to make critical approaches to the president’s policies, at a time when she suffers from deepening public distrust. Her ratings plummeted to below 30 percent late last month. To restore public trust, Park said she will carry out reshuffles of the Cabinet and reorganize Cheong Wa Dae. So far, Park has nominated former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Lee Wan-koo as her new prime minister and said will announce another batch of ministers after the appointee gets parliamentary endorsement. Rep. Lee’s two-day confirmation hearings kicks off Tuesday and his nomination will be put to a vote Thursday. His nomination, however, is expected to face fierce opposition from the main opposition New Alliance Politics Alliance Party.The opposition lawmakers have accused him of abusing his power over media firms to stop publishing negative stories on him.The latest controversy follows a series of other allegations including academic plagiarism and real estate speculation.

I will block the recklessness of the Park Geun-hye government, which is destroying the people's lives.""Moon especially accused Park of deceiving the public with her campaign pledge to expand welfare without tax hikes. Since taking office in February 2013, the Park administration has been dogged by questions about whether it will be able to implement all of the expensive welfare projects she promised without raising taxes.The government has come under fire in recent months for raising tobacco prices, pushing to reform civil service pensions and introducing a revised tax settlement scheme, all of which critics argue are designed to squeeze more money out of ordinary wage earners.""I will cut through to withdraw tax cuts for the rich, such as by normalizing the corporate tax rate,"" Moon said. ""I will once again establish a fair tax system.""South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won ($18.2 million) was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the preceding Lee Myung-bak administration.Earlier in the day, Moon visited the National Cemetery in Seoul to pay tribute to late former presidents, including Presidents Rhee Syng-man and Park Chung-hee, the father of the current president.About 50 opposition lawmakers accompanied Moon on the visit.It marked the first time that the opposition party's leadership paid their respects to the late authoritarian leaders whose legacies still divide the Korean public.Former President Park is praised by his supporters for leading the country's economic development in the aftermath of the 1950-53 Korean War, but denounced by his critics for brutally suppressing democracy.""I decided to pay my respects with the hope of contributing to national unity,"" Moon told reporters after paying tribute at the late presidents' graves.""True national unity is not achieved by paying respects at a cemetery but when the perpetrators repent for their historical wrongdoing, offer their sincere apology to the people, comfort the victims, and the victims come to have a heart of forgiveness,"" he said.

The policy has drawn criticism even from her ruling party that it is impossible to provide welfare without raising taxes.She was critical of calls from some lawmakers that the government should raise taxes to make up a revenue shortfall, saying the government did not do its best in revitalizing the economy. Park speaks in a regular meeting with her top aides at the presidential office on Monday.(Yonhap)""We should seriously think about whether we have done all we can before placing an additional burden on the public,"" Park said in a regular meeting with her top aides at the presidential office.""What is important is to find ways to solidify welfare while minimizing public burden.""South Korea has about a 20 trillion won ($18 billion) shortfall in tax revenue as protracted slow growth undermined the tax base.She reiterated calls for revitalizing the economy, saying it will help create more jobs and raise tax revenues, further alleviating the public's financial concerns.""I ask the parliament again to quickly pass bills meant to revitalize the economy,"" Park said.Park's ruling Saenuri Party commands a parliamentary majority with 158 seats in the 295-member National Assembly, which can allow the ruling party to push bills through the parliament unilaterally without cooperation from the main opposition party.Park's comments came as Moon Jae-in, the new leader of the main opposition party, vowed to raise the corporate tax rate and withdraw tax cuts for the rich in what he described as an attempt to establish a fair tax system.South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the preceding Lee Myung-bak administration.Moon, who had lost the presidential election to then ruling party candidate and now president Park in 2012, was elected chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy in a national convention on Sunday.Kim Moo-sung, the chairman of the ruling party, voiced support for the president's stance.""The Saenuri Party and the Park Geun-hye government are bound together by a common destiny, and the Saenuri Party will become a reliable assistance force and help (solve) the president's problems,"" he said in a meeting with foreign correspondents in Seoul.He added that the best solution to the welfare controversy would be a ""grand social compromise,"" which he acknowledged would not be an easy task.Also Monday, Park called for more slashing of the country's red tape to make it easier for mergers and acquisition of local startups as part of efforts to revitalize startups and venture firms.

Late last month, his second son voluntarily underwent a medical exam in public to prove that he was legitimately exempted from mandatory military service.On Monday, Lee denied the allegations in a written response to the National Assembly's inquiries.He claimed that his wife, followed by his second son, has faithfully paid the inheritance tax on a piece of land acquired from his father-in-law in Bundang, just south of Seoul.On the reasons for buying a high-class apartment in southern Seoul, Lee said he bought it for his family to live in, not for speculation purposes.He acknowledged that his thesis did not meet the strict ethical standards of today when it comes to citations, but argued that he still wrote the paper independently using his own data and analytical methods.Lee's nomination is scheduled to be put to a vote during a plenary session on Thursday.If he fails to win parliamentary approval, Park could face another setback in running state affairs as she has been plagued by a series of unsuccessful personnel nominations.In recent weeks, her approval rating dropped to 29 percent, her all-time low since taking office two years ago, according to polling agency Gallup Korea.

(Yonhap)“(The president) is expected to conduct a Cabinet reshuffle with the recommendation of the new prime minister after the parliamentary approval of nominee Lee Wan-koo is completed,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters on Sunday.“What I know (now) is that the scale (of the shake-up) will be small, including the maritime minister,” he said. The maritime minister’s post has remained vacant since late last year after former Minister Lee Ju-young returned to his party.The announcement came after Min announced the list of new vice ministers appointed by the president on Sunday.Park named presidential secretary for education Gim Chae-chun as education vice minister, and promoted assistant ministers for future strategy and culture, Choi Jae-you and Park Min-kwon, to vice-ministerial posts in their respective ministries.When asked about the fate of Park’s chief of staff, Min said there will be an announcement about it after Lee’s confirmation process wraps up. “It is said that there will be an announcement,” he said. But the spokesman said that it is not yet known whether the announcement will be about Kim leaving or staying.Min also hinted that the president is likely to appoint presidential advisers for political affairs after the confirmation hearings.Last month at her New Year’s news conference, the president said she would conduct a “small-scale” Cabinet reshuffle. Park appointed Lee, former floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, as her new prime minister and replaced three senior presidential secretaries.But she has come under growing pressure both from the ruling and the main opposition to carry out a massive reshuffle of her Cabinet and presidential secretaries to restore public support for her reform drive. Her approval ratings plummeted more than 10 percentage points in three weeks to below 30 percent on Jan. 27. It was her lowest rating since she entered office and far lower than when her leadership was questioned in the wake of the Sewol ferry accident. Her disapproval rating also polled above 60 percent for the first time.Critics say that Park’s plan to keep the scale of reshuffle minimal reflects her determination to maintain “stability” in her state management. Some suggested that the president could replace a few ministers, including unification, land and transport, and maritime.The presidential office appears to have decided to retain as many incumbent Cabinet members as possible, amid fears of losing time in the confirmation hearings on new nominees as Park entered her third year in the office. Her term ends in early 2018. Under the Korean law, Cabinet members are subjected to confirmation hearings, but only the prime minister nominee requires parliamentary approval.The National Assembly plans to hold a confirmation hearing for Lee Tuesday and Wednesday, with a vote scheduled for Thursday. If the prime minister nominee obtains parliamentary endorsement, the reshuffle could be carried out over the weekend or early next week, according to observers.Park appears confident as she plans to reveal the names of her new Cabinet appointees after Lee gets parliamentary approval. But it remains unclear whether he will pass the parliamentary vote amid escalating controversy over his alleged power abuse over media, academic plagiarism and real estate speculation.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","cabinet reshuffle after her ,call for change president ,to conduct cabinet reshuffle ,cabinet reshuffle after ,scale cabinet reshuffle after","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Lee Wan - koo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48584652  0.21519269

Moon Jae-in, former confidant of the late former president Roh Moo-hyun, as its new chairman at the party convention in Seoul.Rep. Moon, who lost to President Park Geun-hye in the 2012 presidential race, defeated Rep. Park Jie-won in a close contest by winning 45.3 percent of the final count. Rep. Park won 41.8 percent of the votes. More than 71 percent of the party’s 15,019 delegates participated in Sunday’s vote.   The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy picks Rep. Moon Jae-in as its new leader. (Yonhap)Reps. Joo Seung-yong, Jun Byung-hun, Jung Cheong-rae, Oh Young-sik and You Seung-hee were elected to the party’s supreme council. Moon and his council will serve a two-year term and oversee the party during next year’s parliamentary elections.“Change begins now. We will move forward now,” Moon said. “I will start an all-out war against the Park Geun-hye administration if (it keeps) destroying democracy, and the middle-class economy.”For Moon and his council members, victory brings on tough challenges ranging from controversial policy debates with the governing Saenuri Party to reknitting a party wracked by factionalism and worryingly low public ratings. If Moon can produce results though, he might have another shot at the presidency in 2017, some analysts say.Proposed reforms to the pension for retired civil servants and revisions to the Constitution that will diminish the president’s grip over domestic politics have been the policy hot potatoes dividing politicians on party lines.President Park and key members of her Saenuri Party have supported reforming the pension for retired officials, saying the funds have wreaked havoc on public coffers. But they oppose rewriting the Constitution, saying it would create partisan fights detrimental to implementing other reforms.They have cited in-house tallies that assert the pension will create additional debts of 18 trillion won ($16.4 billion) by 2020 if reforms are not implemented.The NPAD, on the other hand, has failed to come up with a unified voice. It has also failed to offer the nation any specific alternative to the Saenuri Party’s position on the two issues.The main opposition has merely been able to compel the Saenuri Party to form a parliamentary panel for debating the pension reforms, after public officials’ unions, the main beneficiaries of the pension and a key political base to the NPAD, protested the Park administration’s reform plans.The opposition has also come up empty on constitutional changes, although some NPAD lawmakers have floated suggestions to transfer the president’s authority over nominating Cabinet members to a parliament-elected prime minister.Opposition supporters have hoped this year’s convention would raise the party’s struggling public ratings and unite its many factions before the 2016 general elections. But the race has been marred by emotional verbal fighting that has only worsened factionalism, critics said. The race was viewed as a fight between the leaders of the party’s main factions from the start. Analysts viewed Moon, the opposition’s 2012 presidential hopeful, as the representative of the so-called pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction, named after admirers of the late president. Park was seen as the leader of the non-Rohs, an inclusive camp encompassing those not for the pro-Rohs.Lee was considered the leader of the 486 faction, a group composed of former student activists that led street protest against the military dictatorships of the 1980s.NPAD supporters had hoped though that the three candidates would compete by engaging in productive policy debates to offer alternatives to President Park Geun-hye’s so-called “welfare without taxation” policy.But the campaign trail was tattered with emotional finger-pointing that showed Park and Moon blaming each other for the party’s many woes.The main opposition’s factionalist woes worsened when former presidential candidate Chung Dong-young exited the party last month, saying the NPAD had tilted “too much toward the right.”With Moon having won the leadership by only a small margin, his task to unite the party will be that much more challenging. Park supporters, based mainly in the Jeolla region, have even threatened to exit the party en masse, although that chance appears slim according to analysts.Over one year remains until the 2016 April general elections, but public rating lags behind the governing party, showing Moon has much catching up to do.A Gallup Korea poll conducted from Feb. 3-5 on 1,003 adults nationwide showed the main opposition party having a 24 percent public rating and the Saenuri Party enjoying a 41 percent standing. The survey had a 95 percent confidence level and a 3.1 percent margin of error.A Realmeter survey taken in late January, showed the NPAD’s 27.5 percent rating lagging behind the governing party’s 35.9 percent. That survey had 2,500 adult respondents nationwide and a 95 percent confidence level on a 2 percent margin of error.The numbers come despite falling ratings for an embattled President Park. Her ratings are near the 30 percent mark, according to the same polls.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","2012 presidential race defeated ,presidential race defeated rep ,the 2012 presidential race ,2012 presidential race ,presidential race defeated","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Seoul', 'Moon', 'Park Geun', 'Park Jie - win', 'Park']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.18401158 -0.09692979

His rival, Park Jie-won, a three-term lawmaker, garnered 41.78 percent.""Party members voted for a change, and I will fulfill the grave mission,"" Moon said in an acceptance speech. ""I will wage a full-out war with the government of President Park Geun-hye if it continues to ruins democracy and the livelihoods of ordinary people.""Moon replaces the current interim chief, Moon Hee-sang, who took office in September after his predecessor resigned amid factional infighting.NPAD has been headed by the interim leader since its two co-leaders -- Kim Han-gil and Ahn Cheol-soo -- stepped down to take responsibility for the party's crushing defeat in July's parliamentary by-elections.The new NPAD leader is faced with a daunting task of regaining public confidence in the opposition party, which has been dogged by infighting between a pro-Roh faction and others.Moon pledged to end the ""factional politics"" by establishing a transparent and fair nomination system to pick the right candidates for the upcoming general election. A weekly survey by Gallup Korea showed Friday that the approval rating for NPAD came to 24 percent, far lower than the ruling party's 41 percent.The new leader is seen as a potential presidential candidate in the next election slated for late 2017. In the previous election in December 2012, Moon was the standard-bearer of NPAD's predecessor but he eventually lost to then candidate and now President Park Geun-hye of the ruling Saenuri Party.Before the national convention, Moon said he would not stand for the next parliamentary elections scheduled for 2016 if he is elected chairman.In response to the new chief's strong stance on the Park administration, the ruling Saenuri Party urged Moon to lead his own party in harmony and make bipartisan efforts to deal with urgent issues pending in the parliament.  ""The temporary parliamentary session in February should be a turning point as should work with the ruling party to handle several issues, including reform of the government employees' pension system and bills aimed at boosting the economy,"" Saenuri spokesman Kwon Eun-hee said in a briefing.

He is scheduled to undergo confirmation hearings at the National Assembly on Tuesday and Wednesday, after which a plenary session will be convened on Thursday to put his nomination to a vote.Lee and his second son are suspected of avoiding conscription, a highly sensitive issue in South Korea, which remains technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. All able-bodied South Korean men between the ages of 18 and 35 must serve in the military for about two years.The prime minister nominee is also suspected of speculating in real estate, plagiarizing his doctoral thesis and intentionally omitting parts of his annual wealth report.""Prime Minister nominee Lee should decide his course of action on his own,"" a group of lawmakers from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said in a statement. ""He should fully explain about the suspicions and apologize to the nation.""Lee is not qualified to become a prime minister because he has persisted in denying the suspicions, the lawmakers said, adding that what is more serious is his ignorance of his wrongdoing.The ruling party criticized the main opposition party for pressuring the prime minister nominee to step down, based only on suspicions without undergoing a legal procedure.""It is not desirable to try to make the nominee drop his nomination, citing only suspicions,"" Saenuri spokeswoman Rep. Kwon Eun-hee said. ""Credentials of public-post nominees should be screened through a confirmation hearing."" Chung will remain in the country's No. 2 political job until Lee is confirmed by the National Assembly, where Park's conservative party commands a majority. Chung offered to resign in the wake of April's tragic ferry accident that claimed more than 300 lives, but Park retained him in June.In South Korea, the prime minister is the second-highest position after the president, but the job has been limited to a largely ceremonial role as power is concentrated heavily in the president.

The three-term lawmaker must now respond to charges that he faked medical records to avoid serving in the military.Lee was initially approved to serve in the active service in 1971 according to NPAD Rep.

Lee had indeed suffered from flat feet before 1971, how did he get approved to serve? If he had flat feet, it would have been common sense for him to have applied for a re-exam immediately,” Jin said.“It appears he was relieved from his military duties once he was able to secure a job,” Jin said in reference to Lee’s passing the national civil service exam in 1974.Lee’s confirmation hearing will begin next Tuesday.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition party on friday ,korea obligatory military draft ,party on friday accused ,of dodging south korea ,friday accused the prime","['South Korea ’s', 'Cabinet', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Wan - koo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74456954  0.37015748

Jin Sun-mee claimed that Lee made profits by buying and selling four apartments in Gangnam and Banpo, residential districts in southern Seoul that were designated as speculation zones by the government at that time.Lee purchased the four apartments after entering public service in 1974, Jin said. The NPAD lawmaker cited property documents showing that Lee had purchased three apartments in the Banpo district of Seoul in the late 1970s and early ’80s by taking out loans on the properties. Lee began by taking out a loan on his first home and using it to buy an apartment in Banpo district in 1978, Jin said. “He took out additional loans on his second home and used the new money to buy a third home. Lee sold the second home once it doubled in value.”Lee used the same method to buy his fourth home in the late 1980s, the NPAD lawmaker added.“This is pretty much standard practice for real estate speculators,” Jin said, adding that the district was a hot target for speculators at the time.This is the latest in a long list of criticisms of Lee, who was appointed to the Prime Minister’s Office on Jan. 23 by President Park Geun-hye.Jin’s allegation adds to suspicions that Lee profited from land deals in Gyeonggi Province in 2000, while serving as a lawmaker on a parliamentary panel overseeing national real estate policy. The value of the property reportedly rose 10-fold between the time of purchase and sale.Lee is also accused of purchasing and selling an apartment in the Gangnam district of Seoul in 2003. The ex-floor leader of the Saenuri Party made a profit, his critics say, of over 400 million won ($367,512).But Lee has denied the charges, saying he has paid related taxes and has not done anything illegal. Lee’s supporters have said the experienced politician will reveal everything at his confirmation hearing next Monday. The NPAD and Saenuri Party are at loggerheads over whom to call in as witnesses to the hearing, suggesting that it could be postponed.Statements by top NPAD officials have shown, though, that Lee is likely to pass the confirmation, despite the accusations.NPAD floor leader Rep. Woo Yoon-keun most recently told the incumbent Prime Minister Chung Hong-won that he had done a “good job during his time in office” during a nationally televised speech Wednesday, apparently implying that Lee would soon replace Chung.Lee earned a reputation as a reasonable negotiator on divisive partisan issues during his term as Saenuri Party floor leader last year. He is one of the few governing party officials who enjoys respect from the NPAD’s top leaders, including Rep. Moon Hee-sang and Woo.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","and selling four apartments ,illicit profits through four ,selling four apartments ,selling four apartments in ,opposition party on thursday","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Jin Sun - mee', 'Lee', 'Gangnam', 'Banpo', 'Seoul']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74008191  0.28785497

Woo Yoon-keun of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy repeated demands for constitutional revisions aimed at decreasing the president’s authority over domestic political affairs.Constitutional amendments would resolve not only the country’s political problems but also its long-term economic worries, such as fears over deflation and rising debt levels, Woo said.“Our country is marked by a series of monopolies,” the three-term lawmaker added. “Monopolies are omnipresent in our economy, in politics, and throughout other parts of our society.”“Our nation’s partisan fights have more often hindered efforts to fix our economy,” he continued. “I trust that revisions to the Constitution will offer a fundamental resolution.”Calls to revise the Constitution and thereby limit the president’s powers are decades old. But the NPAD and some members of President Park’s governing Saenuri Party, the dominant parties in Seoul, have reignited the debate in recent months.They support forming a parliamentary panel to discuss details of possible reforms such as taking away the president’s right to nominate members of her Cabinet and the Constitutional Court, while giving more authority to the prime minister, a post widely considered to be ceremonial.Park has refused to discuss the proposals though, saying such debates would divert public attention away from more urgent economic reform plans.Potential reforms suggested by the president include plugging what her supporters call the “debt-sucking” pension for retired civil servants, implementing a more laissez-faire policy in the labor market, and easing mortgage loan rules to increase home purchases. Some of these ideas have been dubbed “Choinomics,” after Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who masterminded many of them.Woo called “Choinomics” a failure during his speech.“The government is asking citizens to take more loans even as household debt levels continue past the 1 quadrillion won ($921 billion) mark.”South Korea’s household debt stands at 1.06 quadrillion won as of the third quarter of 2014, according to Bank of Korea estimates.Saenuri Party officials offered a measured response to Woo’s remarks.“Discussing constitutional reforms could hamper the government’s efforts to revive our economy,” Rep. Park Dae-chul said. “Putting it up to a referendum is a bit too early.”“There were many parts in Rep. Woo’s speech that deserve careful consideration and debate,” Saenuri Party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo said.“But he seems to have agreed that it’s the economy that requires our attention.

Kim Moo-sung addresses the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)""Welfare without tax hikes is impossible and it isn't right for a politician to deceive the public with such words,"" he said in his address to the National Assembly.  President Park Geun-hye promised during her 2012 election campaign to expand welfare programs without increasing tax rates. Early in her term, she vowed to regularize the underground economy, curtail unnecessary projects and plug tax loopholes in order to fund the programs.  In recent months, however, the government has raised tobacco prices, pushed to reform civil service pensions and introduced a revised tax settlement scheme, all of which critics argue are designed to squeeze more money out of ordinary wage earners.  ""In order to enjoy the benefits of welfare as a right of the people, one must realize that one must bear the cost of paying taxes as an obligation of the people,"" Kim said, citing the examples of Argentina and Greece, which experienced serious financial trouble due to their short-sighted welfare expansion.  ""We must carry out an overall inspection of how our welfare budget is spent,"" he said. ""Based on the results, tax hikes should be pursued when no alternative can be found after seeking the public's opinion.""  The main opposition party, the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, offered a different solution to the problem, saying the real reason for the lack of funds lies in tax cuts for the rich.  ""Talking about tax hikes in order to avoid withdrawing tax cuts for the rich, after increasing all sorts of taxes for the working class, is the sort of thing Chairman Kim pointed out a politician shouldn't do,"" NPAD spokesman Park Soo-hyun said in a press briefing. ""As the fault lies in tax cuts for the rich, normalizing this should come first.""  The opposition party has accused the conservative Park administration of favoring large businesses at the expense of average wage earners, citing various tax benefits for the rich.  South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won ($18.2 million) was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the previous Lee Myung-bak administration.

Her rating slipped to 29.7 percent on Tuesday, the lowest since she entered office early 2013. The government’s controversial tax settlement scheme seems to be correlated to the sharp decline, Realmeter said in a statement.The poll ratings climbed up slowly starting on Wednesday as the president tried to please the public by visiting marketplaces and a day care center in Incheon, it added. For the survey, 2,500 adults were interviewed nationwide between last Monday and Friday. The poll has a 2 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level.Observers say Park’s steadily falling ratings will unsettle her nerves and press her to quickly finalize her reshuffle plan, possibly by early this week. Park appointed former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Lee Wan-koo as new prime minister and replaced her senior secretaries two weeks ago. Park said that she would also conduct a “small-scale” Cabinet reshuffle at her New Year’s conference last month. Some insiders say that the president could announce lists of new Cabinet members on Tuesday at the earliest, and also hinted that she could replace her chief of staff, who has been accused of exercising too much power in terms of state affairs and personnel choices.Park vowed Monday that she would avoid causing the public further concern by closely working with the ruling Saenuri Party over policy coordination. While expressing her gratitude for congratulatory messages for her 63rd birthday on Monday, senior presidential press secretary Yoon Doo-hyun told reporters in the morning that the president was set to have lunch with her chief of staff and other senior presidential secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae.“There was no birthday event planned but we will have a simple lunch at (the president’s) residence as senior secretaries wish to (celebrate the day),” said Yoon.Park has come under fire for her government’s revised tax settlement scheme and suspended plans to revamp the national health insurance system, with many questioning her principles-based leadership.Controversy escalated last week after Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said he would not consider introducing a new system to levy more health insurance fees on high earners. The remark quickly raised speculation that the minister may have been under pressure from the presidential office to backpedal on the policy to avoid agitating taxpayers already upset with the recent tax increases. The Park government has come under fire as some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,700) will have to pay additional taxes this year due to a new tax scheme.In an obvious move to placate the public, the Cabinet and presidential office said Sunday they would launch a joint consultative body to coordinate government policies. The new committee will consist of the two deputy prime ministers for economic and social affairs, the minister for government policy coordination, and three senior presidential secretaries for policy coordination, public relations and economic affairs, officials said.Pundits and the opposition party, however, lashed out at Park’s new joint body, stressing that it would not help to solve the political crisis that has arisen over her inconsistent welfare policies. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy urged the president to give up on her welfare policies if unable to implement them without boosting taxes. Launching a new committee would not help her win back public support, it stressed. “Public distrust of the government’s policies is expanding as it has backtracked on plans to revise tax settlement, reform the health insurance system, and raise automobile and residence tax,” said NPAD chairman Moon Hee-sang at a party meeting.“It is because of the government’s unrealistic policies and its belief that welfare expansion is possible without a tax increase.”By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","january fell percentage points ,president political crisis deepens ,record low last week ,weekly job rating hit ,political crisis deepens president","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'realmeter']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83170527  0.27111784

Lee Ju-young after winning the election on Monday at the National Assembly. (Lee Gil-dong/The Korea Herald)Economist-turned-lawmaker Rep. Yoo Seong-min won the primary vote for Saenuri Party floor leader on Monday, defeating former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Joo-young with about 56 percent of the vote.Yoo’s victory appears to be an unofficial no-confidence vote for President Park Geun-hye from her governing Saenuri Party, as he is expected to take a critical approach to the president’s policies.Park’s approval ratings have continued to dip on the heels of alleged scandals in the presidential office and public uproar over increased taxes in this year’s settlements, stirring fear among Saenuri lawmakers looking to run in the 2016 parliamentary elections. Realmeter reported on Monday that President Park’s approval rating hit 32.2 percent, the lowest weekly figure recorded by the pollster since her inauguration.Yoo, a third-term lawmaker, told Saenuri lawmakers he would support government policies “that have the support of our people,” sparking speculation among observers that he would support Park’s policies if her approval ratings rose as the 2016 elections near.Before entering politics, Yoo worked at the Korea Development Institute, a government-run think tank focusing on economic issues.Yoo’s running mate Rep. Won Yoo-chul will serve as the party’s Chairperson of the Policy Committee, the top policy adviser to the floor leader. The primary has been seen as a contest between pro-Park Lee and the reportedly anti-Park Yoo.Lee and his running mate Rep. Hong Moon-jong have openly expressed their support for the president. Hong has claimed he would become Park’s “cheerleader” if elected. Lee has echoed one of Park’s campaign pledges from the 2012 presidential race, “welfare without taxation.”Their rivals Yoo and Won were seen as the anti-Park candidates in the floor leader primary, although Yoo has publicly contested the label. “I am neither a pro-Park nor an anti-Park figure,” Yoo said before the vote. “I will strictly follow what our citizenry demands.”Yoo was close to Park when he served as Park’s chief of staff, and as a key adviser to her during the 2007 Saenuri Party presidential primary.But rifts between Yoo and Park have steadily widened since the 2012 parliamentary elections, when Yoo protested what he called “Park’s closed-ear policy.” He is also reported to have declared “never to work with Park.”Park was the Saenuri Party’s interim chair at the time.A majority of the 158 Saenuri Party lawmakers participated in Monday’s vote with 84 casting ballots for Yoo, 65 for Lee and nine abstaining. Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Prime Minister nominee Rep. Lee Wan-koo abstained.Park’s ratings have declined amid fierce public uproar over the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal and increased taxes caused by government reforms to related laws in 2013.Citing leaked presidential office papers, a local daily accused Chung, a former Park aide, of having used ties to incumbent Cheong Wa Dae staff to exert pressure on some Cabinet members to resign.Prosecutors have claimed the allegations are false, though public suspicion lingers. Government changes to tax laws in 2013 forced taxpayers to forego much of their rebates or pay more in this year’s tax settlements, touching off calls of protest among the local media and taxpayers.By Jeong Hunny(hj257@heraldcorp.com)","monday defeating former maritime ,min won the primary ,defeating former maritime minister ,party new floor leader ,after winning the election","['the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Lee Ju - young', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee Gil - dong', 'Korea', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Joo - young']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07036401  0.24773301

Lee Ju-young will face off against Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Lee is a former judge and a four-term lawmaker. Yoo is a three-term legislator and a former researcher at the Korea Development Institute, a state-run think tank focusing on economic policies.The primary is expected to be close. But whoever wins will play the unofficial party whip of the majority Saenuri Party in the National Assembly, as President Park struggles to push through an array of unpopular reforms to areas including civil servants’ pension and the labor market.Many of her proposals have drawn mixed responses from the public at best, compelling vote-wary legislators to defer passing related amendments, with just over one year left until the 2016 parliamentary elections.Analysts consider Lee to be a pro-Park figure, and if he wins, the lawmaker is likely to support many, although not all of the president’s reforms, by passing related revisions in the Assembly. If Yoo wins, he is expected to take a more critical approach to Park’s policies.The reforms on the nation’s pension for retired bureaucrats have drawn a fierce backlash from government officials, the main beneficiaries of the pension. Park proposes decreasing the government’s gross payouts from the pension, as it is expected to deplete national coffers in the coming decades, burdening future taxpayers. Public officials against the reform say that the pension compensates them for their relatively low wages.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","economist in monday governing ,leadership primary an election ,four term lawmaker yoo ,an economist in monday ,economist an ex judge","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Lee', 'Yoo', 'the Korea Development']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57829362  0.49306002

If it is passed, lawmakers, government officials, and possibly journalists, among others, will be subject to strict penalties for graft.The bill is named after its initial proposer, who served as a Supreme Court Justice and the head of the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission, a government body. It proposes penalizing civil servants and their families found to have received gifts, however small.That would include officials who take ostensibly innocent gifts such as Christmas or birthday presents.The bill also proposed putting non-government officials working for the public good subject to the bill, such as members of the media and teachers in private secondary schools.Critics have alleged that the bill is unnecessarily overreaching.The governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy have conducted intermittent debates on the bill, trying to narrow its sweeping nature.Lawmakers at the National Assembly’s National Policy Committee passed a version of the bill that put the bar at 1 million won ($907) on Jan. 8. Officials who receive more than that amount will face criminal charges, while those taking lesser gifts will face fines.The bill is pending before the Legislation & Judiciary Committee, which is the final debating ground for the main parties, before a draft law is voted on at a plenary session.Debates over controversial bills at plenary sessions are often symbolic, as partisan divisions over such bills are ironed out beforehand at the Assembly’s judiciary panel.Judiciary committee chief NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min has hinted that his panel could take some time before OK’ing the bill, due to its overreaching character, despite bipartisan support for the legislation.More divisive partisan battles this session are expected elsewhere.The special investigative committee on the Lee Myung-bak administration’s resource diplomacy policy will hold a meeting Monday to decide on witnesses to testify before the panel.NPAD officials have consistently demanded key administration officials testify, including incumbent Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, and former officials in the Korea National Oil Corporation, Korea Resources Corporation, and other public bodies that participated in the policy.Saenuri Party officials have consistently refused, citing that calling in such officials is “unprecedented.”Ex-President Lee and top officials in his administration are accused of investing public money into risky foreign ventures on energy development.Prime Minister nominee Lee’s confirmation hearing will also present the main parties with grounds for political fighting.

The remark quickly raised speculation that the minister may have been under pressure from the presidential office to backpedal on the policy to avoid agitating taxpayers already upset with the recent tax increases.Cheong Wa Dae, however, exacerbated the mess Thursday as it flatly denied the minister’s remark, saying that the government would consider introducing the new system. The ministry backtracked from the new health insurance policy entirely on Moon’s judgment, said presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook. “We believe that (the remark came from) the health minister’s own judgment that the government may need deeper discussion on the policy in order to form a social consensus,” he said.The Park government has been seeking ways to implement a new system to fairly impose health insurance fees based on subscribers’ income levels.The new policy on health insurance was to plug an obvious loophole in the system. Under the current payment system, some subscribers with similar incomes pay different health insurance fees and those who are registered as a dependent in a family are not obliged to pay the mandatory fees even if they hold massive amounts of assets.The unfairness of the system sparked criticism when a mother and her two daughters committed suicide last year after suffering from financial difficulties. Because none of the family members were employed, they had to pay a monthly health insurance cost of 50,140 won, which was calculated based on their assets, even though other rich subscribers enjoy the same health service for free if they are registered as dependents.The revision of the system was one of Park’s campaign pledges.Minister Moon’s remark follows the harsh public criticism the Park administration faced over the government’s new tax settlement scheme. In the face of strong resistance, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to push for revision of the tax code to offer more tax refunds to eligible taxpayers.The main opposition New Politics Alliance Democracy lashed out at the government for backtracking on its plan to revise the current health insurance payment system. “It is the president’s duty to seek the public’s understanding after honestly explaining the reason why the government has given up on the policy,” said Rep. Woo Yoon-keun.“This is not the first time that Park didn’t keep her promises, but it is apparent that the people would be more disappointed on this,” he said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","pyo told lawmakers wednesday ,controversy escalated on thursday ,lawmakers wednesday ,told lawmakers wednesday that ,insurance fees controversy escalated",['Moon Hyung - pyo'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09526964  0.5181675

Lee Wan-koo had speculated on real estate, as part of efforts to scrutinize the nation’s next potential Cabinet member.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy has made a laundry list of accusations against Lee and his family. Lee has vowed to clear his name at his confirmation hearing next Monday, three days before the National Assembly puts his appointment to a final vote.His critics fall into two camps. A moderate group says Lee’s confirmation hearing should focus on examining the nominee’s competence as the president’s top deputy. Hard-liners say that his past raises questions that must be answered. Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo answers questions from reporters in front of his temporary office in Tongui-dong, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)NPAD hard-liners appear to be focusing their firepower on allegations that Lee speculated on land in Gyeonggi Province in 2000, when he was serving on the parliamentary panel that oversees national real estate policy. The value of the land he bought is thought to have risen tenfold.His critics have also cited property records showing that the governing Saenuri Party’s former floor leader bought a luxury apartment in the relatively wealthy Gangnam district of Seoul in 2003, before selling it six months later for approximately 39 percent higher than the initial price.Lee denied the charges, reiterating that he has documents to prove related tax payments and claimed that he sold the properties for reasons unrelated to speculation.NPAD hard-liners have also launched attacks pertaining to Lee’s family, although main opposition officials appear to be retreating on those issues, after moderates hinted that the charges had gone too far.Those attacks include an accusation that Lee’s second son dodged mandatory military service in 2006 by faking a leg injury, with Lee’s implicit approval.In tears, Lee vowed Thursday that his son would take an MRI image of the leg. “I feel mixed emotions, because I could be asking him to do something beyond anything a father should ask his son to do,” he said.Seoul National University Hospital officials later told reporters that X-ray photos of the leg “likely showed an earlier surgery in the ligament following an injury.”Another charge against his family involves his brother, who was arrested in 2011 for influence peddling and receiving bribes from public contractors in South Chungcheong Province. Lee was governor there until 2009.NPAD officials have also questioned Lee’s stint with law enforcement during ex-President Chun Doo-hwan’s rule in the early 1980s’, when Chun, a military dictator, used his influence over the military and police to impose an authoritarian regime.The list goes on. But Lee appears confident that he will survive the political onrush, saying he will reveal everything at his confirmation hearing.President Park Geun-hye last Friday named Lee to join her Cabinet as her No. 2. Park supporters hope his reputation as a moderate compromiser among lawmakers from both the Saenuri Party and the NPAD will help boost the president’s struggling approval rating, which slid below 30 percent this week according to Realmeter, a local pollster.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","confirmation hearing next monday ,party officials on thursday ,confirmation hearing main opposition ,hearing next monday three ,main opposition party officials","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Cabinet', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31324792  0.27213129

I'm greatly concerned about of this kind of situation.""Another focus of the ongoing parliamentary probe is whether the development projects involved any corruption or illegalities by Lee's aides.""We can conduct a thorough investigation and severely punish those involved if any corruption is found in the development projects,"" he said.

Hong Moon-jong will run for the party’s policy committee chair as party floor leader hopeful Rep. Lee Ju-young’s running mate. Rep. Won Yoo-chul will run as Rep Yoo Seong-min’s deputy. The policy committee chairperson serves as the top policy adviser to the floor leader.The Lee-Hong duo is considered to represent the pro-Park faction, while the Yoo-Won partnership is considered to stand for the anti-Park faction. There has been no credible poll previewing the primary, to be held next Monday. Experts say the results will be close.Lee has previously run for the party’s floor leadership. The former judge ran against Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan in 2013, but lost by just more than 5 percent of the votes. But Lee has strengthened his public standing after serving as the maritime minister in President Park’s Cabinet last year. Lee was one of the few Saenuri officials to openly express sorrow for the victims of a ferry accident that had become politicized, something that many of his party officials avoided. Lee gained a reputation as a moderate through his actions, analysts have said, an image that the president may need to raise her public standings, which have fallen to new lows according to recent polls.Lee’s competitor Yoo also presents strong credentials. The former economist appears to be investing his political future on the growing anti-Park public sentiment. The president’s public ratings have been falling according to recent polls by Gallup Korea and Realmeter, to the 30 percent range.The two pollsters conduct weekly polls with sample sizes often ranging from 1,000 to 5,000.

Rep. Shin Hak-yong of New Politics Alliance of Democracy is suspected of creating a slush fund of around 100 million won ($92,000) with the money he pocketed from salaries of his three aides between 2007 and last year. Investigators believe that the 63-year-old three-term lawmaker took the money in exchange for helping them get party nominations for local elections. Two of the aides were elected as councilors of local assemblies in the last two elections held in 2010 and 2014.The prosecution said they would question Shin on whether he was involved in creating the illegal fund and pulled strings to help them get party nomination to run for local assembly seats.Shin has denied the allegations.“The allegations (of creating a slush fund from salaries of the aides) are not true,” Shin told reporters before entering the Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office. “It is unthinkable for me to exercise influence on party nominations.”Investigators have requested Shin to appear for questioning multiple times since last year. But the lawmaker disobeyed a summons, citing schedule conflicts. As part of the investigation, the prosecution raided the homes and offices of the three concerned political aides and summoned them last year.The lawmaker is currently standing trial over a separate case of bribery. He is suspected of having received kickbacks from the head of Seoul Art College in return for helping it change its name. The college chairman had offered bribes to Shin and his colleagues to omit the term “vocational” from the school’s original name, prosecutors said. He is also accused of taking bribes from a kindergarten union for allowing special benefits.

Her disapproval rating hit 58.3 percent, a rise of 6.4 percent. The 95 percent confidence level was plus or minus 2 percent.Support ratings for President Park’s governing Saenuri Party stood at 38.6 percent.The announcement follows a Gallup Korea report last week that showed the president’s approval rating at a record low of 30 percent.Realmeter’s survey results also showed that 40.3 percent of respondents “highly disapproved” of the president, marking the first time the figure has exceeded 40 percent.President Park is facing an apparent political crisis according to survey results from the two pollsters this month. Analysts said Park’s refusal to fire her top aides accused of meddling in state affairs in the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, and the public uproar over increased taxes were the likely causes.Park last Friday named Saenuri Rep. Lee Wan-koo, a reputed compromiser who has supporters even in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, as her new Prime Minister to apparently raise her public ratings. Park is likely to reshuffle her aides in coming weeks.“Park’s ratings are lower than her party’s. This means she’s not helping her party. It means she’s actually contributing to the party’s unpopularity among voters,” Myongji University professor Chung Jin-min said in a phone interview last week.If Park’s approval ratings continue to fall, her top initiatives such as reforms to the pension for retired civil servants could be stalled in the National Assembly, as lawmakers looking to run in the 2016 parliamentary election try to distance themselves from the unpopular president’s policies.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","34 percent weekly poll ,new high last week ,her disapproval rating hit ,percent weekly poll conducted ,last week amid fears","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36550343  0.11593688

With 96.8 percent of polling stations counted, Syriza had 36.4 percent _ and 149 of parliament's 300 seats _ versus 27.8 percent for Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' conservatives.  If Tsipras, 40, can put together a government, he will be Greece's youngest prime minister in 150 years, while Syriza would be the first radical left party to ever govern the country. The prospect of an anti-bailout government coming to power in Greece has revived fears of a bankruptcy that could reverberate across the eurozone, send shockwaves through global markets and undermine the euro, the currency shared by 19 European countries. Syriza's rhetoric appealed to many in a country that has seen a quarter of its economy wiped out, unemployment above 25 percent and average income losses of at least 30 percent. Tsipras won on promises to demand debt forgiveness and renegotiate the terms of Greece's 240 billion euro ($270 billion) bailout, which has kept the debt-ridden country afloat since mid-2010.  To qualify for the cash, Greece has had to impose deep and bitterly resented cuts in public spending, wages and pensions, along with public sector layoffs and repeated tax increases. Samaras soon conceded defeat Sunday, saying he had received a country “on the brink of disaster” when he took over in 2012 and was close to ushering it out of the crisis. “I was asked to hold live coals in my hands and I did,” he said.  The country's progress in reforms is reviewed by inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank, collectively known as the troika, before each installment of bailout funds can be released. Tsipras pronounced the troika and its regular debt inspections “a thing of the past.” Greece's creditors insist the country must abide by previous commitments to continue receiving support. In Germany, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann told ARD network that he hoped “the new Greek government will not make promises it cannot keep and the country cannot afford.” The election results will be the main topic at Monday's meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Belgium's minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, said there is room for some flexibility, but not much.  “We can talk modalities, we can talk debt restructuring, but the cornerstone that Greece must respect the rules of monetary union _ that must stay as it is,” Van Overtveldt told VRT network.  JPMorgan analyst David Mackie said negotiations between the new government in Athens and creditors “are likely to be very difficult” but cannot drag on indefinitely. “If Greece is unable to honor its obligations this year, then economic, financial and banking stress is likely to lead either to an agreement, or to a second round of elections, or to an EMU exit,” he said, referring to Greece's membership in the eurozone. But Re-Define think tank analyst Sony Kapoor said that while Greece has failed the eurozone and EU authorities, they have also failed Greece. “The Greek rescue package was financially unsustainable, economically wrong-headed, politically tone-deaf and socially callous,” he said. “Syriza deserves a chance, and their victory will force the EU to confront the elephant in the room: unpayable debt and bad policy decisions.” He noted that Syriza's moderation of its rhetoric before the election “is promising, making it likely that it will govern closer to the center than many think.” A Syriza official said Tsipras would meet Monday with the head of the small Independent Greeks party, which elected 13 lawmakers, “to confirm the support and possible participation of the Independent Greeks in the new government.” The official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said Tsipras would likely be sworn in as prime minister later Monday, and the new government would be formed in the following couple of days.   The centrist Potami (river) party was battling for third place with the Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn, whose leader and several lawmakers campaigned from prison, where they are awaiting trial on charges of participating in a criminal organization. (AP)","radical left wins election ,left wins election threatening ,wins election threatening market ,victory in sunday parliamentary ,wins election threatening","['Greece', 'Alexis Tsipras', 'Greece']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66079092  0.0161482

420,420,[Newsmaker] Saenuri bigwig gears up to become PM,"Prime minister nominee Lee Wan-koo on Sunday kicked off preparations for his confirmation hearing at the parliament, after President Park Geun-hye nominated him to become her top deputy last week.

Among the issues expected to be discussed at the hearing are allegations concerning Lee and his son’s military duty exemptions, a crime committed by his brother and questions about a piece of land Lee gave his son in 2011. Shortly after his nomination on Friday, local media accused his son of wrongful exemption from military service. Lee himself was discharged from military service after serving only one year, apparently due to an ankle condition.Lee held a press conference the following day to show X-rays of the injury that led to his son’s exemption. On Sunday, Lee also said he was ready to address allegations of misdeeds concerning his and his son’s mandatary military duty.“If needed, I can even publicly have him take an MRI or X-ray. My son told me he is ready to comply with any demands to settle this issue,” he said.Prime minister nominee Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)While the accusation is likely to be a major issue in the hearings, observers expressed optimism about Lee’s chances of surviving the hearing since National Assembly members tend to go relatively easy on fellow lawmakers.The reaction from opposition lawmakers to Lee’s nomination has also been fairly benign. Rep. Moon Hee-sang, the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, vowed a thorough grilling of the candidate, but added that Lee’s competence as politician had “already been proven” and that he could play a significant role right away if he was confirmed.The NPAD, however, criticized the ruling party for helping Lee prepare for the hearing, saying the Saenuri should also join efforts to evaluate Lee’s qualifications for the post.Shin Yul, a politics professor at Myeongji University, said that Lee’s nomination may have been an attempt by Park to seek an “easy way out.”Last year, Park’s bid to replace Prime Minister Chung Hong-won ended in failure after her appointments of both Ahn Dae-hee and Moon Chang-keuk fell through. After the nomination debacle, Park decided to retain Chung. “She (Park) would not have wanted another fiasco like Moon and Ahn. Former politicians tend to have it easy in hearings, as they are ‘colleagues’ (of lawmakers),” he said.But appointing an incumbent ruling party lawmaker is problematic, Shin pointed out. Currently both deputy prime ministers for social and economic affairs are Saenuri lawmakers, which means the top three Cabinet positions may be filled by members of the president’s party. “The Saenuri Party already holds a majority in the National Assembly and if they (Saenuri lawmakers) also get hold of administrative positions, checks and balances will be virtually impossible. Birds of a feather flock together,” he said.Early Sunday, Saenuri officially accepted Lee’s resignation as the floor leader and he was briefed by officials of the prime minister’s office. His confirmation hearing is expected to be held early next month.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","parliament after president park ,sunday kicked off preparations ,his son in 2011 ,parliament after president ,top deputy last week","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Lee']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79498953  0.25538355

Lee Wan-koo, 64, entered public service in 1974 and is a three-term lawmaker. The former governor of South Chungcheong Province and current Saenuri Party floor leader has earned a reputation as a compromiser on divisive partisan issues. Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)Analysts said Lee’s appointment was part of efforts to redeem Park’s record-low approval ratings, which had fallen mainly due to her image as an uncommunicative leader.Park’s rating was 30 percent on Thursday according to a Gallup Korea poll of 1,001 adults. The poll has a 3.1 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level. The record-low tally is the result of a weekslong nosedive in Park’s ratings, partially caused by her refusal to yield to opposition demands that she rename some of her top aides, and Cabinet members.Public support for Park waned further earlier this week after preliminary calculations of this year’s tax settlements showed taxpayers nationwide could end up paying more taxes, or forfeit much of their rebates. Revisions to tax codes in 2013 by the government were faulted for the increased taxes.Hasty countermeasures by the Saenuri Party and the government to legislate a retroactive tax code by April were denounced as populist and short-term moves by critics.Local political experts, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and some members of Park’s Saenuri Party have recommended that Park conduct a radical Cabinet shake-up in order to lift her ratings.Park had partially agreed, saying she would carry out a minor Cabinet shake-up and a partial reorganization of the presidential office, during her New Year’s press conference on Jan. 12.But the announcement of Park’s latest approval rating appeared to have convinced Cheong Wa Dae officials to conduct a limited reshuffle earlier, to calm the growing public disapproval.Senior NPAD officials welcomed Lee’s nomination but said they would strictly review the Saenuri lawmaker’s qualifications at his confirmation hearing in the National Assembly.“Rep. Lee’s competence as a politician is already something everyone knows,” NPAD chair Rep. Moon Hee-sang said after the announcement was made.But Moon urged Lee to “better facilitate communication between lawmakers and the president.”“And you must know when to say no to the president,” Moon added in a meeting with Lee later Friday. Moon was echoing criticism that senior Saenuri Party officials were yes-men too afraid to offer the president honest political advice.One analyst, though, said the latest personnel change would not be enough to stem Park’s falling ratings. “This is a maximum-effort situation. This is a political crisis,” Hanshin University professor Yoon Pyung-joong said regarding Park’s falling ratings.“But the latest decision is a minimum-effort move,” he said. “Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon remains in office.”Kim was at the center of the NPAD’s reshuffle demands, as he is considered to be the one who should take responsibility for the Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, one of the contributors to Park’s low public ratings.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","three term lawmaker ,defuse political crisis president ,lawmaker the former governor ,friday nominated senior governing ,political crisis president park","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Saenuri Party']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39761996  0.39333096

It will also expand the number of preparatory schools ― operated for children of migrant families having difficulty with regular school curriculums ― from 80 to 100.In its briefing, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said that it would work to preserve the culture of the children’s native countries, by encouraging them to learn their own mother tongues. According to the ministry, 76.1 percent of children whose parents are from North America or Europe learn the native language of their parents, but only 3.1 percent and 17.1 percent of the children with Cambodian and Vietnamese roots do the same.Last year’s data from Statistics Korea showed that 8.3 percent of all marriages in 2013 were interethnic marriages. But another report by the National Human Rights Commission showed that 41.3 percent of multicultural children do not have a Korean friend, indicating that ethnic Koreans show little tolerance for migrant familiesThe government will introduce an online education system that will help ethnic Koreans better understand their neighbors from different ethnic groups. Officials will finalize the education content by August and will kick off pilot programs in September.As regards education reforms, the Education Ministry reiterating its intention to expand the “free semester” ― a no-test semester that provides job-related experience for first-year middle school students ― to 70 percent of all middle schools, up from 25 percent in 2014. The ministry will also push for enacting a bill that will mandate government and state-run bodies to provide programs for students. A pan-government committee on creating such programs will be established, and a separate bureau-level team dealing exclusively with policy will be created within the ministry.But the briefing left out any mention of the free high school education policy, one of President Park’s election pledges.“Free high school education has been put off for this year, and will be discussed next year. But the policy is not being discarded, just postponed” said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea.

The latest uproar darkens the political future of Park and the Saenuri Party, analysts said.To address the discontent, the government on Wednesday held an emergency meeting with senior members of the Saenuri Party. They agreed to revise related tax laws by April in the National Assembly. The ruling party said it would discuss with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy to push for legislation to retroactively apply the changes.The revisions will aim to increase tax deductions to households with two or more children, in a country whose birth rates have dipped to 1.19 as of 2013, according to Statistics Korea, a government-run body.The upcoming changes to tax codes will also increase deductions on pension-related taxes and taxes on unmarried, single-person households, the party said after the meeting.The move came a day after the presidential office and finance minister Choi Kyung-hwan tried to defuse fears about the tax increase. At a hastily arranged news conference on Tuesday, Choi apologized for causing concern but said that the new tax scheme is aimed at improving distribution of wealth. President Park also ordered officials to give proper explanations about the tax issue.The government-party agreement on Wednesday appears to have been reached amid fears that the tax scheme could further aggravate public sentiment.The recent tax increases follow an unpopular tax hike on tobacco products this year. The Korea Taxpayers’ Association, an activist group concerned with public finance, is currently leading a national signature campaign against the tax increases levied on this year’s settlements.“It is safe to say that this is the beginning of the end for the Park administration,” Yonsei University professor of Korean politics Yang Seung-ham said. “Park’s falling approval ratings appear to be difficult to stem. I won’t be surprised if the governing party loses in the 2016 general elections.”Chung-Ang University Korean politics professor Choi Young-jin agreed.“Everyone (in the Saenuri Party) knows this means trouble,” he said.“Taxpayers in their 40s and 50s will be affected the most. They might vote the other way in 2016, meaning that this is an opportunity for the opposition parties.”Park’s approval ratings had already fallen to the 30 percent range, apparently due to the public’s frustration at her refusal to fire her top aides linked to the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, in which the aides were accused of having meddled in state affairs.Park’s approval rating was 39.4 percent in a recent survey by Real Meter, a local pollster. The survey of 2,500 adults nationwide from Jan. 12 to 16 had a 2 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level.Gallup Korea measured Park’s approval ratings at 40 percent in the last quarter of 2014. The polling company takes weekly tallies of the president’s ratings, usually surveying about 1,000 adults, with a 3 percent margin of error and 95 percent confidence level.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","year tax filing escalated ,more taxes this year ,political troubles besetting president ,recent weeks preliminary tax ,tax uproar new challenge","['Park Geun - hye', 'the Korea Taxpayers ’ Association']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32700732  0.40197134

The revision, however, left some people with an annual income of less than 55 million won ($50,733) having to pay additional taxes.Under Wednesday's agreement, the government will raise tax credits for families with children and restore tax credits for new births and adoptions, Ju said.Unmarried salaried workers who do not qualify for tax credits received by families will receive separate tax credits, while tax deductions for post-retirement savings will be expanded, he said.The exact amount of tax credits will be determined by the end of March following an analysis of this year's tax returns.Any additional taxes that need to be paid under the new tax settlement scheme will be payable in installments.The ruling party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy will discuss ways to revise the tax code to reflect the proposed changes and handle the relevant bill during April's parliamentary session, Ju said.The parties will also jointly push for legislation to enable the retroactive payment of the tax credits, he said.During the meeting, Finance Minister Choi Kyoung-hwan apologized for causing ""an inconvenience and burden"" to the public.

Rep. Park Hong-keun of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy on Tuesday accused a state-run agency of failing to collect royalties that could amount to billions of won. The Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, in charge of preparing questions for the exam, known here as Suneung, has never exercised its copyrights over the exam questions, Park said.The state-run body customarily posts the test questions on its home page after the exam, and allows anyone to use them as long as it is not for profit. But workbooks containing the questions have hit the market every year. The annual sales of the workbooks is estimated to be about 10 billion won ($9.2 million), according to Park, and are sold publicly in bookstores across the country.Korean law states that copyright violators can face up to five years in prison, or a 50 million won fine. The KICE, however, claimed that Suneung questions were considered “public goods” to which exclusive copyrights did not apply. “The cost for preparing Suneung questions comes from taxes and admission fees by test-takers. By forfeiting the royalty fees, the KICE gave up on a revenue source to ease that financial burden,” said Rep. Park. “We have to figure out if this is due to incompetence of the education authorities, or if there is some sort of ‘connection’ between them and the publishers that profited from selling the workbooks.”In 2014, it cost 6.4 billion won to prepare the questions for the state-commissioned Suneung.Later in the day, the KICE denied allegations of illegal collaboration with local publishers and claimed the reason they did not collect royalty fees was to ensure that students would not shoulder extra financial burden. A KICE official said publishers are likely to charge more to students if it started charging the publishers for the questions.He said the agency will work the the Education Ministry to find best possible approach to copyright. This includes possibly changing the policy to collect royalty fees, although he added that the agency was looking at all options.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","an opposition lawmaker tuesday ,forfeited profit from college ,profit from college exam ,opposition lawmaker tuesday accused ,opposition lawmaker tuesday","['Park Hong', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52950704 -0.01806359

Before the revision, many wage earners were able to get tax refunds that were commonly referred to as a bonus or extra wage. ""We will actively study policies to relieve the tax burden, raise tax equity and restore the corporate tax rate to normal levels,"" Rep. Woo Yoon-keun, the floor leader of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said during a party meeting. South Korea's corporate tax rate on taxable income exceeding 20 billion won was lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent during the previous Lee Myung-bak administration.""The warehouses of conglomerates are overflowing, while the glass wallets of ordinary citizens are being emptied,"" he said.""Glass wallet"" is a term used to describe the ""transparent"" income of ordinary wage earners.Woo accused President Park Geun-hye's conservative administration of favoring large businesses at the expense of average wage earners, citing data that the corporate reserves of conglomerates amounted to 552 trillion won last year, double the amount five years earlier.The opposition party will study ways to revise the law to raise the tax credit rate from 15 percent to 20 percent during next month's extra parliamentary session, he added.The ruling Saenuri Party expressed frustration as the government's efforts to defuse the controversy only invited stronger criticism.In a hastily arranged press conference earlier in the day, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the extra money collected, mainly from high-income earners, would be used to finance two government programs aimed at helping low-income self-employed workers and encouraging people to have more children. He also said the government will consider adjusting tax deduction categories to give more benefits to families with children and help people prepare for retirement.""The government shouldn't be bent on temporarily stitching up the problem but think carefully about how to address the public's mistrust in the fairness of the tax system and come up with a solution as soon as possible,"" Kim Young-woo, the ruling party's senior spokesman, said in a press briefing. ""The Saenuri Party will do its best to find a more reasonable way that strikes a balance between welfare and the tax burden.""President Park Geun-hye also addressed the controversy.""It's important that (the public) thoroughly understand (the issue),"" she told Choi ahead of a Cabinet meeting at the presidential office earlier in the day.

To bring about a fundamental change, we need to hire fully qualified individuals at our day care centers. And for that, we need quality jobs with good working conditions.”According to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, day care workers earned an average of 1.12 million won ($1,030) a month in 2013, while working as much as 10 hours a day. Among the 1,634 workers surveyed by NHRCK, 60 percent said they did not get lunch breaks, while 40.6 percent said they were stressed because of the workload. Under the current system organized by the Welfare Ministry, a single worker may be asked to care for as many as 20 children aged 4 or older.“Educated and qualified workers don’t want to be overworked or underpaid,” said Yoon. “You can’t expect day care workers to do a good job without paying them enough.”Nationwide concern about child abuse by child care workers has erupted after a 33-year-old worker at an Incheon day cancer center was caught on CCTV footage beating a 4-year-old for not finishing her meal. A subsequent investigation found further abuses by the worker and a court issued an arrest warrant for her on Saturday. Following the controversial case, Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency said it had booked three teachers at an English-language kindergarten in Bucheon on suspicion of mistreating children. Meanwhile, in Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province, the police discovered through CCTV footage that a child had been forced by day care staff to eat food that had fallen on the floor. Hong Seong-bo from the child care division of the Seoul Metropolitan Government said having CCTV cameras installed was better than having no surveillance system at all. According to Hong, about 70 percent of day care centers run by the government in Seoul currently have cameras installed. “The cameras still give them a sense that they are being watched by someone else,” he told The Korea Herald. “It motivates the workers to be more careful with children.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","government recently announced countermeasure ,heated debate greets proposal ,countermeasure installing surveillance cameras ,child abuse cases at ,greets proposal for cctv","['Yoon Deok - gyeong', 'the Korean Women ’s Development Institute']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22558106  0.00792787

The president’s powers are too broad, they say, and the office’s authority over Cabinet nominations, among other things, should be cut back.But talks on reform have fizzled out due to wrangling over other issues and President Park Geun-hye’s lukewarm response to the proposals. Parliamentary sources said the trend would continue as other sensitive issues beg the National Assembly’s attention.President Park Geun-hye and the top brass within her governing Saenuri Party have emphasized that it is the economy that matters most, not political debate on constitutional reform, which could drown out legislation of key economic reform bills.Park and the Saenuri Party have vowed to prioritize labor market deregulation and public servants’ pension reforms this year. The policies aim to increase employment and reduce the national debt. Saenuri Party chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung’s urge to follow through on the reforms was visible when he expressed frustration during a press briefing following his New Year speech last week.Reporters had asked about political scandals and constitutional reform, and barely discussed the speech itself, which focused on economic reforms.The Saenuri Party on Thursday appeared determined to put off constitutional reforms.After a lengthy two-hour closed-door meeting of the floor leaders and chairs of the NPAD and the Saenuri Party, spokesmen for the two parties released a joint statement saying they agreed on the “need for constitutional reform,” but that they would “discuss details at a later date.”The NPAD, the main supporters of constitutional reform, also appear to be taking a break from the issue.“We are not sure when we will be able to discuss the matter again,” NPAD deputy floor leader Rep. Ahn Gyu-baek told The Korea Herald on Sunday. There was no major in-house debate on how to push for constitutional reform at the Assembly, the lawmaker added.Constitutional reform is almost as old as South Korea itself. The country was founded in 1948. The first revision came in 1952, and the Constitution was amended eight more times under military rule. The last revision came in 1987, when military rule ended.“Calls for constitutional reform usually come when politicians want to change the political rules to their advantage,” Myongji University professor Chung Jin-min said.A majority of NPAD and a few Saenuri lawmakers support strengthening the prime minister’s authority over domestic affairs and allowing the parliament to elect the prime minister, instead of giving the president the right to appoint the administration’s No. 2 official.

Those with populations one-third the size of larger voting districts are granted the same number of lawmakers. Justices said the population gaps were unconstitutional.Leaders of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and the governing Saenuri Party agreed to create a parliamentary committee sometime next month to discuss how to reduce population differences among voting districts.But parties agreed to give an external organization the final say over remapping the nation’s 246 parliamentary constituencies. Some say that this organization will be the National Election Commission, a government-run body unaffiliated with any party and in charge of managing South Korea’s major elections.The decision to give an outside body overall authority appears to be aimed at calming public fear that the country’s main parties would remap districts in their own favor, to protect their interests before the 2016 general elections.The two parties hold a combined 288 seats in the 295-seat parliament.Party representatives, though, failed to form a panel to consider amendments to the Constitution.Proposals to limit the president’s constitutional powers over domestic affairs such as Cabinet and Constitutional Court appointments have been raised since the 1970s. The opposition and some Saenuri lawmakers have reignited public debate over the issue.Main opposition officials say the president’s powers over Cabinet nominations give the chief executive overreaching political influence over governing party lawmakers, who often seek positions in the government’s top decision-making body to boost their political careers.Supporters of constitutional reform suggest strengthening the prime minister’s authority over domestic affairs. They also support electing the prime minister by parliamentary vote, as opposed to giving the president the right to pick a person for the government’s No. 2 job. Leaders of President Park Geun-hye’s Saenuri Party have been treading carefully though, after the president expressed her staunch opposition to rewriting the Constitution during her New Year Address Monday.The president and influential members of the governing party say such a parliamentary panel would only increase partisan wrangling, impeding key legislative reforms the Park administration is pursuing.These include possible changes to pensions for retired civil servants in order to lower the public debt, and deregulating the labor market, a move targeting the 9 percent youth jobless rate.“The NPAD strongly demanded forming a panel (to revise the Constitution) but the governing party proposed postponing such debates to a later date,” NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo said, adding that was all he had been told by the senior party leadership.“Parties were in consensus over the panel for electoral reforms, but there appear to be great differences over constitutional amendments.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","political parties on thursday ,parties discuss remapping voting ,discuss remapping voting districts ,parties on thursday ,remapping voting districts",['Constitutional Court'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78372568  0.00522223

435,435,Leak scandal escalates,"The presidential office said on Wednesday it will dismiss a public relations official who reportedly raised allegations that Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung secretly triggered a recent political scandal involving competing groups of aides to President Park Geun-hye.Eum Jong-hwan offered to resign after a news photograph showed Kim’s written memo, apparently a quote from a remarks made by Eum last month. It read, “...","The presidential office said on Wednesday it will dismiss a public relations official who reportedly raised allegations that Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung secretly triggered a recent political scandal involving competing groups of aides to President Park Geun-hye.Eum Jong-hwan offered to resign after a news photograph showed Kim’s written memo, apparently a quote from a remarks made by Eum last month. It read, “K and Y are behind the ‘document gate.’ Will unveil the truth. You will see. An announcement will come shortly.” “K” is said to stand for the ruling party leader and “Y” for Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the same party.Lee Jun-seok, a ruling party member, said Eum made the remark during a meeting between Cheong Wa Dae and party officials on Dec. 18, which he relayed to Kim during a recent conversation.“Administrative officer Eum denied the report that he made such a statement but tendered his resignation, taking responsibility for causing concern by misbehaving as a public official,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters. Eum is one of the presidential officials embroiled in the scandal. Kim has been struggling to head off the allegation about his role in the scandal after the photo published Tuesday sparked a new feud within his party.“It was preposterous,” Kim said in his New Year news conference Wednesday. Kim Moo-sungKim expressed concerns that the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal is threatening to derail President Park’s economic reform initiatives.The scandal began to surface last November after presidential papers that investigated Chung Yoon-hoi, Park’s former secretary, were leaked to a local daily.The papers alleged that Chung had meddled in government affairs and personnel decisions using his close ties to incumbent Cheong Wa Dae officials.Chung has denied the accusations. Prosecutors have concluded the rumors are false and indicted those who wrote the report and leaked it to the media. But the public appears unconvinced, according to multiple local polls. A survey by Ace Research and Consulting Group and the Seoul Shinmun, a local daily, showed 63.5 percent of 1,010 respondents did not trust the prosecution’s investigations.The poll was conducted a few days after the prosecution announced its investigation results, with a margin of error of 3 percent and a 95 percent confidence level.Park’s critics had been anticipating a reshuffle of Park’s top aides in the New Year, but she expressed reluctance to do so, sparking criticism within her own party.“It doesn’t matter if the scandal is true or not,” Saenuri Rep. Lee Jae-oh said Wednesday. “If the public wants the president to change her aides, then the president must deliver. If you go against public opinion, it’s going to get more difficult to push through key reforms and legislation.”Lee is a well-known Park opponent, and a confidant of ex-President Lee Myung-bak, Park’s former political rival.But pro-Park Saenuri Party lawmakers refuted their critics. “I also have something to say,” Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said only minutes after Rep. Lee Jae-oh had expressed his doubts about the president.“The public wants the government and us politicians to improve the economy. I think that the president has been genuinely trying to do just that.”If the Saenuri Party’s internal bickering escalates, political wrangling could impede legislation of bills aiming to restructure Korea’s economy, effectively paralyzing Park’s goals of reforming the public officials’ pension and easing employment regulations.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","recent political scandal ,resign after news photograph ,triggered recent political scandal ,recent political scandal involving ,to resign after news","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park Geun', 'Eum Jong - hwan', 'Kim ’s', 'Eum']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62197381  0.20651519

According to the document, Jeong plotted to oust Park's current chief of staff, Kim Ki-choon.Reports emerged Tuesday that K and Y are the initials of the ruling party chief and Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the same party, casting a pall on recent hopes that Park and her party could mend their strained ties.""The party and Cheong Wa Dae are one body,"" Kim Moo-sung said during his New Year's press conference at the National Assembly, referring to the presidential office. ""It's been reported that there is a rift between the party and Cheong Wa Dae, and it may appear so, but we have interacted until now without any problems.""However, I think there is a need for closer interaction,"" he added, saying he will try to hold regular meetings with the president to relieve any concerns the public may have on the matter.On the writing in the notepad, Kim said he had written down what someone had told him because it was so absurd.""I was looking for a different note inside the main Assembly hall when it was photographed,"" he said. ""It's actually quite ridiculous to be subject to such slander, but yesterday, it was also ridiculous to be accused on the news of intentionally doing so in order to be photographed.""Reports have pointed to a presidential official in charge of public relations as the person responsible for making the initial accusation.The official denied having made such remarks but offered his resignation to take responsibility for causing trouble, presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters.The presidential office will accept his resignation and remove him from office, Min said, adding that it is in the process of verifying the allegations.

Moon Hee-sang also criticized Park’s refusal to sack her chief of staff Kim Ki-choon, and a group of presidential aides alleged to have meddled in state affairs, during his New Year address at the National Assembly.“President Park said (in her New Year address) that debates over revising the Constitution would take public focus away from her efforts to boost our economy,” Moon said.“But now is also the ‘golden hour’ to fix our Constitution, a law that allows the president political powers that I fear resemble those of an emperor,” the five-term lawmaker said.Moon and senior NPAD lawmakers have called for constitutional amendments that would diminish the chief executive’s authority over domestic affairs, such as the right to nominate members of the Cabinet and the Constitutional Court, the nation’s highest judicial body.But Park had said during her New Year address on Monday that she was against discussing constitutional reforms. They would create unnecessary partisan wrangling between the NPAD and the governing Saenuri Party and block the enactment of key economic bills, she had said. Public support for constitutional reform was also lacking, Park added.Rep. Moon Hee-sang. (Yonhap)NPAD officials say, though, that the president wields unwarranted political advantages over governing party lawmakers, who often seek positions in the Cabinet to boost their political careers.Members of Park’s Saenuri Party have also expressed support for constitutional reform including Saenuri chair Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Rep. Lee Jae-oh, a five-term lawmaker close to former President Lee Myung-bak, Park’s former political rival. Moon also urged Park to sack members of the presidential staff linked to the so-called Chung Yoon-hoi scandal, named after Park’s chief of staff during her years at the parliament.“I am confident that a large portion of the public supports firing the aides accused of meddling in government affairs,” Moon said.Ten current and former Park aides have been accused of exerting political pressure on senior government officials to resign. Chung is accused of directing the group’s involvement by using his ties to current presidential staff.Park said she would retain her staff, though, as the scandal was based on “groundless rumors.”“How would anyone be able to work with me if I fired someone every time they were linked to uncorroborated rumors?” the president said during her New Year press conference.Public responses to Park’s comments have been mixed. A poll conducted by Realmeter hours after her address reported only 33 percent of respondents said they “agreed” with the remarks. Five-hundred adults were surveyed nationwide, and the poll has a 4.4 percent margin of error and a 95 percent confidence level.But rumors that Park could reshuffle members of her senior staff surfaced Tuesday when Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Min Kyung-wook announced Park was “closely monitoring responses” to her address.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","party leader on tuesday ,leader on tuesday vowed ,the constitution new politics ,group of presidential aides ,powers day after president","['Park Geun', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66844857  0.28729746

Moon said.He also called for greater efforts to improve ties with North Korea, saying the government should lift all sanctions the previous administration imposed on the North for torpedoing a South Korean warship in March 2010 and resume a joint tour program to the North's scenic Mount Kumgang.The opposition leader lashed out at Park for failing to mention safety issues, which have become a major public concern since April's deadly ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing.He also claimed that Park's economic policies based on deregulation, freeing up the labor market and prioritizing conglomerates will not help revive the slumping economy.

A bill sponsored by the ruling Saenuri Party and the Park Geun-hye administration will provide government support to develop the domestic cruise industry. It had been pending in the Assembly since July 2013.The bill will allow the central and local governments to lower related taxes, and legalize gambling on cruise ships weighing more than 20,000 tons.Legislators passed the Mariana Bay Infrastructure Vitalization Act, submitted to the National Assembly in 2012 by the government, which will lower real estate and investment taxes on bay development projects.The two bills were stalled due to protests by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which had charged that they would mostly benefit a few rich investors. The NPAD was especially suspicious of the cruise industry bill as it legalized large-scale casinos.Insiders said the main opposition, however, let the bills pass as the governing party had yielded to the opposition’s demands on other bills. One of those bills authorized damages payment by the government to families of victims killed in the Sewol ferry accident last April.The 6,800-ton Sewol’s sinking in the West Sea left more than 300 dead, most of them schoolchildren. Prosecutors blamed marine industry regulators for condoning safety violations in the months leading up to the disaster.Local media and government critics also charged the Coast Guard of having botched the rescue operations.The opposition parties had consistently demanded that the government pay damages to the victims for the faults. The governing party had been ambivalent about the suggested payments, as it appeared to link President Park, the government’s top executive, to the accident.But the bill passed Monday after the NPAD agreed to take out the word “compensation” from the bill in previous negotiations. Compensation legally implies that a specific entity holds responsibility for the reason for making payments to victims.Lawmakers also authorized a special parliamentary panel to investigate accusations that the Lee Myung-bak administration had misspent millions of won in public money, under the former president’s “resource diplomacy” policy.Lawmakers, though, failed to pass the so-called Kim Young-ran bill.The KYR bill, named after its initial proposer, the former chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, proposes to penalize all public officials who receive more than 1 million won ($920) or an equivalent amount in products or services from outside interest groups.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","legislature but lawmakers failed ,much touted draft bills ,public officials lawmakers voted ,wrangling had paralyzed lawmaking ,national assembly on monday",['the National Assembly'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78628552  0.46593931

The three-time lawmaker said he sympathizes with the group’s ideals to “pursue a reasonable progressive politics and to create a country based on peace, protection of environment and welfare.” Five former lawmakers plan to join the group, and former four-term NPAD lawmaker Chun Jung-bae is reportedly mulling whether to follow suit. Chung’s exit is likely to deal a heavy blow to the NPAD, which is slated to elect its new leader on Feb. 8. Moments after his defection, the party expressed regret over Chung’s decision. Former liberal presidential candidate Chung Dong-young walks out of the National Assembly press conference room Sunday after announcing that he would leave the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. (Yonhap)“It is very regretful that Chung, who had been our party’s presidential candidate, left us. I think people would have expected us to cooperate under the new leadership,” said Rep. Han Jeong-ae, a spokesperson for the NPAD.Park Jie-won, one of three candidates for the NPAD leadership, also said he was “deeply sorry” Chung had to leave. “His departure made me think the factional feud (within the party) may have been too much,” he said.Moon Jae-in, another candidate for the NPAD leadership, said Chung should have stayed to work out the issues rather than to leave the party. “If by any chance, our party was not as progressive as he (Chung) felt was necessary, he should have made efforts within the NPAD to lead us.”Shin Yul, a political professor at Myongji University, said Chung’s defection may have resulted from the fear that his political career may have no future within the NPAD. But he expressed doubts that many incumbent lawmakers would follow Chung’s footsteps to join the new party. “In most cases, the lawmakers (within the NPAD) likely to leave the party are ones opposing the pro-Roh faction. But most of them are either centralists or moderates who are unlikely to join forces with progressives,” said Shin.Other observers raised the possibility that prominent centralists, such as NPAD lawmakers concerned about the growing prominence of the pro-Roh faction ― namely Rep.

Kim Young-han, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs (Yonhap)Presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said the secretary refused to show up after calling the parliamentary request for his attendance a political offensive, and expressed his intention to resign. “Cheong Wa Dae will sternly hold him responsible, including recommending his dismissal, for defying both the agreement between ruling and opposition parties and the chief of staff’s directive,” Min told reporters.Earlier in the day, Chief of Staff Kim apologized over the scandal for the first time. “I will deeply self-reflect over the shameful incident,” he told the National Assembly’s steering committee. Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon (left) bows to lawmakers at the National Assembly’s House Steering Committee on Friday. Kim expressed “remorse” over a recent scandal linking up to 10 current and former presidential aides accused of exerting undue pressure on top government personnel decisions. (Yonhap)Kim, who has been under growing pressure from both ruling and opposition parties to resign, added that he would “not care much” about holding on to his current job.The chief secretary also promised to take stern measures against the civil affairs aide for disobedience. He said he would advise President Park to accept Kim Young-han’s resignation.The abrupt development is likely to reignite political bickering over the so-called Chung Yoonhoi scandal ahead of Park’s New Year’s press conference scheduled for Monday. Park is widely expected to apologize and call for an end to political fighting.The incident was brought to the public spotlight in November when a local daily reported the leaked presidential office paper that claimed Chung, Park’s chief secretary when she was a lawmaker, continued to exert his influence. Prosecutors on Tuesday concluded the rumors were false. A police officer who wrote the leaked papers is facing charges of publicizing government papers without authorization. An ex-presidential office aide is also accused of condoning the leak.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy claimed that the prosecution covered up the case, and accused the civil affairs secretary of interfering in the investigation.At Friday’s session, lawmakers planned to question the aides linked to the Chung scandal, but only two senior aides attended. NPAD lawmakers threatened a parliamentary boycott, demanding the aides show up.“If there is truly nothing to hide, I demand the aides attend today’s hearing,” NPAD Rep. Park Beomkye said.Minor opposition Justice Party Rep. Kim Je-nam also asked why the presidential office had refused her request for up to 23 documents related to the recent scandal.Lawmakers from President Park’s Saenuri Party defended Kim, saying that he could answer for all the other aides as the chief of staff.“Whether or not the senior civil affairs secretary attends is not important. The chief of staff is here,” Saenuri Rep. Kim Do-eup said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","parliament over recent scandal ,resign senior presidential aide ,resign friday in defiance ,to resign senior presidential ,offered to resign friday","['Kim Ki - choon', 'Kim Young - han', 'National Assembly']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68321687  0.1881229

Kim Jae-won of the ruling Saenuri Party told reporters.The junior secretary is suspected of intervening in the prosecution's probe into the allegations sparked by the leak of a presidential document in late November.The junior secretary's disobedience is widely expected to deal a heavy blow to the presidential office still reeling from the allegations that Park's former aide Jeong Yun-hoe and her younger brother Ji-man were engaged in a power struggle. On Monday, the prosecution concluded the allegations were unfounded.""I will accept his resignation offer and recommend (the President) to dismiss him to hold him responsible (for the disobedience),"" the presidential chief of staff told the session.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) called on the presidential office to fire him immediately instead of accepting his resignation.  During the session, Kim, the chief of staff, apologized for the leak and vowed to take action to tighten discipline among his officials.""(I) have deeply looked into myself due to this shameful incident,"" Kim told lawmakers. ""I feel sorry for causing concern among the people and lawmakers.""It was his first official apology over the scandal. President Park has not made any official comment since the prosecution announced the probe results Monday.""I've never clung to my post, and I am ready to quit whenever I complete my duty,"" Kim said. He has been under pressure to resign, particularly from the opposition, to account for the political turmoil.""Upon reading the document on Chung's alleged political meddling, I was sure that all the contents were false, and felt no necessity to take any action,"" he added, saying Chung has not been close to the president since 2004.The former aide Chung served as President Park's aide when she was a lawmaker but has never taken any official post in her administration. Park took office in February 2013.Vowing to tighten discipline among members of the presidential office to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, the chief of staff stressed that he and his officials would concentrate on carrying out their primary duty of assisting the president and supporting the handling of state affairs.The parties have been locking horns over the scandal. Casting doubt on the outcome of the prosecution's probe, the NPAD has demanded a separate parliamentary investigation into the scandal, which the ruling party has dismissed as a political ploy.

Lee In-young of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy will challenge the favorites Reps. Moon Jae-in and Park Jie-won in the in-house chair election on Feb. 8. But Lee may play the role of spoiler as votes from the two-term lawmaker’s main political support base could be split between himself and Moon, leading to a win by Park. Lee could also be the answer to the party’s infighting problems, analysts and Lee supporters said.NPAD in crisisThe main opposition party has been on the decline over the past two years amid continuous feuding among its main factions. Three leaders were pressured to resign during this period. The party’s public ratings have nosedived. The party also lost the July by-elections to the governing Saenuri Party, even losing a seat in the Jeolla region, an electoral stronghold that the left has rarely lost in major elections.Those vying to become the party’s new leader in the coming convention have vowed to end the intraparty fighting and turn the party around before the 2016 parliamentary elections and 2017 presidential election.But critics have charged that the Moon-versus-Park paradigm in the coming party convention will exacerbate friction within the NPAD, as the two figures are considered the senior leaders of the party’s two main factions.Moon leads the so-called pro-Roh Moo-hyun group, which is named after the late former president and consists of a relatively younger group of Roh-admiring lawmakers. Park leads the old-school faction that traces its roots to one of modern Korea’s liberal founding fathers, Kim Dae-jung.“Is the NPAD convention going to repeat the usual pro-Roh vs. non-Roh fight?” read a satirical editorial in the right-leaning Chosun Ilbo newspaper in Seoul on Thursday, in reference to Moon and Park.The answer?Lee won the third and last spot in the NPAD’s party chair elections in a primary held Wednesday. In his speeches, Lee underlined his determination to break from the NPAD’s traditional factionalism.“Reps. Moon and Park cannot unite our party. They are the representatives of the pro-Rohs and the non-Rohs,” Lee said during a campaign rally in Gwangju on Thursday. “I intend to make a stand and rally our party at this convention.”Lee argues he is best fit for the party’s chair as the NPAD is in need of a “generational change.”“If Lee runs, he’s likely to offer party voters a third option and break the Moon-versus-Park paradigm, even if he loses,” local daily Hankook Ilbo cited an unnamed “moderate NPAD lawmaker” as saying.Rep. Lee In-young. (Yonhap)But Lee’s candidacy poses challenges to Moon. Lee’s political support base comes mostly from the “86ers,” an NPAD group of former student activists born in the 1960s who spent their college days protesting against the military governments of the 1980s.If Lee choses to give up his candidacy before Feb. 8, the “86ers” are likely to offer their votes to Moon, a former student activist whom the 86ers can empathize with better than Park.As long as Lee runs, though, this support base is expected to be split between Lee and Moon, giving the upper hand to Park, the leader of the old-school liberal camp.“Moon and Lee could also split the votes from Seoul,” Hanshin University professor Yoon Pyung-joong said. Moon earned more votes than President Park Geun-hye in Seoul in the 2012 presidential elections. Lee represents an electorate in southwestern Seoul.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","opposition chairmanship election next ,race an underdog politician ,main opposition chairmanship election ,an underdog politician running ,underdog politician running in","['Lee In - young', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Jie - win', 'Lee']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.83711255  0.11251377

Moon Jae-in and Park Jie-won are strong contenders for the New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s chairmanship, to be determined through a vote by party officials on Feb. 8. The new leader will oversee the party in the 2016 general election and the 2017 presidential election. On Wednesday, Rep. Lee In-young filled the last spot on the slate for party chair through a primary.But experts say Moon and Park are too invested in their respective factions to resolve intraparty bickering, a reason behind the party’s falling public ratings and landslide defeat to President Park Geun-hye’s governing Saenuri Party in July’s by-elections. From left: Reps. Park Jie-won, Moon Jae-in and Lee In-young, candidates for the chairmanship of the NPAD, pose at the primary on Wednesday that decided the slate for the party convention on Feb. 8. (Yonhap)“Park (Jie-won) is one of the main people who has been using factionalism to his advantage. So don’t expect him to change the NPAD,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. “Moon is even more inclined toward factionalism (than Park),” Choi added.Koh One, a Korean politics professor at the Seoul National University of Science and Technology, likewise forecast darker skies for the main opposition party.“Expect the opposition’s factional feuds to intensify after the convention,” he wrote in a book on prospects for Korean politics in 2015. Koh also raised the possibility that a third party could overtake the NPAD, as the nation’s main opposition party has been mired in layers of trouble.The NPAD has suffered from falling approval ratings that sank below the 30 percent mark throughout 2014, according to Gallup Korea. Analysts say the low figure is likely due to the NPAD’s lack of policy initiatives and incoherence among its multiple factions.The in-house division was most recently reflected in rumors that Chung Dong-young, a senior NPAD official and liberal presidential candidate in 2007, would leave the NPAD to found a third party to compete with the main opposition.That party has still not materialized, but the coming NPAD convention is still likely to worsen factional rivalry.Moon and Park are the respective leaders of the party’s two main factions. Moon leads the pro-Roh Moo-hyun faction, named after the late liberal president, while Park leads the old-school liberal camp, a faction that traces its roots to former President Kim Dae-jung.But despite its troubles, the NPAD remains South Korea’s No. 2 political party by multiple standards. It holds 130 seats in the 295-seat National Assembly, behind only the Saenuri Party, which holds 158. It ranks second among the nation’s top parties in major polls, although its ratings barely breach the 20 percent mark, according to Gallup Korea and Realmeter, another local pollster.Analysts say the NPAD will have to get its act together before the 2017 presidential election if the left wing wishes to reclaim Cheong Wa Dae.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","two political heavyweights running ,political heavyweights running in ,opposition party chairmanship election ,political heavyweights running ,election early next month","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Jie - won', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy ’s']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.79081732  0.232802

Those that scored 85 or more received a “very satisfactory” rating, and those in the 80-84, 75-79 and 65-74 ranges were marked “satisfactory,” “average” and “unsatisfactory,” respectively.Those that scored below 65 were rated “very unsatisfactory.”Only three education offices ― in Daegu, North Chungcheong Province and Daejeon ― were in the “satisfactory” group while 10 ― including the ones in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province ― were labeled “unsatisfactory.” Three ― in Sejong City, Incheon and Gwangju ― were assessed to be “very unsatisfactory” and the remaining two were evaluated to be “average.”Among administrative organizations, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, Military Manpower Administration and Public Procurement Service and now-disbanded National Emergency Management Agency received top marks, with none landing in the bottom group.The report showed that on average, local education offices scored 71.1 out of 100 in 2014, up 2.2 points from the year before. The average score for other government bodies were 80.1, improving marginally by 1 point compared to 2013.“We expected that the recent sinking of the Sewol ferry would have negative repercussions on how citizens perceived government bodies. But the government officials’ effort to improve their services appear to have resulted in improved ratings,” an ACRC official said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","civilian complaints in 2014 ,poorly with petitions twelve ,wednesday the anti corruption ,2014 state run watchdog ,education offices deal poorly","['Korea', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17438477 -0.01788332

Moon Jae-in, Park Jie-won, and three others are in the race for the party chairmanship, while more are vying for seats on the party’s supreme council.But the focus is on who will become the party leader, as the new chair will have to tackle the party’s long-running problem: factional strife between the party’s powerful pro-Roh Moo-hyun group, which claims to have inherited the late liberal president’s legacy, and the rest. The simmering strife between the two factions has boiled over twice in 2014, causing the party to forfeit all legislative affairs both times and thereby paralyzing lawmaking activities at the National Assembly, which hurt their ratings in the polls.In 2014, the NPAD’s ratings never breached the 30 percent-mark in Gallup Korea surveys. December’s rating stood at 22 percent. Realmeter, another local pollster, measured the main opposition’s approval numbers at 22.7 percent in the same month.The strife has also led to the toppling of three chairs, as opposing factions pressured the leaders to resign after disappointing results in the July by-elections and prolonged negotiations with the governing Saenuri Party over the special Sewol bill.But the convention itself is a factional fight, as it pits Moon, the leader of the pro-Roh faction against Park, the leader of the opposing faction. Such a matchup could worsen internal strife or at best, distract attention from it, experts said.“Moon is taking up his role as a big brother for the pro-Rohs,” Chung-Ang University professor Choi Young-jin said. “He’s likely going to make the playing field for the pro-Rohs easier in the 2016 general election after he becomes party chair.”Moon has vowed to end factionalism for the party’s sake if he becomes chair. That promise will be all the more important for the South Korean left according to another expert.“2017 will be a good opportunity for the (NPAD) to defeat the conservative party in the presidential election,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a professor at Hanshin University.“The public is likely to be jaded with the two consecutive conservative administrations,” Yoon said, citing the recent scandals in the Park Geun-hye administration and the preceding Lee Myung-bak administration.The NPAD will have about 34 months from the convention until the next presidential election to raise its public standing.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","regroup at february convention ,the 2012 presidential election ,for democracy 2015 will ,main opposition new politics ,presidential election the npad","['New Politics Alliance for Democracy , 2015', 'NPAD']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56143647  0.43892258
