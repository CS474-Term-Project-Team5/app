1,1,1,Another NPAD lawmaker leaves,"Rep. Kim Dong-cheol announced Sunday he was leaving the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, bringing the number of defectors from the embattled opposition party to four in just a week.“The only way to accomplish new politics and administrative change at this point is through the new party to be created by Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo,” Kim, whose defection was widely predicted, said at a press conference.Rep. Kim Dong-cheol...","Rep. Kim Dong-cheol announced Sunday he was leaving the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, bringing the number of defectors from the embattled opposition party to four in just a week.“The only way to accomplish new politics and administrative change at this point is through the new party to be created by Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo,” Kim, whose defection was widely predicted, said at a press conference.Rep. Kim Dong-cheol YonhapKim’s defection marked the first time for a lawmaker representing the opposition’s political stronghold of Gwangju to bolt. He said he believed many more would follow suit.Last week, Reps. Moon Byung-ho, Yoo Sung-yop and Hwang Ju-hong defected from the NPAD to join Ahn, an entrepreneur-turned-politician who recently left the party over a power struggle with current leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.With Kim’s defection, only five out of eight lawmakers representing the NPAD’s political bastion of Gwangju remain within the party. Former NPAD members Reps. Chun Jung-bae and Park Joo-sun, both representing different districts of Gwangju, had left the party earlier in the year and are each planning to launch their own party.Of the remaining five, only Rep. Kang Ki-jung is considered a part of the Moon faction, which observers point to as a sign that more of them could decide to leave as they had been demanding Moon step down for a fresh leadership ahead of next year’s general election.“Many of the lawmakers representing (the Gwangju constituencies) are expected to make the decision (to leave),” Kim said without naming names.The internal dispute at the NPAD has been spilling over to reshape the bipartisan political landscape paralleled by the ruling Saenuri Party in recent weeks, culminating in the defection of Ahn on Dec. 13. While it had only been less than two years since Ahn joined forces with the main opposition bloc, he had recently been spearheading Moon’s internal critics that include the former Democratic Party’s old guards. With less than four months remaining to the April 13 parliamentary elections, the series of defections are feared to disperse the already weakened progressive support base against the solid conservatives.Law professor Cho Kuk of Seoul National University, who had served in the NPAD’s reform committee, said via his Facebook page on Saturday that all the dissenting forces should work on paving their own ways but should gather forces ahead of the elections.“(The opposition) should go their own way for the time being. … But it is hoped that they come to their cool-headed and rational senses ahead of April. I hope that they will align in the name of chaebol reform, economic democratization and citizens’ welfare,” he said as he touched on the sense of emergency felt among liberals.Moon, meanwhile, urged for those being left behind to remain undeterred. “Some of our family members have left our home (NPAD) saying they no longer like the way we are. But it is all the more reason for those remaining to gather forces and rebuild the house so that those who left will return,” Moon said while attending a welfare seminar at the National Assembly on Sunday.Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon, who also attended the event, emphasized consistent efforts to prevent further split. “I am extremely concerned about the party. … Division leads to absolute defeat,” he said. “I think we should conjure up all means possible by trying to embrace conservative-centrist forces to win the parliamentary elections.”Rep. Ahn, in the meantime, is planning to hold a press conference Monday and reveal the blueprint for creating his new party, his sources said.

The shelling killed four South Korean soldiers and civilians, and wounded 19 others.   The presidential order was not carried out, however, as military officials overrode the order with a United Nations Command rule that says a counterattack should be conducted with weapons of the same type and amount.   ""The military officials hesitated about the military action, citing a need to discuss it with the United States Forces Korea,"" the former aide said.  He said non-military Cabinet members were more eager for a proactive counterattack, while military officials were not prepared enough, stressing that the two dispatched fighters were not even loaded with air-to-surface missiles.   The former presidential secretary also wrote about a behind-the-scene story involving Lee's summit meeting with then U.S. President George Bush in 2008.  ""From now on, (the U.S.) will give intelligence to South Korea,"" the former presidential official said, quoting the U.S. president.   Until then, the U.S. withheld intelligence from South Korea because they believed U.S.-provided information was flowing to North Korea under the previous liberal administration of President Roh Moo-hyun, he said, stressing that the remarks are a clear sign that the South Korea-U.S. alliance is on the upturn.

The central government has also opposed the move.Park, who was elected with strong support from liberal supporters, is a member of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.""I propose creating an organization with the participation of the central government, the National Assembly, rival parties, youth organizations and local governments,"" Park told reporters. Under Park's proposal, some 3,000 people aged between 19 and 29 in the low-income bracket will benefit from the plan starting in the second half of 2016 on a trial basis. Nearly 50 billion won is estimated to be required to execute the plan between 2016 and 2020.

""He has brutally dealt with disobedient officials while displaying the image of a caring leader for ordinary North Koreans.""Since assuming power, Kim has executed around 100 party and military officials, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy.He ordered the execution of his once-powerful uncle Jang Song-thaek for treason two years ago. Former defense chief Hyon Yong-chol was killed with an anti-aircraft gun over his alleged disloyalty to Kim.The iron-fisted rule has helped the North's leader reshuffle old-time officials and set up his own legacy, but a growing number of officials are also disenchanted with his rule, seeking asylum in South Korea and other countries, experts said.""What strikes in the North's power structure is an emergence of new power elites in their 40s and 50s,"" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. ""A shift in generations will continue among party officials.""Analysts said that the planned congress of the ruling Worker's Party of Korea will be a watershed for gauging the direction of Kim's governing rule.The WPK plans to hold the congress for the first time in more than three decades in May where Kim is likely to conduct reshuffle and unveil a new line of state policies.Yang said Kim may loosen the severity of the reign of terror ahead of the key party event, but his pursuit of purges will continue as it is a common governing style in dictatorial socialist countries.Touching on external affairs, North Korea has seen its isolation deepen under Kim's regime due to the country's persistent pursuit of nuclear weapons program. The North has conducted nuke tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.Kim is seeking a dual pursuit of developing nuclear arsenals and boosting its fragile economy, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy. Seoul and Washington have warned that the North's dual-track policy a dead end for it.Also he has not held any summit with leaders from other countries including China, the North's traditional ally.Relations between North Korea and China have been sharply strained since the North's 2013 nuke test though some signs of improvement have emerged since October when a ranking Chinese official visited the North for a military parade.Meanwhile, South and North Korea reached a rare deal in August on defusing military tension following heightened tension sparked by a landmine blast near the inter-Korean border blamed on North Korea.The two sides are scheduled to hold a vice-ministerial meeting on Friday to discuss pending issues, but there is a big gap between the two over main agenda items for the talks.Seoul puts a priority on regularize reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War while Pyongyang calls for the early resumption of a suspended joint tour program at Mount Kumgang in the North.""Whether to resume the tour program is not a simple issue as it is linked to the North's nuclear problem as U.N. Security Council sanctions on the North bans transfer of bulk cash to Pyongyang,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a researcher at the Seoul National University Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.He also said that the North is facing very serious isolation as it is under relevant U.N. sanctions banning the North's nuke and missile tests.""North Korea is expected to focus on handling external relations for the time being ahead of the party congress,"" he said.

The negotiators are set to produce a deal that is to be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below2 degrees Celsius.   In Prague, Park met with the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia in the inaugural summit between South Korea and the so-called Visegrad Group.   Park also held separate talks with all four leaders in Prague, which were dominated by Park's sales pitch for South Korea's nuclear reactors and her push to make inroads into infrastructure markets.   South Korea said the Visegrad Group countries are pursuing major infrastructure projects expected to be worth over 50 trillion won ($43 billion).   South Korea also hopes that the experience of the Visegrad Group in embracing democracy and market economy could be a lesson for South Korea at a time when it is pursuing a peaceful unification with North Korea.   ""There are many areas in which to cooperate with these countries to help North Korea embrace change,"" Park told South Korean residents, noting the Visegrad Group had the experience of transforming into a democracy and a market economy following the collapse of the Soviet Union.   She has called reunification a ""bonanza"" for South Korea as well as a blessing for surrounding countries.   Still, North Korea has long suspected that Seoul could be plotting to absorb Pyongyang, a claim denied by South Korea.

Marine Corps servicemen also staged a group dance performance in commemoration.    The prime minister pledged that ""the government and the military will foster powerful defense capabilities as to be able to protect the safety and peace of our nationals in any case.""    ""Taking the North Korean provocation as a searing lesson, we should open up a new era of genuine peace,"" the prime minister said, also vowing government efforts for the reunification of the divided countries.     Later in the day, South Korea conducted a live-fire drill in the waters off Yeonpyeong and its adjacent border islands, brushing aside North Korea's warning of retaliation a day earlier.   About 300 artillery shells were fired in the 40-minute artillery drill, which started at 4:00 p.m., by the Marine Corps unit stationed in the border islands.    The fire exercise came despite North Korea's warning a day earlier that it will retaliate ""mercilessly"" if the South fires artillery into North Korean waters.    ""All the shells fired in the latest maritime artillery drill landed in South Korean waters,"" a military official said.   North Korea has not shown any abnormal military activity so far.   The South Korean military had originally planned a larger-sized drill, but downsized it, citing unfavorable weather conditions.   ""Cloudy weather and a heavy sea fog made it difficult to assess the exact performance of the drill. So the types of weapons deployed were downsized,"" the official said.   Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said in a separate press briefing that the drill is part of regular military exercises and that if North Korea launches any provocations, Seoul will hit back immediately.

The two had shared ups and downs in their relationship as Kim had resisted militant leaders including Park’s father, the late former President Park Chung-hee.The visit lasted eight minutes and came a few hours after she returned from a 10-day trip to three nations for a series of regional forums.As soon as she arrived at the funeral hall set up at Seoul National University, Park burned incense and laid a chrysanthemum before the portrait of the former president who dedicated his life to the nation’s democratization and opposed the military dictators for decades. Kim Hyun-chul, the second son of late former President Kim Young-sam, greets President Park Geun-hye at the funeral hall of Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul on Monday.  (Yonhap)Park offered a word of comfort to Kim’s second son Hyun-chul and also held hands with former first lady Son Myung-soon, her spokesman Jeong Yeon-guk said in a written statement without providing details of the conversation she had with Kim’s family. She was accompanied by her Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee and senior political secretary Hyun Ki-hwan.“My heart goes out to the bereaved family members, and I pray for the soul of the deceased,” Park had said in Kuala Lumpur upon learning of Kim’s death. The government has decided to hold a state funeral for Kim, including a ceremony at the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon. Park is expected to attend Kim’s funeral, along with other political leaders.Park’s brief visit to Kim’s funeral hall reflected the uncomfortable relationship the two had for years.Kim was an opposition politician who vehemently objected to the constitutional revision that allowed Park Chung-hee to serve for three consecutive terms. Kim was expelled from the parliament for his antigovernment activities.Kim, even after his presidency, continued his opposition against the senior Park.In 1999, while visiting the April 19 National Cemetery that honors protesters against the former late President Syngman Rhee’s dictatorship in the early ’60s, Kim said that attempts to glorify the legacy of the militant ruler Park Chung-hee should be scrapped. Park, then vice chairwoman of the Grand National Party, predecessor of the ruling Saenuri Party, rebuked Kim’s remark, saying that an antisocial person who only believes in himself should never be a political leader again. Their twisted relationship peaked in 2012 when Kim’s son Hyun-chul sought the party’s nomination to run for a parliamentary seat, the same year Park was nominated as Saenuri’s presidential candidate. As Hyun-chul was eliminated from the nomination, the enraged ex-president blasted Park that she was making “merciless political revenge” that was passed down from her father.Kim continued to inveigh Park, telling former Gyeonggi Province Gov. Kim Moon-soo that she was not suited for presidency, calling her “chilpunii (retard).” But Kim later endorsed her just before the presidential election through Kim Moo-sung who then led Park’s campaign team. After winning the election, Park expressed her gratitude to Kim by paying a visit that quickly eased their strained relationship but the two never fully reconciled before his death.Meanwhile, more than 3,200 mourners paid a visit to Seoul National University Hospital to pay respect for the deceased who is praised for having laid the foundation for a peaceful power transfer from militant rulers. The mortuary was filled with hundreds of political bigwigs, incumbent and retired senior government officials and business representatives, remembering him as a leader who risked his life and political career against militant regimes’ constant threats.Many incumbent and former politicians and government officials, including Lee Hoi-chang who served as prime minster under the Kim administration, mourned Kim’s death. Former prime ministers ― Chung Un-chan, Kim Hwang-sik and Chung Hong-won ― all paid their respects at the president’s memorial hall, as well as Lee Hee-ho, widow of former President Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam’s successor and political rival. Mark Lippert, the top U.S. envoy in Seoul, also paid a visit. Calling himself a political heir to Kim, Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung stayed at the funeral home for two days to greet mourners. The ruling party leader in his early years in the politics supported the late president when he established his own party in 1987 to run for a presidency. When Kim ascended to power, Kim Moo-sung served as presidential secretary for civil affairs and vice home minister.Municipalities across the country have opened memorial altars on Monday for citizens for condolences, including Seoul city government that set up a makeshift altar at Seoul Square for three days.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","enraged ex president blasted park ,attend kim funeral along with ,hospital in seoul on monday ,widow of former president kim ,national cemetery that honors protesters","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Kim', 'Park ’s', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Seoul National University', 'Kim Hyun - chul', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Seoul', 'Son Myung - soon', 'Jeong Yeon - guk', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Park ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Syngman Rhee ’s', 'Kim', 'Park Chung - hee', 'the Grand National Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim ’s', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Hyun - chul', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kim Moon -', 'Kim', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Lee Hoi - chang', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Chung Un - chan', 'Kim Hwang - sik', 'Chung Hong - win', 'Lee Hee - ho', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Mark Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Seoul', 'Cho Chung - un']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54784161  0.48702839

Some from the opposition party underscored Kim’s legacy during the Korea’s democratization and urged the Park Geun-hye administration to uphold his values. Conservative politicians such as former President Lee Myung-bak and former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil described Kim as “the last figure who protected South Korea’s democracy” and “a political leader with a strong conviction,” respectively. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in highlighted the political message of Kim’s life, saying, “It is extremely shameful that Kim, who led the nation’s democratic movement, leaves us when the fate of the nation’s democracy is now on the line.”   Cabinet members of the Park Geun-hye administration pay tribute to late President Kim Young-sam at a funeral hall set up at the Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul, Sunday. YonhapHis death came at a time when a debate is intensifying over the future of Korea’s democracy under the current Park Geun-hye government, which faces mounting criticism at home and abroad for what critics consider to be “antidemocratic” moves, such as its attempt to adopt state-authored textbooks and block rallies. Kim’s democratic feats were not always as praised by the opposition. Particularly the NPAD lawmakers loyal to Kim’s rival late President Kim Dae-jung had criticized him for merging with a party led by Roh Tae-woo, a general turned president, during the 1992 presidential campaign. Roh had been supported by his predecessor Chun Doo-hwan, who rose to the power with military coup in 1980. Nevertheless, upon his death, the NPAD joined in praising Kim as an opposition politician who contributed to expel the relics of authoritarian regime. Kim had disbanded a military organization attempting to wield political power by seizing control of the newly aligned ruling party. Hundreds of people joined the mourning, recalling how Kim’s life epitomized the rocky development of Korea’s modern history.“Despite his political mistakes, Kim was truly a driving force behind the Korea’s democratic movement. What he had done is all the more meaningful compared to what the Park Geun-hye is doing in terms of democratic value,” said Kim Myeong-sook, 45, a woman from Kim’s hometown of Geojedo Island, South Gyeongsang Province. The NPAD, meanwhile, plans to reevaluate Kim’s contribution to the opposition’s democratic movement and list him as one of the “key figures” in the party’s democratization movement. NPAD Rep. Chun Byung-hun said in a media interview that Kim was a proud legacy of the opposition parties and a historic figure who its lawmakers should respect. Other minor opposition parties agreed. “Late President Kim had criticized and found it regretful that democratization that was realized with him and his former colleague late President Kim Dae-jung through their sacrifice and determination were losing its light due to the Park Geun-hye administration’s self-righteousness,” said People’s Justice Party led by Rep. Chun Jung-bae.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","opposition parties agreed late president ,in seoul sunday yonhaphis death ,death on sunday prompted heavyweights ,and bigwigs to rookies politicians ,rival late president kim dae","['Kim Young - sam', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim ’s', 'Korea', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Kim', 'South Korea ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Cabinet', 'Kim Young - sam', 'the Seoul National University Hospital', 'Seoul', 'yonhaphis', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'NPAD', 'Kim', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Roh Tae - woo', 'Roh', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'NPAD', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Kim Myeong - sook', 'Kim', 'Geojedo Island', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Kim', 'Chun Byung - hun', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'People ’s Justice Party', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80959564  0.73987263

YonhapJoining the National Assembly in 1954 at age 26, Kim had led an arduous movement against military-backed leaders including former Presidents Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan, which led to incarcerations, house arrest and even threats of terror attacks.With late former President Kim Dae-jung, Kim had maintained a unique relationship ― a mixture of cooperation in their democracy movements and rivalry amid their bids for Cheong Wa Dae. The former died in 2009.During his democracy movement, he went through a series of tribulations that even threatened his life.Kim Young-sam (left) attends a news conference with then-President Roh Tae-woo (center) and leader of another opposition party Kim Jong-pil for their merger in January 1990. The merger of his Reunification Democratic Party, Roh’s ruling Democratic Justice Party and Kim Jong-pil’s New Democratic Republican Party later gave him the platform to win the 1992 presidential election. YonhapIn 1969, when he vehemently objected to the constitutional revision to allow then President Park Chung-hee to serve for three consecutive terms, three assailants threw a bottle of acetic acid toward Kim’s car. Kim walked unscathed.In the 1970s, his resistance against the military dictatorship peaked. He directly challenged the so-called Yushin Constitution, which the Park government enacted to prolong his term. His resistance resulted in him being ousted from the parliament. Kim Young-sam is being forced out of the building of the New Democratic Party in August 1979, after he allowed around 180 female workers at the Y.H. Trading Company to use the headquarters for their demonstration against their company’s shutdown by the company owner and then-government. Police raided the office injuring tens of workers and lawmakers. One worker died in the process. The incident, followed up by a court order to suspend Kim’s party chairmanship, later led to mass rallies in Busan and Masan and later the assassination of then-President Park Chung-hee. YonhapAs the new military-backed government was launched following the assassination of former President Park in 1979, an undeterred Kim stepped up his fight against then general-turned leader Chun. In 1983, he staged a hunger protest for 23 days to mark the third anniversary of the May 18 pro-democracy movement. The protest added to the momentum for a national campaign to challenge the Chun government.The massive pro-democracy movement in June 1987 weakened the military-backed government and helped achieve a constitutional revision to enable a direct presidential election system.Kim Young-sam (right) and Kim Dae-jung look away from each other at an event in October 1987. The two had discussed joining candidacy to go up against ex-general Roh Tae-woo in the December presidential election the same year, but failed in the coalition. The Kims ran separately and Roh was elected the 13th president. YonhapHowever, Kim’s failure to unify the opposition candidacy with Kim Dae-jung during the 1987 presidential election led to another term by the general-turned-president, Roh Tae-woo.“Had the candidacy been unified at the time, there would have been an early end to the military-backed government,” said Lee Jang-hee, politics professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “The division in the opposition forces also led to a deepening of regionalism.”In 1990, Kim’s decision to join forces with his political foes ― then-President Roh Tae-woo and leader of another opposition party Kim Jong-pil ― vitiated his past democratic struggle, drawing intense criticism from opposition politicians for caving in for the sake of power. Critics derided him as a “betrayer,” but the merger among his Reunification Democratic Party, Roh’s ruling Democratic Justice Party and Kim Jong-pil’s New Democratic Republican Party helped him win the 1992 presidential election. The aligned party became the precursor to the incumbent conservative Saenuri Party.One of the most prominent legacies from his presidency is his purge of politically minded generals who had deeply engaged in the policymaking. “With his determination, he purged the politicized generals, a task that laid the foundation of the country’s institutional democracy,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, political philosophy professor at Hanshin University.“With the purge, Korean military leaders have become depoliticized. It was possible because of his determination, without which it must have been difficult given the amount of influence generals had wielded at the time.”Kim is also known for his sweeping reform in the financial and real-estate transactions. His government introduced the “real-name” financial transaction system, which made it difficult for politicians and businessmen to engage in suspicious transactions under false names.Kim Young-sam lies in bed as he carries out a hunger strike that lasted 23 days against the dictatorship of former President Chun Doo-hwan in May, 1983. He was put on house arrest, expelled from the National Assembly and banned from politics at the time for his democratic activities. Yonhap“The need and urgency for real-name transactions had been mentioned several times before. But his predecessors did not push for it,” professor Yun noted. “The real-name policy, which is now the basic principle for financial dealings, has increased transparency and reduced the risks of corruptive practices.”The former leader is also remembered for his straightforwardness in his diplomacy toward Japan, exemplified by his now-famous quote, “We will teach them to have manners once and for all,” regarding Japanese politicians defending Japan’s wartime atrocities. He continued to press Japan to atone for colonial-era wrongdoings including Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.During his term, Japan issued two government statements apologizing for its past misdeeds including the sexual slavery issue.Such achievements, however, have been eclipsed by corruption scandals involving his son Hyun-chul. The scandals were a disgrace for Kim, who had vowed to deal sternly with any cases involving the presidential family.Kim Hyun-chul was called a “little president” as he peddled influence in various state affairs including ones involving major conglomerates including Hanbo Group. He was given a two-year jail term for receiving kickbacks from businesspeople and evading taxes in 1997.Kim is also criticized for his poor handling of the economic crisis, which forced the country to seek an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund.A series of deadly accidents also called into question his competence for crisis management. In 1994, a bridge over the Hangang River collapsed, killing 32 people. A year later, a department store in Seoul collapsed, killing 501 citizens.

It is composed of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus its eight dialogue partners -- South Korea, China, Japan, the United States, Russia, Australia, India and New Zealand.  South Korea, China, Japan, the U.S. and Russia have been involved in the long-stalled negotiations to coax North Korea into abandoning its nuclear program.  On Saturday, Park called for regional support to ensure North Korea ""makes a strategic decision to abandon its nuclear weapons programs and choose the path of change.""  She said the North's nuclear issue must be resolved as economic development and growth cannot be achieved without regional peace and stability. She made the comment in the summit with the leaders of ASEAN, China and Japan -- dubbed the ASEAN+3 summit -- in Malaysia.   Still, North Korea has repeatedly vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, despite repeated warnings from Seoul and Washington that the policy is a dead end for the country.  Park's possible encounter with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Kuala Lumpur is also likely to be closely watched among officials and analysts in the region as there is lingering speculation that he might visit North Korea.  On Friday, South and North Korea agreed to hold a working-level meeting to prepare for high-level talks next week.  The move is part of efforts by the two Koreas to implement the August deal that defused military tensions sparked by a land mine attack blamed on North Korea.  The summit is taking place while territorial disputes in the South China Sea, one of the key shipping routes for South Korea and other regional countries, continue to heighten.  China has been pushing for land reclamation projects in the South China Sea, creating tension with the U.S. and some Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines.   Days before the summit, Park and other world leaders held other high-profile summits, where they condemned the recent deadly terrorist attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 people. Kuala Lumpur is the third and last stop on her 10-day tour, which already has taken her to Turkey for the G-20 summit and the Philippines for the APEC summit.  Park is set to leave for home later in the day.

(Yonhap)Former South Korean President Kim Young-sam, the country’s icon of democracy who ushered in an era of civilian leadership to end more than three decades of military rule, passed away early Sunday. He was 87.Kim, who led the nation from 1993-1998, died of sepsis and acute renal failure at around 12:22 a.m., according to Oh Byung-hee, the head of Seoul National University Hospital where he was hospitalized last Thursday for high fever and breathing difficulties. Along with former President Kim Dae-jung, who died in 2009, he is noted for his grueling campaign against authoritative general-turned-leaders such as former presidents Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan of the 1970s and ‘80s.Toward the end of his term, his political feats were overshadowed by his son’s influence-peddling and his government’s poor handling of the economy that forced the nation to accept a bailout program of the International Monetary Fund.“He has already undergone surgeries several times before, due to blockages in the cardiovascular system. Adding to that was sepsis and acute distress, which led to a weakening of his heart and then his death,” Oh told a press conference as he confirmed Kim’s death.“A stroke is an illness caused by a blockage in the blood vessel. We believe Kim died due to the worsening of his chronic illnesses.”After he was hospitalized for a stroke and pneumonia for 18 months to October 2014, concerns persisted over the health of the former leader, who was credited with leading a peaceful transition of power from military-backed authorities, purging politically minded generals and enhancing transparency in financial transactions.His family, including his second son, Kim Hyun-chul, a professor at Kookmin University, stood by his deathbed. His wife Son Myung-soon was not present in his last moments. Kim Hyun-chul said he informed her of Kim’s passing several hours later to lessen the blow.The Seoul government at a Cabinet meeting decided to hold a five-day state funeral for the late leader. According to law, a state funeral committee headed by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is to be organized. The funeral ceremony is to be held Thursday at the National Assembly. Kim is to be buried at Seoul National Cemetery in central Seoul.Kim, along with Kim Dae-jung and political heavyweight Kim Jong-pil, led the “Three Kims” politics in the 1980s and ‘90s. His pro-democracy campaign put him behind bars and under house arrest, but helped undermine military-backed leaderships, reform the Constitution to enable a direct presidential election system and facilitate democratization.The “Three Kims” politics faded officially into the past in 2004 when Kim Jong-pil failed to garner a parliamentary seat for his 10th term and retired from politics. Born in December 1927 on the southern island of Geojedo, Kim was elected to the National Assembly at age 27, which still marks the youngest elected as an assemblyman, in 1954. He served as a lawmaker for a total of nine terms.President Park Geun-hye, who was in Malaysia for summit meetings involving the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other nations, expressed her condolences. “After being informed of the death of former President Kim, I expressed my deep condolences and pray for the repose of the deceased,” Park was quoted as saying by Cheong Wae Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk.“Our government will prepare, with honor, for his funeral in accordance with the related laws and the wishes of his family.”The leaders of political parties visited the memorial altar to pay respect to the late leader.Kim Moo-sung, leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, called the deceased leader his “political father.” He entered politics in the 1980s with the help of the former president.“Kim was a political leader who achieved our society’s actual democratization,” said Kim, tears forming in his eyes.Moon Jae-in, the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said the nation should uphold the former leader’s spirit and philosophy for democracy.“I feel very regretful that Kim, who enabled democracy to take root in this country and led the pro-democracy movement, passed away when our democracy is now facing a crisis again,” Moon told reporters. Moon hails from Kim’s hometown of Geojedo Island and graduated from the same middle and high schools Kim attended. In 1990, Moon also joined a pro-democracy campaign then led by the late activist leader.Kim Jong-pil also appeared at the memorial altar, saying the former president will be remembered forever in the minds of citizens as a “leader of determination.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","deathbed his wife son myung ,death of former president kim ,former presidents park chung hee ,late former president kim young ,hospitalized last thursday for high","[""Kim Young - sam 's"", 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Kim Young - sam', 'oh Byung - hee', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'Kim ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim Hyun - chul', 'Kookmin University', 'Son Myung - soon', 'Kim Hyun - chul', 'Seoul', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'Geojedo', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Malaysia', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'Kim', 'Cheong Wae Dae', 'Jeong Yeon - guk', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Moon', 'Kim Jong - pil', 'song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.11194049  0.45069727

While Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan on Thursday rebuked the move as “welfare populism” and pledged to block the policy, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon vowed to push ahead with the scheme under the support of main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.“Some local governments are trying to implement new welfare policies that I believe are welfare populism. (The government) will exert its authority to prevent those localities from indiscriminately rolling out financial aid to the people,” said Choi during the meeting with Cabinet members who deal with economic policies. Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon(right) and NPAD Chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. YonhapPark and Moon, two main opposition political heavyweights, disputed the criticism, as they joined hands in working on overhauling the NPAD to win next year’s general election. They asserted that the localities are in a better position to provide tailored solutions to the worsening youth unemployment. Pointing to the government’s repeated objection to the independent moves of local governments to implement their own welfare policies, the two NPAD presidential hopefuls urged the government to share its authority with localities. “Since it has taken more than a year to come up with this policy, it is well tailored for the target group. I think the central government’s policy tends to be more standardized. (The central government) should grant more autonomy to local governments,” said Park in a meeting with young people at Seoul city hall.  The escalating feud came after Seoul City announced on Nov. 5 that it would offer 500,000 won ($430) a month to unemployed young people aged between 19 and 29 who are in the low income bracket. Seoul said it would implement the policy next year. As a part of the city’s five-year youth support plan, the city of Seoul will select 3,000 unemployed young people the city deems to be eligible for the subsidy for up to six months. The young applicants are required to submit their job hunting plans.The policy was thrown into the political limelight as the government raised its opposition. The Ministry of Health and Welfare asserted that the city violated relevant laws because it pushed to implement an “independent” welfare policy without coordination with the central government. According to the Framework Act on Social Security, local governments must consult with the Welfare Minister in creating their own welfare system. In September, the city Seongnam and the Sungdong-gu district of Seoul had pursued similar policies for youth, but the plans had been thwarted by the central government. Seoul City has refuted, saying the policy in question is not subject to consultation with the central government because it was not a welfare policy, but rather a program to boost youth employment.  Seoul also said their plans are different from previous ones as they would undertake a selection process to determine eligible beneficiaries, not indiscriminately roll out financial aid to those in need as Seongnam had intended. If Seoul agrees to consult with the central government, they would have 90 days to discuss the plans. If the municipality refuses, the government has no legal options to block it. The government can instead cut financial assistance for the city.Welfare experts expressed their regret over the politicization of youth employment, saying the welfare issues have often turned into ideological battles between liberals and conservatives, overshadowing those in need. “In Korea, conservative and liberals often clash over whether welfare policies should be universal or specifically for a certain group of people,” said Chung Ick-joong, a social welfare professor at Ewha Womans University Graduate School of Social Welfare.“Admittedly, one policy could be more important than the other depending on the situation. But usually we need both. It is a shame we often tend to use partisan ideology to attack a specific policy, without contemplating what is in the interest of the nation’s welfare policy as a whole,” said Chung. The financial assistance program for the young unemployed people is not uncommon in some European nations. France offers cash benefits to young unemployed aged 18 to 26 who promise to take a one-year course for job hunting. Germany operates a similar program for helping young people pay for living expenses.  By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","block the policy seoul mayor ,seoul will select 000 unemployed ,on thursday rebuked the move ,economic policies seoul city mayor ,worsening youth unemployment pointing to","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Choi', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul City', 'Park Won - soon(right', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'YonhapPark', 'Moon', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Social Security', 'Sungdong', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul', 'Seongnam', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Chung Ick - joong', 'Ewha Womans University Graduate School of Social Welfare', 'Chung', 'european', 'France', 'Germany', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66852981  0.33578706

It came just two weeks before Park, Trudeau and leaders around the world are to meet in Paris to try to produce a new legally binding deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are to blame for global warming.The deal is set to be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.Park said the countries should faithfully implement their contributions submitted to the U.N.'s climate change body and stressed the importance of a voluntary participation by developing countries.In June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it lets business run as usual.Park said responses to climate should be as viewed as ""an opportunity to secure a new growth engine, not a burden.""Trudeau proposed that Seoul and Ottawa actively cooperate in their responses to climate change.The two leaders also agreed to expand cooperation in science and technology in their first meeting since Trudeau took office earlier this month.South Korea and Canada have recently initialed a deal that call for cooperation, among other things, on joint research projects, personnel exchanges and startups.The sides are pushing to sign the deal in the first half of next year.Park also said effects of a free trade deal between South Korea and Canada could be felt among the people of the two countries. Trudeau described the free trade deal that went into effect earlier this year as a ""great one, but we need to work on building better business ties and moving forward with our friendship and partnership.""Park also held a separate summit with Philippine President Benigno Aquino III and they agreed to expand economic cooperation and health care.Demand for telemedicine remain high in an archipelago nation of more than 7,000 islands where many people live in medically underserved areas.Benigno Aquino III told Park that he expects active participation in massive infrastructure projects by South Korean companies. The Philippines is pushing for a number of infrastructure projects worth more than US$19.4 billion.Benigno Aquino III also told Park that he is considering measures to ensure the security of South Koreans across the country following the recent killing of a South Korean couple by an unidentified gunman near Manila.Crimes against South Koreans in the Philippines have been on a steady rise in recent years. Nine Koreans have been murdered there this year alone. The back-to-back summits come hours before Aquino held a welcoming ceremony for Park and other leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.The APEC summit brings together leaders of the 21 member states, including the United States, China, Japan and Australia, which together account for nearly 60 percent of global gross domestic product and almost half of world trade.This year, the summit is meant to discuss how to build inclusive growth and sustainable and resilient communities, but it is being overshadowed by the recent deadly terror attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 people.Terrorism was also high on the agenda at the G-20 summit, the world's premier forum designed to tackle economic issues.At the summit in Turkey earlier this week, Park, U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders condemned the attacks in Paris as they pledged to fight terrorism.Also on Wednesday, Park called on APEC members to nurture the service industry to create jobs and economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region in a session of the APEC Business Advisory Council. The service industry accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product in the region.Separately, Park declared her commitment to expanding cooperation in a wide-range of sectors with leaders of the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trade bloc composed of four countries bordering the Pacific Ocean -- Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.Park later had a pull-aside meeting with her Peruvian counterpart, Ollanta Humala, and they agreed to make joint efforts to help produce a climate deal in Paris.Humala said he expects South Korean companies to participate in infrastructure projects in Peru, Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office said, without elaborating.The two leaders met in April in Peru during Park's swing to South America.

It came just two weeks before Park, Trudeau and leaders around the world are to meet in Paris to try to produce a new legally binding deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are to blame for global warming.The deal is set to be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.Park said the countries should faithfully implement their contributions submitted to the U.N.'s climate change body and stressed the importance of a voluntary participation by developing countries.In June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it lets business run as usual.Park said responses to climate should be as viewed as ""an opportunity to secure a new growth engine, not a burden.""Trudeau proposed that Seoul and Ottawa actively cooperate in their responses to climate change.The two leaders also agreed to expand cooperation in science and technology in their first meeting since Trudeau took office earlier this month.South Korea and Canada have recently initialed a deal that call for cooperation, among other things, on joint research projects, personnel exchanges and startups.The sides are pushing to sign the deal in the first half of next year.Park also said effects of a free trade deal between South Korea and Canada could be felt among the people of the two countries.  Trudeau described the free trade deal that went into effect earlier this year as a ""great one, but we need to work on building better business ties and moving forward with our friendship and partnership.""Park also held a separate summit with Philippine President Benigno Aquino III and they agreed to expand economic cooperation. Benigno Aquino III also told Park that he is considering measures to ensure the security of South Koreans across the country following the recent killing of a South Korean couple by an unidentified gunman near Manila.Crimes against South Koreans in the Philippines have been on a steady rise in recent years. Nine Koreans have been murdered there this year alone. The back-to-back summits come hours before Aquino held a welcoming ceremony for Park and other leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.The APEC summit brings together leaders of the 21 member states, including the United States, China, Japan and Australia, which together account for nearly 60 percent of global gross domestic product and almost half of world trade. This year, the summit is meant to discuss how to build inclusive growth and sustainable and resilient communities, but it is being overshadowed by the recent deadly terror attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 people. Terrorism was also high on the agenda at the G-20 summit, the world's premier forum designed to tackle economic issues. At the summit in Turkey earlier this week, Park, U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders condemned the attacks in Paris as they pledged to fight terrorism.Also on Wednesday, Park attended a session of the APEC Business Advisory Council and held an unofficial dialogue with the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trade bloc composed of four countries bordering the Pacific Ocean -- Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s visit to Pyongyang resurfaced Monday following a news report of a trip, possibly this week, to help set the stage for addressing a set of North Korea issues including its nuclear program. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attends the G-20 summit in Turkey on Sunday, local time. (Yonhap)Yonhap news agency reported that the South Korean secretary-general would visit the North’s capital city after his plan to travel to the North fell through in May due to the communist regime’s rejection. In response, the U.N. spokesperson’s office said it had “no comment.”Should he go to Pyongyang, it would be the first visit by an incumbent U.N. leader in 22 years. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who headed the U.N. from 1992-96, visited Pyongyang in 1993, while Kurt Waldheim, who led the U.N. from 1972-81, visited the North in 1979.The U.N. spokesperson’s office refused to comment on the report.“The secretary-general has always said that he is ready to play any role in order to help enhance dialogue, stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula,” it said in an email sent to the media. “As for any future plans by the secretary-general to travel to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), we have no further comment at this time.”Cheong Wa Dae said it has no knowledge of Ban’s plan to visit the North.“We have never heard of it. There is nothing for us to say at this point,” a senior Cheong Wa Dae official told media.Some observers remained skeptical about Ban’s reported plan to travel to Pyongyang. They noted that it is not good timing given that the world is in mourning over the victims of last week’s terrorist attacks in France, and that Ban has a set of pending issues including a global climate change gathering to begin late this month in Paris.Ban planned to visit the inter-Korean industrial complex in the North’s border city of Gaeseong in May. But Pyongyang abruptly canceled his visit without elaborating on the reasons for the rejection. Observers say Ban’s remarks against Pyongyang’s potential launch of a rocket might have angered the North.Ban’s reported plan to visit emerged as there has not been any significant progress in Seoul’s efforts to improve cross-border ties despite growing bilateral civilian exchanges. In line with the Aug. 25 deal to defuse military tensions and enhance bilateral relations, Seoul has proposed government talks with Pyongyang three times since late September. But Pyongyang has spurned the proposals, arguing that they were insincere due to South Korean civic groups’ continued distribution of anti-Pyongyang leaflets and Seoul’s criticism of Pyongyang’s potential provocations including a possible rocket launch and other issues.Analysts said that if Pyongyang has accepted Ban’s visit, it might want to use the U.N. to ease international pressure over its woeful human rights record, and nuclear and missile programs.“As the U.N. is at the forefront of applying international sanctions against the North, Pyongyang may want to utilize Ban to help ease pressure against it vis-a-vis its nuclear program, human rights issues and others,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification.He added that the North could also raise the issue of a peace treaty with the U.S., an issue that observers say the North seeks to utilize to divert international attention to the issue of its denuclearization.“Given the role of the U.S. to promote world peace and stability, Pyongyang might try to raise the issue of a peace treaty to replace the current armistice agreement,” Chang said.

In a written interview with eight news wire services from around the world, she also said she is open to holding one-on-one talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as long as he abandons his nuclear ambitions and makes progress in cross-border ties.  President Park Geun-hye (center) speaks during a face-to-face meeting with members of the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies held on the sidelines of their written interview. (Yonhap)Citing the rapid aging of the so-called comfort women and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s own touching on women’s rights in armed conflict at the U.N., Park warned that Tokyo will face a “heavy historic burden” should it keeps “dragging on without acknowledging the problem” and maintains an impenitent attitude towards its colonial brutalities. “In consideration of the urgency of the issue, I expect the Japanese government to quickly present a solution that is acceptable to the victims and deemed reasonable by the Korean people,” the president said in the interview with the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies. “The Japanese Prime Minister and I agreed to expedite consultations for the early resolution of the issue at the Korea-Japan summit held on Nov. 2, I believe now is high time to make a decision to attend to the wounds from the past and heal them.”The two sides have been trying to end the dispute through seven rounds of director-general-level meetings since April 2014 but made little headway in bridging the gap between their respective positions. Seoul demands an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims and their families, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that restored bilateral diplomatic relations.“In this year marking the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties, our two countries need to tackle history issues on the basis of a correct understanding of history, thereby creating a turning point for a new journey into the future,” she added. As for inter-Korean ties, Park called for Pyongyang to follow through on an Aug. 25 agreement and improve relations in a stable manner, stressing the need to gradually build trust and lay the groundwork for an eventual reunification. Top officials in charge of security and cross-border affairs held a rare meeting at the border village of Panmunjeom and agreed to launch formal talks to advance their relations in Seoul or Pyongyang and arrange reunions of separated families, which took place last month. “There is no reason not to hold an inter-Korean summit if a breakthrough comes in solving the North Korean nuclear issue and progress is made in improving the South-North relationship,” she said.“But it will be possible only when the North comes forward for a proactive and sincere dialogue. What counts most is North Korea’s sincerity and determination to act on its words.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","enslavement of korean women during ,friday once again urged japan ,solving the north korean nuclear ,women and japanese prime minister ,war ii through sincere apology","['Park Geun - hye', 'Japan', 'korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Organization of Asia - Pacific News Agencies', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'U.N.', 'Park', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'korean', 'the Organization of Asia - Pacific News Agencies', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48547441  0.65610123

(Yonhap)The school in Pyongyang is the top institution where party officials are trained.Choe, a senior secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, visited China a couple of times and is widely seen as North Korea’s point man on China.In 2013, Choe met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing as Kim’s envoy. In September, Choe also visited Beijing for China’s massive military parade.Choe’s whereabouts have been under the intense spotlight among officials and analysts in South Korea and other regional powers as he was not named as a member of a funeral committee of a senior military official who died last Saturday.Choe also did not show up for the state funeral ceremony of Ri Ul-sol, marshal of North Korea’s military, who died of lung cancer at the age of 94.Choe’s conspicuous absence sparked speculation among some analysts that he might have been ousted from the party’s key post.Still, the South Korean intelligence officials believe that Choe was not purged, though he is undergoing education at the Kim Il Sung Higher Party School for unspecified reasons.The officials, who spoke on conditions of anonymity, did not give any details on how Choe ended up in reeducation at Kim Il Sung Higher Party School.There is media speculation that it may be related to problems in building a dam near Mount Baekdu, which Pyongyang claims is the sacred birthplace of Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s late leader and the father of the current leader Kim.The South Korean officials said that reeducation at Kim Il Sung Higher Party School is the most lenient punishment, compared with writing a letter of self-criticism at home or serving time in rural areas or coal mines.On Wednesday, North Korean state television aired footage of Choe when it aired a competition of “ssirum” ― a traditional Korean form of wrestling ― at a stadium in Pyongyang, the officials said.The intelligence officials said they believe that the ssirum competition was held Tuesday. The North Korean state television usually reports events a day after they take place.In 2014, the North’s main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, mentioned Choe’s late father’s case as an example of protecting the country’s founder Kim Il-sung.Choe Hyon, who served as a vice defense minister, pulled a pistol during a key party meeting in 1956 on the opposition in a factional strife against Kim Il-sung. The senior Choe’s move dampened the spirits of those who opposed Kim, who later purged his political opponents.

But Choe Ryong-hae, secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, was not in attendance.Speculation over his fate has intensified since Choe was found to have been omitted from the list of a committee that prepared the funeral.The KCNA said that the North's leader ""expressed deep condolences"" over Ri's death before the coffin was carried out of a funeral hall.Ri was an anti-Japanese guerrilla in the first half of the 20th century and worked with the North's late founder Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the current leader.He also assumed a number of key posts in the KPA and gained the title of marshal of the North's military in 1995. But his influence had fallen markedly since Kim took power in late 2011 following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il.

They argue that Korean President Park Geun-hye’s first-ever summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Nov. 2 must mark a turning point for strained relations. Yet, doubts remain: Would Japan change its policy towards Korea if Korea does toward Japan?Professor Hwang Jae-ho“Walk alone like a rhinoceros,” reads a passage from an ancient Buddhist script, a metaphor for going one’s own way. The Park administration should “go its own way” when it comes to its Japan policy. Seoul needs to keep its current relations with Tokyo from deteriorating any further rather than expecting a dramatic change for the better in its ties with Japan. Tokyo, indeed, will not change.Japan no longer sees Korea as strategically valuable for its foreign policy. The Abe administration, in its early years, was willing to promote closer ties with Korea. Yet now, Seoul-Tokyo relations are secondary to Beijing-Tokyo ties. Japan wants to believe that Korea is already on the Chinese side. Letting Korea do so would also serve Japan’s interests. Tokyo can get what it wants by partnering with the U.S. Its half-hearted fence-mending efforts with Seoul come only out of consideration for Washington.Since Prime Minister Abe was reelected, Japan, with its samurai-like determination, is gearing up for a rivalry with China. A real showdown lies ahead. Conflicts in the East China Sea are not mere territorial disputes per se. It signals the beginning of an earnest rivalry between the two powers. Japan has a last chance for a surprise upset before China consolidates its leadership while Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping are both in office. Korea, in this sense, is not a decisive factor for Japan.Diplomacy is the responsibility of a nation’s top leader. Korea’s current leader, as shown in domestic politics numerous times, sticks to principles and has a clear set of preferences. Against this backdrop, Seoul cannot pretend to be on friendly terms with Tokyo as if nothing has happened. Korea should ideally maintain friendly ties with all nations, but each administration has gone through difficult times with one certain country: with the U.S. under the Roh Moo-hyun administration; with China under President Lee Myung-bak’s rule; and with Japan under the current president. Seoul is better off sticking to principles, a move that would become an asset for its trustpolitik.The success of Korea’s Japan policy depends on the U.S. Yet it would be naive for Korea to expect more attention from Washington. The U.S. is currently preoccupied with the strategic rebalance to Asia. Given that Abe is actively embracing U.S. interests, it is only natural for Tokyo to trump Seoul in U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, Korea should uphold its principles on issues of unresolved historical animosity, but, at the same time, it needs to change its focus. The sexual enslavement of Korean women by Imperial Japan during World War II is indeed an important issue. However, the Korean government should widen its frame of historical issues. Sticking to the “past” will only narrow Korea’s room for action in the U.S.-Korea-Japan triangle.In a nutshell, Koreans should not be obsessed with producing results from the recent summit talks with Japan. Nor do they need to be frustrated with Abe’s failure to issue an apology during the summit. Seoul should not compromise its principles. There is no need for haste.

The book, published by Seoul-based left-wing civic group the Center for Historical Truth and Justice, designated 4,389 people as pro-Japanese figures during the 1910-1945 colonial era, including late President Park Chung-hee, father of incumbent President Park Geun-hye.  The building of National Institute of Korea History. Yonhap“I have asked (the city government) about the distribution process and was told that it will start in mid-December,” said Kim in a media interview. In 2014, Seoul city approved a budget for distributing the books to middle and high schools in the municipality. “Seoul City Council had unanimously passed a legislation for distribution because the city’s lawmakers believe that the current history textbooks’ description of Japan’s colonial rule of Korea was not accurate enough,” said Kim, a member of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The plan to bring the books to actual classrooms and libraries at schools would require panels of teachers, parents and school officials to decide whether to purchase them from the city’s education authorities.The opposition from conservative camps also added complexity to the implementation of the policy that has been delayed for a year. Some right-wing civic groups and conservative-minded parents had then protested against the distribution. The ruling Saenuri Party’s lawmakers on Monday joined the fray. Rep. Ha Tae-kyeung dismissed the book as “biased” and denounced the publisher for advocating a historic perspective that denies the orthodoxy of South Korea. “If you look at the publishing entity’s mission statement, you can realize that it is pretty much the same as that of now-defunct Unified Progressive Party,” said Ha. The leftist party was dissolved in 2014 by the Constitutional Court’s decision, which said the party had plotted to overthrow the government. The liberal civic groups welcomed the city’s decision to distribute the books. The Korean Teachers and Educational Workers’ Union, the nation’s biggest progressive teachers’ union, said that the dictionary would serve “educational” purpose and help the students remember “unfortunate” modern Korean history. The ideological feud over the book came amid burgeoning controversy surrounding the government’s decision to reinstate state-authored textbooks for secondary education. Faced with a public backlash, the government has struggled to select a panel of experts who would author the textbooks. With a day left for the government to decide the panel, it was reported that about 20 experts had applied for the position. During the recruitment period, a prominent history professor who was to lead the publication project resigned on Friday over a sexual harassment scandal. Responding to the growing concerns over which experts would take the risk of leading the project, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea said in a media interview that the government would not reveal the identity of the authors until it finishes publishing the textbooks.   Meanwhile, the teachers and parents were divided over the city government’s policy. Some parents cautioned that some teachers might use what they considered to be “unverified” books to inject their own political views. “I am not sure whether the books are 100 percent accurate. Considering the fact that the students are susceptible to the influence of their teachers, I am worried that the students might learn biased views of South Korea’s history,” said Kim Jeong-lee, a 45-year-old mother of two middle school students in Seoul.Some liberal-minded teachers, on the other hand, dismissed the concern, saying that the books would only serve as a historic reference to the Korea’s modern history, not as a textbook that the teachers would employ during the class.  “Even if our school was to purchase the books, I do not plan to use them in class. It is up to the students to make use of the books. I think they would serve as a good academic reference that the students can find in the library,” said Seoul high school teacher who asked to remain anonymous.    By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks description of japan ,the books the korean teachers ,media interview in 2014 seoul ,middle school students in seoul ,seoul city approved budget for","['Seoul City', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Kim Moon - soo', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Council', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Education Office', 'the "" Register of Sympathizers of Imperial Japan', 'Seoul', 'the Center for Historical Truth', 'Justice', 'pro - japanese', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun', 'National Institute of Korea History', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City Council', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Ha Tae - kyeung', 'South Korea', 'Progressive Party', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'the Korean Teachers and Educational Workers ’ Union', 'korean', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Jeong - lee', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42652431  0.58213204

(Yonhap)“Through (the office), I hope to expand the range of cooperation on sectors such as welfare, health, disaster management, security and underground resources that will benefit both Koreas.”Park’s remarks were delivered at the meeting where officials and experts suggested revitalizing North Korea’s domestic market by expanding inter-Korean economic cooperation in order to induce Pyongyang toward openness. The idea demonstrated the views by the government and experts that it would be more realistic to push North Korea to open its doors by reviving its domestic market rather than waiting for the collapse of the Kim Jong-un regime.The president also urged North Korea to step forward and keep its promise of holding a dialogue with the South.“As agreed on the Aug. 25 (high-level) inter-Korean talks, I expect to start a discussion on mutual interests of the South and the North and for the future of the Korean Peninsula,” she said. In an Aug. 25 agreement that ended a military standoff, the two Koreas agreed to hold government-level talks in Pyongyang or Seoul at an early date to improve inter-Korean ties. There has been some progress on the civil level with the two Koreas resuming the reunion of separated families last month. Despite Seoul’s repeated calls, Pyongyang has remained silent on holding the high-level follow-up talks.Park raising her voice on inter-Korean exchanges and dialogue was expected to bring the focus on the matters of resuming aid to Pyongyang and lifting financial sanctions. The Seoul government slapped the sanctions on the North on May 24, 2010, in the wake of its torpedoing of a South Korean warship. The measure prohibits all inter-Korean economic activities, except for the Gaeseong Industrial Complex.Reiterating her firm position on publishing state-controlled history textbooks, Park also said the goal of achieving the peaceful unification of the two Koreas would be difficult unless solid historic values were set.Park stressed that her mission to instill a sense of pride and to set a correct view of history for future generations is the first step toward unifying the two Koreas, which has been divided for more than 60 years following the 1950-53 Korean War.“If these missions are not taken (in advance), it would be hard to achieve unification.

South Korea demands Japan offer a sincere apology and compensation to the victims before they all die, while Tokyo insists all issues related to its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula were settled under the normalization treaty of 1965.   Recognizing the difficulties of resolving the issue through a single meeting, experts here instead highlighted the significance of the summit itself.   ""The fact that they had the opportunity to hold candid talks carries great significance in itself,"" said Lee Won-deog, head of the Japanese studies center at Seoul's Kookmin University. ""In a way, it removed the obstacle to future summits between the two countries.""   Lee expressed hope Park and Abe would hold further talks during various group summits scheduled for the end of the year to resolve the ""comfort women"" issue, and then exchange visits next year.   ""It's a decision that's up to the two countries' leaders,"" he noted.   On the comfort women issue, Park and Abe agreed to speed up negotiations for a quick resolution, an apparent step back from Park's earlier call to resolve the issue by the end of the year.   However, South Korea's strategic interests are not limited to historical issues alone, Lee stressed.   Park Cheol-hee, head of the Japanese studies center at Seoul National University, also welcomed the summit as a ""stepping stone"" for further talks.   ""It's good that they left open the possibility of resolving"" the comfort women issue, he said. ""Other areas of cooperation should not be linked to it.""   Chin Chang-soo, head of the Sejong Institute, a private think tank near Seoul, called the summit an example of South Korea's ""flexible diplomacy.""   ""Therefore, it can be rated highly, and for now, we should attach meaning to the fact that they met,"" he said.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (left)and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang hold hands together for a photo before their trilateral summit at Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday. (Yonhap)What was initiated as a regular summit in 2008 had been stalled since the fifth summit in May 2012 due to long-festering historical and territorial feuds that have aggravated mutual distrust to the detriment of regional stability.“Although their economic interdependence has continued to deepen, the three nations’ political relations have been shaky,” said Nam Chang-hee, political science professor at Inha University. “The trilateral meeting helped forge a momentum for narrowing the yawning gap between the economic and political realities.”South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang attended the three-way summit at Cheong Wa Dae, as international attention was being drawn to their talks’ impact on the regional security and economy.In the absence of the summit, political distrust between Seoul and Tokyo and between Beijing and Tokyo has worsened -- a reason calls have been mounting for the three nations to exert more efforts to mend their relations.Some four months after the last trilateral summit, the Japanese government nationalized the group of disputed islands in the East China Sea, which drew strong protests from China that also claims the islands. Relations between Seoul and Tokyo were also caught in a downward spiral after former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak paid a surprise visit in August 2012 to Dokdo, Korea’s easternmost islets, which Japan also claims. Japan’s lack of contrition for its wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women and its repeated sovereignty claim to Dokdo have continued to deepen mutual animosities and hamper bilateral cooperation in a set of areas including deterrence against the North.Washington has continued to pressure its Asian allies to work closely together to promote regional stability, leading Seoul to exert its diplomacy to persuade Beijing and Tokyo to get together for the trilateral summit in Seoul.Analysts say that the summit at least helped curb North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations given that the issue is an exception on which the three nations can present a united position.“All three parties shared the need to prevent North Korea’s additional provocations that are not in their interests. So cooperation on the North would be one of the tangible achievements,” said Park Won-gon, international relations professor at Handong Global University.“But the cooperation should not remain just declaratory. The three nations should continue to flesh out their plan for joint efforts to deter North Korea in concrete terms, and Seoul needs to capitalize on the momentum to tackle the North Korean issue.”The three-way summit also helped ease the impression that Seoul was tilting toward Beijing, as Seoul showed its willingness to improve relations with Tokyo, observers noted. Since Park visited Beijing to attend a military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in September, the impression has been growing. But Seoul’s steps to engage with Tokyo and improve three-way security cooperation involving the U.S. helped reduce that impression.Nam of Inha University said that while Seoul strives to strengthen the trilateral cooperation mechanism involving South Korea, China and Japan, Seoul also needs to enhance three-way cooperation with the U.S. and Japan so as to “balance” the two trilateral relationships.“There should be a certain level of balance between the Seoul-Beijing-Tokyo partnership and the Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership. One should not be pushed for in a way that would damage the other partnership,” he noted.“So, one plausible way is to propose holding a trilateral summit among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan as well on a regular basis, as South Korea, China and Japan seek to institutionalize their three-way cooperation apparatus.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sunday south korean president park ,china and japan on sunday ,sunday south korean president ,fifth summit in may 2012 ,said sunday south korean president","['South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'south korean', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Washington', 'asian', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Park', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Nam of Inha University', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Song Sang - ho']",4,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.37492761  1.23296356

The plan will be finalized within this year and implemented from next year gradually, the ministry said.Should the plan be enforced, the posts for 30 Army generals, five or six admirals and seven Air Force generals are expected to be removed. Currently, the general-level group consists of 310 Army generals, 50 admirals, 60 Air Force generals and 15 marine generals. “Several years ago, we announced our plan to reform the command structure, part of which is to reduce the number of generals. But the plan did not proceed well, and thus the reduction plan has been put on hold,” ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok told reporters during a press briefing.“Thus, we are now seeking to set up a new plan to reduce generals and implement it from next year.”In 2011, the Lee Myung-bak administration announced a major defense reform plan aimed at streamlining the bloated command apparatus and readying it for the transfer of wartime operational control from the U.S., which was then set for December 2015 and now is expected to take place in the mid-2020s.The overhaul plan involved a reduction of some 60 general-level officers, which sparked strong opposition from generals.Critics here argue that the Army’s interests in the country’s Army-centric military seemed to have been reflected in the formulation of the plan.    “Given the total number of Army troops, there should be more Army generals removed, when other armed services are not adequately staffed,” a military source told The Korea Herald, requesting anonymity.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","involve reduction of 40 generals ,more army generals removed ,posts for 30 army generals ,more army generals removed when ,reduction of 40 generals","['the Defense Ministry', 'Park Geun', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Lee Sun - jin', 'yonhap).the ministry', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Army', 'Air Force', 'Army', 'Air Force', 'Kim Min - seok', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army', 'the Korea Herald', 'Song Sang - ho']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3929081   0.35540569

Kim Tae-heum of the same party the day before, when he held Hwang responsible for lacking strategies to assuage state textbook opposition.Last month, the ministry announced that it would take back publishing rights for history textbooks in secondary education from private publishers, alleging that the current books are ideologically biased toward leftists and contained many errors. The policy has sparked disdain from the opposition and the progressive educators, which was aggravated by controversial comments like Kim Moo-sung’s “90 percent of historians are leftists,” and words by Kim Jung-bae ― the official who will be in charge of overseeing the state textbook publication ― that “Textbooks cannot have diversity.”Another obstacle for proponents of state textbook appeared Sunday after the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused the ministry of running a secret task force for the new textbooks under direct orders from the presidential office. The ministry denied the accusations.With the operations on state textbooks in danger of drifting south, there have been rumors that Hwang will take the fall for the nationwide dispute over the policy. A Saenuri official told local media that there had been “strong sentiment” requesting Hwang ― who doubles as a Saenuri lawmaker ― to step down. Hwang on Tuesday said that he had no intention of stepping down, although he vowed to “graciously accept” the criticism.“I understand that the ministry and I have been reprimanded to work harder. I will take an extra effort to carry out my work,” he said at an unscheduled briefing at the government complex in Seoul.Hwang bashed the opposition for falsely accusing the ministry officials of “conducting illegal activities,” referring to the allegations about a secret task force. He said the ministry would continue collecting public opinions until Nov. 5 as scheduled, and would start authoring the new textbooks later in the month. As of Tuesday, over 100 history professors from major universities across the country -- including Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University and Hanyang University -- had publicly announced that they would not participate as authors of the state-published history textbooks. Eight of the 10 history professors at the state-run Academy of Korean Studies also released a statement opposing the notion. “Some AKS professors have publicly announced their support for the state textbook, making it seem like the majority of our faculty members are supporting it. But we would like to make it clear that they are the minority at the academy,” they said, possibly referring to AKS professor Kwon Hee-young, one of the most outspoken proponents of the state textbook.The ministry said Monday that it would not scrap the plans even if the public opinion toward state textbooks turned out to be unfavorable.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","authored history textbooks faces hurdles ,lawmaker to step down hwang ,party began pressuring education minister ,to assuage state textbook opposition ,moo sung told reporters tuesday","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Education', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Hwang', 'Kim', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Tae - heum', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim Jung - bae', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'Hwang', 'Seoul National University', 'Yonsei University', 'Korea University', 'Hanyang University', 'Academy of Korean Studies', 'AKS', 'AKS', 'Kwon Hee - young']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19256873  0.4565556

""Countries have agreed to join forces and open their doors in the realm of science through the meeting.""Choi added South Korea is the ""righteous"" nation to fulfill the vision shared during the meeting.""The meeting has paved ways to accelerate discussions on inclusive growth around the globe,"" Choi said. ""South Korea has taken the central part in such a process."" The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has said the declaration will work as the guideline for their science-related policies down the road. Among other things, the declaration says that science and technology will improve the quality of life for all citizens as they increase employment, productivity and economic growth in a sustainable manner over the long term.South Korea's ICT ministry said the global science meeting is significant in that delegates from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have also been invited.Along with government delegates, world-famous business executives and scholars also visited Daejeon, the science hub of South Korea located 164 kilometers south of Seoul.Futurist Jeremy Rifkin shared ideas on how ""the zero-margin"" concept, which refers to a system where it costs almost no resources to benefit an additional person on the back of technology, should be developed further to cover energy issues.Sergio Bertolucci, the research and computing director at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and Phil Diamond, director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics also highlighted the importance of ""open science,"" which is aimed at making technology more accessible to people at all levels.The OECD Committee for Science and Technology Policy also held a closed-door meeting on Thursday to discuss detailed ways to roll out the vision shared through the Daejeon Declaration.South Korea said another key achievement of the five-day gathering was the promotion of Seoul's creative economy policy to the world as a new paradigm for economic and social development.The creative economy vision, initiated by President Park Geun-hye, calls for creating new growth opportunities through merging different industries, especially through information and communications technology.Delegates, including OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria, visited a creative economy center located in Daejeon on Tuesday, where startups are invited to receive financial and other key support from the government.

Last year, Park established a presidential committee to study ways to achieve the peaceful unification of the two Koreas and to reach public consensus on the issue. Park was touching on the role of the police in the process of an envisioned unification for the first time.The president also called for strict law enforcement, stressing that maintaining the authority of law is essential for her goal of achieving national reform and economic takeoff.“I ask you to strictly enforce the law against those who deny liberal democracy and the spirit of the Constitution,” said Park.Expressing her gratitude to 140,000 police across the country for their efforts in maintaining social security, Park also urged officials to better deal with increasingly sophisticated crimes, such as financial fraud and cybercrimes.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","police day in seoul wednesday ,police day president park geun ,at ceremony in seoul president ,day in seoul wednesday yonhapher ,hye on wednesday urged law","['Park Geun', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'YonhapHer', 'Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1962335   0.37388563

There have been a lot of questions about whether South Korea has slipped the moorings and was steaming full-speed toward Beijing, leaving the alliance in the wake,"" Klingner said.The summit came after questions have arisen about whether South Korea is getting too close to China after Park attended a massive Chinese military parade last week that was seen as a show of force at a time of growing rivalry with the U.S.""I think the summit ... put a lot of supposed concerns to rest,"" Klingner said.During a joint news conference following Friday's summit, Obama expressed clear support for South Korea to bolster relations with China, saying it's wrong to believe good relations between Seoul and Beijing are bad for the Korea-U.S. alliance.""Sometimes there's a perception that if President Park meets with President Xi, that must cause a problem for us,"" Obama said during a joint news conference with Park. ""We want South Korea to have a strong relationship with China, just as we want to have a strong relationship with China.""Obama also said that there is no ""contradiction"" between South Korea having good relations with the U.S. and having good relations with China. Obama added, however, that the U.S. expects South Korea to speak out if China fails to abide by international norms and rules, apparently referring to the dispute over Chinese actions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.The two leaders also issued a joint statement dealing exclusively with North Korea's nuclear program and provocations, urging Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program and refrain from provocations like a long-range rocket launch or a nuclear test. The U.S. also reaffirmed its commitment to resolve the nuclear issue with ""utmost urgency and determination.""It was the first time the countries have adopted such a North Korea-focused statement at the leaders' level.Klingner said the summit affirmed there is ""no daylight"" on North Korean policy between the two countries.Still, the expert said it would have been better if the two leaders had discussed the issue of the possible deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area missile defense system, a move that China has vehemently opposed.""So in that case, South Korea continues to buckle under the pressure from China,"" he said.Yang Chang-seok, a former senior official of South Korea's Unification Ministry, noted that the summit produced no new incentives for North Korea to return to the negotiating table.""We need some more to get North Korea back to the table in addition to both presidents' position that if North Korea gives up nuclear weapons, we can provide extensive economic cooperation, etc.,"" Yang said, adding that Pyongyang renewed its demand for a peace treaty just a day after the summit.""It would have been better, if we want more, to show North Korea some bigger carrots if North Korea comes to the dialogue table,"" he said.

Hyun told Kim and Moon that the president also wanted to urge the rival parties to pass outstanding bills at the parliament, the party officials added.In response, NPAD has suggested a trilateral meeting involving Park and the two party leaders to also put the issue of the state-authored history textbooks on the table.The planned publication of history texts written by government-designated authors has been a divisive hot potato in recent days.A Saenuri official said the ruling party welcomed Park's proposal, but it was opposed to discussing history textbooks during the meeting, viewing it as an attempt by NPAD to turn the occasion into a political show.Hyun, meanwhile, declined to comment on NPAD's proposal when reached by phone.

(Yonhap)Her trip also helped ease the growing impression that Seoul was tilting toward Beijing, analysts noted. During his summit with Park last Friday, President Barack Obama expressed support for Seoul to pursue deeper ties with Beijing. Yet, there is a major task left for Park to fulfil to maintain strong ties with its security ally -- mending relations with Tokyo to strengthen the trilateral security partnership that the U.S. has been keenly fostering despite its allies’ historical animosities.“Obama’s support for the Seoul-Beijing relations means that the U.S. sort of recognized the role of South Korea as a pivotal middle power nation, and that Seoul secured more space for it to strategically maneuver in the regional diplomatic arena,” said Nam Chang-hee, diplomacy professor at Inha University.“However, Seoul should also read what Washington meant. Obama supported Seoul’s relations with Beijing on the premise that Seoul would try to do what it can to enhance its ties with Tokyo and the trilateral partnership involving the U.S.”The upcoming trilateral summit among the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China is expected to be a crucial juncture for Park to improve relations with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe whose nationalist policy agenda has aggravated taut diplomatic tensions. Both Park and Abe have expressed their willingness to hold a bilateral summit on the sidelines of the trilateral summit, which is expected to be held in Seoul in late October or early November. The two sides have not yet held a summit amid territorial and historical spats. Another achievement from last week’s summit between Park and Obama is that the two sides agreed to strengthen their cooperation on the issue of the unification of the Korean Peninsula, analysts noted.In a joint statement, which was seen as unusual due to its focus wholly on North Korean issues, the allies said that they would intensify “high-level strategic consultations” to create a favorable environment for peaceful unification.Seoul officials said that the high-level consultations mean a vice minister-level or minister-level communication mechanism focusing on unification issues.Also notable is that the U.S. offered greater support for Park’s “Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative.” Washington appointed its Special Representative for North Korea Policy Sung Kim as an envoy dedicated to supporting the NAPCI.Park has been pushing for NAPCI to build multilateral trust to address the “Asia Paradox,” in which regional political and security cooperation is weak, despite deepening socioeconomic interdependence. NAPCI is one of the three major external policy initiatives including the Peninsular Trust-Building and Eurasia Initiatives.During her trip to the U.S., Seoul made yet another request that the U.S. help transfer some key technologies to build indigenous fighter jets. However, the U.S. rejected the notion, as was widely expected.But the allies agreed to build a consultative body to promote technological cooperation in Seoul’s fighter jet development program and wider defense industry areas -- an agreement that observers said helped save face for South Korean defense officials.By Cho Chung-un, Song Sang-ho (christory@heralddcorp.com) (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","park last friday president barack ,returned to seoul on sunday ,with park last friday president ,last friday president barack obama ,obama support for the seoul","['Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'Seongnam', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park', 'Barack Obama', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Obama', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Park', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Obama', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'Sung Kim', 'napci.park', 'NAPCI', 'NAPCI', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Song Sang - ho']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37032941  0.49124989

The director-level talks, which began last year, have since been dragging.Park said in her speech at the CSIS that the trilateral summit will become an important juncture not only for peace and stability in the region, but also in improving ties with Japan.“I hope this trilateral summit will provide an opportunity for Korea and Japan to clear away obstacles hindering closer bilateral ties and thus hold sincere discussions on the way forward towards a common future.”She went on to hype the trilateral diplomacy that she said was a “new endeavor” to make important contributions to improving bilateral and multinational cooperation in Northeast Asia, the only region that lacks mechanisms for multilateral cooperation.Such moves also come in line with U.S. efforts to develop multiway cooperation in the region, such as through the ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit, she said.Senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs Ju Chul-ki separately told reporters that the date of the summit talks has not been confirmed, though it is likely to be held around Nov. 1.This will be the first trilateral summit in three years and six months, and it will be attended by Park, Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.  South Korea and Japan are close economic partners and key allies of the U.S., though they have long been at odds over their shared history, including the Japanese military's sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.  South Korea has repeatedly pressed Japan to resolve the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan's World War II soldiers -- one of the knottiest issues between the two neighbors.   ""I think it's fair to say that there could be a meaningful summit if progress is made on the issue,"" Park said in a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington.  Park has so far shunned bilateral talks with Abe due to his apparent refusal to acknowledge Japan's responsibility for its past atrocities, including sex slavery.  The issue of sex slaves has gained urgency as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.  ""We don't really have much time left in terms of dealing with this issue,"" Park said. Also Thursday, Park called for international coordination to make sure North Korea will recognize that pursuing its nuclear program is ""an exercise in futility"" and deepens its isolation.  ""It's very important that the international community stands united in sending the message so they have no choice but to forgo their nuclear weapons capability,"" Park said.  North Korea pledged to scrap its nuclear program in return for diplomatic concessions and economic aid under a landmark 2005 nuclear deal with South Korea, the U.S., China, Russia and Japan.  The North later backtracked from its commitment and conducted nuclear tests. It has also repeatedly vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear programs as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy against it.  ""The South Korea-U.S. alliance should exercise leadership to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear program and pursue reform and openness,"" Park said.  On Friday, Park and U.S. President Barack Obama are set to adopt a joint statement on North Korea's nuclear program in the latest move that could illustrate their commitment to producing progress over the issue.  Park accused North Korea of sticking to the path of isolation while advancing its nuclear capability, citing a recent nuclear deal reached between the United States, five other world powers and Iran.  South Korea has called on North Korea to emulate Vietnam and Myanmar, which opted for reform and openness. ""The situation on the Korean Peninsula is at a crossroads due to the possibility of North Korea's provocations,"" Park said.  There is lingering speculation that North Korea may launch a long-range rocket in the coming months to put what it claims to be a satellite into orbit.  Seoul and Washington view a satellite launch as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.  A new rocket launch could prompt the U.N. to further tighten sanctions on North Korea, which has long been under an array of U.S. and international sanctions for its missile and nuclear tests.

It operates, among other things, the Hubble Space Telescope.  Noah Petro, a scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter at Goddard, said he hopes South Korea and the U.S. will expand cooperation on lunar exploration.   In May, NASA and its South Korean counterpart signed a letter of intent calling for cooperation on lunar exploration. South Korea and the U.S. are pushing space cooperation as a new frontier of their alliance that has long been associated with security cooperation against the threats posed by North Korea.  Park also expressed hope that her visit to Goddard would serve as an occasion to further boost bilateral cooperation on space after receiving a briefing on NASA's Mars and lunar exploration programs.  Christopher Scolese, director of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said he is pleased to cooperate with South Korea and expressed hope that the two sides will expand cooperation.  Park also watched a pre-recorded video message from Scott Kelly, commander of the International Space Station orbiting 250 miles above Earth.  ""On behalf of my crewmates, I want to extend our warmest wishes from space to President Park on the occasion of a visit to Goddard,"" he said.  Fifty years ago, Park's father, then-President Park Chung-hee, visited Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

(Yonhap)Like her visit to the U.S. in May 2013, her trip to Washington this time is also an “official working visit” -- a notch down from the “state visit” that involves more ceremonial events, which some experts say was a decision to place wider focus on “practical” issues.Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to the U.S. for a state visit. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to the U.S. in April was an official visit, but he was seen being wined and dined with greater distinguishment than his predecessors in recent memory, with the media depicting the U.S.-Japan relations as having entered a new “honeymoon” period.A Seoul official told The Korea Herald that there is no special political meaning for Park visiting the U.S. for an official visit rather than a state visit.“A South Korean president usually travels to the U.S. for a state visit once during his or her term. The president makes a state visit in the early part of the five-year term or in the latter part,” the official said on condition of anonymity.“Both countries do not pay much attention to whether it is a state visit or not. Even though she traveled to the U.S. for an official working visit in 2013, she was treated as if she was on a state visit then.”But there seem to be subtle differences between the different levels of presidential visits. During his recent state visit to the U.S., Chinese leader Xi stayed at the Blair House, the official state guesthouse of the White House. He was also invited to an extravagant state dinner event hosted by U.S. President Barack Obama.But there is no schedule yet for a state dinner with Obama playing host to Park. But Vice President Joe Biden is to host a dinner event for her, Cheong Wa Dae said, stressing the importance of Biden’s invitation.“It is a rarity for the vice president to invite a foreign high-level guest to his residence. The invitation underscores the familiarity between South Korea and the U.S.,” Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, told reporters. Where Park will stay during her trip to the U.S. also drew attention. Reports say she is not expected to stay at the Blair House.Whatever treatment she receives, Park’s priority for this trip rests on reaffirming the robust alliance with the U.S. to better cope with Pyongyang’s evolving missile and nuclear threats, observers pointed out.

Members of a conservative civic group protest against NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in (right) and other party members who were holding a rally opposing the government’s revival of state-published history textbooks in Yeouido, Tuesday. (Yonhap)“The political circles should not cause rifts within the public opinion with unnecessary dispute, and should instead normalize the history lessons so that it will be a catalyst in establishing the people’s unity,” she said during a secretarial meeting at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae. “It is our imperative to ensure that the future generation can acquire a correct view of history and value.” The Education Ministry’s recent announcement to monopolize history textbook publication for middle and high school has sparked furious backlash from the main opposition, who accused the president of attempting to hide flaws of controversial political figures like her father, former President Park Chung-hee, and the founding President Syngman Rhee.The government had claimed that current privately published textbooks were too biased in favor of the leftists, and requires government intervention.Park emphasized the importance of an accurate view of history, particularly amid the rapid shift in the power dynamics of Northeast Asia and the surrounding countries. “It is important for our children to grow with pride (about Korea) through correct history lessons. ... I urge (officials) to reflect opinions from various fields so that correct history textbooks can be authored.”The comments, made just hours before her visit to the U.S., marks her first public comments on the contentious issue of state history textbooks. It was widely seen as an attempt to defend and push ahead with her government’s decision that had sparked an uproar in both education and political circles.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn defended the president’s resolve, saying that the government should be in charge of “balanced responsible history education.”He also said that in a democratic society like Korea, some ideas can be restrained by law, during Tuesday’s interpellation session at the National Assembly. When asked if the government can be justified in forcing a single idea upon people, Hwang said that the freedom of ideas is not about accepting all opinions and that ideas that are against democracy itself cannot be tolerated by the country.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","rally opposing the government revival ,history textbooks in yeouido tuesday ,conservative civic group protest against ,holding rally opposing the government ,of conservative civic group protest","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Yeouido', 'Cheong', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'Hwang']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31194949  0.36453161

Mark Lippert, however, ruled out a stationing of advanced U.S. missile defense assets on the peninsula as an item on the agenda for Presidents Park Geun-hye and Barack Obama, though she is scheduled to visit the Pentagon during her trip accompanied by Defense Minister Han Min-koo. “But back to principle, we would like North Korea not to undertake any kind of actions that would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions in the first place, and that’s what we’re working on right now,” the envoy said in a joint interview at his residence in central Seoul.  U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert speaks at a reception in Seoul last month. (Yonhap)Tension has been flaring in recent weeks as Pyongyang threatened to launch a long-range rocket and extend what it calls nuclear deterrence ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party on Saturday. The North’s evolving missile threats have helped prompt the U.S. Forces Korea to carry out a site survey for a possible deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, which is designed to shoot down short, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal stage. While North Korea is to feature “robustly and deeply,” the two leaders will focus on a “three-pronged strategy” consisting of diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions and measures as well as robust defense and deterrence, Lippert said. He also called on the Kim Jong-un regime to engage in “authentic and credible” talks to break the prolonged standoff and deepening isolation, citing recent Washington’s breakthroughs with Iran, Cuba and Myanmar. “(They were) instances where there have been serious, incredible interlocutors on the other side of the table willing to negotiate in principled diplomacy. The Obama administration has reciprocated and come to conclusions on negotiations with three countries that historically have had very difficult relationships,” the ambassador said. “North Korea doesn’t seem interested in engaging with other countries. … So I think the ball is in their court.” On the economic front, Lippert struck an upbeat tone about Seoul’s potential membership in the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership, welcoming its interest and reaffirming Washington’s willingness for related discussions. The two presidents will also seek to reinforce the partnership on “new frontiers” ― emerging nonconventional security challenges such as cyberspace, environment, energy and global health, he noted. “(South Korea) has bilateral free trade agreements with 10 of the 12 members of the TPP so it puts them in a logical position, good position going forward,” he added.“We have long welcomed their interest in the TPP and look forward to continue conversations with them.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","summit next week the ambassador ,amid north korea growing nuclear ,scheduled to visit the pentagon ,two presidents will also seek ,isolation citing recent washington breakthroughs","['North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Pentagon', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'North Korea', 'U.N.

The fund, which had gathered roughly 4.3 billion won ($3.7 million) in less than a month since its launch, will be mainly used to cover the blind spots of the government’s existing youth job policies, they said. Occupational training and mentors will be made available for job seekers, while the tentatively named “Youth Hope Academy” will analyze the demands of employers and match them with potential employees. The “Youth Hope Foundation” will also coordinate private institutes in finding job opportunities overseas. While youth unemployment in Korea calls for drastic measures, practically all the policies they proudly announced are just a rehash of existing policies. Although the government said it would cover the gaps in the ministerial policies, job mentors, training and job match-making are already being covered by the ministry.The Labor Ministry even operates the “Youth Employment Academy” that carries out many of the same functions that the Youth Hope Academy is expected to conduct.“They may have similar names, but they are different in how they are operated. What the government does is a standardized financial support, and the Youth Hope Fund will add to the government support,” said Minister Lee. If a person looking for a job wants to be trained for example, the preexisting policy would cover the training costs, but the fund will cover their living costs, he explained.But Lee was vague on why the present policies themselves could not be amended to provide sufficient support, and a separate state plan ― under the same name but “different operation” ― is needed.Funding was another issue. The 4.3 billion won raised so far is about 0.2 percent of the annual 2 trillion won budget spent on youth employment. As the money is spread thinly across most of the policies, it is but a dent in the big picture.Since the fund relies completely on voluntary donations, it is unclear if the money will keep flowing in, especially beyond the incumbent government. Less than a month after the funding kicked off, there are already reports of banks taking part in the project allegedly pressing their employees to participate. The much-trumpeted project was initiated by President Park herself ― who was the first donor ― and its participants include Prime Minister Hwang and other high-profile officials who scurried to follow suit. What many criticized as a publicity stunt was being made amid the administration’s labor market reform push that has faced harsh criticism for being business-friendly.Minister Choo emphasized that youth employment projects are important regardless of their size, but did not address why time and efforts need to be devoted to launch projects with similar names, purposes and directions that will most likely and inevitably overlap and eventually fizzle out.Lee said that the original “standardized” policies foster “standardized talents,” and that the addition of the Youth Hope Fund project will help in creating talents that will be competent on the global stage. But while money is not always the answer, it is difficult to believe that the 4.3 billion won plan will be able to achieve what a 2 trillion won plan was unable to do, especially if the former is a much smaller and less impressive doppelganger of the latter.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","critics of president park geun ,unemployment issue at media briefing ,the plan wednesday which park ,employment fund have been bashing ,unemployment in korea calls for","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Labor', 'Lee Ki - kwon', 'Choo Kyung - ho', 'the "" Youth Hope Fund', 'Youth Hope Academy', 'the "" Youth Hope Foundation', 'Korea', 'the Labor Ministry', 'the "" Youth Employment Academy', 'the Youth Hope Academy', 'the Youth Hope Fund', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Choo', 'Lee', 'the Youth Hope Fund']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.06288043  0.21209012

General Assembly.Park has made pitches for unification in recent years, calling it a ""bonanza"" for South Korea as well as a blessing for neighboring countries.North Korea has long suspected that Seoul could be plotting to absorb Pyongyang, a claim denied by the South. The rival Koreas remain technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Park believes that peaceful unification is the fundamental solution to resolve the standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.Park's latest comment came amid lingering concerns that North Korea may launch a long-range rocket to put a satellite into orbit as part of its celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party that falls on Saturday. Seoul and Washington view a satellite launch as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.Park also called for efforts to cut red tape to help boost corporate investment while instructing officials to make sure that many young people can find opportunity through a fund meant to help young people find jobs.Park has donated 20 million won and promised to give about 3.2 million won, or 20 percent of her monthly salary, each month to the fund.The fund, proposed by Park, drew 1.92 billion won ($1.62 million) from about 50,000 people in just days after it was set up last month.Young people have been struggling to find jobs as local companies remain reluctant to hire new workers amid a prolonged economic slump. The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 8 percent in August, down from 9.4 percent a month earlier and the lowest level since October last year. Park also called for swift implementation of a set of measures that could boost competition in the financial industry.The measures include a portable account service, which is designed to connect to the computer system of local banks to make it easier for people to switch bank accounts.South Korea is also pushing to introduce Internet-only banks as part of its efforts to deregulate the local financial industry and foster the fast-growing financial technology.""The reform in the financial sector is a task that cannot be delayed anymore,"" Park said, describing it as the blood vessel of the economy.

I think it's very interesting, it's very creative,"" Medeiros said. ""I appreciate the fact that the ROK (South Korea) took the initiative. It's something that we need to discuss in more detail.""The vision is aimed at promoting peace by building trust in a step-by-step manner. It calls for countries in the region to start with softer, nonpolitical issues, such as environmental issues and disaster relief, to foster trust before expanding cooperation to tackling serious political and security matters.Northeast Asia has long been plagued by historical and territorial rows in addition to military tensions stemming from North Korean provocations, despite deep economic interdependence among the countries in the region. Japan remains at odds with its two key neighbors, South Korea and China, over its militaristic past and territorial claims.Park calls the situation the ""Asia paradox.""The NAPCI has been one of Park's trademark security policies, along with the Korean Peninsula trust process that calls for similar step-by-step measures to build trust between the two Koreas.Medeiros said there are still questions about the initiative, such as how it is different from the six-party talks and whether it will undercut some of the current structures in the de-facto regional security architecture.""I think that President Park's visit is the perfect opportunity to discuss some of these issues,"" he said.

The United Nations, established seventy years ago after overcoming the calamities of war, was a beacon of hope for all people around the world.This was because of the trust and hope towards the UN's spirit of putting people at the center despite the constraints of realpolitik. Despite the many challenges and criticisms, the UN has been making tremendous contributions to promoting the common good for humanity.Even as we speak, the blue helmets - a symbol of peace - of UN Peacekeeping Operations are greatly contributing to international peace and security.The adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 provided a groundbreaking occasion to promote human rights, while the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court marked conspicuous progress towards institutionalizing the protection of human rights.The Millennium Development Goals, launched in 2000, was the most successful poverty eradication campaign in the history of the UN, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty. And few places in the world would see the UN's efforts make as much a difference as in the Republic of Korea.  This year also carries special meaning for the Republic of Korea - a year that brings both the joy of marking the 70th anniversary of our liberation and the anguish of going into the 70th year of our division. During the past 70 years, the Republic of Korea rose above the ordeals of partition and war and went on to simultaneously achieve industrialization and democratization and the UN has stood with the Republic of Korea since the founding of our government to this very day.  The values and ideals upheld by the UN - global peace, promoting human rights and common prosperity - embodied the very vision of the Republic of Korea.  And the future that Korea is envisioning is in sync with the aspirations of the UN.  The challenges pursued and achievements made by the Republic of Korea over the years are a testament to how the UN's goal for a better world has been successfully manifested. Mr. President,Notwithstanding these efforts by the UN and the international community, humanity today is confronted with multiple, simultaneous challenges in all corners of the world. To this day, there is no shortage of conflicts, big and small, and extreme civil wars.The surge in extremist groups that ISIL represents is now a global concern that needs to be urgently addressed.A single photo of Aylan Kurdi captures how such instability is unleashing the greatest humanitarian refugee crisis since the Second World War. Global climate change is even threatening the lives of our future generations; Ebola and other infectious diseases are causing countless victims, awakening us to the importance of health security.  Today, no one in our global village is free from these global and transnational threats and challenges.As the international order experiences these tectonic shifts, now, more than ever, is the time to once again light up the beacon of hope, that is the UN throughout the world to promote international peace and security, human rights and common prosperity.Above all, the international community should rally around the UN and return to the founding spirit of the UN Charter that calls for faith ""in the dignity and worth of the human person."" We must build a UN that is strong, carry the banner of renewed multilateralism, and realize the value of human dignity based on freedom, human rights, justice, and the rule of law.As a nation that puts the peace and happiness of our global village at the center of its diplomatic endeavors, Korea will spare no effort and support the UN in addressing the challenges faced by the international community, while highlighting the ideals of humanism and the need to live up to those ideals.Mr. President,The UN's drive to produce a new post-2015 development agenda is also anchored to this people-centered spirit. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit three days ago, will set a historic milestone towards a better world that leaves no one behind.  No more than half a century ago, the Republic of Korea was among the poorest countries in the world. Today, it is one of the world's top fifteen economies.In the course of achieving this 'Miracle on the Han River,' we drew immense strength from the assistance and development cooperation of the international community.  In this regard, I believe the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be an important stepping stone that can lead to a second and third miracle around the world. The Republic of Korea, holding the current presidency of ECOSOC, which will be playing a key role in the implementation of this development agenda, will actively contribute to achieving the development goals.Along the way, the Republic of Korea will actively share our development experiences and know-how with the international community.In the meantime, we have been sharing with developing countries the experiences of the Saemaul Undong (New Community Movement), which served as a springboard for Korea's leap forward. I believe that the Saemaul Undong can maximize the utility of development cooperation with developing countries, given that it ignites a sense of confidence and ownership through competition and incentives, and lays the groundwork for self-help in communities with the engagement of the local people.Two days ago, we co-hosted with the UNDP and the OECD a Special High-Level Side Event on the Saemaul Undong, and agreed to work together to help eradicate poverty and build transformative local communities in developing countries.We will further expand our efforts so that the Saemaul Undong can develop into a 'new paradigm for rural development' in developing countries.Another important driving force behind Korea's economic development was the human talent that has been nurtured through unsparing investment.  Education is the key sustainable development agenda that helps empower the individual and achieve national development. Korea has been actively engaging in the Global Education First Initiative as a Champion country. We hosted the World Education Forum with UNESCO last May and led the adoption of the 'Incheon Declaration', which sets the global education goals to be achieved by 2030.Going forward, the Republic of Korea will continue to make such efforts in the area of education.In particular, Korea will continue to work with UNESCO to spread global citizenship education.Next, Korea will also play a strong role in strengthening global health security.In addition to dispatching a disaster response team to Sierra Leone to help fight Ebola late last year, Korea announced that it would contribute 100 million dollars over the next five years to support capacity-building in developing countries at the 2nd meeting of the Global Health Security Agenda held in Seoul three weeks ago.In addition, the Republic of Korea plans to pursue projects to support developing countries worth 200 million dollars over the next five years under the 'Better Life for Girls Initiative'. Fellow delegates, Even as we achieved rapid industrialization, Korea has also been putting great energy into supporting the co-existence of man and nature.Our designation of April 5 as Arbor Day and the promotion of forestation led to a 20-fold increase in the number of trees per hectare over the past 50 years. Since 1972, we designated green belt zones to curb development in the suburbs, thereby achieving harmony between the environment and development.Now, we are channeling our environmental advocacy to joining the international community's response to climate change.  Dealing with climate change is an urgent task that we can no longer afford to put off. It is critical that the international community produce a concrete, meaningful outcome at the 2015 Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC this December. I believe that addressing climate change is not a burden, but a fresh opportunity to create future drivers of growth through technological innovation. Guided by that belief, Korea submitted a forward-leaning Intended Nationally Determined Contribution last June and is actively seeking to transition towards a low-carbon economy, while actively participating in the climate negotiations. In addition, as the host country of the Green Climate Fund Secretariat and the Global Green Growth Institute, Korea will continue to support climate action by developing business models relating to new energy industries and sharing them with developing countries.Ladies and Gentlemen,The UN's recent review of peace operations, peacebuilding as well as women, peace and security in line with a changing security environment, could not have come at a better time. As a country that experienced a devastating war and remains scarred to this day by partition, the Republic of Korea is acutely aware of the importance of peace and is strongly supporting the efforts of the UN to protect peace.To date, Korea has dispatched some 13,500 peacekeepers to 18 missions. Korean peacekeepers are being held in high regard for their exemplary and community-friendly peacekeeping and reconstruction activities.Upon consultations with the UN, Korea plans to make additional deployments to peacekeeping missions in the near future and will strengthen our substantive partnership with the African Union.To assist Syrian refugees flowing from the instability in the Middle East, Korea will step up its humanitarian assistance to the relevant countries. Korea is also pouring its efforts into laying the groundwork for peace in Northeast Asia - a region that continues to undergo persistent tensions and discord among countries. In Northeast Asia, we see a deepening of the Asia paradox phenomenon, where political and security cooperation lags behind the high-degree of economic interdependence among the countries in the region.Recently, new moves that could potentially have profound consequences for Northeast Asia's security order are leading to misgivings among countries in the region. Japan's recently-passed defense and security legislation should be implemented transparently and in a way that is conducive to friendly relations among regional countries and to peace and stability in the region.  Pointing to Northeast Asia with its continuing tensions and discord, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon once described the region as a 'crucial missing link' with no regional cooperation mechanism.The reason I am pushing forward the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative is to reconnect that missing link and thereby create a virtuous cycle of trust building and increased cooperation.  At the moment, consultations among the countries of the region are underway on a range of collaborative areas, including nuclear security, disaster management and health, and the accumulation of these experiences will also contribute to promoting global peace and cooperation.  Such efforts on our part will also help to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which poses a serious threat to peace in Northeast Asia and beyond. Resolving the North Korean nuclear issue should be accorded the highest priority if we are to uphold the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and live up to the aspirations of humanity for a world without nuclear weapons.    Last July, the Iran nuclear deal was reached. Now the international community should focus its efforts on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue - the last remaining non-proliferation challenge. In recent weeks, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again publicly intimated further acts of provocation that would violate UN Security Council resolutions. This will not only do harm to the hard-won mood for inter-Korean dialogue, but also undermine the efforts of the members of the six-party talks to reopen denuclearization talks. The DPRK would do well to choose reform and opening rather than additional provocations and to endeavor to free its people from hardship. Pushing ahead with provocations, including its nuclear development program, will undermine the values of humanity's peace espoused by the international community and the UN have been espousing. Should the DPRK boldly give up its nuclear ambitions and choose the path towards openness and cooperation, the Republic of Korea will work with the international community to actively support North Korea in developing its economy and improving the quality of life of its people. Ladies and Gentlemen,During the last 10 years, the UN has achieved significant progress, not least in terms of protecting human rights and advancing freedom.  The concept of Responsibility to Protect was adopted at the 2005 UN World Summit, and legal accountability for those involved in genocide was defined with the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court.I believe that we should further strengthen the responsibility to protect in order to prevent the humanitarian crisis our world currently faces from deteriorating further.  Last year, at this very podium, I stressed that sexual violence against women during armed conflicts, whenever or wherever it may have taken place, is unquestionably a violation of human rights and humanism.  This year marks the 15th anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, and the international community should do justice to the occasion by paying greater attention to sexual violence against women in conflict situations.The most compelling reason is the fact that only a few of the victims of brutal sexual violence during World War II are still alive today. Solutions that can bring healing to their hearts need to be devised quickly, while these victims are still alive. The efforts of the UN High Commissioners of Human Rights and Special Rapporteurs on this issue must not be allowed to come to naught.There is no path to unlocking the future, if the past is not acknowledged.   We now hope the spirit of enduring partnership towards humanity that the UN embodies will resonate far and wide so that past wounds can be healed and a new future can unfold.One issue that has attracted great international attention in the realm of human rights realm over the past year is the human rights situation of the DPRK. The report of the Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the DPRK, published last year, called for the active response of the international community to address the North Korean human rights issue.In the wake of the report's release, not only would the UN Human Rights Council and the General Assembly adopt relevant resolutions, but no less than the Security Council would take the issue up for discussion. We once again call on the DPRK to heed the concerns of the international community and start improving the state of human rights.Ladies and Gentlemen,At the UN General Assembly last year, I proposed that a World Eco-Peace Park be built as a space to unfold dreams of peace within the demilitarized zone - the symbol of a divided Korean Peninsula. However, as the recent land mine provocation in the DMZ brought home, the inescapable reality we face is that peace on the Korean Peninsula can be jeopardized in a single moment. Fortunately, the two Koreas managed to reach an agreement on August 25 through high-level talks and are now standing at the juncture pointing to a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation.The impetus for moving this new virtuous cycle forward will come from the faithful implementation of the August 25 accord and fulfillment of concrete steps for reconciliation and cooperation by both Koreas. We must no longer use political and military reasons as excuses for turning a blind eye to humanitarian issues, in particular the reunion of the separated families. I hope we can embark on the path to regaining our common identity as one nation, through the official dialogue and range of exchanges provided for in the August 25 agreement. Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, and fellow delegates,On October 3, a few days from today, the German people will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of their reunification. Just as the UN blessed the birth of the Republic of Korea in 1948, I dream for the day to come soon when the entire world celebrates a unified Korea.Ending the seven-decades-long history of a divided Korean Peninsula - the last remaining vestige of the Cold War - will mark nothing less than a contribution to world peace.Not long ago, the Republic of Korea organized a journey by rail, called the Eurasia Friendship Express, that went through Russia and reached all the way to Europe. Those who took part in the journey came back deeply touched and moved.However, the train couldn't run through the DPRK as the rails there were closed off. I ask all of you here at the UN to lend us your strength so those doors are flung open and the air of peace can suffuse the Korean Peninsula.  A peacefully unified Korea will be a thriving democratic nation free of nuclear weapons and upholding of human rights.What is more, a unified Korean Peninsula, both as a symbol of peace in our global village and a new engine of growth - will contribute greatly to peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and beyond. I hope that the UN and all peace-loving countries will work together so that the ideals of peace and human dignity dreamt of by the UN founders 70 years ago can also be fulfilled through the unification of the Korean Peninsula.  On this grand journey towards a better world, you can rest assured that the Republic of Korea will be a companion that the UN and the international community can count on. Thank you.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has repeatedly said he is not interested in South Korean politics, but he is still the most favored among potential candidates for the 2017 presidential election.In April, Ban said he wants to spend time taking care of his grandchildren after his retirement. It remains unclear whether the U.N. chief can realize his simple dream as he could be at the center of South Korean politics in the coming years. A latest poll showed that the former South Korean foreign minister received 21.1 percent of public support as a possible candidate for the presidential election.The leaders of South Korea's ruling and opposition parties trailed far behind Ban, with 14.1 and 11.2 percent, respectively, according to the survey conducted by polling agency TNS Korea. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.The survey result came as Ban and South Korean President Park Geun-hye exchanged public messages in support of each other at the U.N.Park has unveiled her commitment to making contributions to the sustainable development agenda and the U.N. climate change conference, the two major issues pushed by Ban.Park also attended an informal working lunch Ban hosted to build momentum in leading up to the climate conference meant to produce a new legally binding deal cut the heat-trapping gases. (Yonhap)Meanwhile, Ban hosted a closed-door banquet in Park's honor at his official residence soon after Park arrived in New York for the U.N. General Assembly on Friday.The two met each other on several occasions during the U.N.sessions. In the session on South Korea's ""Saemaeul Movement,"" or new community movement, Ban said he was moved as U.N. member states adopted and carried out the movement for the first time in the history of the U.N.The initiative -- launched by Park's father, then-President Park Chung-hee, in the 1970s -- is credited with helping modernize the then-rural South Korean economy.Ban also said the Saemaeul Movement spread in countries ranging from Asia to Africa ""like a forest fire.""He also expressed gratitude to Park for sharing South Korea's development know-how with developing countries.Park smiled and clapped her hands after Ban's speech and told him ""thanks"" in Korean.Ban also vowed to assist in efforts to promote peace and the development of inter-Korean relations, a key agenda of Park.The apparent rapport between the two leaders and Ban's active support of Park in the U.N. may rekindle the rumor of Ban's possible candidacy, despite his objection to getting involved in South Korea's domestic politics.Ban's second five-year term at the U.N. is set to end at the end of 2016, a year before South Koreans go to the polls to elect a new president who will replace Park.Park's single five-year term ends in early 2018, and by law, she cannot seek re-election.

An artist's rendering of KF-X fighter jet. (Yonhap)   The defense acquisition agency ""is now preparing documents to be handed in to Cheong Wa Dae,"" the official said.    The Air Force acquisition project, Korean Fighter Experimental (KF-X), has come under fire after findings that the U.S. did not allow exports of four major technologies promised for the South Korean project in a decision made in April.    Under the project to build homegrown combat jets, DAPA agreed with Lockheed Martin to obtain 25 kinds of fighter jet technologies from the U.S. firm in a sideline deal clinched when DAPA purchased 40 F-35A combat planes a year earlier.    Including the more than 8 trillion won ($6.7 billion) expected for research and development, the project is presumed to cost nearly 18 trillion won to produce the new fleet of 120 combat jets.    Earlier this week, DAPA belatedly confirmed that the U.S.government refused to grant export licenses on four of the 25 Lockheed Martin technologies promised last year on account of the country's technology protection policy.    Final export permission on the rest of the 21 technologies is also pending at the U.S. Department of State although DAPA said they are sure to win the approval.      The announcement increased skepticism over the fate of the much-trumpeted project, with South Korea missing the four essential technologies, including those on integrating active electronically scanned array radar and other sensors into fighter jets' mission computers.    The KF-X project was launched to replace 120 aging units among the Air Force's some 400 combat planes with locally made aircraft starting in 2025.   The focus of the presidential probe will reportedly focus on the background of DAPA's unsuccessful transaction with Lockheed Martin, as well as the design of the KF-X project.   ""We plan to draw up related documents and submit them to Cheong Wa Dae today,"" a DAPA official said.

""The ultimate goal of change is to make it possible for companies to hire young people without worrying about more personnel outlays.""He claimed that the move to extend the retirement age to 60 starting in 2016 and rigid systems of employment and pay have undermined the ability of companies to hire new workers. ""Companies have either refrained from hiring new people or only recruit irregular workers,"" the policymaker said.The latest agreement, however, could make it easier for companies to dismiss under-performing workers and alter the rule of employment, which may be disadvantageous to employees. Such changes could make it possible to hire new workers.It also outlines measures that can tackle the non-regular workers issue and bolster unemployment benefits and the country's social security net.According to the government and management, greater labor market flexibility can create more openings for young people, who have been hurt by a drop in the number of regular jobs. The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 8 percent in August, much higher than the 3.4 percent for the country as a whole.The deal, which needs to be approved by lawmakers, also aims to promote the government-initiated wage peak system, which calls for workers nearing retirement age to accept cuts in pay with the money saved by this arrangement to be used to hire new employees.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, said the National Assembly should support the agreement by passing related laws, with management and labor taking steps to expand employment and labor market flexibility. For its part, the government will invest resources to strengthen the country's social security net, he said.The finance minister further said that the government is committed to supporting programs that link school studies with practical skills that can help young people secure jobs.Choi's visit to Busan is part of the government's determined push to improve employment conditions for young people.

Park and Tusk also shared their views on North Korea’s nuclear ambition, condemning Pyongyang for its development of nuclear and ballistic missile programs. They also urged North Korea to return to the long-stalled six-party talks.“(The leaders) called on the DPRK (North Korea) to cease all related activities immediately as required by the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions,” according to a joint press statement released after their summit. “They called on the DPRK to fully comply with its obligations under the relevant U.N. Council resolutions and to refrain from any further provocation.” South Korean President Park Geun-hye and European Council President Donald Tusk shake hands Tuesday after their joint news conference at Cheong Wa Dae. (Yonhap)After the talks, the presidents held a joint press conference followed by dinner.Tusk arrived in Korea on Monday for a three-day visit including a trip to the demilitarized zone.The last Korea-EU summit was held in November 2013 during Park’s visit to Brussels, Belgium. This is the first meeting between Park and Tusk, who assumed his post last year.Cheong Wa Dae explained that the talks with EU were all the more significant following her visit to China earlier this month and ahead of Park’s visit to the U.S. in her third year in office to further strengthen ties with the world’s major power.EU is Korea’s largest foreign investor and third-largest trade partner. While it is customary for the European Commission president to join such high-level summits, Cheong Wa Dae explained that the current chief Jean-Claude Juncker could not attend due to his inevitable schedule. His place was taken by Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade.“South Korea is the only country that has signed all three major treaties with the EU on politics, economy and global security. The summit talks are expected to pave the way for the two sides to upgrade their relations to a higher level,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said on condition of customary anonymity.Korea and the EU signed the Framework Agreement in 2010, a free trade agreement in 2010 and the Framework Agreement for the Participation of Korea in EU Crisis Management Operations last year.During the talks, both sides also agreed to explore ways to improve investment norms, considering that the FTA does not include provisions on investment protection, according to the statement.The crisis management treaty is currently awaiting the National Assembly’s ratification. When it goes into effect, Korea and EU are expected to cooperate on global security issues including antipiracy measures.The presidential office also underscored EU’s efforts to address North Korea’s human rights problems while maintaining dialogue with the reclusive regime.

(Yonhap)Some 10 key officials from each side voted in favor of the draft plans that aim to enhance the social safety net, tackle the widening income gap and discrimination against nonregular workers, increase market flexibility and revamp the overall wage system. The trilateral committee will be extended by a year to Sept. 18 next year to discuss further steps.“I ask the members of the National Assembly to put aside partisan interests and support the agreed upon deal for it to be legislated,” Kim Dae-wan, a head of the trilateral committee, said at the meeting. President Park has set labor market reform as the top priority on her policy agenda in the second half of the year, viewing increased market flexibility as key to generating jobs for the young and reviving the slowing economy.The government has vowed to implement the reforms within this year, even without workers’ approval as the tripartite committee’s negotiations were bogged down.In an effort to “share the pain” from the labor market reforms, President Park is planning to set up a social fund in the near future to boost opportunities for the young to enter the labor force, Cheong Wa Dae said. Park will be the first to donate to the fund, it added.The government-backed fund will receive voluntary donations from the public and be used to fund programs including training for young jobseekers to start their own businesses.After the breakthrough -- still opposed by staunch labor unionists -- the Federation of Korea Trade Unions head Kim called on the government and business bloc to make efforts to resolve the social polarization and dispel workers’ concerns. The nation’s largest union umbrella group approved the deal at a central executive committee meeting Monday. Park Byoung-won, head of the Korea Employer’s Federation, welcomed the deal, but the group also expressed regret over the “low” level of market reforms. “The FKTU’s victim mentality placed the three-way talks in trouble, but I thank the FKTU head for reaching an agreement,” he said. “The business bloc will prove that employers will not abuse the guidelines.”Five key employers’ groups said in a statement that it would file a petition with the National Assembly to achieve more drastic market reforms for the sake of “economic recovery.”Meanwhile, the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, the second-largest and more militant of the top two union umbrella groups, vowed all-out war against what it called the “collusion” among the representatives of labor, business and government. (Yonhap)Han Sang-kyoon, head of the KCTU, and 20 other key officials from the union, shaved their heads in protest earlier in the day, blasting the tripartite committee for using laborers to meet capitalists’ demands. The KCTU is set to declare an all-out strike Saturday.The government’s push for the labor market reforms faced a number of stumbling blocks before its landmark compromise, with the labor circle fiercely protesting its plan to ease restrictions on layoffs and change of company rules without union consent. Since the three-way dialogue kicked off on Dec. 23 last year, more than 120 meetings took place to seek a compromise. Under the agreement, the government will establish administrative guidelines designed to ease restrictions for employers to dismiss underperforming workers and change company rules without union approval.In an apparent attempt to contain the workers’ concerns, the committee stipulated in the draft plan that the government should sufficiently consult with the labor and business blocs when employing measures to overhaul the labor market.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","weekend to ease labor restrictions ,labor market reforms president park ,tuesday thanked the workers for ,reviving the slowing economy ,businesses for easier employment conditions","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Dae - wan', 'Park', 'Park', 'the Federation of Korea Trade Unions', 'Kim', 'Park Byoung - won', 'the Korea Employer ’s Federation', 'the National Assembly', 'the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Sang - kyoon', 'KCTU', 'KCTU', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36657828  0.62424845

The two Koreas last held family reunions in February 2014.Hundreds of thousands of Koreans remain separated since the Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.Family reunions are a pressing humanitarian issue on the Korean Peninsula, as most of the separated family members are in their 70s and 80s, and wish to see their long-lost relatives before they die.There are no direct means of contact between ordinary civilians of the two countries that remain divided by a heavily fortified border.On Monday, North Korea vowed to launch a series of satellites as part of its space development program.There is speculation that North Korea may launch a long-range rocket in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.It remains unclear whether North Korea's possible rocket launch could have any influence on the planned family reunions.North Korea claims that its satellite launches are a peaceful project for science and economic development, calling it a sovereign right.Still, South Korea and the United States view the satellite launches as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under a U.N. resolution.Also Tuesday, Park hailed a recent landmark compromise reached among labor, management and the government to ease labor restrictions.The deal would allow companies, among other things, to dismiss workers who are either negligent or underperforming. Currently, companies can terminate an employee's contract only when they are involved in either a corruption or an embezzlement case. Firms are also permitted to lay off a number of workers should they face serious financial difficulty.Park vowed to ensure that easier job dismissals would not be imposed on workers as she called on companies to make efforts to create jobs and revitalize the economy.She also announced a plan to establish a fund that helps create jobs for young people, An Chong-bum, the senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, told reporters after the Cabinet meeting. He did not elaborate.The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 8 percent in August, down from 9.4 percent a month earlier and the lowest level since October last year. The slight improvement came as students can find part-time jobs during the summer break.

Won Hye-young asked the minister if Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in their summit to ""cooperate"" on the reunification of the two Koreas. He was citing an earlier government statement.Yun was equivocal.""Discussions on unification, along with the North Korean nuclear issue, provocation, and peace issues, have been under way naturally on various levels, including the summit between the two sides, since (President Park's) state visit to China in 2013,"" he said. ""The unification matter is in the direction of being discussed in a natural and frank manner.""Yun said it would be impossible to peacefully reunify the two Koreas without denuclearizing the North.He reaffirmed that the government is not seeking any absorption-based unification.Rep. Shin Kyoung-min of the NPAD also took issue with the government's own assessment of the outcome of the latest Park-Xi summit, saying it is ""filled with self-praise"" and diplomatic rhetoric despite no breakthrough in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.In fact, there is no difference from the results of their previous summit two years ago that called for the early resumption of the six-way nuclear talks and the North to refrain from taking provocative acts, he argued. In response, Yun simply said the government's statement on the summit ""considerably reflects the actual content and mood of the summit talks.""Defending Yun from the opposition party's criticism, Rep. Won Yoo-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party said the president bore a lot of fruits through her talks with Xi, including a deal to continue dialogue and cooperation on political, military, economic and security issues.Rep. Lee Ju-young of the ruling party pointed out that Park's decision itself to attend a massive military parade in Beijing drew largely positive public feedback. Many say it has paved the way for South Korea to balance its ties with China and its alliance with the United States. A number of media outlets agreed that Seoul's diplomacy on regional powers has entered a new path.""Nonetheless, we need to continue diplomatic efforts in a calm way, bearing in mind that diplomatic accomplishments tend to come out gradually, rather than immediately, after any summit talks,"" Lee said.Rep. Choi Jae-cheon of the opposition NPAD questioned China's role in bringing lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula.He recalled a 2013 opinion poll by a local private think tank showing 25 percent of Koreans view China as the biggest obstacle to unification, while only 19.1 percent picked North Korea.""We should be very prudent and strategic in treating China as a cooperation partner for peaceful unification,"" Choi said. ""In particular, China is a signatory to the Armistice Agreement.""The minister said China is expected to play a ""constructive role"" in promoting peace on the peninsula.South Korea is leaving the door open for consultations with China and other relevant nations on the issue of eventually replacing the 1953 armistice with a peace treaty, Yun said, adding that there should first be some progress in denuclearization efforts.

In her keynote speech to the Seoul Defense Dialogue, she pointed to what she called the Asian paradox as a threat to global peace -- regional instability stemming from the perennial standoff on the peninsula and persistent territorial and historical spats between neighbors, despite growing economic interdependence. “There have been efforts to promote closer exchanges among the countries in the region with a focus on the economy, but still not in the making is a mechanism for security cooperation that could help tackle tension and establish peace and stability,” Park said. “Today we cannot achieve peace and stability with the efforts of some countries, but only through international cooperation built on trust.” President Park Geun-hye (second from left, front), Defense Minister Han Min-koo (far left, front), Edmond Mulet (far right, front), assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations at the U.N., and other officials take part in the Seoul Defense Dialogue in Seoul on Wednesday.

The drive is in line with its Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative, a long-term confidence-building process among neighbors including North Korea, envisioned to deal first with nonpolitical matters and ultimately progress to hard security cooperation.But the division of the peninsula and persistent cross-border threats remain the biggest stumbling block, highlighted once again by a recent flare-up in tension. “A unification of the two Koreas will mark a fundamental solution to North Korea’s nuclear and human rights problems, end the history of the Cold War in the 20th century and provide a groundbreaking growth engine for global prosperity by making it possible to link Northeast Asia and Eurasia,” Park added, calling for multinational security cooperation to realize the vision. Defense Minister Han Min-koo delivers welcoming remarks at the opening ceremony of the Seoul Defense Dialogue in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Launched by the Defense Ministry in 2012, the vice-ministerial conference brought together Some 250 senior defense policymakers, military executives and academics from around 30 countries and four international agencies for a three-day run. Under the theme, “70 years of the Post-WWII Era and the Division of Korea,” the participants will explore the prospect of the peninsula’s unification and its potential impact on regional security, as well as unabated historical and territorial tensions in Northeast Asia and ways to defuse them.They are also forecast to analyze emerging cybersecurity challenges and the outlook for global cooperation, while addressing constant regional maritime conflicts such as over islands in the East China and South China Seas, exclusive economic zones, continental shelf delineation, and air defense zones.“Reunification would set the conditions for an enduring peace on the peninsula by removing a source of potential regional conflict,” David Helvey, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, said in a speech summary released ahead of the event.“(Following Korean reunification) the emerging security architecture might be a hybrid mechanism designed to promote cooperative solutions to nontraditional or transnational threats existing alongside/on top of a more traditional, self-help and alliance-based architecture for managing hard security adapted to the new realities of Northeast Asian security dynamics.” Lim Jong-in, President Park Geun-hye’s special adviser on security and dean of Korean University’s Graduate School of Information Security, stressed the rising need for states to beef up their cybersecurity capabilities while fostering international cooperation for better responses. “As one of the most serious threats that most states face, cyberthreats are getting more sophisticated and targeted,” he said. “To deter the rapid growth of cyberthreats, it is important for each state to build its own capacities and yet cooperate internationally.” Other attendees include Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong, former Japanese Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto, Edmond Mulet, assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations at the U.N.; and Martin Libicki, a professor at the RAND Graduate School in the U.S. Han Min-koo, Seoul’s defense minister, also delivered an address. Three special sessions are scheduled to take place to discuss defense cooperation for global health security, violent extremism, and nuclear nonproliferation, respectively. On the sidelines, working-level officials from the 30 countries plan to hold separate talks on cybersecurity, while another meeting on Northeast Asia will bring together six countries -- South Korea, the U.S., China, Japan, Russia and Mongolia.

So it was ironic that Roh pushed to abolish sasi, the nationwide test open to anyone regardless of educational background. His move was said to be aimed at rooting out academic elitism by spreading out the pool of would-be litigators, as sasi passers tended to come from top echelons of schools, creating a cartel of their own.During Roh’s presidency in 2007, the National Assembly passed legislation that allowed universities to establish law schools, and to replace sasi with a U.S.-style bar exam for which only law school graduates could apply. Accordingly, sasi will officially be phased out after 2017. The first enrollment of law schools began in 2009 and there are now some 25 law schools nationwide.Sasi, a mixture of words sabeob (judicial) and siheom (exam) in Korean, dates back to 1947. Called with different names throughout the decades, it involved three steps -- a written multiple-choice test, an essay and eventually an interview. Those who passed all three stages were enrolled into the Judicial Research and Training Institute for two years. Upon graduating from the institute, they moved onto becoming prosecutors or lawyers. The entire process, especially in preparing for sasi, was notoriously grueling and lengthy, with candidates spending years dedicated to the exam with a 3 percent acceptance rate.Now, with some 15 months left until the official expiry of sasi, public debate has refused to subside over whether the abolishment will serve its original purpose, or rather create a different type of hierarchy.Sasi proponents, including the Korean Bar Association claim that the exam is a constitutionally-protected system that grants people equal opportunities to become a legal professional. They argue that expensive law schools will further limit opportunities, while at the same time bombard the market with an excessive number of lawyers. They cite some 3,354 licensed lawyers who are out of work as of July this year.“As long as you get admitted to law schools, you can expect about 75 percent of the graduates to pass the exam, which is even higher than the drivers’ license exam. I think it is absurd,” said Na Seung-chul, a lawyer and advocate of sasi. The law stipulates that the ratio of those who pass the exam to those who enter law schools should not be below 75 percent.He also noted that sasi’s low 3 percent acceptance rate is quite normal when compared to other state-run exams such as for the civil service. The rate was 1.7 percent in 2015 for the Seoul City civil servants exam. Advocacy group protests over the repeal of Sa shi, Korean traditional bar exam. YonhapIn their argument, the sasi takers have filed a petition with the Constitutional Court and proposed a “happy medium” by offering multiple gateways to become a lawyer by either passing the bar exam after graduating law school or simply passing sasi.“Under current law, those without a college degree cannot apply for law schools to become lawyers. It means they are banned from becoming prosecutors and judges because it requires a lawyer’s license. … Abolishing sasi therefore is an outright violation of freedom to choose jobs and assume public posts,” said Kwon Min-sik, a representative of the advocacy group. Some lawmakers have also come to the fore to uphold sasi, including ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Oh Seung-hwan, who won this year’s by-election under the slogan of protecting the system.He and four other lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties have proposed similar bills, which are still pending at the Assembly.Those in support of abolishing sasi, on the other hand, claim that the bar exam was an outdated system that undercut the government’s efforts to overhaul the nation’s lawyer recruiting system. They argue that sasi supporters are trying to hold onto their vested interests.Instead, the law school proponents contend that the new legislation paves the way for quality legal services by tapping into diverse academic experience of law school graduates, whose undergraduate background is more diverse than traditional sasi test-takers who usually only study law during their undergraduate years.“Law schools allow us to foster legal minds through a comprehensive education process, instead of a one-time test,” said Oh Soo-geun, president of Ewha Law School and the head of Korean Association of Law School. The new system also puts an end to time-consuming preparation and low acceptance rate as law school admission assesses the applicants’ overall academic ability, such as GPA or language skills, and is more likely to foster lawyers tailored for practical cases such as in medical and engineer fields, Oh said.Dismissing the rags-to-riches story that sasi had once promised as a myth, he asserted that the burden has become unrealistic for students to bear in preparing for the test, financially and time-wise.“Considering the odds of passing the test are incredibly low, the test is no longer a viable option for those have-nots who seek to purse a legal career.”He said it was noteworthy that economics and liberal arts professors welcome the decision to repeal sasi the most.“Since the law school’s bar exam is more of a license exam that entails a robust curriculum, we expect more students to focus on their own majors during undergraduate years and to think hard about whether they are fit to be a lawyer in the future.”The debate is expected to persist, further stoked recently by a series of allegations involving senior lawmakers, who reportedly pulled strings to secure jobs at prestigious law firms for their children, who happened to be law school graduates.Sasi advocates immediately referred to the cases as an indication that law schools will fall far short of curbing elitism and class society.Public opinion also remains largely split, with a recent survey conducted by Realmeter showing 61.3 percent of 500 respondents saying sasi should be retained. Another survey conducted by the Seoul Shinmum on 16 lawmakers belonging to the Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee showed that nine of them reserved their position on the calls to keep sasi. Four said they supported the move, while three opposed it.The remaining parliamentary session this year is considered critical for the final fate of sasi, as six bills related to maintaining the system are likely to be automatically discarded if not voted on within the year, as the political parties are set to be largely preoccupied next year with the upcoming general election.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","south korea late president ,farmer son with high school ,south korea late president roh ,korea late president ,korea late president roh moo","['South Korea ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Korean', 'Roh', 'the National Assembly', 'Sasi', 'Korean', 'the Judicial Research and Training Institute', 'the Korean Bar Association', 'Na Seung - chul', 'Seoul City', 'korean', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Kwon Min - sik', 'Saenuri Party', 'Oh Seung - hwan', 'Assembly', 'Ewha Law School', 'Korean Association of Law School', 'GPA', 'the Seoul Shinmum', 'the Assembly ’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61057866  0.76060712

South Korea will initiate various discussions “in the near future” on how to bring about the peninsula’s unification, Park said, adding that the issue was also the focal point of her summit with President Xi Jinping last week. “We agreed to work together for a peaceful unification of the peninsula,” she told reporters on her return flight Friday from China. Rallying behind China for its unification with North Korea is imperative to the South, given Beijing’s “blood” ties with Pyongyang forged during the 1950-53 Korean War, its still formidable sway over peninsula issues, and persistent concerns about a sudden contingency that may spark a refugee crisis along their border. By taking part in the war victory celebration -- where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was conspicuously absent -- and the massive military parade that Western powers particularly shied away from, Park may be able to help secure Xi’s support for her unification drive, some experts say. “Park’s presence alongside Xi (during the military parade) is less about Park being snared by Beijing than it is about Park pressing to consolidate China’s support for Korean unification in the context of unprecedentedly weak ties between Beijing and Pyongyang,” Scott Snyder, director of the U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, wrote in his commentary.“To fill the space left by Kim Jong-un’s absence is, for South Korea, an important step toward gaining Beijing’s blessing for the holy grail of Korean unification that Seoul has sought for over two decades. In this respect, Park’s presence may be perceived less as a big catch for Xi than a lure through which Seoul hopes to finally hook Beijing.”  President Park Geun-hye (left), Chinese President Xi Jinping (right), Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders and high-level officials from around the world observe a massive military parade in Beijing on Thursday to mark the 70th anniversary of the victory in World War II. (AFP-Yonhap)Another apparent booster for her unification campaign is a recent breakthrough in rare high-level inter-Korean talks that pulled the old foes from the brink of an armed clash. Among the major feats are their agreements to hold formal talks to improve their relations in Seoul or Pyongyang “at an early date” and working-level dialogue Monday to arrange reunions of separated families in time for the upcoming Chuseok holidays.Park is also expected to raise the issue and solicit support during a planned summit with U.S. President Barack Obama next month. Yet Park’s “unification preparation” plan has hardly fleshed out nearly two years after its introduction, with a fresh, realistic vision lost, and priorities and action plans remaining in the shadow. The drive was unwrapped in Park’s New Year address last year as the centerpiece of her second-year presidency. Unification would bring a “bonanza” to all Koreans and an opportunity for the nation to take a great economic leap forward, she said. In the former East German city of Dresden two months later, she laid out a three-point proposal that was supposed to be a guideline for her agenda -- to the dismay of many observers who had anticipated out-of-the-box ideas she had been trumpeting. The Park administration has since been ramping up the initiative, ratifying a unification law to set up a legal and institutional framework and launching a presidential panel on unification preparation. The North, nonetheless, gave the cold shoulder to most of her Dresden offers, including the establishment of inter-Korean cooperative offices and greater expansion of humanitarian, financial and infrastructure support.Seoul, for its part, triggered controversy after dealing poorly with the remarks early this year by a vice president of the presidential committee that the organization had installed a team to work for unification by absorption. Though Park may be credited with ensuring China’s support for unification, their consultations will likely be confined to fundamental reaffirmations, rather than in-depth planning, at least for the time being, experts say. The Kim Jong-un regime could also upend the burgeoning reconciliatory mood, such as by staging major provocations for next month’s anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party. “Red Cross talks scheduled for next week may break down, if they are held at all. Inter-Korean family reunions could be upstaged by a future North Korean provocation, in the form of a missile launch or a nuclear test,” Snyder at the CFR noted. To attract a security-anxious Pyongyang to the negotiating table, Seoul should focus on ways to rev up economic cooperation instead of “hasty discussions” on unification, said Cheong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy research at the Sejong Institute. “As the Kim regime has condemned Park’s North Korea policies as being confrontational aimed at isolating and crushing it to death through collaboration with outside forces, it may likely view Park’s latest remarks in the same frame and break down the dialogue,” he said. “While talks with other countries remain crucial for a future unification, the first and foremost thing is direct, formal dialogue between the two Koreas. When they are struggling to escape the standoff, I doubt how much understanding and support for unification it will be able to draw from neighbors.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","flight friday from china rallying ,parade in beijing on thursday ,to finally hook beijing president ,friday from china rallying ,friday from china rallying behind","['Park Geun', 'China', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'Xi Jinping', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Park', 'Xi', 'Xi', 'Beijing', 'China', 'korean', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Scott Snyder', 'the Council on Foreign Relations', 'Washington', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'Xi', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park Geun - hye', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Beijing', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Park', 'Park', 'Koreans', 'east german', 'Dresden', 'Dresden', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Red Cross', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'snyder', 'CFR', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'the Sejong Institute', 'Kim', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Koreas', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50253868  0.50598079

Over the past week, the North has made a series of statements to deny its responsibility for the land mine provocation and downplay its expression of regret over the detonation in the Aug. 25 agreement.Hours after the agreement, Hwang Pyong-so, director of the North’s military’s General Political Bureau, argued that South Korea’s claim about the mine blast was “groundless.” Seoul did not respond to it, regarding it as part of the North’s propaganda activities for the domestic audience.On Wednesday, the unnamed spokesperson of the North’s National Defense Commission said that its expression of the regret in the bilateral agreement was not the North’s acceptance of responsibility, but an expression to console the wounded South Korean troops. Despite the exchange of barbs, the inter-Korean relations are not going to further deteriorate, analysts said, noting that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs to improve cross-border relations to break his country’s isolation and find a way to improve its economy.Meanwhile, Seoul is stepping up its diplomacy to strengthen coordination with the U.S. and China to address North Korea issues, a senior Seoul official told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.Seoul’s top nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kook plans to visit the U.S. next week to meet with his U.S. counterpart Sung Kim. A senior Chinese official will also visit Seoul next week to discuss North Korea’s nuclear issues.The agenda for their talks is expected to include deterring North Korea’s potential provocations around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party.Based on its analysis of commercial satellite imagery, 38 North, a research website run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said that it was not yet possible to determine whether Pyongyang would conduct any launch soon.The website noted that recent imagery showed construction at the vertical engine test stand that would allow the testing of larger, more capable rocket engines was proceeding rapidly. But it said that the work was unrelated to the question of whether the North will conduct a new launch in the near future.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea friday for criticizing president ,friday for criticizing president park ,friday for criticizing president ,north korea friday for criticizing ,for criticizing president park geun","['unification Ministry', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun', 'chinese', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'China', 'Unification Ministry', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang ’s Committee', 'Fatherland', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'North Korea ’s', 'Beijing', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'General Political Bureau', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'the North ’s National Defense Commission', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Joon - kook', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Sung Kim', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'North', 'the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Sang - ho']",19,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.19811371  0.56571668

(Yonhap)A key outcome of Wednesday's summit between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was an agreement to hold a trilateral meeting with their Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, potentially representing a significant step toward improving ties among the regional powers mired in history and territorial disputes.Park and Xi agreed during their summit talks in Beijing to hold the trilateral meeting at a ""mutually convenient time, including at the end of October or the beginning of November, in South Korea,"" according to a statement by Cheong Wa Dae, Park's office.The announcement was no major surprise as it was widely reported that South Korea -- as chair of the trilateral cooperation process -- was pushing to host the forum before the end of the year.With the plan now made official, all three countries are expected to step up efforts to arrange the summit that was last held in May 2012.China has been locked in a territorial dispute with Japan over control of the Senkaku Islets, among other issues, while South Korea has refused to hold a one-on-one summit with Japan unless Abe takes sincere steps to address the grievances of Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II.According to Cheong Wa Dae, Xi expressed thanks to Park for her ""active efforts"" to normalize trilateral cooperation.For South Korea, a trilateral meeting will set the stage for a bilateral summit with Abe in a way that least offends South Koreans who still resent the neighboring country for its brutal colonial rule from 1910-45.Seoul and Tokyo have come under growing pressure from Washington to mend fences as the U.S. seeks to bolster trilateral cooperation with its two Asian allies, in part to keep a rising China in check.China's position on the trilateral summit had been more cautious until recently, indicating that Xi's consent may have been a result of South Korea's diplomatic efforts.Experts noted a possible shift in the regional diplomatic landscape.""The fact that South Korea-China ties are becoming closer than ever may mark the beginning of a new alignment in the current 'southern triangle' versus 'northern triangle' format,"" said a diplomatic source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. South Korea, U.S. and the Japan form the ""southern triangle,"" while North Korea, China and Russia comprise the ""northern triangle.""He stressed, however, that trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and Japan will remain the mechanism safeguarding South Korea.On North Korea, arguably the most important agenda item in the Park-Xi talks, they reaffirmed their close partnerships. They agreed to continue joint efforts for the resumption of ""meaningful six-way talks"" on the North's nuclear program, said Cheong Wa Dae.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un presides over a recent party meeting. (Yonhap)Park and her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held a summit for the sixth time Wednesday with a focus on joint efforts to address North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and provocations, reaffirming prolonged diplomatic tensions between Beijing and its traditional ally, Pyongyang.The reclusive state sent Choe Ryong-hae, a secretary of its ruling Workers’ Party, to attend China’s World War II victory ceremony Thursday. Yet, Choe’s visit only highlighted the current status of the relationship between the two allies, which they used to tout as being “forged in blood,” observers noted.After recent moves by Washington to normalize its ties with Tehran and Havana, Pyongyang’s isolation has been further magnified, which experts say might have put more pressure on the North to seek improved ties with the outside world, particularly its southern neighbor.Last month, Pyongyang offered Seoul a rare expression of regret over the Aug. 4 land mine blast in the DMZ, and agreed to hold government-level talks to address cross-border relations and to arrange the reunions of separated families. These moves were seen as a strategic decision by the North to break its isolation, which analysts say could, otherwise, damage Kim’s legitimacy as a competent ruler when Kim’s drive to shore up the economy has yet to yield any significant progress.“Pyongyang’s moves to disentangle relations with Seoul are in connection with its efforts to escape from its current isolation. Should it not improve relations with the South, it would be difficult for the North to normalize ties with the U.S. and Japan as well,” said Koh Yoo-hwan, North Korea expert at Seoul’s Dongguk University.“The North’s current relationship with China isn’t good enough for Kim to travel to Beijing to celebrate the victory event with a smile on his face. But I think after the event, Pyongyang would likely move to improve relations with China, its most important economic partner.”Park’s sixth summit with Xi underlined the increasingly closer bilateral relationship, in stark contrast to the absence of any summit between Xi and Kim of North Korea.Apparently expressing its discomfort over their summit, the North’s powerful National Defense Commission issued a statement saying that the South should refrain from “words and actions” that could dampen the mood for improving cross-border relations.The deterioration in relations between Beijing and Pyongyang appears to have been caused by a series of North Korea’s provocative acts that it pushed ahead despite Beijing’s admonitions.Since Xi was elected as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee in November 2012, the North has conducted a third nuclear test, tested ballistic missiles and engaged in other provocative actions, pushing the limit of his patience, analysts said.With the international community pressuring China to play a role as a “responsible stakeholder” in regional security, Beijing has, in recent years, been seen taking a tough stance over North Korea’s actions to destabilize the region.Any instability stemming from North Korea’s provocations could impede Beijing’s efforts to address domestic issues including income disparity, regional development gaps and political corruption, among others. China’s massive campaign to link it with the world through railroads and ship routes could also be hampered by Pyongyang’s destabilizing activities, observers noted.Above all, the most effective way for the North to address its isolation is to improve inter-Korean relations, analysts said. But they noted that the North might continue a somewhat hostile stance toward the South until after Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling party.“At least until Oct. 10, the North could continue to focus on strengthening national unity under its signature national mottos of self-reliance and dignity, and under the military-first principle,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification.“Yet, the North might continue to agonize over the way forward ... the way for it to lift itself out of its diplomatic and economic backwater. This could raise the prospect of the North pushing for dialogue with the outside world.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","trip to china this week ,recent party meeting yonhap park ,prolonged diplomatic tensions between beijing ,workers party to attend china ,over recent party meeting yonhap","['Park Geun', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'North Korea ’s', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'Workers ’ Party', 'China', 'Washington', 'Tehran', 'Havana', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'DMZ', 'Kim', 'Kim ’s', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Koh Yoo - hwan', 'North Korea', 'Seoul ’s Dongguk University', 'North ’s', 'China', 'Kim', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Xi', 'Xi', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'National Defense Commission', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'Beijing', 'Xi', 'the Chinese Communist Party ’s Central Committee', 'China', 'Beijing', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Beijing ’s', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification', 'Song Sang - ho']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4033713   0.42782134

We should open the door wide for their exchanges starting with this forthcoming session.”  President Park Geun-hye speaks at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday at Cheong Wa Dae. (Yonhap)The marathon negotiations salvaged the peninsula from the verge of an armed clash. Seoul officials have been trumpeting the six-point accord as a milestone enshrining Pyongyang’s apology for a recent border land mine attack and steps to ward off a relapse, despite lingering controversy over its interpretation. While pledging to focus on cranking up the economy and reform plans such as on labor, education and finance, Park praised the 86 young soldiers who had requested to delay their discharge from the military as cross-border tension hit new highs.Despite the diminishing strain, Vice Defense Minister Baek Seung-joo remained adamant that the latest fence-mending dialogue could rather boost the rationale for the Kim Jong-un regime to press ahead with a major provocation to coincide with its planned celebration of the 70th anniversary of the launch of the ruling Workers’ Party on Oct. 10. “The possibility that the North will stage a strategic provocation such as a long-range ballistic missile launch or nuclear test has increased somewhat since the agreement,” Baek said in an interview with Kyodo News. “That’s because many people say that the agreement left North Korea with egg on its face,” he added, vowing to employ “all retaliatory steps including a restart of propaganda broadcasts” along the Demilitarized Zone in the event of a provocation. His unrefined choice of words aside, the remarks sparked controversy as they run counter to the burgeoning mood for long-awaited reconciliation and do not reflect the overall government assessment, Defense Ministry officials said. The October event remains set to be a barometer for future inter-Korean ties -- and the core of the recent breakthrough. The possibility of a provocation was initially floated by Defense Minister Han Min-koo months ago but Seoul officials appear to have been refraining from making comments that potentially provoke Pyongyang. Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok sought to downplay Baek’s remarks, saying they were not from “high-level intelligence” but meant to be a “general statement” based on outside experts.

Park will hold a summit with Xi on Wednesday in Beijing, a day before she attends a military parade marking the end of World War II. Asked whether Park and Xi would send a ""strong message"" about the denuclearization of North Korea, Hwang replied, ""There will be in-depth discussions with the Chinese side."" South Korea has asked China to exercise more leverage in getting North Korea to change its course on its nuclear weapons program and return to the negotiating table. But North Korea has shown no signs of giving up its nuclear ambitions. China is North Korea's economic lifeline, but it has been reluctant to use leverage over the ally because it could lead to the North's collapse and instability on its border. The six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program, involving the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan, have been stalled since late 2008. Diplomatic efforts to revive the multilateral talks have produced no results so far. North Korea conducted its third and most powerful nuclear test in 2013.

It will be their sixth summit since she entered the office in early 2013. (Yonhap)“The leaders will intensively discuss ways to bolster the bilateral relationship, and also on the Korean Peninsula and regional security,” said Ju at a press briefing.Park‘s trip is expected to highlight her efforts to address North Korea’s evolving nuclear threat and secure a delicate balance amid the intensifying rivalry between Beijing and Washington.On Sept. 3, China plans to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its victory, widely seen as a showcase of its growing military strength and its attempt to highlight Japan’s surrender in the war. Many Western leaders, however, remain reluctant, with concerns of the event further stoking Beijing’s rivalry with Japan. Park is the only leader of a U.S.-allied country to make an official announcement to attend the Beijing ceremony. Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe said he would skip the event, citing domestic obligations, which has placed Park in an awkward position and highlighted Japan’s alliance with China’s rival, the U.S.Despite concerns, Park is scheduled to attend a rare parade to be staged at Tiananmen Square, with other leaders including Russian President Vladmir Putin and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also attending.Ju stressed that Park’s decision to attend the parade was made after “much consideration” and taking various factors into account such as bilateral ties between Seoul and Beijing and the growing geographic tensions in Northeast Asia. “We hope to promote peace, harmony and cooperation in Northeast Asia and beyond by setting up a correct perception and evaluation on the past history through the event,” he said.Ju also expressed hopes for Beijing to play a bigger role in the future on resolving North Korea’s nuclear ambition and on achieving a peaceful unification of the two Koreas.After the meeting with Xi, Park will also hold separate talks with Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang to seek ways to further develop bilateral ties amid growing fears on the volatile regional economy.To strengthen business ties with China, South Korea’s largest trading partner, a large group of business representatives will be accompanying Park on her trip. The two sides will work closely to highlight the need for parliamentary approval for the Korea-China free trade agreement within this year. China is South Korea’s largest trade partner.

(Yonhap)The decision came after a long debate over the plan’s potential environmental impact and economic feasibility. Yangyang residents and the county office argued that the cable car project will not only boost the local economy by bringing nearly 100 billion won ($85 million) of financial benefits, but also offer more diverse travel routes for mountain visitors, especially for the elderly and disabled, who often have difficulty accessing the national park.Environmentalists, however, expressed ecological concerns, claiming that the proposed cable car route went through a natural habitat for various endangered species, especially a type of mountain goat, which is a grade I endangered species. Acknowledging the civic group’s opposition, the national park committee ordered the county office to fulfill seven preconditions ahead of starting the project. This includes strengthening safety rules and measures to support endangered species, mapping out facility monitoring and donating to a forest protection fund. Despite these preconditions, civic groups objected to the approval, arguing that the new proposed route would still affect the natural habitat of the mountain goats. “The approval is not valid as there were some procedural problems,” said the environment groups, urging the environment minister and vice-minister to step down from their posts. They added that they would meet religious groups Monday to discuss how to take action against the government’s decision. Environmentalists have expressed concerns that the government’s decision will motivate other cable car projects being pushed by other local governments. As of now, only three cable car facilities exist in national parks, including the existing Seoraksan cable car, with the latest one constructed at Mount Deogyusan in 1996. Four cities and counties in other regions are currently gearing up to launch their own cable car projects in the national parks. The cable car project on Mount Seoraksan was approved a year after President Park Geun-hye vowed to support the project, as part of the government’s efforts to boost the local economy ahead of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.“I hope that the cable car is pushed as early as possible, by the time the PyeongChang Winter Olympics are held (in 2018),” Park said.The ministry previously rejected the cable car project proposal in 2012 and 2013, citing concerns over the animals’ natural habitats, and over the short distance between the mountain’s main peak and the cable car destination. Under the legal criteria, the location of the destination must be far from the mountain’s peak in order to minimize access of cable car users to areas away from the usual hiking courses. Experiencing two failures, the county changed the route to a location it says is far enough from the natural habitat and distant enough from the mountain peak.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","2018 pyeongchang winter olympics hope ,national park committee on friday ,pyeongchang winter olympics hope that ,the 2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,pyeongchang winter olympics hope","['the Environment Ministry ’s', 'Yangyang County Office of Gangwon Province', 'Mount Seoraksan', 'Mount Seoraksan', 'Gwacheon Government Complex', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'yangyang', 'Seoraksan', 'Park Geun', 'PyeongChang', 'Park', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20944464  0.52276808

""We continue to coordinate closely with the ROK and to reiterate our unwavering support for the alliance.""After days of marathon negotiations, the two Koreas announced a landmark agreement that centered on the South halting anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts in exchange for the North expressing regret over the injuries South Korean soldiers sustained from the explosion of landmines planted by the North.The two sides also agreed to hold more government-to-government talks to move inter-Korean relations forward, organize a round of separate family reunions around Chuseok--a major fall holiday in both Koreas--and seek greater civilian exchanges between the two sides.The agreement capped tensions that had been spiraling since the two sides exchanged artillery fire across their heavily armed border last week, which sparked fears the tensions could escalate out of control and lead to larger military clashes.Kirby said the agreement is significant in itself.""This was obviously a compromise by both sides and again, that's not insignificant all by itself. We hope that it will contribute to decreased tensions and we're going to have to see how it plays out,"" he said.The spokesman also praised the South for remaining ""resolute"" throughout the crisis.""I think the ROK has remained pretty resolute in the face of continued North Korean aggressive actions and rhetoric,"" Kirby said in response to a question on whether the agreement means South Korea has backed down or caved in to North Korean pressure. ""I don't know that I would characterize anything as backing down.

(Yonhap)Park maintained a hard-line stance as the two Koreas continued grueling high-level talks over a recent spate of North Korean attacks at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjeom for the third consecutive day.“The most important things with regard to the talks are North Korea’s apology for recent provocations including the land mine provocation that triggered the current situation,” Park said during a meeting of her senior secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae.“An apology and prevention of a recurrence are needed in order not to repeat (North Korea’s) repetitive provocations and subsequent public angst. (Without an apology), we will take corresponding measures and continue propaganda broadcasts through loudspeakers.”Park, however, noted that her government was doing its best to settle the pending issues with Pyongyang. “Currently, we are in talks with the North to finalize our agreement. As soon as the result comes out, we will clearly explain it to the public,” she said.Her tough stance reaffirmed her repeated vows to break the “vicious circle” of North Korea making provocations to induce a crisis on the peninsula, with South Korea offering concessions to the North to resolve the crisis, only for Pyongyang to make more provocations in pursuit of more rewards.An intense tug-of-war between the two Koreas continued during the cross-border talks that began Saturday and continued for three days, with some breaks in between. Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo represented the South Korean side. Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau, and Kim Yang-gon, a secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party and top official in charge of inter-Korean issues, attended on behalf of the North.The delegations first met at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday at South Korea’s Peace House in the border village and their talks continued until 4:15 a.m. the next day. After an “adjournment,” the talks resumed at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday and continued into Monday.The South Korean delegation demanded that Pyongyang apologize for the Aug. 4 land mine attacks that severely injured two South Korean troops, reprimand those who orchestrated the attacks, and take steps to prevent a recurrence.But the North Korean side has reportedly denied responsibility for the attacks, and urged the South to immediately turn off its propaganda loudspeakers in the border regions. The South resumed the propaganda broadcasts on Aug. 10 for the first time in 11 years in retaliation for the land mine blast. Showing sensitivity to the broadcasts, the North issued a 48-hour ultimatum last Thursday, demanding the loudspeakers be turned off.The North has called the broadcasts a “threat to its (communist) system,” as the broadcasts highlight South Korea’s economic advancement, the benefits of liberal democracy, the importance of human rights and call for the restoration of the divided nation’s homogeneity, among other things.North Korea experts say Pyongyang may regard Seoul’s broadcasts as an affront to its “supreme dignity,” namely North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and that the regime may fear that its people would slowly become more aware of its despotic nature.The ongoing talks apparently delayed the ultimatum and allowed the North to stall for time, observers said.Amid the ongoing marathon talks, hopes also grew that the two sides might try to strike a compromise, which would allow the North to express “regret” without specifying the culprit behind the land mine attacks.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","last thursday demanding the loudspeakers ,korea apology for recent provocations ,hour ultimatum last thursday demanding ,monday the south korean delegation ,amid the ongoing marathon talks","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'south korean', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'north korean', 'General Political Bureau', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'inter - korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Song Sang - ho']",5,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.29730502  0.39609212

Wang Junsheng, an associate professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, also suggested that Park could skip a scheduled military parade, which could highlight a rivalry between China and Japan, during her possible visit to Beijing. Most Western leaders are unlikely to attend the Sept. 3 ceremony hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping because the military parade could send the wrong signal at a time when China is increasingly assertive in its territorial claims in the South China Sea. ""As one of the few ROK leaders who knows the Chinese language and understands Chinese culture, Park has been pushing for the betterment of bilateral ties since taking office two years ago,"" Wang said in an op-ed piece published by the state-run China Daily newspaper. ""Even if she does not attend the Sept. 3 parade, Park's visit to Beijing will be of great importance to regional stability, because if Beijing and Seoul cooperate more closely, Tokyo's neighborhood diplomacy may hardly work. Pyongyang may abandon its rhetoric and act with reason,"" Wang said. The comments by Wang suggested that Park may not attend the morning parade, but attend the afternoon reception on Sept. 3.Park could make a decision on whether to attend China's celebrations as early as later this week, presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters.South Korean diplomats in Beijing have said that Seoul feels awkward about accepting the Chinese invitation for the military parade because of a rivalry between China and Japan amid Beijing's increasingly assertive actions in territorial disputes with its neighbors. Another embarrassing point is that the military parade will be staged at Tiananmen Square, where the Chinese Communist Party crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in a bloody crackdown in 1989, the diplomats said.South Korea and China are former battlefield foes as China fought alongside North Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States and 20 other allied countries fought on South Korea's side under the U.N. flag.

A joint military Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise with the U.S. was also launched for a 12-day run. The military drill has been lambasted by the North, which fears it is a rehearsal for an invasion.“We need to maintain strong military readiness to protect our people’s lives and their properties from North Korea’s provocations and to keep peace on the Korean Peninsula, at a time when military threats posed by North Korea are on the rise,” Park said. President Park Geun-hye speaks at a Cabinet meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday. Cross-border tension is expected to escalate in the coming weeks, following the North’s Aug. 4 land mine attack in the DMZ that injured two South Korean soldiers, and as the North threatens to take military action unless the two allies halt their annual exercise.The South Korean president also praised the injured soldiers, saying they were brave examples of the military’s commitment to serving the nation. She wished the two well and requested officials to take every possible means to treat them and seek ways to honor their actions. Pyongyang has denied its role in the incident, countering Seoul’s announcement that North Korea planted the mines inside the demilitarized zone by illegally crossing the border. Last week, South Korea resumed loudspeaker broadcasts in the Demilitarized Zone, more than 11 years after the two sides halted such psychological tactics in 2004, to protest against Pyongyang’s land mine attack. In apparent retaliation to Seoul’s propaganda program, North Korea on Monday afternoon launched a loudspeaker campaign at the border. “We have learned that North Korean Army has resumed loudspeaker broadcasts at some areas of the eastern border,” said a South Korean Army official.  North Korea on Sunday vowed to retaliate against the U.S. and urged South Korea to halt the joint military exercise if it wants to hold inter-Korean talks.Seoul and Washington, meanwhile, have refuted the North’s claim, saying that the exercise is defensive in nature.South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo and visiting U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Christine E. Wormuth said over the weekend that the combined exercise is meant to protect the region and maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula.Inter-Korean tension has been surging despite initial hopes that the rigid relations would thaw on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of Liberation Day last Saturday.North Korea on Sunday denounced Park’s Liberation Day speech, rejecting her offer of holding reunion events for separated families.The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement that Park’s speech “viciously” slandered the North and that she drove into catastrophe.In her speech, Park had said that Seoul “will sternly deal with any North Korean provocations” that will only further deepen Pyongyang’s isolation and destruction.Seoul’s Unification Ministry, in return, expressed strong regret over the North’s statement, urging it to return to dialogue.“The government strongly condemns North Korea for making the preposterous argument that the recent mine incident is a fabricated slander against the North,” the ministry said in a statement.“The North should discard its irresponsible manner, which betrays the historical significance of Liberation Day. … We once again urge the North to alleviate military tension, build trust and head for peaceful unification as proposed by the South through dialogue and cooperation,” it added.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)(photo: Yonhap)","north korea on sunday vowed ,north korea on sunday denounced ,to kill south korean soldiers ,official north korea on sunday ,korea on sunday denounced park","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Cabinet', 'Ulchi', 'Ulchi Freedom Guardian', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'DMZ', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'north korean Army', 'south korean Army', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'south korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'U.S.', 'Defense for Policy', 'Christine E.

It said such behavior caused shock and outrage among the people. The DPRK is North Korea's official name.The committee in charge of handling inter-Korean affairs said that Park is responsible for causing the worse deterioration in cross-border relations in history and challenged the North's integrity and governing system by talking about ""purges"" and ""provocation.""""Instead of atoning for bringing about the current state of affair Park caused more problems by her ludicrous statements,"" it said.The CPRK then warned that Park will pay dearly for her actions.It said calls for family reunions, the creation of a Peace Park within the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries and more sports and cultural exchanges were all blatant attempts to fool people.The committee then said that Park's stance can only be interpreted as a political provocation and a declaration of war.It said that if Seoul really wants peace and an easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, it must stop its joint military exercise with the United States that can only be seen as a move to invade the North.South Korea is set to kickoff the Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG) exercise this week, which North Korea says must be halted if meaningful talks are to take place.The exercise has been held annually since the 1970s, with North Korea routinely denouncing it as war preparations against it.Related to the UFG, Pyongyang's National Defense Commission warned that it will take tough military action if Seoul and Washington go through with the military maneuvers that start Monday.In response, the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command made clear that the exercise is aimed at maintaining stability on the peninsula and was planned well in advance and the number of troops is no larger than it has been in the past.The U.S. will have some 30,000 troops on the ground, while Seoul will employ 50,000.South Korea's military said that the UFG will take into account possible provocations by the North.""If the North engages in aggression, the South will respond in a firm manner,"" Adm. Choi Yun-hee, chairman of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said.

Lee Maeng-hee (Yonhap)The elder Lee, also the father of CJ Group Chairman Lee Jae-hyun, passed away at a hospital in Beijing where he was being treated for lung cancer that had spread to other parts of his body, said a CJ group official. The elder Lee ""passed away from a chronic disease at a hospital in Beijing as of 9:39 a.m. (Beijing time),"" the CJ official said. Another CJ official in Beijing said no funeral date has been set yet. Samsung Group founder Lee Byung-chull had three sons, including Maeng-hee and Kun-hee, and five daughters. Maeng-hee had once been designated the heir of Samsung Group in the early 1960s, but he fell out of favor with the Samsung founder after a fertilizer subsidiary of Samsung smuggled 56 tons of chemicals from Japan in 1966.  Maeng-hee underwent lung cancer surgery in Japan in 2012, and had been staying in China to recover, sources said. Kun-hee also has been hospitalized at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul since May last year after suffering a heart attack. While he had surgery to remove a third of his lung, the cancer spread to other parts of his body in the following year, driving him to receive radiation treatment in China and Japan. The two had been involved in several legal disputes until Maeng-hee said he would not appeal a court decision that rejected his demand for a 940 billion won ($800 million) share of his sibling's inherited wealth.The two never reconciled their relationship before Maeng-hee's death.","year after suffering heart attack ,hee underwent lung cancer surgery ,years long battle with cancer ,maeng hee underwent lung cancer ,kun hee died on friday","['Lee Maeng - hee', ""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung Group', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'Lee Maeng - hee', 'Lee', 'CJ Group', 'Lee Jae - hyun', 'Beijing', 'CJ', 'Lee', 'Beijing', 'Beijing', 'CJ', 'CJ', 'Beijing', 'Samsung Group', 'Lee Byung - chull', 'Maeng - hee', 'Maeng - hee', 'Samsung Group', 'Samsung', 'Samsung', 'Japan', 'Maeng - hee', 'Japan', 'China', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Japan', 'Maeng - hee', ""Maeng - hee 's""]",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43925467  0.65641588

Most of them are ordinary convicts, according to the Justice Ministry.  The pardons are part of celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.    Liberation Day, which falls on Aug. 15, is one of the major holidays in South Korea. Presidents usually grant special pardons in commemoration of major national holidays.  Speculation had been high that Park would use the pardons to get badly needed cooperation from the business community as Asia's fourth-largest economy has been faltering as of late.  Last year, South Korea's top court upheld a four-year jail sentence against Chey for embezzling 46.5 billion won ($43.6 million) from two SK Group affiliates and funneling the funds into personal investments in stock futures and options in 2008. In February, an appeals court gave Kim, the Hanwha chief, a three-year sentence for illegally using company money to pay back the debts of firms he ran under borrowed names.

But the blast that inflicted serious injuries to two South Korean sergeants and North Korea’s breach of borders has placed Park under pressure to revise her entire message to Pyongyang in line with Seoul taking a strong stance toward the reclusive regime.Defense Minister Han Min-koo has so far vowed to seize the upper hand in the DMZ and take other punitive steps against North Korea in response to it crossing the border and planting the three land mines. The defense chief has also warned of further actions in retaliation besides the propaganda war launched against the North.Amid deepening concerns over inter-Korean ties, Park vowed Wednesday to sternly deal with North Korea‘s provocation. She said, however, that she will keep the door open for joint efforts toward unification. President Park Geun-hye, Korea Liberation Association chairman Park Yu-chul (right) and other participants pledge allegiance to the national flag during a luncheon event to appreciate some of the country’s former independence fighters and their bereaved families at Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday. (Yonhap)“We will sternly deal with North Korea’s provocation. At the same time, we will also make all possible efforts to bring peace and prevent such (provocative incidents) from happening,” she said at a luncheon held to thank independence fighters and their surviving family members.The nation should carry out a historic mission to achieve the peaceful unification of the two Koreas that many patriotic martyrs had dreamed of, Park said. “We could only complete our patriots’ mission of liberating Korea through having the two Koreas work together for peaceful unification and the people’s coprosperity, and to become (a single) advanced, strong nation in the world,” she said.  The tone of her speech with regard to Japan also remains undecided as the Seoul government waits for the release of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s statement slated for Friday to commemorate the end of World War II. Abe has been facing pressure from in and outside Japan to make clear apologies for past atrocities in his speech.On Wednesday, Park invited independence fighters and the surviving family members of the deceased to Cheong Wa Dae as part of a series of events held to commemorate Liberation Day.She has been hosting the event with independence patriots every year since she entered office in early 2013, paying her respects to people who risked their lives for the nation’s independence from the 1910-45 Japanese colonial rule, her office said.The president praised them for their sacrifices, calling it a foundation of South Korea today, and also asked for their support for her reform drive and policies for economic revitalization.The government plans to present medals and presidential commendations Saturday to 257 independence fighters, including 10 foreigners who supported Koreans struggling to end Japan’s colonial rule.The government has also invited descendants of independence fighters living in foreign countries to join the festivities to honor them. The Ministry of Justice has granted Korean citizenship to 11 descendants of independence fighters so that they may keep and acknowledge their Korean roots.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","to deliver her annual speech ,koreans struggling to end japan ,korean ties park vowed wednesday ,deliver her annual speech ,national flag during luncheon event","['Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'japanese', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Han Min - koo', 'DMZ', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'North Korea‘s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Korea Liberation Association', 'Park Yu - chul', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'North Korea ’s', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Koreas', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Park', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'korean', 'korean', 'Cho Chung - un']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.00340338  0.50279236

The Japanese news outlet reported that the U.S. government has told Park, through diplomatic channels, that her attendance at the Beijing event would send a false message to the world that China has caused a rift in the U.S.-South Korea alliance. The U.S. expressed concerns through its embassy in Seoul and other channels, the report added.“It is a false report that the U.S. had asked South Korea not to attend the event through diplomatic channels,” said Min.“We have also seen reports of the U.S. clarifying that it was not true.” President Park Geun-hye speaks at a meeting with her senior secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday. (Yonhap)The White House on Monday denied the news reports, saying they did not request Park to skip the ceremony in China.On Sept. 3, Beijing plans to hold the 70th anniversary of the “Chinese People’s Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War Victory Commemoration Day,” widely seen as Beijing’s display of its growing military strength and its attempt to highlight Japan’s surrender in the war.China has invited world leaders to attend the event including a rare military parade. Many Western leaders, however, remain reluctant, as it could further instigate Beijing’s rivalry with Japan.Another official said Monday afternoon that Cheong Wa Dae would make a final decision on her trip to China in the latter part of next week as the nation is celebrating the 70th anniversary of its liberation from the 1910-45 Japanese rule this week.The decision can be made after reviewing the contents of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s planned speech on Aug. 14, and also his decision on attending the ceremony, he said.Abe is expected to express “deep remorse” over Japan’s wartime wrongdoings, but may refrain from apologizing for its atrocities during the war.The remarks came after local reports noted that Park has already decided to attend the ceremony and would use her visit to the headquarters of the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai for its reopening as an excuse.“Many things are under consideration as the headquarters of the Korean provisional government in Shanghai will be reopened (at that time),” said a Cheong Wa Dae official.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","skip the ceremony in china ,korean presidential office said monday ,park to skip the ceremony ,china invitation sent to president ,white house on monday denied","['south korean', 'China', 'Park Geun', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'Beijing', 'China', 'U.S.-South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Yonhap)The White House', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Beijing', 'Japan', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Japan', 'China', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Park', 'the Korean Provisional Government', 'Shanghai', 'korean', 'Shanghai', 'Cho Chung - un']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.36735627  0.89720416

Lee Hee-ho hugs a child during her visit to Aeyukone, an orphanage for kindergarteners in Pyongyang last Thursday. Kim Dae-jung Peace CenterHer failure to hold the meeting -- which had been expected by some as the Seoul government had discounted her trip as a personal one -- reconfirmed Kim’s poor diplomatic skills, analysts said, noting that his ineptitude was also demonstrated by his refusal to attend Russia’s 70th anniversary celebration in May of its victory in World War II, a rare diplomatic chance for the secluded ruler.The 93-year-old widow of the former president, who was noted for his inter-Korean reconciliation efforts, returned after four days of visiting orphanages, hospitals for children and mothers with newborn babies in Pyongyang, Mount Myohyangsan north of the capital, and other facilities.Apparently anticipating questions on her failure to meet Kim, Lee stressed that her trip was a personal one without any official mission given to her.“As a civilian myself, I was not given any official task to fulfill for this trip, but I carried out all my (personal) plans with a sense of duty to contribute to the spirits of the June 15 inter-Korean declaration,” she said during a press conference upon arrival at Gimpo International Airport in western Seoul.She was referring to the declaration signed in 2000 during an inter-Korean summit between her husband and former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.“While holding hands of pure-looking children at orphanages in Pyongyang I visited, I thought deeply again that we should not pass down the pains of division to the next generation,” she added.Lee’s side reportedly made a request to the North for her talks with Kim, but it was not accepted.As criticism rose of the Seoul’s “passive attitude” over arranging the meeting between Lee and Kim, a senior official of Seoul’s Unification Ministry said that it was Pyongyang that was not “enthusiastic” in setting up the meeting.“From the beginning stage when each side was preparing for her trip, there was no enthusiasm (about arranging the meeting) on the part of the North,” he told reporters. “The reason why we characterized her trip as personal is that should the meeting not be organized, there would be repercussions.”During her stay in the North, she was greeted and accompanied by officials from the North’s Asia-Pacific Peace Committee handling inter-Korean affairs, including Maeng Kyong-il, the committee’s vice chairman and vice-ministerial official.Upon her arrival in Pyongyang, Maeng delivered Kim’s welcoming message verbally to Lee. But Kim did not offer any handwritten message to her, nor did he meet her face to face, even though he himself invited her late last year.During a reception hosted by Lee’s side at Mount Myohyang Hotel on Friday, Lee asked Maeng to tell Kim that she was grateful to him for inviting her to the North. She also expressed her sadness about failing to meet him, her aides said.To recognize the visit by the widow of former President Kim, who was once credited with promoting cross-border cooperation with his signature “Sunshine Policy,” the North Korean leader should have at least sent Kim Yang-gon, the North’s top official in charge of inter-Korean relations, to visit Lee, observers noted.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute, said Kim’s refusal to meet Lee highlighted his lack of diplomatic finesse.“His lack of diplomatic finesse was also confirmed when he refused to meet the visiting Mongolian president in 2013 and to attend the war victory celebration in Russia, which might have been a very crucial chance to improve the North’s external relations,” he said.“I am not sure whether he is following his father’s footsteps: His father began summit diplomacy six years after the death of his father and national founder Kim Il-sung. This, anyway, would serve as a factor to deepen the North’s international isolation.”On Wednesday, Lee took a direct flight over the West Sea to Pyongyang, using South Korean low-cost carrier Eastar Jet. It was her third visit to the North following the first during the inter-Korean summit in 2000 and the second in 2011 for the funeral of the former North Korean leader.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","kindergarteners in pyongyang last thursday ,jung returned home saturday without ,kindergarteners in pyongyang last ,korean summit between her husband ,for kindergarteners in pyongyang last","['Lee Hee - ho', 'south korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Lee Hee - ho', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'centerher', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Russia', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Mount Myohyangsan', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Maeng Kyong - il', 'Pyongyang', 'Maeng', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Lee ’s', 'Mount Myohyang Hotel', 'Lee', 'Maeng', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'inter - korean', 'Lee', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'Sejong Institute', 'Kim ’s', 'Lee', 'mongolian', 'Russia', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Lee', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Eastar Jet', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.38001889  0.37326187

Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald“This is the time when we should make a decision for our daughters and sons, and for the future of the country,” she said in her public address delivered at Cheong Wa Dae.“Labor reform is (all about) creating new jobs. Without overhauling the sector, we cannot save young Koreans from despair and resolve the pain of irregular workers,” she said.Park’s speech came at a crucial time, two weeks before the halfway mark of her five-year term. The speech was her fourth public address since entering office in 2013. The president was widely seen as seeking public support for her reform measures, which have been delayed by the unprecedented outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome and also a series of political scandals involving her close confidants.Park’s reform drive has been losing steam amid intensifying partisan rivalries ahead of the general elections next year. She appeared to be seeking fresh momentum for her state management by betting on the success of the labor reform, a difficult task at which previous administrations had failed.The unemployment rate among young South Koreans aged 15-29 stood at 10.2 percent in June, significantly higher than the overall jobless rate of 3.9 percent, according to the government.In her speech, the president vowed to implement a wage peak system for all public offices within this year, promising that the money saved by the plan would create about 8,000 new jobs in the next two years.She also pledged to strengthen the social security net by raising unemployment allowance from the current 50 percent to 60 percent of their previous salaries. The unemployment benefits will be given for 30 additional days to help the unemployed pursue a stable life while seeking new jobs. Currently, the government grants unemployment allowances for up to 240 days.She also vowed to overhaul public companies often denounced for their lax management and low productivity.Stressing that she was standing before the people with “a sense of urgency,” Park urged the older generation to share the pain of young people left unemployed due to the lack of jobs in the market. She also asked them to gradually give up their vested interests so that young people could start a family and become confident members of society. “Creating more jobs for young people is the foundation of building a healthy society and key to tackling low birthrates,” she said.The president, however, didn’t mention the government’s lax management of MERS that hit hard the nation since early summer, nor her plan to possibly grant clemency to business tycoons. The speech was delivered with reporters attending, but ended without a Q&A; session. In her 25-minute speech, the president also called for restructuring in the education, financial and service sectors to revitalize the nation’s faltering economy. Park also urged a tripartite committee to resume a stalled negotiation meant to make concessions between stakeholders on the labor reforms. “I earnestly request (representatives from) the labor and the management to make room for each other and reach a grand compromise to live up to people’s expectations.” The dialogue has been stalled since April, after an umbrella labor union boycotted the negotiations with the government and business.On education, she pledged to expand the test-free semester program next year to let students explore their fields of interest rather than limiting themselves to textbooks.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","hire more president park geun ,workers she said park speech ,birthrates she said the president ,thursday ahn hoon the korea ,president also called for restructuring","['Park Geun - hye', 'Koreans', 'Park Geun', 'Ahn Hoon', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Q&A', 'Cho Chung - un']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3241837   0.57314742

She then went to “Pyongyang Nursing Home,” a facility North Korean leader Kim Jong-un recently inspected.After a brief respite at the Baekhwawon Guest House, she visited Mount Myohyang, a resort mountain north of Pyongyang.Attention was being drawn to whether she would meet with the North Korean leader. Given that Kim invited her, she is likely to meet him before she returns home Saturday, observers said.Kim offered a handwritten invitation to Lee late last year after Lee sent condolence flowers to him on the occasion of the third anniversary last December of the death of his father, Kim Jong-il.

Park had said last month that the pardon would serve as an opportunity to “bring people together in the spirt of Korea’s Liberation Day.”Chey Tae-won (left) and Kim Seung-yeon (Yonhap)But Min declined to confirm the scope of the list, particularly whether the president would grant pardons to convicted business tycoons, saying “Cheong Wa Dae cannot confirm (the list) until we reach a point where we issue pardons.”Despite the lack of confirmation, news reports speculated that Park would grant pardons to Korea’s conglomerate owners such as SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won and Hanwha Group chairman Kim Seung-yeon, among others. Chey and Kim were convicted of illegally using their respective company’s money.But convicted politicians are reportedly excluded from the list for special pardons, according to Park’s top aide. Rep. Kim Jae-won of the Saenuri Party, who also serves as the president’s special advisor for political affairs, said on Thursday in a media interview that special pardons for politicians are “unlikely.”“Admittedly, people are not that responsive to the special pardons for businesspeople, but President Park will push ahead with the pardons to jump-start the economy. As for pardons for politicians, however, many people would find it hard to see a rationale for the move,” said Kim.The Ministry of Justice will work out a draft of the pardon list and finalize it by Monday.

It's good to see you again after last year."" Ri, however, did not respond.A similar scene played out at last year's ARF meeting in Myanmar as the two shook hands at the gala dinner, but did not hold talks.Leaving the dinner hall Thursday, Ri was only a few steps behind Yun, but neither acknowledged the other's presence.Yun left the building right away, while Ri entered a waiting room before emerging several minutes later to get into his car.Responding to a reporter's question outside the room, a North Korean official, who accompanied Ri throughout the day but declined to give his title or name, said that a member of their delegation will hold a press conference on Thursday after the ARF meeting.""We will be able to clearly state our position,"" he said, apparently referring to North Korea's repeated claim that its nuclear program is a deterrent against the United States' ""hostile"" policy toward it.The ARF brings together all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 16 other countries and the EU, including the members to the six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.In Cairo, meanwhile, a North Korean government delegation headed by the North's ceremonial leader, Kim Yong-nam, dismissed the possibility of talks with a South Korean delegation led by Maritime Minister Yoo Ki-june.""You know the atmosphere at the moment,"" a North Korean diplomat and member of the delegation told Yonhap News Agency.Both sides are scheduled to attend celebrations for the biggest expansion of the Suez Canal since its opening in 1869.

In an interview with Japan’s video-sharing website Niconico, the 61-year-old Park Geun-ryeong said she was sorry that in most news reports South Korea blames Japan for the ongoing toil of the so-called comfort women “without itself taking greater care” of them.Citing previous statements including the regret expressed by Emperor Hirohito to then-President Chun Doo-hwan in 1984, she said it is “inappropriate” to demand an apology every time a new premier takes office. Park Geun-ryeong (Yonhap)  Park also defended the Japanese prime minister’s globally criticized visit to the controversial Yasukuni war shrine in December 2013, calling Seoul’s opposition an “interference” in another country’s internal affairs. “I believe if anyone thinks that the prime minister would worship at the Yasukuni with an ambition for another war in mind, he or she is an abnormal person,” Park said. “How would blood-related descendants not pay respect to their ancestors?”Her remarks are likely to have little impact on the bilateral diplomatic relations or the ongoing talks aimed at resolving the sex slavery dispute, but they instantly sparked public uproar given her position in the presidential family. With Korea regarding the issue’s resolution as essential for rapprochement, the two countries’ foreign ministries have held eight rounds of talks and Park Geun-hye herself said the negotiations were at the “final stage” during a recent interview. Seoul has been demanding an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that normalized their relations.Geun-ryeong’s remarks once again highlighted the checkered relationship between the sisters. The older Park has apparently been displeased with Geun-ryeong’s marriage, being absent at her 2008 wedding to Shin Dong-wook, who they suspected had ulterior motives for approaching their sister 14 years older than him. Shin, who currently heads the minor Republican Party, was found guilty in 2009 of spreading malicious rumors online about the president before her election, serving 18 months in prison. The two sisters became estranged over the right to operate the Korean Children’s Center, a private foundation set up by their late mother Yuk Young-soo in 1969 to promote child welfare. Geun-ryeong took over the organization in 1990 from her elder sister, whom she accused of failing to spot misconduct by its board members. Yet she was also forced to step down in 2004 amid corruption scandals involving her own staff. Though she raised a suit to nullify the decision, the Supreme Court ruled in May 2009 that her layoff was justified.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","two sisters became estranged over ,japanese prime minister globally criticized ,displeased with geun ryeong marriage ,controversy by criticizing seoul for ,absent at her 2008 wedding","['Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Geun - ryeong', 'Japan', 'Niconico', 'Park Geun - ryeong', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Hirohito', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Geun - ryeong ’s', 'Geun - ryeong ’s', 'Shin Dong - wook', 'Republican Party', 'the korean Children ’s Center', 'Geun - ryeong', 'the Supreme Court', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64002413  0.51142555

(Yonhap)Her four-day trip to the communist state came as inter-Korean relations continued to deteriorate with the North sticking to its nuclear program and the South raising pressure on it to renounce it and improve its woeful human rights record.Upon her arrival at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, Lee, 93, was greeted by a series of senior North Korean officials including Maeng Kyong-il, vice chair of the North’s Asia-Pacific Peace Committee handling inter-Korean affairs.Maeng, who visited Seoul in 2009 to attend the funeral of the late former President Kim, is one of the key figures in the North who have dealt with cross-border relations, an indication that Pyongyang regards Lee’s visit as an important state affair. Former first lady Lee Hee-ho (center) is greeted by officials as she arrives at Gimpo International Airport to head to North Korea on Wednesday.

Her trip itself is very meaningful, but we are not considering sending any special message to the North through Lee,” said the ministry’s deputy spokesperson Park Soo-jin told reporters.

To ensure that these schools’ operation do not go rogue, the government conducts an evaluation once every five years. In May, the SMOE announced that four schools ― Mirim Girls’ High School, Kyungmoon High School, Sehwa Girls’ High School and Janghoon High School ― failed to acquire the minimum passing score of 60. They were subject to a public hearing, where they got a chance to challenge the results and provide specific plans to improve their shortcomings. The other three schools were given a two-year extension after the evaluation. Since the evaluation results were announced, Mirim has stressed that it did not wish to retain the elite school status. “Instead of participating in the hearing, it submitted a written opinion that it wishes to become a regular school,” said an SMOE official. “Each year, student recruitment and other financial problems became obstacles for the operation of our school. These limits pushed us to decide that becoming a regular high school is our best option,” the school said last week in a message delivered to the parents of students.While the autonomous private high schools are given leeway over operation, the lack of government subsidy is a challenge for some schools. The difficulty in recruitment is also fueled by their expensive tuition, which is at least three times the amount charged by regular high schools.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","yonhap autonomous private high schools ,office of education said thursday ,janghoon high school failed ,an autonomous private high school ,evaluation requirements top seoul educator","['the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'the Education Ministry', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'SMOE', 'Kyungmoon High School', 'Mirim', 'SMOE', 'Yoon Min - sik']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23732322  0.49468586

The Ministry of Health and Welfare is headed by Moon Hyung-pyo, a former economist who has been blamed for his lack of expertise in public health ever since the MERS outbreak took place in May. The ministry’s vice minister is Chang Ok-ju, who has degrees in rather social work, women’s studies and law, but not health-related fields.As the leaders of the ministry -- which is in charge of health and welfare policies in the country -- have been criticized for their inept handling of the MERS crisis especially during the early stages, there has been a growing concern about the lack of high-ranking government officials who specialize in health.  As the leaders of the Ministry of Health and Welfare has been criticized for their inept handling of the MERS crisis especially during the early stages, there has been a growing concern about the lack of high-ranking government officials who specialize in health. (Yonhap)The government is considering the launch of a system with two vice ministers -- one in charge of public health and the other of welfare -- for the Ministry of Health and Welfare, so there can be at least one authority figure with expertise in each of the respective policies. The government is also considering promoting the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a state-run agency under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, to the vice minister level.As some of the current administration’s key pledges were to introduce more welfare benefits especially for the growing elderly population, the government had been putting less emphasis on the nation’s public health sector before the MERS outbreak took place.The Ministry of Health and Welfare’s budget for the welfare programs jumped by 20 trillion won -- 82 percent -- from 2010 to this year, from 23.93 trillion won to 43.44 trillion won.However, its budget for the public health programs increased by just 1 trillion won over the same period.South Korea reported no additional cases of MERS for the 14th consecutive day Sunday. The outbreak has killed 36 and infected 186 since the first case was reported on May 20. The spread has shown consistent signs of losing steam this month, with no new cases confirmed since July 6 and 135 patients fully recovered from the virus.If no additional cases are reported until Aug. 2 -- four weeks since the latest case was reported on July 5 -- the outbreak in the country can be officially declared over. Among the newly recovered patients is a Pyeongtaek-based police officer, the 119th patient. The health authorities have yet to figure out exactly how the officer contracted the virus. Although he visited a Pyeongtaek-based hospital on May 31, the same day that the 52nd patient visited the same facility, they were in the property at different times and never ran into each other.The outbreak had a drastic impact on everyday life in Korea and the nation’s economy last month, as many avoided crowded and public spaces including shopping malls and amusement parks. The Bank of Korea forecast this month that the economic growth rate this year would slow to around 2.8 percent, down from 3.3 percent last year, citing the MERS outbreak as one of the biggest burdens. The outbreak also had an impact on the country’s $30 billion tourism industry, as more than 124,000 tourists, most of them from China, canceled their trips to Korea last month. The Health and Welfare Ministry had refused to share the list of MERS-affected hospitals for 18 days after the first case was confirmed in late May, and this lack of transparency has been blamed for the public fears that eventually damaged the economy. The ministry has also been accused of protecting the hospitals’ commercial interests by not sharing the information, rather than keeping the general public safe from the possible infection.In spite of the damages, it is unclear whether the government would offer an official apology to citizens once the outbreak is declared over. Minister Moon Hyung-pyo only apologized at the National Assembly last month while being asked about the outbreak by the nation’s lawmakers, while President Park Geun-hye has never offered any words of apology throughout the health crisis. The President made her first onsite visit to meet medical staff more than two weeks after the index MERS case was confirmed.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","health crisis the president made ,the officer contracted the virus ,police officer the 119th patient ,the health crisis the president ,officer contracted the virus","['the Health Ministry', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Chang Ok - ju', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare ’s', 'South Korea', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Korea', 'the Bank of Korea', 'China', 'Korea', 'the Health and Welfare Ministry', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67647821  0.33183551

Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldThe Saenuri chief also vowed to fully cooperate with the Park administration, stressing that the party would be more responsible for the success of her reform drive.Kim also requested Park exercise her clemency to release not only the people convicted of minor crimes, but also business leaders who have been put behind bars as part of efforts to revitalize the nation’s economy. The president said she would “officially” review the party’s request, Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul told reporters after the meeting.Park’s remark instantly raised speculation she would use her special authority to free business tycoons convicted of crimes for the first time. She has remained reluctant to do so until now.Park said she would administer the law strictly and treat all criminal offenders equally upon her inauguration in early 2013. The president granting pardons to high-profile businessmen is still widely viewed as government favoritism to conglomerates. But business circles have been calling for the release of key members of families that run conglomerates, saying keeping them in jail could delay the companies’ key operations.On Monday, she has ordered her senior secretaries to review the scope and the criteria for pardons she is set to issue on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea’s independence from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule.Park and Kim also vowed to reactivate a trilateral meeting among the government, Cheong Wa Dae and the Saenuri Party that has not been convened since May. They also agreed to work closely to pass a 22 trillion won ($19.2 billion) extra budget bill to revive the sluggish economy and support victims of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Won said. The president also accepted Kim’s request to hold a separate trilateral meeting with leaders of the ruling and the main opposition party. Park also held a closed-door meeting with Kim for 20 minutes. Kim, however, said he would not release the details of the conversation he had with the president. It was her first meeting with Saenuri leadership in five months, just three weeks after she blasted the party for bowing to the main opposition party’s demand to revise a controversial parliamentary law. Calling former Saenuri whip Yoo Seong-min a traitor, Park pressured him to leave his post. Her harsh bombardment exposed a party feud between lawmakers loyal to Park and nonmainstream members who denounced her grip on the party. By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","2013 the president granting pardons ,reporters after the meeting park ,imprisoned business leaders during meeting ,president also accepted kim request ,president granting pardons to high","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Won Yoo', 'Kim Jung - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Hoon', 'Korea', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yoo', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Won', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50337112  0.68820137

Last year, the Unification Ministry said it would funnel $13.3 million to help fight acute malnutrition among infants and mothers in the North in partnership with the U.N. World Food Program and World Health Organization. The “1,000 days” project is designed to provide health care to some 2.4 million women and their children up to age 2.It is also in line with Park’s ambitious initiative to boost peace, cooperation and trust in northeast Asia, beginning with climate change, antiterrorism and other nonpolitical matters, and ultimately progressing to security partnerships.During the session, she also introduced Seoul’s drive to devise a resolution to better prevent and respond to natural calamities with the communist neighbor such as through joint river management and reforestation, saying the two countries have a “common duty” to keep the peninsula “healthy.” Yet the efforts have been dogged by Pyongyang’s aloofness and continuing military and political threats, as well as the administration’s unrealistic vision and flip flops on North Korea policy. “Last year, we put forward various initiatives to open the path for practical inter-Korean cooperation, but North Korea has yet to answer,” Park said. She called for the Kim Jong-un regime to change course and take lessons from Iran and Cuba, the U.S.’ old foes that are seeking respectively to put their ties with Washington back on track. “Those cases show that change and cooperation are the prevailing trend in the international community,” the president added. “We are waiting for North Korea to come to the dialogue table, leaving open the door for talks and cooperation. We should heal the wounds of the division and lay the groundwork for a peaceful unification before it’s too late.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korea to tackle infectious illnesses ,she also introduced seoul drive ,north korea to tackle infectious ,geun hye on friday stressed ,presidential committee on unification preparations","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Yonhap)She', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Park', 'Koreas', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Mongolia', 'german', 'Dresden', 'the Unification Ministry', 'the U.N.

The committee is in charge of parliamentary operations and the presidential secretariat. The Saenuri Party members, meanwhile, remained mostly silent about the vetoed National Assembly Act revision, which would have given the legislature the right to request changes to government ordinances. Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min (left) shakes hands with Lee Byung-kee, presidential chief of staff, during a National Assembly steering committee meeting Friday. YonhapNo particular interaction took place between Cheong Wa Dae’s Lee and ruling Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who presided over the committee meeting. President Park had blasted Yoo for being uncooperative last week. Yoo has since refused to step down despite vehement calls from pro-Park members to resign.“It is absurd and dumbfounded for (the president) to have shifted the responsibility to the National Assembly,” the NPAD members said, citing similar revisions that were supported by Park during her lawmaker days.“While in formality, (Park) turned down the Assembly Act revision, in reality, it was a resurrection of Yushin that denies the legislature,” said NPAD Rep. Kang Dong-won. He was referring to the Yushin Constitution that gave Park’s late father and former President Park Chung-hee dictatorial power by enabling extension of his presidency in the 1970s.Chief of staff Lee rebuked comments likening Park to an autocrat, saying, “I do not agree with such a description. … (Cheong Wa Dae) is not as enclosed or unilaterally operated as it is viewed from the outside.” He also said he believed the president would address the public on the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak once the infection subsides for certain.

I hope (the incumbent administration) would prepare for the resumption of such things.”  Lee Hee-ho (Yonhap)On Tuesday, five officials from the Kim Dae-jung Peace Center, including its director and former Culture Minister Kim Sung-jae, met with five North Korean officials in the North’s border city of Gaeseong to discuss the details of her trip to the North. The two sides failed to set a date for her visit, but Kim said that his delegation delivered to the North Lee’s wish to visit the North within July if possible. “The North’s side said it honored her wish and would deliver it to the higher authorities. The two sides decided to meet later again to discuss the time schedule of her visit to the North,” the former culture minister told reporters after the talks in Gaeseong.Kim added that the two sides reaffirmed that Lee would visit the North via a land route across the border, stay in the Baekhwawon Guesthouse in Pyongyang and visit a child care center.Public attention is now focused on whether Lee would be able to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, as her visit could create much-needed momentum to defrost the icy relations between the two Koreas.Her visit has been pushed for since the North Korean leader offered a hand-written invitation to Lee late last year. The invitation was sent after she sent condolence flowers to Kim on the occasion of the third anniversary last December of the death of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.Lee’s side initially proposed holding talks with Pyongyang in April to arrange her visit to the North, hopefully in May. But the North rejected the talks amid cross-border tensions that escalated due to Pyongyang’s angry response to the South Korea-U.S. military drills and other issues.Talk of her visit to the North came as the relations continued to deteriorate.The establishment last Tuesday of a U.N. field office in Seoul to monitor North Korea’s human rights abuses has drawn the ire of Pyongyang, which has argued that the office is designed to overthrow its regime by politicizing the issue and meddling into domestic affairs.The inter-Korean ties were further strained after Seoul imposed financial sanctions last Friday on six Taiwanese individuals and entities and a Syrian institution over suspicions that they traded arms and gave support to the North.Lee plans to visit the North not with a full plate of politically motivated promises, but with relief supplies and knitted caps and scarves for young children, which many hope will move the heart of the North Korean leader and forge the mood for cross-border reconciliation.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","widow of former president kim ,ho widow of former president ,strained after seoul imposed financial ,old former first lady hopes ,widow of former president","['Lee Hee - ho', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'inter - korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Lee Hee - ho', 'Kim Dae - jung Peace Center', 'Culture', 'Kim Sung - jae', 'north korean', 'Gaeseong', 'Kim', 'Gaeseong', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'the Baekhwawon Guesthouse', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Lee', 'Pyongyang', 'May.', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'taiwanese', 'syrian', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64376163  0.46583614

Roh Gun-pyeong is suspected of pressuring government officials to allow Sung to be pardoned at the end of his brother’s term in 2007. The summons is part of the investigation into the “bribery list” that Sung left before he killed himself. In 2007, the businessman was sentenced to a six-month of jail term suspended for one year over charges of breach of duties. One month after Sung gave up his appeal, he was put on a special pardon list despite the Justice Ministry’s objections. The prosecution reportedly secured testimony from a high-ranking official of Sung’s company that he had asked the president’s brother for a pardon.The official and the elder Roh had reportedly been tight as they grew up in the same neighborhood, sources said.Investigators are looking into whether the elder Roh accepted any kickbacks from the late Sung, the prosecution said. The ex-president’s brother denied the charges, saying that “although the aides of Sung tried to reach me, I flatly rejected.”He was previously involved in a number of graft scandals.

Cheong Wa Dae said they were appointed to improve communication between the presidential office and the National Assembly. Opposition lawmakers, however, resisted the appointments, saying that they violated the parliamentary law that bans legislators from taking additional posts and urged them to choose one position. The law allows lawmakers to hold two posts only when they are appointed as Cabinet members. After Park officially appointed the three as her special advisers, Chung said he would examine the legitimacy of the case. The law stipulates that the speaker can decide whether to allow lawmakers to hold additional posts.The parliamentary speaker said he consulted the matter with a number of local law firms for months. Though Chung approved the case, he expressed concerns over legislators working as the president’s advisers at the same time, saying it would negatively affect the parliament’s independence and clashes with the principle of separation of the three powers.He also urged Park to institutionalize a communication platform between the legislative and the executive branches instead of having sitting lawmakers serve as her messengers to the parliament.

A nurse tends to a patient being treated for Middle East respiratory syndrome at the National Medical Center in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)Telemedicine is illegal here, but a draft bill backed by the ruling Saenuri Party and the Park administration proposes to legalize it. The bill has been stalled by the opposition in the National Assembly.The Saenuri Party says telemedicine would create jobs and improve care. The opposition says high profits from telemedicine would induce hospitals to reduce unprofitable services to the poor, who would likely be unable to afford telemedicine. “The government first failed to contain the MERS outbreak because it had privatized the health care industry here too much,” NPAD lawmakers said.“We cannot help but ask how far the Park administration is ready to go in its efforts to protect Samsung,” they added, in a thinly veiled reference to the administration’s initial refusal to publicize the name of hospitals that treated MERS patients, apparently fearing the move would hurt business at the hospitals.The Korean Medical Association, a civic group representing thousands of Korean doctors, also voiced protest.“The government should try to induce non-emergency patients to visit local hospitals,” the KMA said in a statement later Thursday. “Treating visiting patients is also something that can be done by cooperation among medical professionals at different hospitals.

Park has suffered falling approval ratings, despite her attempts to emphasize her prioritization of public health by canceling a trip to the U.S. The president visited an elementary school in southern Seoul and a middle school in northwestern Seoul, which both resumed classes after a weeklong shutdown over the deadly MERS virus. Her visit was the fifth and latest in a series of public activities aimed at calming the public’s escalating fears over the disease that killed 19 as of Tuesday afternoon.President Park Geun-hye visits an elementary school in Seoul on Tuesday. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)At schools, Park watched students washing their hands to help them learn how to prevent the infection of the virus. She also told students not to fear MERS, and that the virus can be prevented by following simple steps such as regular hand washing. “If you can follow those healthy habits, you don’t have to fear things like MERS,” she told them.The president also held a separate meeting with parents and teachers to ask them to strengthen disinfection measures at schools.Before her visit to the schools, the president also met doctors and medical staff at state-run hospitals in Seoul who were designated to treat MERS-confirmed patients and civil servants at an emergency control center run by Gyeonggi Provincial Government. On Sunday, Park visited a fashion market in Dongdaemun, Seoul, to encourage merchants suffering hard from a drop in sales caused by the widespread MERS fears.Despite such efforts, critics said Park was failing to persuade the public.“From my point of view, I think the president ... could offer a message to the families of the deceased and those in critical condition, such as by sending a word of prayer, and soothing the hardship faced by the people,” said professor Lee Sang-don of Chung-Ang University in a radio interview.Some critics also argued that Cheong Wa Dae has repeatedly made inappropriate “praises” over Park’s public appearances at a time of nationwide emergency, such as by highlighting that the president was receiving an enthusiastic welcome by citizens whom she encountered.In a daily briefing, an official said her security team was having trouble protecting her from cheering crowds wanting to get close to her at public sites. Drawing a stark contrast with the presidential office’s description of her popularity, Park’s approval rating saw a sharp decline from 40.3 percent to 34.6 percent last week, at the lowest ebb in four months, according to Realmeter, a local pollster.The percentage of respondents who disapproved of her state management, however, surged 7.5 percentage points to 60.8 percent, it added.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","weeklong shutdown over the deadly ,virus she also told students ,school in seoul on tuesday ,resumed classes after weeklong shutdown ,classes after weeklong shutdown over","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Provincial Government', 'Park', 'Dongdaemun', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Lee Sang - don', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0811191   0.51072186

The “incorrect” information referred to the contents of Park’s impromptu press conference on June 4. Park had claimed that the 35th confirmed MERS patient, a medical doctor at Samsung Medical Center, had come into direct and indirect contact with some 1,565 Seoul residents, possibly exposing them to the virus. Park said that the doctor had attended a large-scale event despite having shown symptoms for MERS, triggering concerns that the virus might have spread outside medical facilities and into the nation’s capital, which is home to more than 10 million people. Park added that he would find his “own ways” to protect Seoul residents, calling on the central government to share more information with the public and regional governments. The doctor, however, refuted the mayor’s claims in follow-up interviews with local media outlets, criticizing Park for witch-hunting and disseminating flawed information without verifying facts. Some 1,100 participants in the large-scale event, who were placed in isolation for nearly two weeks in the wake of Park’s unexpected announcement, were released from quarantine Sunday after testing negative for MERS. According to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, a department that deals with defamation suits has taken charge of the case. The prosecution has been vowing stern measures against spiraling rumors about MERS that the government accused of sparking public panic. Cheong Wa Dae and relevant ministries have voiced opposition against municipalities’ independent actions on MERS that they said could add to public confusion. The opposition bloc, meanwhile, condemned the prosecutors’ move as “politically motivated.”Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, argued that the prosecutors should start a probe into the government, not the mayor. “It is the government that escalated concerns and fears,” Moon said during the Supreme Council meeting Monday. “The government only attempts to shift its responsibility onto the ministries and private sector without taking control of the situation.”The main opposition NPAD Rep. Jun Byung-hyun also blasted the government. “The government blames the public for the spread of MERS while it is even failing to take measures for a simple flu,” he said. “How can the prosecutors probe Park, who took proactive measures to counter the outbreak of MERS?” he added.Some from the ruling Saenuri Party also echoed similar concerns.The ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Yong-tae claimed the Seoul mayor enabled the central and regional governments to set up a unified system to respond to the spread of the virus. “Park must have had circumstantial evidence when he made claims that Seoul citizens might have been exposed to MERS,” he said. “I don’t understand how prosecutors took legal action.”However, fellow ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Ha Tae-kyung charged that it was Park that had political motive by trying to expand his clout. “I am very concerned that Park is taking advantage of the government‘s botched response to the MERS outbreak to spread propaganda and prompt class conflicts by disseminating unverified information,” Ha said in a meeting with the ruling party’s first-term and second-term lawmakers. “Class conflicts” refer to Park’s decision to check whether some 2,944 irregular workers at MERS-stricken Samsung Medical Center are infected with the virus. The move came after the 137th confirmed MERS patient, who is on temporary contract, turned out to have carried on working despite having MERS symptoms. With Park’s efforts to contain the virus widely hailed as proactive, the liberal mayor has emerged as the most favored presidential hopeful for the first time this year, outpacing Saenuri Party’s Kim Moo-sung and NPAD’s Moon Jae-in, according to local pollsters at Gallup. As of Monday afternoon, the government had reported 16 deaths from MERS in the nation and five additional cases of the disease, pushing the total number of confirmed patients to 150.

Pusic was quoted by Seoul officials as saying that she “sufficiently understood” Korea’s stance. It was the first time for a South Korean foreign minister to visit the country in southeastern Europe since the two sides established diplomatic ties in 1992. Along with Senegal, Qatar, Jamaica and India, Croatia is a vice chair of the 21-member World Heritage Committee, which will convene a general session from June 28-July 8 in Bonn, Germany, to make a final decision regarding Japan’s bid for the world heritage status.Before his trip to Croatia, Yun visited Germany, the WHC chair, Friday. He met with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to call for Germany to play an “active role” to prevent Japan from concealing the fact concerning hard labor at its industrial sites.Making its bid for world heritage status, Tokyo set the period of 1850-1910 for the evaluation of the historical value of the sites, arguing that as the period of Japan’s path to becoming an industrial nation. But critics see the move as a deliberate attempt to whitewash its wartime wrongdoings. Japan’s 23 candidate sites that are located in 11 cities across eight prefectures include the Hashima undersea coal mine off Nagasaki known as “Battleship Island,” the Miike coal mine and Mitsubishi’s Nagasaki shipyard facilities.During his stay in Germany, Yun visited an institution in Berlin that was once used as a camp to accommodate some 2,000 forced laborers and currently stores historical documents about forced labor under the Nazi government.In the visitors’ book, Yun wrote, “I express my respect to Germans who move forward into the future while healing forced laborers and other victims during World War II, and the scars of the past (in general).”On Sunday, Yun was set to fly to New York to meet with Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman, whose country took the rotating chairmanship of the U.N. Security Council this month. Yun was expected to call for support from Malaysia, which is also a WHC member. This Monday, Yun is to fly to Washington D.C. where he and U.S. Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz are to make an official signing of the newly revised civilian atomic energy accord. The two countries made a preliminary signing of the accord on April 22.

But we felt she made comments to the effect that Seoul would try to hold a summit at an early date, as she understands the wishes of the Wise Man Group,” former chief cabinet secretary Takeo Kawamura, a member of the Japanese delegation, told the press conference after the meeting with Park. President Park Geun-hye greets a group of Japanese opinion leaders and senior statesmen including former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori (left) at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday. (Yonhap.)Since Park was inaugurated in February 2013 she has refused to hold a bilateral summit with Abe, saying that the summit would not yield any fruitful result while the anti-Japanese sentiment continued to worsen. Kawamura also expressed hopes that Abe would take advantage of his much-anticipated statement in August ― which would mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II ― to improve the strained ties with Seoul.He added that during the talks with Park, she said she wanted to try to help the victims of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery “regain their honor.” Tokyo has refused to accept the legal responsibility of the atrocities, arguing a lack of clear evidence that Japan as a state forcibly mobilized Korean women for sexual slavery at frontline brothels.Former South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan, a member of the South Korean side of the group, said that during the talks with Park, the group urged the leaders of the two countries to make a “big decision” to move the bilateral relationship forward.During the group’s luncheon meeting with Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, the top diplomat expressed Seoul’s concerns over Japan’s bid to list 23 major wartime industrial facilities as World Heritage sites. Seoul has demanded that seven of the 23 facilities, those where Koreans were forced to labor during the colonial era, should be removed from the bidding process, or that the historical facts about forced labor should be clearly explained when the seven facilities are presented. Earlier in the day, former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of the Japanese delegation stressed the importance of bilateral cooperation to cope with the changing security landscape in the region ― beset by Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear arms and Beijing’s increasing assertiveness.“It is very important for South Korea and Japan ― two countries that are small yet very powerful ― to cooperate and respond to the world’s trends amid a shift in international security conditions,” he said during the session in a Seoul hotel.Saying that there have already been many exchanges among the new generations of the two countries, he pointed out that politicians’ “stubbornness” has hindered the joint efforts to improve bilateral relations.Launched to explore ways to improve the bilateral ties, the Wise Man Group held its first session in March in Tokyo.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","monday urged south korean president ,leaders from japan on monday ,luncheon meeting with korean foreign ,hold summit with her japanese ,urged south korean president park","['Japan', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Park', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Wise Man Group', 'Takeo Kawamura', 'japanese', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Yoshiro Mori', 'Abe', 'anti - japanese', 'Kawamura', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Yu Myung - hwan', 'south korean', 'Park', 'korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Seoul', 'Japan ’s', 'World Heritage', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Yoshiro Mori', 'japanese', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'the Wise Man Group', 'Tokyo', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.3736957   0.43441641

""Why does she plan to visit the U.S., the prime enemy that divided the two Koreas? This shows the repetition of Park's bad habit for making overseas escape.""The North's criticism against Park is not new as Pyongyang has recently ratcheted up its condemnation against South Korea's leader, calling her a ""malignant tumor"" who harms inter-Korean ties.It added that the U.S. is trying to strengthen a trilateral cooperation among Seoul, Washington and Tokyo as it is very jittery about what the North claimed to be a successful test-firing of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.""Park's visit to the U.S. is not only an attempt to make overseas escape but also a risky gambling that hampers the Korean Peninsula and the region,"" it said.The North's move also came after the top nuclear envoys from South Korea, the U.S. and Japan agreed Wednesday to ratchet up pressure and sanctions on the North. They shared the view that advancement in the North's nuclear capability is ""serious.""An official at Seoul's unification ministry voiced regret over the North's repeated criticism of Park, calling on Pyongyang to stop insulting her.""North Korea should immediately stop slandering Park and instead, it should accept Seoul's offer for talks for better inter-Korean ties,"" the official said, asking not to be named.

Park also urged that he be able to sail through the confirmation hearing and take on “the heavy task” to bring a better future for the people. The motion seeking the parliamentary endorsement came five days after Park named the justice minister as new prime minister. Cheong Wa Dae hopes to complete the confirmation process before Park’s planned visit to the United States in mid-June. Under the law, the National Assembly should hold a confirmation hearing of a prime minister-nominee within 15 days and put the motion into vote within five days of the hearing sessions. Prime Minister-designate Hwang Kyo-ahn enters the government complex building in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)Park’s sixth premier nominee since the launch of her administration is expected to face fierce resistance from the main opposition party attempting to take the confirmation as a fresh opportunity to press Park and her ruling party. Cheong Wa Dae stresses that leaving the nation’s No. 2 vacant, particularly when the president is overseas, could create a vacuum in state affairs.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is bracing for the battle, selecting sharp-tongued lawmakers with legal careers to grill Hwang, who served as a prosecutor for more than 30 years. The party is expected to highlight his disputed career as a prosecutor on public security and accuse of being an ideologically biased figure not suitable to serve in the No. 2 post. “It is a matter that is subject to (bipartisan) negotiations and it cannot be done unilaterally,” said NPAD Floor Leader Lee Jong-kul. “Whether the prime minister nominee is eligible will be thoroughly examined in line with the citizens’ perspective.” he said.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, appeared to take a more leisurely approach, as Hwang was already approved by the parliament upon his nomination for justice minister in early 2013. According to reports, the governing party is considering recruiting lawmakers who formerly worked for the prosecution to defend Hwang from the opposition party’s invective.Amid escalating tension between the rival parties, fresh accusations were raised against Hwang claiming that he tried to skip reports on the use of his business allowances as justice minister.Under the guidelines, officials are obliged to submit the names and the titles of people he or she had meetings with if such events were paid by the government at an amount of 500,000 won or more. Hankyoreh newspaper reported on Tuesday that Hwang allegedly spent 490,000 or 480,000 won on 17 different occasions in the first four months this year, raising speculation that he intentionally paid a little less than 500,000 won to avoid submitting details on his business expenses.Controversy is also brewing over his recruitment of incumbent senior prosecutors to help prepare for his confirmation hearing. Two prosecutors from Busan and Uijeongbu District Prosecutors’ Offices have been dispatched to the Justice Ministry to assist Hwang. The decision, however, sparked criticism that the justice minister was abusing his authority and that he should work with his own staff rather than prosecutors.The justice minister, however, remained mum on the accusations, saying that he would prepare for the confirmation hearings “accordingly with the law.”By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday called for parliamentary cooperation ,gwacheon gyeonggi province tuesday yonhap ,party is considering recruiting lawmakers ,tuesday called for parliamentary ,on tuesday called for parliamentary","['Park Geun - hye', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'Park ’s', 'the United States', 'the National Assembly', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Gwacheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Park', 'Dae', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'NPAD Floor', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Saenuri Party', 'Hwang', 'Hankyoreh', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Cho Chung - un']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36837018 -0.14435373

By showcasing a strong alliance with Washington, Park is expected to aim for a boost to her approval ratings against the growing concerns over Korea’s tightening spot in the regional rivalry between China and U.S., escalated by Washington’s closer entente with Tokyo.“With the president having a clear conviction of abolishing the deep-rooted evils of the past in order to resurrect the economy and create the new country, the period between June and August is viewed as the golden time to achieve the reform tasks,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said on condition of anonymity.By August, which Cheong Wa Dae considers a watershed moment for the administration’s five-year term, Park insists on accelerating the reforms of the public, labor, finance and education sector, the source said.Park is also intent on punishing politicians embroiled in the so-called Sung Woan-jong scandal if convicted by the prosecution as part of the political reform, the source added.Eight of the ruling party members have been facing suspicions of receiving illegal donations from Sung, a deceased businessman who committed suicide on April 9 who left a list of the suspected politicians.From news reports","monday to revitalize south korea ,hye vowed monday to revitalize ,to revitalize south korea economy ,may also monday buddhist ceremonies ,vowed monday to revitalize south","['Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Buddha', 'Kim Jong - deok', 'Jogyesa', 'the Jogye order ,', 'South Korea ’s', 'buddhist', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'South Koreans', 'buddhist', 'Park', 'Justice', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Park', 'Korea ’s', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Park', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Sung']",3,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.04240289 0.7646504  0.10358556]

YonhapKim Sung-woo, the chief presidential secretary for public relations, said Hwang was selected as the prime minister as he is considered the right person to bring about political reform. If Hwang is confirmed by the National Assembly, he will fill the spot left vacant by ruling Saenuri Party’s Rep. Lee Wan-koo, who stepped down as the prime minister after he was implicated in an expanding graft scandal revolving around late businessman Sung Woan-jong. Lee was one of eight political heavyweights alleged to have accepted illegal political funds from deceased ex-Keangnam chairman Sung. Park had appointed Lee, a veteran politician and former Saenuri floor leader, in February as part of efforts to seek momentum for her reform drive.The prime minister’s seat has been left vacant for nearly a month as Park struggled to find a replacement.Among Park’s five nominees for prime minister during her tenure, only two, including Lee, were able to assume the office.Hwang is also expected to meet tough grilling sessions at the parliamentary hearing as the opposition takes issue with his expertise in public security.The staunch constitutionalist, who has been advocating a need for early education of the Constitution, is well known for his public security-focused career at the prosecution. While serving as the justice minister, Hwang spearheaded the arrest of former leftist lawmaker Lee Seok-ki and the dissolution of his party for being supportive of the North Korean regime.Upon Cheong Wa Dae’s formal designation, Hwang held a press conference and said, “I will do my best to uphold the people’s wishes, with an understanding that taking care of the socially weak is also a crucial national task while achieving people’s harmony and social integration.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, immediately criticized the choice.“President Park Geun-hye naming Minister Hwang is an overt declaration that she would reign over the country with a public security-focused (government),” NPAD senior spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok.Claiming Hwang’s past career went against the efforts of democratization by curbing opposition forces, the opposition argued Hwang was not fit to be prime minister, a role that must bring the people together and revive the economy.The party vowed a thorough hearing process ahead.By Choi He-suk and news reports","thursday nominated justice minister hwang ,hye on thursday nominated justice ,on thursday nominated justice minister ,thursday nominated justice minister ,years serving as public prosecutor","['Park Geun - hye', 'Justice', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Incheon', 'YonhapKim Sung - woo', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Lee Seok - ki', 'north korean', 'Hwang', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang', 'NPAD', 'Kim Yung - rok', 'Hwang', 'Choi']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73668426  0.48469779

THAAD is a purely defensive system that would improve our ability to intercept short- and medium-range missiles from North Korea. It does not and cannot impact broader strategic stability with Russia or China,"" he said.  The U.S. wants to deploy a THAAD missile interceptor battery to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.  But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for the South because China and Russia see a potential THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and have increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a deployment.  Seoul and Washington have maintained that there have been no formal consultations or decision on the issue between the two countries. But the issue came to the fore again this week as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in Seoul that a provocative North Korea is ""why we are talking about THAAD.""   Rose dismissed Chinese concerns that THAAD would pose a threat to its security interests in the region.  ""I think part of what China is trying to do is create a wedge in the U.S. alliance system in the region,"" Rose said.  The official also said the THAAD missile defense system has no capability to intercept long-range Chinese missiles. He also dismissed Chinese claims that the radar that comes with THAAD could be used to spy on China, saying the U.S. already has such radars in the region.  Rose also praised some senior South Korean officials for rejecting Chinese attempts to affect the issue.  ""I've been very, very pleased with some of the statements that have come out of senior officials in the Republic of Korea, saying even though no decisions have been made, the U.S. has not made a request and no formal consultations have occurred today, let us be clear this is about defense and security of the Republic of Korea and we will make our decisions on our own without any input from you,"" he said.

171,171,171,[Herald Interview] ‘Abe unlikely to apologize in August speech’,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is unlikely to make any apology for his country’s wartime atrocities in a much-anticipated speech to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in August, a Japanese expert said.Yoshihide Soeya, political science professor at Keio University, said that based on Abe’s personal belief that Tokyo’s past apologies were “excessive,” he may refuse to accept Seoul’s repeate...","Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is unlikely to make any apology for his country’s wartime atrocities in a much-anticipated speech to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in August, a Japanese expert said.Yoshihide Soeya, political science professor at Keio University, said that based on Abe’s personal belief that Tokyo’s past apologies were “excessive,” he may refuse to accept Seoul’s repeated calls to express its sincere contrition.“I think if you expect that, you will be disappointed. I think that it is almost for sure,” the professor told The Korea Herald last week. “Making an explicit apology is against his personal will, but also even as a prime minister, he is not ready to go that far.” Yoshihide Soeya. (Song Sang-ho/The Korea Herald)Soeya came to Seoul last week to attend an academic forum arranged by the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.The scholar painted a negative outlook for the future political relationship between South Korea and Japan, noting that neither President Park Geun-hye nor Prime Minister Abe is willing to move first to address the drawn-out stalemate over history and territorial issues.For their relations to move forward, the two countries should recognize the importance of bilateral cooperation, which would create incentives for both sides to seek a future-oriented relationship, he said.Well-known for his extensive research on East Asian politics and Japanese diplomacy, professor Soeya has served as the director of the Institute of East Asian Studies of Keio University and on the Board of Directors of the Japan Association of International Studies.From 1999-2000, he served as a member of the “Prime Minister’s Commission on Japan’s Goals in the 21st Century,” and in 2010, as a member of the “Council on Security and Defense Capabilities in the New Era” in the Prime Minister’s Office.The following is the full text of the interview with professor Soeya. ― Ed.The Korea Herald: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s speech last month at a joint session of U.S. Congress frustrated Koreans as it did not include expressions such as colonial rule, aggression or any apology. What is your take on this? Korean-Americans, Chinese-Americans and other participants stage a rally in downtown Los Angeles on May 2 to demand an apology from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for his country’s wartime aggressions and atrocities. (Yonhap)Yoshihide Soeya: That was not a surprise. That’s expected. I think the same is true for his summer statement (to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II). His position has been very clear from the beginning. I think the most important factor is his personal beliefs, which are not a secret. His views have long been that they (Tokyo’s past apologies for wartime atrocities) are a little bit too much, excessive. It is not that he denies the fact of the war or anything. My way of putting this is that there are two Mr. Abes ― one as an individual politician and the other as a prime minister. So his explicit views about past Japanese government statements are personal. But as a prime minister, he cannot talk in the same way as a national leader. As a prime minister, he has to behave that way because that is how Japanese external relations are framed, not only with Korea, but almost with all the other countries. Making an explicit apology is of course against his personal will, but also even as a prime minister, he is not ready to go that far, because that is against his beliefs. Domestic politics being a factor (keeping him from apologizing) … that is another myth, I guess. I don’t think he is behaving like that because of domestic politics. No. (He is behaving based on) his personal belief and that is the most important thing for him. Including Yasukuni visits, it is personal. No elements of politics. KH: Would it, then, be wrong to expect that Abe is going to apologize in the August statement to respect the growing calls for a sincere apology?Soeya: I think if you expect that, you will be disappointed. I think that it is almost for sure. So, he makes a compromise. For example, in a congressional speech, he said Japan inflicted suffering on Asians, and that sentence has made it clear who was the aggressor and who were the victims, and I think this was the first time for Abe to say that and make that relationship very explicit. That is a compromise and that is one step forward for him. So there may be another step forward in the summer statement. There could be some step forward, but I don’t know what that is going to be. But no matter what happens, this is going to be as a result of a compromise. So I don’t expect him to compromise to the extent of, for instance, complying with the Korean request. I don’t think that is going to happen, but he may make some new compromise, but not to the extent of (making an apology).KH: How do you think Abe will tackle bilateral issues with Seoul, including the wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women?Soeya: I think Korea-Japan relations today ― it is often said ― are the worst in the course of history. In a way, yes, but not necessarily. If you look at the past evolution since 1965, we have made a lot of progress and we have come a long way. And I think how good it has become is mostly shown in the civil society relations. Relations between the two leaders may be the worst since 1965, as a result, that relationship is affecting, first of all, the political sentiment and atmosphere, which is unfortunately spreading into some other social sectors gradually. It is like gas spreading from the top of the mountain to the foot. But I don’t think it has reached all the way down to the bottom and civil society relations are still not very bad. Those people who do not read newspapers and or do not watch TV, they don’t know about this and there are lots of them on the street. The majority of the general public basically do not care about what’s happening in the political relationship. Therefore, many Koreans keep coming to Japan. The Japanese number has decreased but they are still coming here. So my take is, if I can be explicit, I am afraid I have to say as long as the current two leaders are there, the prospects for the political relationship may not be good.KH: How do you think South Korean President Park Geun-hye can improve the bilateral relationship?Soeya: I think realistically speaking, (see) what happened between Japan and China in the Xi-Abe meeting. There was a compromise regarding the four points including critical issues. This is a typical diplomatic way of dealing with difficult issues. And diplomatically speaking, that could be a realistic way between Japan and South Korea to come up with some diplomatic way of dealing with these issues, and each side is free to interpret it according to its own needs. But the question is if that is possible. In case of South Korea, the president’s own feelings should be very important but also possible domestic repercussions are very critical. Leaders become hostage to some extent, and mass media are a very important intermediary in that context.And in the case of Japan, Abe has not become hostage to the domestic sentiment necessarily, but the basic fundamental gap between Tokyo and Seoul is that each side believes the problem lies on the other side. So Mr. Abe believes President Park is too stubborn, and she believes Abe has no readiness to compromise, so she doesn’t want to move. So neither side is ready to make a first step. Both sides believe the first step should be made by the other side and I think that is a stalemate. Again, realistically speaking, some diplomatic way of dealing with the difference should be the way. But the comfort woman issue is the biggest issue. If there is some compromise struck regarding this issue, not necessarily calling for a resolution or anything, if they agree, for instance, on the future way of proceeding regarding this issue … that kind of a deal. If that is done, then of course top leaders do not engage in those kinds of negotiations. So it is a task basically for bureaucrats and secondly how mass media report that deal to the general public would also be very important.KH: Do you think that there are any steps Abe is going to take first to improve bilateral relations?Soeya: Many South Koreans say President Park Geun-hye is interested in improving relations with Japan. But without a significant first step from Japan, she cannot make a move and that is the dominant argument here. Again, the problem is that context is not understood as such in Japan, particularly in the prime minister’s office. Their view is the opposite ― the Korean side should soften its attitude. So therefore, again, realistically speaking, it is not very likely. I think the important point is whether or not both leaders really believe South Korea-Japan relations are important and why.As long as you believe this relationship is nothing, the incentive to improve is also not going to rise. I think that is dominantly the current atmosphere. So in order for both sides to make a move, the first important thing is to come to understand how important the relationship is. If the significance of the relationship is understood very clearly, then that will lead to some kind of incentives to initiate something. So the important thing is rather than pushing Tokyo or Seoul, to do something to make the case for South Korea-Japan relations being very critical in many ways. The flipside was of course the comfort women and those two things are going on. Again regarding history and our difficult issues, and regarding our obvious necessity to cooperate, those two things are both obvious ― importance of history issues and importance of cooperation. In a two-track approach, both tracks should proceed side by side. One should not interfere with the other. But today, the Korean approach is to do something about history and then let’s move on. To be very honest, I don’t think that is going to work. If Japanese side proposes this two-track, many Koreans would take it as a Japanese way of sidelining history issues. So that should be avoided. So, the point is that it should be explicit that both are important in their own rights and they should proceed on two tracks without one interfering with the other. KH: But the problem is that people here in Korea tend to look at the two issues as one package rather than separating the two.Soeya: I think that looks like a dominant perception. But personally, I really don’t know. The public may react positively. I think for the majority of the public, there should not be much problem about the two-track approach. Here, the question is whether you can control the very strong voice in your society. Even though they don’t necessarily represent the majority, their influence is bigger than their size. I think that should be managed. How to manage that is also an important element in a democracy. You should not be taken hostage. If they really believe that the two-track would proceed seriously, I think the public in both societies would eventually accept it even though there may be opposition. It is impossible to expect a 100 perecent consensus in a democracy. So it is a majority thing essentially.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","tokyo past apologies for wartime ,session of congress frustrated koreans ,minister shinzo abe speech last ,apology from japanese prime minister ,tokyo past apologies were excessive","['japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'Keio University', 'Abe ’s', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Song Sang - ho', 'the Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'Abe', 'east asian', 'japanese', 'Soeya', 'the Institute of East Asian Studies', 'Keio University', 'the Board of Directors', 'the Japan Association of International Studies', 'Japan', 'the "" Council on Security and Defense Capabilities', 'the New era', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'Ed', 'the Korea Herald', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'U.S. Congress', 'Koreans', 'Korean - Americans', 'Chinese - Americans', 'Los Angeles', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Abes', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Yasukuni', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Asians', 'Abe', 'korean', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'China', 'Xi - Abe', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Abe', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Abe', 'South Koreans', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', '’s', 'japanese', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.28368524  0.39892516

Moon Jae-in and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon.“Ban is adept at hiding his political motives,” Choi added. “He is a skilled politician and celebrated figure here who has a valuable political resource. Not many hate him.” U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. (AP-Yonhap)Rumors that Ban would run in South Korea’s biggest political election began to surface last October. A report written by the chief executive of local opinion surveyor Realmeter went viral as it mentioned openly for the first time that Ban could run as the ruling Saenuri Party’s candidate in 2017.Ban denied the possibility through his spokesperson in November. He appeared intent on further distancing himself from the presidential rumors and focusing on U.N.-related events during his visit to Korea this week.The U.N. chief will speak Tuesday at the WEF, a U.N.-sponsored event promoting the Education for All Movement, which aims to provide basic education worldwide. Ban, meanwhile, chose to skip a visit to his hometown in Eumseong County, South Chungcheong Province, a destination currently embroiled in a politicized graft scandal involving a deceased businessman from the region who has ties to close relatives of Ban.Sung Woan-jong, the former chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises, committed suicide last month under suspicion of fabricating accounting records. Sung alleged before his death that he had given bribes to eight ruling bloc officials, sparking public uproar.Reports have since risen that Ban’s nephew Bahn Joo-hyun and Ban’s brother Ban Ki-sang had ties to Keangnam.Bahn worked as a middleman in the sale of a building built by Keangnam Enterprises in Vietnam to the Qatar Investment Authority in 2013. Bahn allegedly faked documentation to speed up the sale. Ban Ki-sang was a senior adviser to Keangnam at the time.But one parliamentary source who spoke on the condition of anonymity downplayed the likelihood of Ban running in 2017.“(Saenuri chair) Rep.

But the North did not make any comments on Hyon's reported execution.  South Korea called on North Korea to stop making insulting remarks toward Park and to reflect on itself instead.  ""The South Korean government strongly rebukes North Korea for swearing at the South's leader with insults,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at the Ministry of Unification, said at a press briefing.  ""I think there is nothing worth responding to the North's claims, but it is regrettable that the North shows its level by insulting the leader from a country who seeks dialogue with anti-humanity and anti-feminine remarks,"" he added.  If North Korea's alleged execution of Hyon is confirmed, it would mark another high-profile public execution by the North. In late 2013 Kim ordered the execution of his once-powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek.  The allegation also came as North Korea has recently claimed that it successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile, raising security concerns in the region.  Experts said that the North's criticism of the South is aimed at blocking public agitation in the communist country.  ""Hopes for improvement in inter-Korean ties may fade out.

(Yonhap)His visit here, the first in 15 months, came amid the North's growing threats. It recently announced the successful test-launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, which would provide the country with an advanced way of delivering a nuclear warhead. The North also fired hundreds of artillery shells into the waters just north of the Yellow Sea border with the South last week.  Kerry stressed that such provocations show that the communist nation is running against Washington's efforts to resume dialogue and improve bilateral ties. He said the North should first demonstrate a genuine willingness to fulfill its denuclearization commitments. ""To this moment, particularly with its recent provocations, it is clear that (North Korea) has not even come close to meeting that standard,"" he said, adding that consultations are under way to increase pressure either through sanctions or other means. In a separate meeting with Kerry, President Park Geun-hye said Seoul and Washington should send a consistent message urging North Korea to abandon its provocations, according to Park's office.  Last weekend, Kerry traveled to Beijing, where he voiced hope that a nuclear deal with Iran will send a positive message to North Korea.  Kerry told Park that Seoul and Washington should make strategic and creative efforts to induce North Korea to embrace change, noting Washington's nuclear deal with Tehran left only North Korea isolated. Kerry's trip came weeks before Park visits Washington for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama.  Kerry directly criticized North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for churning out ""stories of grotesque, grisly, horrendous public displays of executions."" Kim Jong-un is alleged to have ordered the public execution of Hyon Yong-chol, the North's defense minister.  Yun also said the sides agreed on the seriousness of the North's provocations and uncertainty over its leadership.  ""In talks this time, we took note of uncertainty over North Korea's internal situations. We agreed to strengthen joint deterrence and coordination on the North Korea issue at a high level between South Korea and the U.S.,"" Yun said.  On a regional history row, Kerry made clear that Japan was responsible for the wartime sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women.  ""With respect to ...the trafficking of women for sexual purposes by the Japanese military during that war, we have said many times that that was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights,"" he said.   The secretary's words were a repeat of Obama's comments on the so-called ""comfort women"" issue. In his trip to Seoul in April 2014, Obama used the same expression.  Kerry's statement, however, came amid lingering doubts here about whether the Obama administration is taking a balanced approach.   Addressing the U.S. Congress last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe refused to offer a clear apology for the wartime sex slavery. U.S. officials, nonetheless, spoke much of Abe's speech as Washington and Tokyo beef up their alliance.  The two sides revised joint defense guidelines to allow Japan to expand the role of its self-defense forces abroad.  Kerry said ""nothing can be done"" by Japan without South Korea's consent in terms of issues related to the security of the peninsula.  He plans to visit the U.S. military base in Yongsan and deliver a lecture on cybersecurity at Korea University later in the day before heading back home.

The 58-year-old former envoy to Ukraine will replace Wi Sung-lac, who is set to retire after serving more than three years in Moscow. Park most recently led years-long negotiations with Washington to revise their civilian atomic energy pact as the Foreign Ministry’s ambassador for nuclear energy cooperation. The two countries clinched a deal last month to pave the way for a more stable supply of nuclear fuel, better management of used rods, research on reprocessing and future exports of reactors. Park Ro-byug. (Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye awarded credentials to him later in the day at Cheong Wa Dae. The ambassador will be tasked with keeping up delicate relations with Russia, which remains at loggerheads with the U.S., a top Seoul ally, over the Ukraine crisis. Moscow has also been reaching out to Pyongyang in recent months in an apparent effort to increase its influence in inter-Korean affairs and secure investment from the South in major trilateral economic projects, such as a joint industrial district, railway, gas pipeline and power grid. Last week, Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the ruling Saenuri Party briefly met with Kim Yong-nam, president of the North’s Supreme People’s Assembly, as the president’s special envoy to a ceremony in Russia marking the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany.A graduate of Seoul National University, Park began his diplomatic service in 1979 and has since taken up various key positions including ambassador for energy and resources, director general for European affairs, deputy spokesperson and director for North American affairs.

South Korea became an ""aging society"" in 2000, when the ratio topped 7 percent.Experts have expressed concerns that the aging population, coupled with low birth rates, poses a serious threat to the nation's economy as it could lead to fewer working people and increased spending on health and welfare.

The factory park, which marries South Korea's capital and technology with the North's cheap labor, serves as a major legitimate revenue source for the cash-strapped communist country.

The much-awaited passage of the bill, however, fell apart in parliament on the last day of the preceding extra parliamentary session last week as rival parties failed to reach an agreement on the conditions of the bill's passing.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) had initially agreed to pass the bill on the condition that the benefit from the overall national pension plan be increased to cover 50 percent of pre-retirement income from the previous 40 percent. The ruling Saenuri Party's last-minute rejection of the proposal led to the parliamentary impasse.""The top priority should be put on processing the public worker pension (bill) that is adjusted to the citizens' expectations. The passage should be carried out in the National Assembly without fail in May,"" chief presidential press secretary Kim Sung-woo said in a press briefing. The presidential official said the national pension issue should be negotiated separately without being linked to the public worker pension issue at hand.""It is not desirable to tie the national pension to the civil servant pension because the issues of the income replacement rate and the insurance rate increase need prior agreement from the citizens,"" Kim noted. He also took issue with the opposition proposal, saying that the increase of the income replacement rate to 50 percent will require an input of 1,702 trillion won in taxpayers' money over the following 65 years. ""An increase of even one percentage point (in the income replacement rate) may pass a disastrous burden on to future generations,"" Kim said. The call on the parliament came as rival parties are set to meet again starting Monday for a one-month extra parliamentary session, which was called after the previous extra session ended without success.The civil servant pension issue is expected to dominate the coming session again although the prospect of the bill's passage is unclear with both parties still wrangling over it.

On the last day of the recent extra National Assembly session on Wednesday, the rival parties tried to pass the ruling party-led bill designed to restructure the deficit-ridden pension system for civil servants.But the efforts fell through as the ruling Saenuri Party rejected the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy's compromise proposal to hike payments of the national pension program. ""It would be proper if politicians first achieve a reform of the public employee pension and then move to the national pension in order to secure financial stability and bolster the function of retirement income, if they really work for citizens,"" the secretary noted. The secretary also slammed the rival parties for complicating the public worker pension reform efforts by bringing up the national pension issue.The rival parties had to collect public opinion before taking issue with public pension because it is directly linked to national finance, Kim said, adding that ""if this public worker pension reform failed, the nation and politicians will be put in a position to pass debt on to future citizens and young people."" Kim also called on the rival parties to revive efforts to pass the reform bill. National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa called another extra parliamentary session on Thursday, which will begin Monday for a one-month run in a bid to cope with the reforms again. The ruling party denounced NPAD leader Moon Jae-in for the parliamentary impasse, with the party's spokesman Kim Young-woo saying, ""We suspect Chairman Moon's promise to reform the civil servant pension to be a lie."" Moon, on his part, accused the ruling party of crushing a bipartisan agreement to pass a concerted bill by rejecting the opposition's compromise. ""The Saenuri Party should come back to the spirit of social agreement,"" he said. The public employee pension reform was at the core of President Park's deregulation and reform campaign aimed at reviving the stagnant economy.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is among the world leaders to attend the May 9 ceremony, with most Western leaders shunning it amid tensions over Russia's role in Ukraine. Asked about the no-show of Kim in Moscow, Cheng replied, ""As for North Korea and the absence of their leader, it is a decision made by their own leader according to their schedule."" Cheng was speaking at a press briefing about Xi's visit to Russia. Russia gave few details about why Kim canceled his visit to Moscow, other than saying ""international North Korean issues."" ""As for China, we hope that the Korean Peninsula could maintain the current situation and the North Korean nuclear issue could be peacefully resolved through six-party talks,"" Cheng said. Earlier in the day, North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, who serves as president of the North's Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, would visit Russia for this week's commemoration events.The U.S. and other Western powers have criticized Russia for annexing the Crimean peninsula and for supporting pro-Russian separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, prompting their leaders to boycott the May 9 event in Moscow. Despite the simmering standoff over Ukraine, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin have forged closer ties. Last week, China's defense ministry announced that Beijing will conduct its first joint naval drill with Moscow in the Mediterranean Sea this month.Asked whether Xi's visit to Moscow this week would further deepen ties between the two nations, Cheng replied, ""China and Russia are important strategic partners.""

Lee’s farewell ceremony was held later in the evening. The president, however, remained silent on the graft scandal, with her office explaining she would need a day or two of rest after falling ill during her Latin American tour last week. Park has been facing mounting calls to state her position over the scandal. The president returned from the 12-day trip Monday morning, but has been suffering from a sore throat and abdominal pain, her spokesperson Min Kyung-wook told reporters. Presidential medical staff have advised rest for one or two days for what is apparent “overwork,” Min added.“Adnominal pain caused by stomach cramps due to chronic fatigue was her major symptom,” he said. “The president’s health condition was not good (during the trip), as she also had a mild fever caused by pharyngitis,” he said, adding that Park powered through her schedule, despite her bad health.Min said the office would announce her forthcoming schedules and her “position” on the looming political crisis in due time, stressing her health is “the top priority.” Park was expected to preside over the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday, but she chose not to attend the meeting, according to officials. With the prime minister leaving the office, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who serves as deputy premier, would chair the meeting this week, they said. Lee was one of eight political heavyweights alleged to have accepted illegal political funds from deceased ex-Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong. Park last week expressed regrets over the prime minister’s resignation, saying it must have been a tough decision for Lee to step down from the post. Park appointed Lee, a veteran politician and former Saenuri floor leader, in February as part of efforts to seek momentum in her reform drive. Expectations are high on how Park will respond to the burgeoning scandal, as the opposition party raised speculations that some of the cash received by the eight politicians was used for her presidential campaign in 2012.With Park returning from her trip, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy intensified demands for her to apologize over her aides’ alleged involvement in corruption.“The president should offer a sincere apology,” said opposition leader Moon Jae-in.“A genuine apology is needed to guarantee a fair investigation into the corruption allegations involving those in power as they are suspected of using the money for her presidential campaign,” he said.Ruling party chief Kim Moo-sung, apparently concerned at the president’s falling popularity ahead of the by-election this week, said Park would deliver a public apology soon. “In the course of the prosecution’s investigation, the president will apologize, in one form or another,” he said Sunday.Kim’s remark prompted fresh speculation that Cheong Wa Dae and the governing party may have agreed in advance to deliver the president’s apology shortly as the scandal inflicted significant damage to both.The presidential office, however, denied the speculation, saying it would be inappropriate for Park to apologize when there is no concrete evidence to prove the graft allegations. Instead of an apology, the president could express regret over the prime minister’s resignation, as she was the one who appointed him, a Cheong Wa Dae official was quoted as saying.A pro-Park member at the ruling party also claimed it would be too early for her to make an official apology as she would have no other political means to seek a breakthrough if the political crisis deepens to an unfavorable issue to her and her party. The focus of the scandal can also be shifted to NPAD, as the ruling party has raised speculation that the opposition leader may have had suspicious ties with the dead businessman. Saenuri attacked NPAD, saying Sung was granted a special pardon by the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, although he was not eligible. Moon denied the speculations and accused the ruling party of attempting to divert public attention away from the scandal. Moon was Roh’s chief of staff at the time.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","the weekly cabinet meeting tuesday ,president returned from her trip ,cabinet meeting tuesday but she ,american tour last week park ,over the scandal the president","['Park Geun', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'latin american', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Cabinet', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Lee', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park', 'Kim ’s', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Saenuri', 'NPAD', 'Sung', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Roh', 'Cho Chung - un']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.507541    0.45258486

In Lima, she and her Peruvian counterpart Ollanta Humala jointly celebrated the rollout of the first basic trainer jet assembled in Peru in cooperation with South Korea’s sole aircraft manufacturer, Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. President Park Geun-hye and her Brazilian counterpart Dilma Rousseff walk to a welcoming ceremony at the presidential palace in Brasilia, Brazil, Friday. (Yonhap)Park and Humala specifically agreed to cooperate in Peru’s advanced trainer jet project, boosting South Korean hopes to win the project.In Chile, Park and her Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, agreed to upgrade the two countries’ bilateral free trade agreement to conform to the changing global trade environment. In Brazil, she and her Brazilian counterpart, Dilma Rousseff, agreed to strengthen partnership by diversifying economic cooperation.South Korea and Brazil “can become ideal partners in expanding cooperation in such high-value-added areas as infrastructure, smart grids, renewable energy and health care,” Park said in a news conference with Rousseff following their summit in Brasilia. Smart grid technology is designed to increase power system efficiency.Rousseff said Brazil and South Korea also agreed to cooperate in renewable energy to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that scientists blame for global warming.Rousseff told Park at the summit that her country can cooperate with South Korea in nuclear power generation as it does not affect climate change, according to Park’s office.South Korea and Brazil signed a set of MOUs calling for cooperation in a broader range of areas, including telemedicine and job training. Park and Rousseff observed the signing of some of the MOUs following their summit.South Korea said it expects its young skilled professionals to make inroads into Brazil’s manufacturing and information and technology sectors through the exchange of skilled workers.The move comes four months before Sao Paulo hosts the WorldSkills Competition, the world’s largest professional education event held every two years.Separately, South Korea said it would set up a “K-move center” in Brazil to help young people get jobs in Central and South American countries. So far, South Korea has been running such centers in seven countries, including the United States and Japan.Officials boasted of noticeable achievements resulting from the trip.An Chong-bum, the senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, said those South American countries voiced hope that South Korean companies would participate in infrastructure projects.The move “considerably raised the possibility that South Korean companies could make inroads into many infrastructure projects,” Ah told reporters.He also said South Korea secured a foothold in telemedicine in the South American countries as they suffer from a shortage of doctors, mostly in remote areas.Telemedicine is designed to improve access to quality care for those in medically deprived areas by using information technology, mostly the Internet.Also Saturday, Park met with hundreds of people in the Korean community in Brazil and gave them a pep talk, an aide said.Those who attended the meeting with Park included Shin Hye-ja, a 74-year-old woman who visited Seoul in 1975 along with other South Koreans living abroad. At that time, Park, as a stand-in first lady after her mother was assassinated by a North Korean agent, met Shin.Park also attended a fashion show at a hotel that included performances by K-pop stars in an apparent move to encourage people from the Korean community. K-pop stars who performed included the boy band SHINee and f(X).About 70 percent of nearly 50,000 Korean immigrants in Brazil work in the fashion industry. The fashion show drew about 700 people, including representatives of Brazilian fan clubs of “hallyu,” or the Korean wave.South Korean TV shows, films and pop music have gained wide popularity in Brazil and other South American countries in recent years beyond China and Southeast Asian countries.Park’s office said there are about 200 K-pop fan clubs in Brazil.According to Seoul government officials, 103 South Koreans arrived in Brazil in 1963 as the first group of Korean immigrants.From news reports","park also attended fashion show ,brasilia brazil friday yonhap park ,up her four nation tour ,cooperation park trip to colombia ,jet project boosting south korean","['SAO', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Colombia', 'Peru', 'Chile', 'Brazil', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Colombia', 'Park', 'Bogota', 'South Korea', 'Lima', 'peruvian', 'Ollanta Humala', 'Peru', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd.', 'Park Geun', 'brazilian', 'Dilma Rousseff', 'Brasilia', 'Brazil', 'Humala', 'Peru', 'south korean', 'Chile', 'Park', 'chilean', 'Michelle Bachelet', 'Brazil', 'brazilian', 'Dilma Rousseff', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'Park', 'Rousseff', 'Brasilia', 'Smart', 'Rousseff', 'Brazil', 'South Korea', 'Rousseff', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'Rousseff', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'Sao Paulo', 'the WorldSkills Competition', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'Chong', 'south american', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'south american', 'Park', 'korean', 'Brazil', 'Shin Hye - ja', 'Seoul', 'South Koreans', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Shin', 'korean', 'korean', 'Brazil', 'brazilian', 'korean', 'south korean tv', 'Brazil', 'south american', 'China', 'southeast asian', 'Park ’s', 'Brazil', 'Seoul', 'South Koreans', 'Brazil', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.26315668  0.55385882

It was also seen as a move to open leeway for a wider prosecutorial probe encompassing politicians from across the spectrum.The remarks came shortly after the surprise meeting with Kim at her office on Thursday afternoon, just before she left for a 12-day Latin American tour.Park calling Rep. Kim to her office in the last minute was seen as an attempt to face the snowballing graft scandal that has alleged eight political bigwigs of accepting illegal political funds from a deceased businessman in recent years. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, one of the eight, is suspected of accepting 30 million won ($27,500) in cash from the late Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong. As opposition and some ruling party lawmakers escalated their demand for his resignation, Lee continued to deny the claim and rejected the calls to step down.President Park Geun-hye shakes hands with ruling Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. (Yonhap)On the fate of the embattled prime minister, the president said she would make a decision after she returns from the trip. She returns to Seoul on April 27. The prosecution launched a special probe into the case after a memo was found from the businessman found dead in apparent suicide last week. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has been calling for an independent probe, questioning the political neutrality of the law enforcement agency.The private meeting between Park and Kim came after she urged the nation to move on from the Sewol tragedy and join hands to make the country a safer place for future generations as South Korea marked the first anniversary of the ill-fated ship on Thursday.“Now, I sincerely request the nation to move on from the pain of the Sewol, to ride out the storm and to take the path toward a new Republic of Korea,” she said in an address delivered at Paengmok Harbor on Jindo Island, South Jeolla Province. The harbor is close to the accident site where the ferry sank with more than 450 passengers aboard.“We cannot continue to be lost in grief. ... Now we should all rise and join hands to make a safe nation ― a job that must be done for our descendants,” she said.The president, dressed in a black suit, also promised to have the ship salvaged as soon as possible, and to continue efforts to recover the bodies of the nine passengers still missing since the accident.“I believe that we now have to seriously prepare for the ship’s recovery,” Park said, standing on the seawall that carried signs urging the government to salvage the ship.“The government will step up efforts to take necessary procedures and begin work to lift the ship as soon as possible,” she added.But Park’s gesture of flying out some 350 kilometers southwest of Seoul was snubbed by the bereaved families.She failed to meet any of the bereaved families of Sewol victims as they left the site in an apparent show of protest against her and the government. The president tried to get into a memorial altar on the harbor, but couldn’t as the door was blocked by tables with pictures of missing people. Paengmok Harbor has served as a shelter for the victims’ families since the accident, as they wait for the missing bodies.They have been protesting against the government’s delayed decision on salvaging the ship and an enforcement decree the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries introduced last month. Families fear that the new rules drafted by the government for the Sewol bill could interfere in an independent probe into its botched rescue mission. In the decree, the ministry said it would deploy a number of public servants to the investigation team.Later in the afternoon, she left for a 12-day overseas trip. She plans to visit Colombia, Chile, Peru and Brazil to promote diplomatic and business ties with the South American countries. The presidential office appears to have struggled to quell growing criticism of her overseas trip, as her departure was planned for the same day the nation marked the first anniversary of the Sewol tragedy. Cheong Wa Dae has also been facing the opposition party’s demand to cancel the trip as she leaves the country amid escalating graft allegations that her aides used the cash for her presidential election in 2012.

The people won’t forgive them, either,” said Park at a meeting with ministers.“Fresh allegations have been raised in the investigation process and the case should be rectified as part of political reform,” she added. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo attends the parliamentary interpellation session at the National Assembly on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The remarks came amid intensifying bipartisan pressure on Lee to leave his post. It was the first time for the president to speak up on the issue. She leaves for a 12-day Latin American tour on Thursday.The president also urged officials to take the case as an opportunity to disclose wrongdoings in the political circles hidden in the past and today.“(Political reform and cracking down on corruption) is a path to the future, economic revitalization and preventing tragedies and troubles. ... Without rooting out such practices, it is vain to make efforts for economic recovery.” The prime minister is accused of accepting 30 million won ($27,000) in cash from late Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong while Lee was running for a parliamentary seat in April 2013. Sung was found dead last Thursday with a memo in which he wrote eight names of political bigwigs including the prime minister and Park’s chief of staff Lee Byung-kee, suggesting they had received money from him.Lee denied the claim and rejected mounting calls to resign.“I, an elected official, can’t decide whether to step down or not, (after being threatened) by a memo or unilateral claims,” Lee said at an interpellation session at the National Assembly.Despite Lee’s repeated denial of graft accusations, the ruling Saenuri Party stepped up demands for Lee to resign with circumstantial evidence emerging that he accepted illegal political funds from Sung.The Kyunghyang Shinmun, quoting Sung’s aide, claimed that the businessman delivered a small box filled with cash to Lee on April 4, 2013, at his office in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province, where he was campaigning for a by-election. Making financial contributions to politicians without clarifying the donors’ names or reporting to the election watchdog is illegal in Korea. If the allegation is proven true, Lee could face up to five years in jail or a maximum fine of 10 million won.   Local cable network JTBC also reported that the two were close, contrary to the prime minister’s claim, as Sung’s diary indicated that they met 23 times over a year. With tension over allegations against Lee reaching boiling point, some leading figures in the ruling party have started to publicly demand the prime minister to voluntarily step down from the post. “How could the prime minister, who faces a corruption probe, be deputy for the president if she leaves for (Latin America) on the 16th?” said Rep. Lee Jae-oh at a party meeting.“Whether (the allegations) are true or not, the prime minister should quit on his own.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy also intensified attacks, threatening that the party would consider inquiring Lee’s impeachment if he keeps his position.“If Prime Minister Lee does not step down voluntarily, we will review impeaching him in accordance with the Constitution,” said NPAD Rep. Jung Chung-rae.Under the law, the National Assembly can introduce an impeachment motion of a president or a prime minister, if they violate rules of the Constitution or common laws. The parliament can initiate an impeachment motion against a prime minister if one-third of the lawmakers endorse it. No South Korean prime minister has been impeached.The special prosecutorial team investigating Sung’s claims raided the office of Keangnam on Wednesday afternoon and seized accounting documents, internal reports and computer hard disks, in their search for records of clandestine political donations.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","thursday the president also urged ,the election watchdog is illegal ,rejected mounting calls to resign ,an impeachment motion of president ,election watchdog is illegal","['Park Geun', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'latin american', 'Keangnam', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Park ’s', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Sung ’s', 'Lee', 'Buyeo', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'JTBC', 'Sung ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee Jae - oh', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Jung Chung - rae', 'the National Assembly', 'south korean', 'Sung ’s', 'Keangnam', 'Cho Chung - un']",16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.58882022  0.66436166

""People also won't forgive those people.""She made the strong warning as her government is reeling from the devastating corruption scandals that involved the prime minister and seven other key officials and politicians close to her.The scandals, sparked by a brief memo left behind by a businessman who committed suicide last week, dealt yet another crushing blow to Park, who has been struggling to win the hearts and minds of the people.The memo found in the pants pocket of Sung Wan-jong, the former head of a mid-size construction company, showed won figures written next to the names of six out of eight politicians, indicating that they had received money. No won figures were written next to Lee's name or that of Park's current chief of staff, Lee Byung-kee. Still, Sung claimed in a newspaper interview published Tuesday that he gave 30 million won ($27,000) in cash to Lee while Lee was running for a parliamentary seat in April 2013. Sung had the telephone interview with the newspaper just before his suicide.Lee is under mounting pressure to quit as an opposition party lawmaker threatened impeachment unless Lee step downs from the country's No. 2 public job.Lee said he cannot decide whether to quit based on the memo or what he says is a unilateral claim by the late businessman.Park said suspicions of corruption linked to the top officials must be addressed in terms of political reform.The latest scandals laid bare the country's deep-rooted corruption as well as a cozy relationship between politicians and businessmen.She also vowed to keep up the fight against corruption to make South Korea a cleaner country, noting that corruption is partly to blame for a deadly ferry disaster a year ago. She called on officials to boost safety as she visited the government building to check preparations for a memorial service for the victims of the ferry disaster.Her comment came a day before South Koreans are set to mark the first anniversary of the ferry disaster that killed more than 300 people, mostly teenage students on a school excursion. Separately, a project to create a forest near the site of the ferry disaster has garnered more than 50 million won ($45,000) in donations, a Seoul-based environmental group said Thursday.

The Abe administration has been stepping up sovereignty claims to the easternmost islets of Dokdo through diplomatic papers, school textbooks and teaching guidelines, while seeking to whitewash Japan’s atrocities during World War II, such as the sexual enslavement of Korean and other women. The ongoing relay of provocations appears to be dwarfing other formidable challenges. North Korea is being shoved to the back burner, with a protracted cross-border standoff putting at a standstill a series of initiatives that Park touted would help rebuild trust and bring forward a reunification.  Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (right) talks with the Presidential Secretary for Foreign Affairs Ju Chul-ki during an event at Cheong Wa Dae on April 2. (Yonhap)The rivalry between Washington and Beijing, each of which officials here claim to have “the best relationship ever” with, seems to be only deepening, demanding Seoul’s decision in delicate issues such as bringing in advanced U.S. missile assets and joining a China-led development bank. All of them have come together to stoke a sense of crisis, yet criticism is growing over Seoul’s facile attitude. Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se recently came under fire after he dismissed the view as “defeatist, self-deprecating and toadyish.” He said the country’s sandwiched position was a “blessing,” not a source of dilemma, urging chiefs of diplomatic missions not to “bother with irresponsible criticism that lacks agony.” A top concern is that the strain between Seoul and Tokyo is threatening to precipitate “history fatigue” in the government and academic circles in Washington, powered in part by Japan’s extensive lobbying. While acknowledging Abe’s need to address past wrongdoings, including in a planned speech at a joint session of U.S. Congress on April 29, more people there are leaning toward the view that regardless of what the premier says, it will be unlikely to meet South Korea’s expectations, diplomatic sources say. Some also raise issue with the Park government’s strictly rigid attitude and lack of practical approach, which they say hinders a crucial three-way partnership to fend off rising North Korean threats. At a seminar in Washington in late February, Wendy Sherman, undersecretary for political affairs at the U.S. Department of State, called disagreements on history and territory issues between South Korea, Japan and China “frustrating,” taking a veiled swipe at Seoul. “Nationalist feelings can still be exploited, and it’s not hard for a political leader anywhere to earn cheap applause by vilifying a former enemy,” she said. In an interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun released Wednesday, newly minted U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called for enhancing trilateral security cooperation between the U.S., South Korea and Japan, saying the three nations must “look toward the future.” “The U.S. appreciates the historical sensitivities in this relationship, but we believe the potential gains of cooperation ― the opportunities that exist for both our two long-time allies, and the entire region ― outweigh yesterday’s tensions and today’s politics,” he said. With pressure increasing for a foreign policy legacy, experts and even some officials stress that South Korea should devise a more active and realistic strategy and ramp up diplomacy with the U.S. to induce a sincere apology and repentant attitude toward history from the Abe administration. The government and ruling Saenuri Party agreed Wednesday to set up a task force to better handle relations with Japan and expand cooperation between the sides. During a meeting of Yun and lawmakers, Rep. Na Kyung-won, chair of the National Assembly’s foreign affairs and unification committee, criticized Seoul’s responses to Tokyo’s territorial and historical provocations as “repetitive, routinely and rhetorical.” “I think the time has come for a fundamental review of our ‘quiet diplomacy’ given that Japan is ratcheting up its claim to Dokdo,” Na said.“We are struck out while Abe is playing fire with history,” a diplomatic source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “There need to be more thorough strategies and tactics and action plans for future provocations. It’s better late than never.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","whitewash japan atrocities during world ,seeking to whitewash japan atrocities ,to whitewash japan atrocities during ,whitewash japan atrocities during ,geun hye third year diplomacy","['Japan', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'korean', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Ju Chul - ki', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'Japan', 'Abe ’s', 'U.S. Congress', 'South Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'Wendy Sherman', 'the U.S. Department of State', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Seoul', 'nationalist', 'the Yomiuri Shimbun', 'U.S.', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Abe', 'Saenuri Party', 'Japan', 'Na Kyung - won', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22605693  0.71133161

The two have held two previous summits -- one in 2000 and the other in 2007.Conservative and progressive forces here are split over whether Park should accept Russia's invitation.The senior South Korean government official indicated a negative view within the administration.It's a matter of whether Park can have a ""substantive dialogue"" when she meets with the North's leader, he told reporters on background.""The government remains open to an inter-Korean summit any time. But we have said it should be held for a substantive dialogue,"" he said. Some people say Park's meeting with Kim, albeit brief, would be of significance itself but ""we need to think about how meaningful it would be,"" he added. On Pyongyang's protest against the cross-border spread of propaganda leaflets, the official said there is no guarantee of resuming talks even if the South curbs the campaign.The North has urged the South to prevent leaflet scattering by activists here, which Seoul views as a matter related to the freedom of speech.The official also stressed the need for developing the so-called Korean Peninsula Trust-Building Process aimed at building mutual trust and paving the way for re-unification.""The policy represents our will to make ceaseless efforts for a change in North Korea,"" he said, adding that it takes two to tango.As to two South Korean men detained in the communist nation on espionage charges, he said that sending a special envoy to Pyongyang for their release is not a realistic option being considered.He cited the unique characteristics of inter-Korean ties.Last month, the North said it arrested the two, who entered its territory through China, claiming they worked for the South's National Intelligence Service.

Under the previous plan, the presidential office was to take a central role in responding to cyberattacks coordinating with related agencies, including the National Intelligence Service, the Korean National Police Agency and the Ministry of Future Strategy, without forming a new team for the purpose.  President Park Geun-hye speaks at a Cabinet meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)Despite the efforts, cybersecurity fears have increased in Seoul following a alleged hacking by Pyongyang on nuclear power plants and on Sony Pictures Entertainment in the United States in December.Park’s new security team is expected to build a new response system by recruiting top experts on cyberterrorism.“The office is designed to enhance (South Korea’s) cybersecurity capabilities, with the National Security Office taking a central role as a control tower,” Park’s spokesperson Min Kyung-wook told reporters. A civil expert on cyberterrorism is expected to lead the new team, with working-level officials from relevant ministries also joining the group.President Park has reiterated the importance of enhancing the nation’s cybersecurity capabilities, stressing that the security situation on the peninsula has become unpredictable.“North Korea could manipulate public opinion and fuel social unrest through cyberspace, without having to (physically) enter South Korea,” Park said in a security meeting with top officials in early March.Apart from hacking attempts on the South’s nuclear reactors, North Korea is also suspected of trying to attack the control systems of public transportation in South Korea, including railway and subway systems, according to a recent report by the Institute for National Security Strategy.The North Korean regime has been nurturing thousands of “cyberterrorists,” said the institute, an affiliate to the nation’s spy agency. North Korea is known to operate a cyberwarfare unit of 1,700 elite hackers who are trained to break into computer networks to steal information and distribute malware. About 1,000 North Korean hackers are stationed in Asian countries, including China, Malaysia and Cambodia, disguising themselves as IT experts operating online gambling sites. Under the direction of Pyongyang, they have been carrying out cyberattacks on South Korea’s public and private entities to paralyze their networks, the report said.In 2013, three South Korean banks ― Shinhan, NongHyup and Jeju ― and their insurance affiliates, as well as three TV broadcasters ― KBS, MBC and YTN ― were hit by a cyberattack as malicious code infected some 48,000 computers in their networks.The U.S. has also recently imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea over its alleged hacking to protest the comedy film “The Interview,” which depicts a plot to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-un. The FBI has concluded that North Korea was behind the attack. Pyongyang denied its involvement, but described the attack as “a righteous deed.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","her cabinet approved proposal tuesday ,out cyberattacks on south korea ,dae on tuesday park hyun ,governmental countermeasures announced in 2013 ,recruiting top experts on cyberterrorism","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'the Korean National Police Agency', 'the Ministry of Future Strategy', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'the United States', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'the National Security Office', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Institute for National Security Strategy', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'asian', 'China', 'Malaysia', 'Cambodia', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'NongHyup', 'Jeju ―', 'KBS', 'MBC', 'YTN', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'FBI', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Cho Chung - un']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.05362402  0.46075016

Former Unification Minister Chung Dong-young (center) announces his bid for Seoul`s Gwanak-B constituencey at his office in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)“Unfortunately, (my party) was not able to nominate any candidate for any of the constituencies. If we are left empty-handed in this election, we can never build a new opposition party as an alternative to the current dynamics. That is why I decided to throw myself into the race,” the former presidential candidate and former opposition party chairman said.Pundits said his move appeared to reflect his determination to create a new opposition force. “Chung’s move may be part of an attempt to make a deal with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. Now that the 2016 general election is approaching, he wants to bring the main opposition party to the table to forge a coalition with his party,” said Yun Seong-yi, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University The by-elections will fill three seats, in Seoul, Gwangju and Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, vacated by the Unified Progressive Party following its dissolution by the Constitutional Court in December. A seat in Incheon is also being contested.Analysts expect the ruling Saenuri Party to win in Seoul and Seongnam, while the main opposition party would likely win in Incheon and Gwangju ― considered its stronghold.With Chung throwing his hat into the ring, the opposition candidate in Gwanak is likely to face a tougher competition, observers said.Chung left the NPAD in January, saying that he was frustrated by the party’s failure to meet the demands of the people. He accused the party of being right-leaning and losing its liberal value. He then moved to build his own party which he believes better represents his political view. His decision has been met with harsh criticism from both ruling and opposition party members. They accused him of acting only in his personal political interests. Some even called him a “migratory politician,” a derogative term to refer to Korean politicians who frequently switch political allegiance. “(Chung’s decision) shows how divided the opposition parties are,” said Kim Moo-sung, the leader of the ruling party. “As witnessed by the North Korea sympathizer case, we shouldn’t tolerate opposition parties’ unruly association with political parties with which who they don’t share the same ideology.” Mindful of the repercussions, NPAD leader Moon Jae-in also expressed discomfort toward Chung’s move. “We won’t build a coalition with Chung’s new party,” said Moon “This by-election is all about holding the Park administration accountable for their misguided policies and laying the ground for taking back the government. In that sense, I am baffled whether Chung made the decision that would live up to people’s aspiration.”A former journalist, Chung entered politics as a lawmaker in 1996. Afterward, he served as unification minister during the Roh Moo-hyun administration and went on to run in the 2007 presidential election as the main opposition party candidate.

Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.Also in Singapore, Park met with Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao and called for close consultation between Seoul and Beijing for the success of the China-led regional development bank.Park's comments came three days after South Korea agreed to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as one of its founding members.Many experts see the bank meant to fund infrastructure projects in Asia as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, which have been dominated by the U.S. and other Western economies.Park also briefly met with former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who led the U.S. delegation to Lee's funeral ceremony.

Speaking at a ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary of Pyongyang’s torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan at the national cemetery in Daejeon, Park also called for a robust deterrence based on the country’s alliance with the U.S. to fend off the North’s possible provocations.“The North should dismiss the thought that nuclear arms would protect it,” Park told a gathering of some 5,000 people who paid their tributes to the 46 victims of the 2010 attack that were laid to rest at the cemetery.  President Park Geun-hye pays tribute at a ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary of Pyongyang’s torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan at the national cemetery in Daejeon on Thursday. (The Korea Herald)“We would only be able to create a new Korean Peninsula when the North shakes off its isolation and comes forward on a path toward genuine change.” The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs hosted the event. Among the participants were Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, ruling Saenri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.Park has attended the memorial event each year, except for last year when she was in Europe to attend the Nuclear Security Summit in the Netherlands and other countries.Touching on a recent series of corruption scandals involving former and current senior Navy officials, Park vowed to root out irregularities in the defense industry, portraying malpractices in the acquisition of military equipment as “acts of treachery.” “I hope our military continues to maintain a strong defense and preparedness to block any possible provocations by our enemy, and fight and definitely win whatever provocations may occur unexpectedly,” she said. “(Corruption scandals) are shameful before the graves of these victims of the attack on the Cheonan.”A series of corruption scandals have triggered public anger and concerns that seemingly deep-seated malpractices in the defense industry could weaken South Korea’s defense against the North’s continued military threats.Former Chiefs of Naval Operations Hwang Ki-chul and Chung Ok-keun have been detained on corruption allegations including those regarding the acquisition of an advanced salvage ship, Tongyeong.The Cheonan sank in the West Sea while on a routine patrol mission near the Northern Limit Line, a de facto inter-Korean sea border on March 26, 2010. A Seoul-led multinational probe team concluded that a midget North Korean submarine torpedoed the 1,200-ton vessel, breaking it into two parts.Seoul has demanded that Pyongyang recognize its responsibility for the sinking and punish those responsible for the attack. But Pyongyang has denied it, calling the investigation results a complete fabrication. The impoverished state has demanded that the South lift economic sanctions imposed on it after the torpedo attack. But Seoul has stuck to its demand that the North accept its culpability for the attack, despite growing calls for Seoul to take a flexible approach toward Pyongyang to break the deadlock in cross-border relations.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","pyongyang to break the deadlock ,renounce reckless provocations and nuclear ,pyongyang to renounce reckless provocations ,cemetery in daejeon on thursday ,senior navy officials park vowed","['Park Geun - hye', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Daejeon', 'U.S.', 'north', 'Park Geun', 'Pyongyang', 'Daejeon', 'the Korea Herald)“We', 'the Ministry of Patriots', 'Veterans Affairs', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Saenri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Netherlands', 'Navy', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'North ’s', 'Chiefs of Naval Operations', 'Chung Ok - keun', 'Tongyeong', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Sang - ho']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.02842654  1.06518233

She said labor reform is a key to job creation, especially for young people.One of the key issues of South Korea's labor market is a divide between regular workers and non-regular workers.Critics say regular workers are being overprotected, a development that causes some companies to shun recruitment and instead rely on non-regular workers that they can fire more easily.Last month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 mostly rich nations, said South Korea needs to break down its labor market duality to boost productivity and encourage more female employment.Labor market duality refers to the difference in pay and job security between regular and non-regular workers in the country.

The meeting has caught attention as Seoul is deliberating over its decision to participate in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in the face of opposition from the U.S. as well as growing controversy over Washington’s possible dispatch of its Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system here. The presidential office played down the significance of the meeting, saying that it was arranged for foreign ministers to pay a courtesy call to Park before holding a trilateral talk. But expectations are high over what message the South Korean president will deliver to top diplomats of Japan and China, not only on the highly sensitive issues of the AIIB and THAAD, but also on territorial and other historic disputes. It will be Park’s first meeting with a Japanese foreign minister since she entered office in early 2013. The diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan have long been strained by historical and territorial rows. Park rejected Japanese leader Shinzo Abe’s repeated calls for a summit as Tokyo has refused to face up to its wartime atrocities, such as its sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women during World War II. China and Japan also have been sparring over a territorial dispute involving islands in the East China Sea, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Later in the afternoon, South Korea, Japan and China are set to hold the first foreign ministers’ meeting in three years. The talk is aimed at rekindling the momentum for trilateral cooperation over a wide range of regional issues as well as to establish the groundwork for a three-way summit among the leaders of the three countries within the year.Yun also plans to hold separate meetings with his Japanese and Chinese counterparts on the sidelines of the trilateral talks. The top Chinese diplomat is expected to press Yun to clarify Seoul’s position over the possible stationing of THAAD, a core asset of the U.S. global multilayered missile shield program, as well as its participation in the AIIB.Chinese officials expressed their opposition to THAAD as they suspect that the U.S. may consider using the system not only against North Korea but also against other potential adversaries such as China and Russia. Seoul has reiterated its position that there has been “no request” from the U.S., “no consultations” with the ally and “no decision” reached.The top South Korean diplomat is expected to address the contentious issue of “comfort women” who were forced to sex slavery to Japanese troops during World War II, and urge Tokyo for its apology.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan. Park has repeatedly demanded that Japan show a sincere attitude toward historic disputes as a prerequisite for a summit with Abe.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","ministers meeting between korea china ,japan the president will meet ,tricky diplomatic issues including washington ,china and japan on saturday ,foreign ministers meeting between korea","['Park Geun', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'asian', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Korea', 'Wang Yi', 'China', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Japan', 'Park ’s', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Terminal High - Altitude Area Defense', 'Park', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'China', 'AIIB', 'Park', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'asian', 'China', 'Japan', 'Senkaku', 'Japan', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Yun', 'japanese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'aiib.chinese', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Park', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Cho Chung - un']",10,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.51445842  0.58258718

Gangneung lies east of PyeongChang and will stage hockey and skating events during the Olympics.At a press conference, Lindberg said she was ""satisfied with the progress, particularly in construction"" by the host.""A lot of work still needs to be done here, but we leave Gangneung very satisfied with the progress,"" she said. ""We're convinced that all the venues will be ready for the test events (in early 2016) and the Olympic Games. This positive momentum now needs to be continued to allow the organizing committee and Korea to deliver its vision and commitments. PyeongChang and its partners will need to focus simultaneously on multiple objectives.""PyeongChang has been under pressure to speed up its preparations, and its construction delays and lack of corporate sponsorships have been well documented.Organizers here have had to fend off speculation that they'd been asked to consider moving some events to outside PyeongChang, or even outside South Korea, to help save costs. Then last week, Cho Yang-ho, president of the organizing committee, declared that PyeongChang isn't considering co-hosting the Olympics, saying only natural disasters that affect pre-existing venue plans would alter the committee's stance.While those calling for sharing the Games say doing so would help PyeongChang financially, organizers counter that it makes little economic sense to co-host the Olympics. They reason that building additional infrastructure -- such as athletes' residence and media centers -- would lead to extra costs.On Thursday, Lindberg sided with the organizers' sentiment, flatly rejecting any talk of making PyeongChang co-host the Olympics. After the IOC's project review on PyeongChang's preparations in January, Lindberg had said the host's venue master plan was ""finalized,"" and she reiterated her position.""I approved the venue master plan in January and all the venues are confirmed both for the test events and the Olympic Games,"" she said. ""(Any talk of co-hosting) was closed in January.""Pressed further to offer any criticism on PyeongChang's work, Lindberg said Olympic hosts are always bound to experience challenges along the way.""I don't remember if we've ever had an organizing committee that didn't have some kind of difficulties,"" she said. ""We've identified them with President Cho and we've moved forward. I thank him for his quick action, and we have to focus on the future.""Lindberg also said the Integration Working Group, a joint task force with representatives from PyeongChang, the IOC and the local government, held its inaugural meeting this week. The entity was formed to help expedite the decision-making process, and Lindberg said the first meeting put all those involved in the right direction.""We discussed close cooperation and also addressed the importance of getting the venues ready,"" she said. ""We also discussed how to have quick decisions about the budget.""Cho called the IOC's visit and a subsequent series of meetings ""a turning point"" for PyeongChang.""Based on the feedback that we have received over the past week, we will work on issues that need to be addressed and further strengthen things we've done well so far,"" he said. ""We will shift our focus from construction to operations. With the issue of co-hosting behind us, we will move forward aggressively and with momentum.""Lindberg identified a lack of international experts in winter sports in South Korea as ""a critical area."" Lindberg pointed out that experts from overseas should be coming to PyeongChang to first help the local organizers for the test events and then to help the Olympic organizing committee ""to fully understand the administration of the Olympic Games.""Kwak Young-jin, the committee's secretary general, responded that the committee has so far hired four experts from overseas, and will add seven more starting next month. Separately, 28 consultants will be brought on board to provide operational assistance.

It was two years after Moon took a back seat in his party after he was defeated in the presidential election in 2012. Moon told Park that her entire economic policies had left the economy in great danger and failed to improve the quality of people’s lives, which were her major campaign pledges.  Moon Jae-in (center) pays his respects at the grave of former President Roh Moo-hyun in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province, Wednesday. (Yonhap)Park’s apparent discomfort failed to stop Moon, as he continued on using words such as “failure,” “all-around crisis” and “broken campaign pledges.”Moon, who had been buttressing his political platform with the focus on the economy and welfare since he won the chairmanship of the party last month, appeared confident and ready to steal Park’s spotlight.Moon continued his offense the next day, slamming the president that she had no critical views over contentious economic issues nor any measures prepared to resolve the problems.“I realized that (she and I) still had different standpoints over ways of assessing the reality of the economy and resolving the problem,” he said during a supreme council meeting.“The government appears to have no countermeasures to resolve problems with corporate tax, rising short- and long-term rent prices and households’ debts.” The opposition leader also stressed that he would meet Park on a regular basis, indicating he will continue to flex his new political muscle. “We must not expect too much at the first attempt. We have to work together and meet frequently to give hope to the people,” he said. Encouraged by the boosted mood, Moon made high-profile appearances on Wednesday, starting off with a visit to the graveyard of late former President Roh Moo-hyun, whom he had worked for in Cheong Wa Dae as the Chief Secretary.“I will resurrect your spirits through history,” Moon wrote in the guestbook at Bonghwa village near Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province.This was followed by an intense debate session with the conservative governor of the region Hong Joon-pyo, who recently stirred controversy on free school meals.Hong, the former chairman of the ruling party, scrapped the free meal program and said he would selectively provide free meals to low-income families. The NPAD has been opposing his decision that it would leave students from low-income families feeling embarrassed.Moon held the governor responsible that he unilaterally suspended the nationwide program in the province based only on his “false conviction.”“Providing meals to all children is part of compulsory education,” said Moon during a meeting with Hong in his office. “Children in South Gyeongsang Province should not be discriminated over school meals due to political calculation,” he said.Critics said that intensifying his image by confronting the president and engaging verbal battle with the conservatives would help Moon unify the opposition that has been suffering from an escalating interparty feud. But, on the other hand, he should step cautiously as his bold moves may fail to secure more votes from the centrist forces, a crucial task if he wants to win the next presidential election, said professor Yoon Sung-yi of Kyung Hee University.The upcoming April 29 by-election is expected to be a test for him, as it was viewed as a barometer of public sentiments one year ahead of the general election next year.Critics say that Moon should not just confront Park but also cooperate with her from time-to-time for the greater good.

Moon Jae-in, however, blasted Park’s overall economic policies during a three-way meeting at Cheong Wa Dae ― the Blue House ― that her measures have failed to improve people’s livelihoods and have left the economy in “great danger.”Park met with the leaders of the two main parties to seek support for her reform drive, which has stalled amid political wrangling between ruling and opposition party lawmakers.The president asked ruling Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in to help her reform package receive parliamentary endorsement this year, the midpoint of her five-year term that ends in early 2018. Park had invited the two leaders for a meeting last week to discuss the achievements from her recent trip to the Middle East. “I wish that the two leaders (of the main two parties would) help us build the foundation for (another) economic development by linking the outcome and achievements from the trip,” Park said during the meeting. “Partnership with the political (parties) is essential,” she added.But the opposition leader lashed out at Park’s overall economic policies, stressing that they lack fundamental and long-term elements to raise the real disposable income level of Korean households. “The president has tried to revive the people’s livelihood after taking great pains, but the government’s economic policies have failed to improve their quality of life,” he said. “(The) South Korean economy is in all-around crisis.” President Park Geun-hye talks with New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Moon Jae-in (right) and Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Park’s meeting with the political leaders drew public attention as it was Park’s first face-to-face meeting with Moon, her former presidential election rival, since 2012.Since taking over the party’s chairmanship last month, Moon has been intensifying his criticism against Park’s economic and welfare policies. The opposition leader urged Park to revise her economic policies and pursue economic growth by raising the minimum wage, establishing a fair tax system and stabilizing prices in Korea’s long-term leasing system.On inter-Korean relations, Moon also asked the president to hold a summit with the North Korean leader this year. NPAD will fully support Park if she makes the move, Moon said.Park’s hosting of the three-way meeting was seen as an attempt to cast off her uncommunicative image and request bipartisan support for her reform drive and pending economy-related bills.While presiding over the weekly cabinet meeting earlier in the day, Park said, “We need to take stern action against the corruptive practices that have accumulated not only in the defense industry, but also in other sectors of our society.” Park’s remark, delivered in an unusually strong tone, came amid ongoing investigations into the defense industry over graft allegations and into private companies suspected of creating slush funds. Her comments followed Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo’s statement last week to fight against corruptive cases, both in the public and the private sector.The president labeled corruption as a stumbling block for economic revitalization, as well as for her reform drive. “For a long time, I have been thinking that we must eradicate such practices at all costs. To revive the economy, we cannot leave corruption as it is,” she said.“If we achieve economic growth without correcting corruptive practices, it will be like spinning wheels (that don’t move forward),” she added.The president called for an early implementation of reform in the public sector and labor market by next month, as well as a revamp of the public servants’ pension system. A group of politicians, union workers and experts launched a national committee to start a discussion on the reform of the civil servants’ pension program. Park said “meaningful progress” has been made with the group starting the discussion and she hopes lawmakers can reach an agreement and work on the bill’s legislation.The president also urged ministers to push ahead with the reform drive, reiterating that it is required to achieve sustainable economic growth and for future generations.Last week, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo declared an “all-out war” on corruption and vowed to root out irregularities by mobilizing all possible resources. In 2014, Park said she would have the Prime Minister lead her reform drive aimed at eliminating corruptive practices and breaking down unnecessary regulations in four sectors: labor, education, finance and public office.Authorities have been expanding probes into irregularities, including the military procurement process and alleged embezzlement into a construction unit of steel giant POSCO.Three subcontractors for POSCO Engineering and Construction were raided by the prosecution and a former naval chief was questioned on Tuesday. The raid occurred over the allegation that he received bribes in exchange for conniving in the illegal transactions of parts from a domestically developed salvage ship in 2009.

The two leaders will sign the pact on Monday and request respective parliamentary endorsements afterward. Under the pact, the two sides agreed to eliminate New Zealand’s import tariffs on 92 percent of all shipments from South Korea in terms of their value and remove all tariffs on South Korean products within seven years after the implementation of the deal. South Korea will reciprocate by removing tariffs on 96.4 percent of shipments from New Zealand over a 15-year period when the deal goes into effect. The two sides have agreed to exclude some products from the deal, mostly agricultural goods such as rice that are considered very sensitive in South Korea.In 2013, bilateral trade between the two countries came to $2.8 billion, making New Zealand the 44th-largest trading partner of South Korea. South Korea is New Zealand’s 41st-largest trading partner, according to the ministry.New Zealand is the third-largest beef exporter to Korea, following Australia and the United States.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","seoul next week to ink ,korea for three day trip ,counterpart in seoul next week ,in seoul next week ,seoul three times since 2010","['Park Geun', 'New Zealand', 'Seoul', 'New Zealand', 'John Key', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'FTA', 'G20', 'Australia', 'New Zealand ’s', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'New Zealand', 'South Korea', 'New Zealand', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'New Zealand ’s', 'New Zealand', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'the United States', 'Cho Chung - un']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5396378   0.48397672

We must not fear failure and push forward,"" the new minister of oceans and fisheries was quoted as saying.  ""However, in the case of safety, we must thoroughly guard against any failure.""  The ministry is still reeling from the sinking of the passenger ship, Sewol, in April that killed more than 300 people, mostly high school students on a school excursion.  Investigations showed that the ministry and other agencies that are in charge of public safety had been lax in their inspections and in their immediate responses to the tragedy.   ""Through a series of accidents, we have come up with a number of (safety) measures while also making significant improvements to the law and the system. But we must check thoroughly to see how such changes are actually applied out in the field,"" Yoo said.  He also vowed to develop the country's fishery industry, partly by boosting its exports.  ""I will work with those in the fishing industry to make the Korea-China free trade agreement open up China's vast market into a great chance to increase exports,"" he said.  Yoo, a lawyer-turned-lawmaker, is a native of Busan, the country's largest port city.

Lee’s predecessor Lee Byung-ki was appointed as Park’s new chief of staff. The nominee is subject to a confirmation hearing, though no parliamentary approval is required. Lee was widely expected to face a relatively easy hearing, as no major allegations of wrongdoing have been found. But the main opposition party plans to challenge him over his conservative disposition at the session.“Nominee Lee seems to have excessively conservative (views),” the New Politics Alliance for Democracy said in a statement, adding that it would examine whether he is qualified to remain politically neutral if he becomes the chief of the agency. In a column written by Lee in 2009, the nominee likened the protests by evictees in a Seoul redevelopment in the district of Yongsan as an “insurrection” and insisted that the enforcement agencies should take the controversial crackdown on them as a lesson to reestablish their authority. NPAD suggested that some students who heard his lectures at Ulsan University between 2010 and 2014 have described him as strongly politicized and conservative.The hearing came amid growing demand for a massive reform of the National Intelligence Agency to prevent it from interfering in political affairs.The NIS has suffered from public distrust after a string of political scandals. The nation’s top spy agency has been accused of interfering in the 2012 presidential election, revealing a transcript of a 2007 inter-Korean summit and fabricating court evidence in an espionage scandal. Under the law, the agency should remain politically neutral.The main opposition party also claimed that Lee was unfit to lead the NIS as he has been critical of the NPAD’s demands to reform the agency.In a contribution article published by newspaper the DongA Ilbo, Lee denounced the Democratic Party, which reformed as the NPAD, saying that the proposal was like “burning the whole house just to get rid of the bedbug.”The opposition party was seeking to attack him during the hearing session but it appears to have not found evidence of strong enough wrongdoing to make his appointment untenable.NPAD lawmakers were expected to question him about allegations that his two sons avoided paying national health insurance premiums but no critical issue that could strike a blow to Lee himself.A NPAD official was quoted by Yonhap Agency that he had stayed away from the NIS for a long time, and that the party has no information about him as he worked in international affairs for a considerable time. Lee, after graduating the Military Academy, served in various posts including the director at the department of international affairs and the deputy chief of the NIS. He also worked as South Korean ambassador to Malaysia.The ruling Saenuri Party, for its part, was expected to question his ability to deal with escalating fear of cyberterrorism involving North Korea. But it said that the opposition party should stop politicizing the hearing session and concentrate on testing his ethical standards and abilities. The NPAD has been boycotting another parliamentary confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice nominee.Park Sang-ok, a former prosecutor, was nominated as Supreme Court judge in January, but a group of NPAD lawmakers have been refusing to attend a hearing session for him, due to his role in the 1987 investigation of police officers accused of torturing a student activist to death. The prosecution came under fire after a revelation by Catholic priests that there were more police officers involved in the torture than those it had indicted. The NPAD has claimed that the justice nominee was responsible for the cover-up and urged him to voluntarily withdraw from nomination.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","boycotting another parliamentary confirmation hearing ,presidential election revealing transcript ,reforming the agency monday lee ,been boycotting another parliamentary confirmation ,2012 presidential election revealing transcript","['Lee Byung - ho', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Lee', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee', 'Lee Byung - ki', 'Park ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Yongsan', 'Ulsan University', 'the National Intelligence Agency', 'NIS', 'inter - korean', 'Lee', 'NIS', 'DongA Ilbo', 'Lee', 'the Democratic Party', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Yonhap Agency', 'NIS', 'Lee', 'the Military Academy', 'NIS', 'south korean', 'Malaysia', 'Saenuri Party', 'North Korea', 'NPAD', 'Supreme Court', 'Park Sang - ok', 'Supreme Court', 'NPAD', 'catholic', 'NPAD', 'Cho Chung - un']",16,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.22493805 0.15890838 0.18624382]

It was the first time Park invited the five leaders to detail the outcome of an overseas trip. The meeting came before she is to meet Saenuri Party Chairman Kim Moo-sung and New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Moon Jae-in next Tuesday to discuss the results of the Middle East tour.During Park’s trip, she and Korean business leaders accompanying her focused on diversifying cooperation with Middle Eastern partners in preparation for the “post-oil era.” The resource-rich nations exhibited their interest in cooperation with Korean firms in various areas including information and communication technology, medicine and health care.South Korean firms signed a total of 44 deals ― worth 1 trillion won combined ― with some 260 business partners in the region on cooperation in infrastructure construction and other economic sectors. Another achievement for Park was the agreement with Saudi Arabia to seek opportunities to build more than two small and medium-sized nuclear reactors in the Gulf nation ― projects that may be worth as much as $2 billion.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","reinvigorate korea economy and strengthen ,park invited the five leaders ,boom to help our economy ,friday called on the leaders ,park invited national assembly speaker","['Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Supreme Court', 'Yang Seung - tae', 'Constitutional Court', 'Park Han', 'National Election Commission', 'Lee In - bok', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Kuwait', 'Saudi Arabia', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Qatar', 'Yang', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'korean', 'middle eastern', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Park', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49009791  0.84407109

Kim Moo-sung, chair of the ruling Saenuri Party; and Rep. Moon Jae-in, leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. Visiting Washington officials also stopped by, including Adm. James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Wendy Cutler, the acting U.S. deputy trade representative. Twitter and other social networks are also brimming with cheers and praises, while a slew of Christian, conservative and other interest groups held rallies and cultural events dedicated to Lippert. During his visit to the hospital, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said Lippert would be able to leave soon “in a very good condition.” “I said we should work together again to build an alliance that never bends to any threat going forward, and that can overcome any crisis and challenge,” he told reporters after the visit.Medical officials said that of the 80 stitches to the envoy’s face, around half of them were removed early Monday and the remainder to be before he leaves the hospital.As part of follow-up treatment, medical staff plan to visit his residence on Saturday, with the cast on his wrist to be completely taken off in three to four weeks, they said. “He will likely be released tomorrow afternoon. … The ambassador has been expressing his willingness to get back to work as soon as possible,” said Yoon Do-heum, general-director of the hospital. Lippert is recovering smoothly, though he appeared slightly tired after receiving guests and took some painkillers late Sunday due to minor pain in the wrist and a headache, according to Chung Nam-sik, president and chief executive of the Yonsei University Health System. “The ambassador is being well taken care of and recovering quicker than we thought, which I think is because he had normally been in good health,” he said at a media briefing.

The president went straight from the airport to Yonsei Severance Hospital, where Lippert has been treated since last week, reflecting her priority in reaffirming the Korea-U.S. alliance.  President Park Geun-hye talks about her four-nation tour of the Middle East with the traveling press on board the presidential plane Monday. (Yonhap)During her Mideast tour, Park called Lippert and made official statements twice about the incident, stressing that it should not damage on Korea-U.S. alliance. Park is also facing escalating disputes over an anticorruption bill that passed last week. The landmark antigraft bill bans not only public officials but also journalists and school staff from taking more than 1 million won in gifts. But the decision has invited fresh criticism, as some parts of the law were vague and likely unconstitutional. Opponents said it was put to a vote without careful consideration.The president said she would also seek a meeting with leaders of the ruling and the opposition parties to request their assistance for the passage of economic reform bills pending at parliament.Wrapping up her tour to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, Park said South Korea has built a deep trust in the region to expand bilateral economic ties. “All of the leaders I met (during the tour) have expressed their deep trust in South Koreans in terms of competitiveness, techniques, professionalism and sincerity,” she said aboard the presidential plane, adding that building trust was the top priority when doing business with the Middle East.During a summit, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thanion said he ordered local firms in the wealthy Gulf states to preferentially treat Korean firms who are bidding for infrastructure projects. Qatar, host of the 2022 World Cup, plans to spend about $100 billion on construction projects including railroads, expressways, harbors and stadiums.South Korean officials said they expected to participate in $29 billion worth of infrastructure projects in the future, including the construction of the main stadium, railway and sewage processing. “As we have hosted (the event) before, I told him not only infrastructure building but also security is important,” she said. “I promised to help Qatar host the event successfully through bilateral cooperation.”The South Korean president also said she would support young workers wishing to work abroad, including in the Middle East. “I have seen a lot of work opportunities in the Middle East for young people in the field of law, medical services and culture. I have given thought that I should help let them display their abilities even in overseas markets,” she said.According to local pollster Realmeter, Park’s job rating rebounded to near 40 percent last week, a 4 percentage point increase from the previous week. The sharp increase appears to have followed her achievements on the Middle East trip and the return of conservative supporters in the wake of an unexpected attack against the U.S envoy, the pollster said. South Korean authorities have been looking into the case and its possible link with pro-North Korean forces.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","the presidential plane monday yonhap ,korean president also said she ,doha to seoul on sunday ,extremist last week the president ,trip monday with substantial diplomatic","['Park Geun', 'Doha', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'south korean', 'Yonsei Severance Hospital', 'Lippert', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Lippert', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Kuwait', 'Saudi Arabia', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Qatar', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Qatari', 'Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thanion', 'korean', 'Qatar', 'south korean', 'Qatar', 'south korean', 'U.S', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Cho Chung - un']",7,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.76683784  0.81912416

South Korea hopes that its companies can secure some of the projects.Park and Al Thani also observed the signing of a memorandum of understanding calling for cooperation on training nuclear experts and on building a nuclear reactor for medical and other research purposes.South Korea said the MOU could help its companies win projects in case Qatar decides to build nuclear reactors in the future.The move came just days after Park and Saudi Arabia's new monarch observed the signing of an MOU calling for a joint partnership on a nuclear reactor developed by South Korea for export to water-scarce countries, including the Middle East.South Korea said the MOU could help its companies win a US$2 billion project to build two mid-size commercial reactors in Saudi Arabia if the desert kingdom decides to build the reactors after a preliminary review set to end by 2018.In Kuwait, Park held talks with Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and sought his interest and assistance to ensure that South Korean companies can participate in industrial and infrastructure projects in the oil-rich country.In Abu Dhabi, Park was upbeat over an MOU on cooperation on halal food products as it could give Seoul access to the huge global halal market, which is expected to grow to $1.62 trillion by 2018.Halal is an Arabic word meaning ""lawful"" or ""permitted."" Halal food is prepared according to religious rules for Muslims, but 80 percent of the food comes from non-Muslim countries and companies, according to South Korea.

Park met with then Saudi Crown Prince Salman on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies in Brisbane, Australia, in November.Park and Salman are expected to discuss ways to boost cooperation in a wide range of sectors from nuclear energy, construction and health care to information and communications technology, according to Park's office. They are also expected to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in diplomatic and security issues amid unrest in the Middle East.South Korea, the world's fifth-largest crude oil buyer, relies entirely on imports for its oil needs. Saudi Arabia accounts for about one-third of South Korea's total imports of crude oil.Park also plans to meet with Crown Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, Salman's youngest brother, and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef al-Saud as part of efforts to build confidence with the ruling family.Saudi Arabia is the second stop on Park's four-nation swing that will take her to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.In Kuwait, Park held talks with Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and sought his interest and assistance to ensure that South Korean companies can participate in industrial and infrastructure projects in the oil-rich country.Last year, South Korean companies secured deals worth US$7.8 billion in Kuwait, the third-largest market for South Korean builders. For decades, oil-rich Middle Eastern countries have been a major source of revenue for South Korean builders.Park's Mideast tour comes as oil-rich regional countries are seeking to diversify their economic portfolios ahead of the inevitable advent of a post-oil era. A plunge in oil prices in recent months has also highlighted the need to diversify the economy that is heavily dependent on oil.

Kim has been accused by the opposition of exercising too much power in state affairs and personnel choices.Lee, one of Park’s closest aides, has led the National Intelligence Service since June.

She appointed former Saenuri floor leader Lee Wan-koo as new prime minister and replaced the maritime, transport and unification ministers. She has been facing demands both from the ruling and the main opposition parties to start afresh with a new lineup amid deepening public distrust of her policy directions on economy and welfare.Her choice of Lee as chief of staff was rather surprising as he was not mentioned as a candidate for the post by political circles or the press.Some conservative observers say that Park’s decision to employ the former diplomat as her chief secretary reflects her will to change her state management style.

He worked as a vice chairman of Park’s campaign during her intraparty race for presidential nomination in 2007 and an advisor during her presidential campaign in 2012. As a diplomat, he also worked at the Korean embassies in Switzerland and Kenya.But the new chief of staff is expected to draw fierce criticism from the opposition party. He was attacked by the opposition over allegations that he had delivered massive funds to the election camp of Lee Hoi-chang, the presidential candidate of the Grand National Party, the predecessor to the Saenuri Party, in 2002. His accumulation of wealth is also likely to be an issue. As Lee is leaving his post at the NIS after just eight months, this could also create a vacuum in South Korea’s diplomatic and security team, critics say.After the announcement was made, Lee said he had declined to take the post several times but accepted the offer due to his affection for the country.“I feel grave responsibility to take the post in this difficult time,” he said. For her special advisors for political affairs, Park named three lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party ― Reps. Yoon Sang-hyun, Joo Ho-young and Kim Jae-won.

Moon Jae-in of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy appear to be an effort to attract centrist and right-leaning voters critical of the Kim Jong-un regime to his party before next year’s parliamentary elections, analysts said.Voters generally consider the NPAD soft on Pyongyang’s human rights abuses, as the party’s agenda often includes plans to provide financial support to the North while excluding policies expected to pressure Pyongyang on its rights violations.“Our party can no longer be seen to be careless about the North’s abuses,” Moon was reported as saying in a closed-door meeting with party officials on Wednesday.Close to 20 versions of a potential North Korea human rights bill have been written by lawmakers in Seoul since 2005. But partisan disagreements over whether the bill would genuinely improve human rights standards in the North have stalled it.As of this year, the governing Saenuri Party and the NPAD are at loggerheads over two versions. The parties agree that a North Korea human rights bill should urge the communist state to meet standards set by the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But they disagree on details.NPAD Rep. Shim Jae-kwon proposes creating a research center dedicated to “improving human rights standards” while Saenuri Rep. Kim Young-woo backs a center more focused on “documenting rights abuses.” The Saenuri Party also advocates creating a North Korea human rights fund. The NPAD opposes the idea, saying it could be used to support controversial activists, such as those who sent anti-Kim Jong-un leaflets and U.S. dollar bills to the North late last year.The activists had worsened inter-Korean relations by provoking Pyongyang authorities, the NPAD had said, and demanded they be stopped. The Park Geun-hye administration refused, saying the activists’ rights to freedom of expression outweighed the NPAD’s concerns.The NPAD has consistently accused the Saenuri Party of provoking the North. The Saenuri version of the human rights bill continues that trend, the NPAD says.But Saenuri Rep. Kim, the chief writer of his party’s human rights bill and who represents a constituency near the border with the North, has said “some degree of provocation” is inevitable. Adding, Pyongyang authorities were more likely to change their stance on human rights through external pressure.North and South are still at war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a cease-fire agreement and not a peace treaty.

Some sources said Park has already picked Kim's replacement from a shortlist of candidates and has only to unveil the choice.Among the candidates is Hyun Kyung-dae, a former lawmaker who serves as executive vice chairperson of the National Unification Advisory Council, according to them.Last week's Cabinet reshuffle affected four ministers, including the unification minister, who handles inter-Korean affairs.The Cabinet shake-up came a day after Lee Wan-koo, Park's choice for prime minister, won parliamentary endorsement. It is widely seen as Park's attempt to try and refresh her team as she enters her third year in power.It also came after Park's approval rating hit a record low of 29 percent amid public backlash over a series of policy blunders.In South Korea, the President usually carries out a Cabinet reshuffle or other personnel changes in a bid to overcome crises and start afresh with a new lineup.

The partial reshuffle is aimed at restoring public confidence and gaining momentum for her reform drive. But its effect is seen as limited given the delay in the replacement of her chief of staff blamed for a series of policy failures and botched appointments.  Senior presidential secretary for press Yoon Doo-hyun announces President Park Geun-hye`s latest personnel decisions on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Yoo Ki-june, a lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party and former maritime attorney, was nominated as the new minister for oceans and fisheries, and Hong Yong-pyo, presidential secretary for unification, was tapped to head the Unification Ministry.Park picked another Saenuri Party lawmaker, Yoo Il-ho, as the new transport minister, and NH Financial Group chairman Yim Jong-yong as head of the state financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission. Officials said Park accepted Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon’s offer to resign but postponed announcing his successor, inviting fresh criticism from the opposition party. Even the ruling party has long demanded Park to dismiss Kim, who has been under scrutiny for exercising too much power in state affairs and personnel choices.Yoon Doo-hyun, senior presidential press secretary, said the president would name his successor after the three-day Lunar New Year holiday this week. “Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon has offered to resign several times so far, and President Park Geun-hye has accepted that,” Yoon told reporters after a briefing on the new ministers. “I believe that (Kim’s) successor will be announced at an appropriate time after Lunar New Year.” Park appears to have struggled to find a candidate to replace Kim who would be able to overturn the public’s growing criticism over her unilateral personnel choices. Critics say she appears to have delayed the nomination for a new chief of staff after her choice of Lee backfired.From left: Hong Yong-pyo, Yoo Il-ho, Yoo Ki-june and Yim Jong-yong. (Yonhap)The parliament endorsed Lee on Monday despite harsh partisan divide over his multiple ethical misdeeds, and he was appointed by the president on Tuesday morning. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy accused Lee of evading military duty, speculating in real estate and intimidating reporters against publishing negative stories on him. Though Lee earned the parliamentary endorsement, the new prime minister is expected to face an uphill battle in restoring public trust in him.With Lee joining the Cabinet, Park requested the new prime minister to play a key role in policy coordination to push her reform drive. Park’s three-year economic reform drive, the centerpiece of her state agenda, has been losing momentum in the face of political scandals and inconsistencies in her tax and welfare policies.“We have a pile of reform issues to resolve, and I expect Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo to do well with his rich experience and leadership,” Park said during her weekly Cabinet meeting.The president also urged ministers for concerted efforts to revitalize the economy and carry out reforms in the public sector, labor, finance and education.“I hope the party, government and Cheong Wa Dae will work together for the passage of urgent bills to revive the economy,” she said.Later in the day, Prime Minister Lee said he would devote himself to the government’s efforts to revive the sluggish domestic economy and enhance communication between the parties.“I will lead a government that does not override the opposition party’s (demands), with my experience as floor leader of the ruling party, which regarded the opposition party as a crucial partner,” he said in his inaugural speech.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","latest personnel decisions on tuesday ,the president on tuesday ,during her weekly cabinet meeting ,on tuesday named new chiefs ,the president on tuesday morning","['Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Yoon Doo - hyun', 'Park Geun - hye`s', 'Ki', 'Saenuri Party', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'NH Financial Group', 'Yim Jong - yong', 'the Financial Services Commission', 'Park', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Kim', 'Yoon Doo - hyun', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park Geun', 'Yoon', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Yoo Ki - june', 'Yim Jong - yong', 'Lee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Lee', 'Cho Chung - un']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57310802  0.43719333

President Park Geun-hye’s decision to field the former defense minister illustrates her desire to cement her country’s strategic partnership with China, which has recently suffered a setback due to the possibility that Washington will deploy an advanced missile defense system to the peninsula.Observers say Kim’s top priority will be to resolve misunderstandings about the possible deployment of the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system to Korea, as Beijing officials have repeatedly expressed their opposition to it.Kim Jang-soo. (Yonhap)The U.S., a core security ally of South Korea, has expressed its wish to bring THAAD to South Korea to better counter the North’s escalating ballistic missile threats. But China apparently believes that THAAD could potentially target it.The continuing controversy over THAAD has underscored the increasingly tricky diplomatic position facing Seoul, which has sought to maintain its long-standing security alliance with the U.S. and deepen its strategic partnership with China.The bilateral partnership has evolved amid increasing cooperation in trade, tourism and other areas. Yet there has been an apparent sense of distrust between the two countries in the realms of politics and security amid the emerging rivalry between the U.S. and China.The distrust was exacerbated after Seoul signed a trilateral military information-sharing arrangement with Washington and Tokyo in December in order to strengthen their comprehensive security cooperation, something China fears could undermine its security.Analysts say that Kim, a former ministerial-level official, might have been chosen for the core diplomatic post to highlight Seoul’s foreign policy priorities and improve trust between South Korea and the emerging Asian power.Since the start of the Park administration in 2013, China has been at the top of its priority list. Park has sought to strengthen Seoul’s relations with Beijing, which were stunted by her predecessor Lee Myung-bak, who focused excessively on relations with the U.S.Opposition lawmakers criticized Kim’s appointment soon after it was announced, arguing the former Army chief had little experience handling diplomatic issues, and that it was inappropriate to restore him to public office less than a year after he resigned.Last May, Kim stepped down as chief of the National Security Office after he controversially denied that his office had a role in handling national disasters. The remarks were perceived as “irresponsible” at a time when the nation was grieving over a massive ferry disaster that left over 300 people dead.Some critics also say that naming the former minister-level official as ambassador to China was not fair given that China appointed a director-general-level official as its envoy to South Korea, and a deputy-minister-level official as its ambassador to the North.Following due appointment procedures, Kim will become the first former defense chief to serve as ambassador to China since the two nations established diplomatic ties in 1992.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","new ambassador to beijing president ,seoul new ambassador to beijing ,new ambassador to beijing ,grieving over massive ferry disaster ,lawmakers criticized kim appointment soon","['Kim Jang - soo', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park Geun', 'China', 'Washington', 'Kim ’s', 'Korea', 'Beijing', 'Kim Jang - soo', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'North ’s', 'China', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'asian', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Kim', 'Army', 'Kim', 'the National Security Office', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35453001  0.46053141

Moon Jae-in, chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, at the party’s supreme council meeting.“President Park should offer an apology, though it happened during the Lee Myung-bak administration,” he said. Lee is Park’s predecessor. Rep. Moon Jae-in, chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, attends the party’s supreme council meeting in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The Seoul High court ruled that Won, who headed the spy agency between 2009 and 2013, meddled in the 2012 presidential election by ordering staff to make political posting online to sway public opinion, overturning a lower court’s decision that acquitted him of election meddling charges. Moon was the presidential candidate for the main opposition party in the election. The NPAD chair intensified criticism of Park. He said Park, then Saenuri candidate, had slandered him when the case emerged during the election campaign period and accused her of interfering in the prosecution’s investigation into the case. Moon came under the political spotlight recently after he rose to the chairmanship of the party on Sunday.The opposition leader also urged the president to carry out a massive reform of NIS to prevent the agency from interfering in political affairs.

Asia’s fourth-largest economy, if revitalized, could help create more jobs and raise tax revenues, she said.The president also agreed to set up a consultative body with her ruling party and the government as part of efforts to better coordinate policies following a series of policy blunders.Park made the decision in a first meeting with new leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party ― party leader Kim Moo-sung, floor leader Yoo Seong-min and chief policymaker Won ― at the presidential office, Won said after the meeting.The presidential office is set to hold a consultative meeting with the ruling party and the government twice a month and they are expected to hold the inaugural session after Lunar New Year’s Day, which falls on Feb. 19.Separately, the three parties will hold a high-level consultative meeting involving the prime minister, Park’s chief of staff, the ruling party chief and the floor leader, according to Won.It is the first time that Park has agreed to set up a consultative body with the ruling party since she took office in early 2013. Park has been accused, even by some ruling party officials, of not communicating well in running state affairs.The latest move came after Park suffered a series of setbacks over the government’s revised tax settlement scheme and the suspension of plans to revamp the national health insurance system meant to fairly distribute the public burden.Also at the meeting, Park pressed for parliamentary measures to revitalize South Korea’s economy.“Cooperation from the National Assembly is urgently required to quickly achieve economic revitalization and I hope that the Saenuri Party will strengthen such a role,” Park said, according to the ruling party.The floor leader Yoo said he would make the utmost efforts to ensure that bills meant to revitalize the economy can pass through the National Assembly.Park’s ruling party commands a parliamentary majority with 158 seats in the 295-member National Assembly, which allows it to push bills through parliament without cooperation from the main opposition party.From news reports","tax hikes day after she ,hye on tuesday denied having ,recent talk of raising taxes ,the president on tuesday ,slammed officials of her party","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Won Yoo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Won ―', 'Won', 'Park ’s', 'Won', 'Park', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'the National Assembly', 'Park ’s', 'National Assembly']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10536537  0.47565675

President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)So there was some optimism when the nation’s first female leader took power two years ago, vowing to usher in “an era of happiness” through a creative economy, expanded welfare and trust-building between the two divided Koreas.Contrary to those expectations, President Park who has just entered her third year in office, now faces a political crisis, beset by deepening public distrust in her leadership and an escalating feud with her ruling party. Her approval ratings plummeted more than 10 percentage points in three weeks to below 30 percent on Jan. 27. It was her lowest rating since she entered office and far lower than when her leadership was questioned in the wake of the Sewol ferry accident. Her disapproval rating also polled above 60 percent for the first time. Gallup Korea noted recently that its survey showed that the positive ratings of Park among those in their 50s ― often regarded as the president’s core support group ― have started to decline. Even among supporters of the ruling Saenuri Party, 37 percent said they disapproved of her state management.A series of political scandals involving conflicting groups of aides as well as the government’s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance have damaged her credibility. Presidential documents were leaked to media late last year, raising speculation over lax discipline within Cheong Wa Dae. Park has also come under fire after she refused to abandon her aides involved in a related influence-peddling scandal. In her New Year’s news conference, Park said she would keep them by her side, despite growing demand from opposition parties and the public. The president said she trusted the three secretaries, citing the prosecution’s investigation that concluded the scandal as groundless. She continued to struggle over her tax policies as the government’s initial plan to revise the tax settlement scheme backtracked in the face of public worries that the middle class will have to pay more.But the greatest fault, critics say, is her “rigid” and “closed-off” leadership that has failed to embrace public demands.“Her greatest asset is that she is a stable leader. But what lies behind the leadership that pursues stability is a leader who refuses to change and listen,” said Choi Jin, president of the Korean Association for Presidential Leadership Studies.“The president remains impervious to public demand,” said Choi likening her to a rock that won’t budge. “But the president has to realize that she is just walking in a dark tunnel now which would lead her to a lame duck status. “She needs to take action right now and seek change, otherwise her political career will collapse.”Her lack of communication with the public has often been cited as the biggest stumbling block to her political career.In the event of social or political conflicts, she refused to talk with groups that wanted to communicate with her and maintained her attitude that she describes as being anchored on “principle and law.” Her political foes have stepped up their offensive, saying she should communicate with them before making decisions to narrow differences, rather than making personal judgments on whether they are wrong or not.Park seldom interacts directly with people, much less with reporters covering Cheong Wa Dae. She has only held two news conferences ― each at the beginning of a year ― since beginning her presidency.Her relationship with her own party is also at stake. Rep. Yoo Seong-min won the primary vote for Saenuri Party leader on Monday, defeating former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Joo-young, who is considered a pro-Park lawmaker. Yoo’s victory was seen as a shift of power in the party’s leadership, as the nonmainstream lawmaker was expected to take a critical approach to the president’s policies. Critics say Yoo’s victory will consolidate Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung’s control of the party. Kim is known as a longtime rival of Park.“Saenuri lawmakers picking Rep. Yoo as a new floor leader clearly shows that the party has started to react to public demands and decided to forge its own voice by disconnecting itself from Cheong Wa Dae’s influence,” said Yoon Pyeong-joong, political professor at Hanshin University. Saenuri leader Kim also went head-to-head against Park’s welfare policies on Tuesday, claiming it was impossible to implement welfare expansion without a tax hike.Park remained mute over Kim’s call but instead urged officials to enhance policy coordination between the presidential office and the Cabinet.Professor Yoon, quoting a previous interview with Park’s former aide, said that another serious problem is that she may understand the gravity of the situation but doesn’t know how to make changes. Critics say that the president should make a “massive” and “radical” Cabinet shake-up first, by assigning figures with progressive and future-oriented ideas to ministerial seats, in order to freshen up the atmosphere. Last month, Park vowed to conduct “a small-scale” Cabinet reshuffle and reorganize the presidential office. She appointed former Saenuri floor leader Lee Wan-koo as new prime minister and replaced some of her senior secretaries. It was widely expected that Park would announce new Cabinet lineup within this week to restore confidence. Park’s unilateral personnel choices have come under scrutiny as her decisions were often seen as favoring figures with legal background and those who are from the Gyeongsang area, where she has a strong foothold. With a new lineup, the president also needs to keep her pledge to share more responsibility with the prime minister and minsters by allowing them greater discretion in decision making, and personnel choices, said Yoon of Hanshin University. Even before she entered office, Park faced a series of attacks over her administrative approach, including her personnel failures. Her appointment of political veteran Kim Ki-choon, who was an aide to her late father, authoritarian former President Park Chung-hee, was one of them.Not just the lack of discretion by each minister, Yoon also pointed out her lack of communication within the Cabinet.“At the (televised) news conference, Park asked ministers ‘Do you think a face-to-face briefing is needed?’ I think it was absurd,” said Yoon. In an apparent gesture to enhance communication between Park and the Cabinet, Cheong Wa Dae has recently started to hold a coffee-session before the weekly meeting which many argued as “ineffective.”Despite the worsening situation, political professor Yoon Sung-yi at Kyung Hee University said it was too early to write Park off. “She has just entered her third year in office, she may seek a turning point,” he said citing her dramatic leadership that has saved her party numerous times in the past.After its failure in the 2002 election, the Grand National Party, the former identity of the ruling Saenuri Party, suffered a major setback upon the prosecution’s full-fledged probe into its illegal political funds, as well as an attempted impeachment of President Roh Moo-hyun that backfired. By moving the party’s headquarters into a tent and pledging reforms as the newly-elected chairwoman, Park successfully helped her party win 121 seats in the 2004 general election, earning her a reputation as Korea’s “election queen.”Until she stepped down as chief in 2006, the GNP won in all elections, leading to a total of eight resignations of rival ruling party leaders.“I think what she needs now is that sense of emergency that she had in the tent headquarters she led in 2004,” said Yoon. “If only she takes this current political crisis as an opportunity to improve herself, the public would return to her.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","korean people loved about president ,newly elected chairwoman park successfully ,pro park lawmaker yoo victory ,elected chairwoman park successfully ,what many korean people loved","['korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cheong', 'Park', 'Choi Jin', 'the Korean Association for Presidential Leadership Studies', 'Choi', 'Cheong', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Joo - young', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Yoo', 'Cheong', 'Yoon Pyeong - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Park ’s', 'Kim', 'Cabinet', 'Yoon', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Cabinet', 'Park ’s', 'Gyeongsang', 'Yoon', 'Hanshin University', 'Park', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Yoon', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Yoon', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Yoon Sung - yi', 'Kyung Hee University', 'the Grand National Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Yoon', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27531505  0.53122276

South Korean prime ministers usually lack clout, as power is concentrated in the president. Only a few wielded meaningful authority, such as Goh Kun in 2004, when President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached.But offering stern advice to a reportedly icy president will not be the only challenge for Lee. The three-term lawmaker will also have to defend himself and his family from accusations of draft-dodging and influence peddling at his confirmation hearing next week.President Park last Friday appointed Lee as prime minister, a day after a weekly Gallup Korea poll put Park’s public rating at 30 percent. Critics blamed the record-low rating on this year’s tax increases and Park’s refusal to give in to popular demand that she conduct a shake-up of her staff, after a series of influence peddling scandals involving her top aides put the presidential office’s public trust in jeopardy.Park supporters hope Lee’s image as a parliamentary deal-broker will help turn around her falling popularity. Lee is credited with successfully negotiating divisive bills with the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy as the governing Saenuri Party’s floor leader. NPAD leaders have echoed such optimism.But the NPAD has also warned that Lee’s reputation as a reasonable compromiser does not guarantee the National Assembly’s approval of his nomination at the confirmation hearing next week.NPAD officials have already initiated attacks on the nominee’s family members. Lee’s second son has been accused of dodging South Korea’s mandatory draft in 2006 by faking a ligament injury.Lee has been accused of condoning an influence peddling scandal in which his brother was arrested in 2011 for receiving cash for favorable treatment of contractors in a public construction project in South Chuncheong province. Lee was the provincial governor from 2006 to 2009. Governing party lawmakers have helped Lee ready his defense, despite criticism that incumbent legislators should refrain from assisting prospective government officials. Lee has said that he is prepared to respond to the accusations. “I hope that the confirmation hearing will be productive,” he said on Sunday, apparently hinting that he wished to avoid lengthy verbal fights with his fellow lawmakers over his family.Lee’s acceptance of the nomination has left his post as Saenuri Party floor leader vacant.

The sector accounts for about 70 percent of the country's GDP and employs some 60 percent of the workforce, according to the ministry.""The services industry is firmly a part of international trade, and people need to consider foreign (service) markets as being extensions of the local market,"" he emphasized.Such views are particularly valid in the face of the growing popularity and acceptance of K-pop and other locally produced contents abroad, he said.Choi proposed calling local services ""K-services"" and said a two-track approach could be followed for their expansion.The expansion of outbound services could focus on the development of resorts, the construction of hospitals and establishment of related medical services, broadcasting, design and other forms of contents, while the inbound services are about attracting more tourists, people who need medical attention, students and aircraft maintenance, he said. The country attracted some 4,710 medical patients last year.The policymaker emphasized that the service sector holds promise in reducing unemployment, especially among young people, whose jobless rate stood at 9 percent in 2014.

She cautioned against slapping lawbreakers on the wrist on the grounds that it could give the wrong signal to society.There is a deep-rooted public perception in South Korea that there is a law for the rich and another for the poor. The perception stems from South Korea's long judicial track record of giving lenient punishments to convicted top business leaders, citing their contribution to the country's economy.

Korea repeats calls to cancel allies’ drills,"North Korea has repeated its calls for the United States to cancel the annual South Korea-U.S. military drills in return for its nuclear moratorium in an apparent show of its desire for talks with Washington amid toughened U.S. economic sanctions against the isolated regime.In a rare media interview on Friday, Hyon Hak-bong, the North’s ambassador to Britain, reiterated Pyongyang’s stance against the Key Resolve/Fo...","North Korea has repeated its calls for the United States to cancel the annual South Korea-U.S. military drills in return for its nuclear moratorium in an apparent show of its desire for talks with Washington amid toughened U.S. economic sanctions against the isolated regime.In a rare media interview on Friday, Hyon Hak-bong, the North’s ambassador to Britain, reiterated Pyongyang’s stance against the Key Resolve/Foal Eagle exercises to begin next month, saying the North was ready to take “responsible steps” to temporarily suspend its nuclear tests.Washington has already dismissed Pyongyang’s proposal as an “implicit threat,” as it is exploring the full range of tools at its disposal ― as Sung Kim, a top U.S. envoy on North Korea policy, said, to get the North to change its course and stop its “destructive” policy choices.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un pays respect to his deceased father and grandfather on Jan. 1. (Yonhap)Seoul and Washington said they would press ahead with the “defense” drills. Seoul stressed that the issues of holding dialogue with Pyongyang and staging the annual drills should be “separate.” The North has long argued the drills are a rehearsal for a “nuclear war of invasion” against it.Raising the pressure on the U.S. to accept the North’s proposal, Hyon also warned that no progress in any dialogue would be made and there would only be a threat of a nuclear war should there be military drills against an “interlocutor.”Noting that in 1992, the U.S. stopped the allies’ “Team Spirit” exercise following North Korea’s demand, Hyon also said, “It is time for the U.S. to make a bold decision for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.”On Sunday, the Rodong Sinmum, the daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, also demanded that the U.S. cancel the drills. It argued that without suspending the plan for the drills, actual dialogue between the two Koreas and between the U.S. and North Korea were impossible.“Should the U.S. cancel the drills as we proposed, there will be remarkable progress on the efforts to secure peace and stability not only on the Korean Peninsula, but also in Northeast Asia,” the daily said in a commentary.Ahn Chan-il, the head of the World North Korea Research Center, raised the possibility that through the proposal for its nuclear moratorium, Pyongyang indicated that it was willing to bargain away its nuclear program and come out to the international community.“My analysis may sound too naive, but the North ― after having watched the improvement in relations between the U.S. and Cuba ― appeared to have decided to negotiate with the U.S. and wanted to come forward to the outside world to ease its isolation,” he said.“It could be a change in the North’s foreign policy course. The North could think that rather than sticking to its policy of nuclear armament, it would be better to negotiate with the U.S. over its nukes and move out to the world.”However, the proposal could also be part of the North’s efforts to show that it has been making efforts toward dialogue with the U.S., said Kim Yong-hyu, North Korea expert at Dongguk University.“The North seems to show that it is leading the situation in the current standoff with the U.S. rather than showing the world that it is being dragged by the U.S.,” he said. “It could also be attempting to accumulate evidence that it did try to improve relations with the U.S. through dialogue.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","suspend its nuclear tests washington ,proposal for its nuclear moratorium ,temporarily suspend its nuclear tests ,cancel the annual south korea ,suspend its nuclear tests","['North Korea', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'Britain', 'Pyongyang', 'the Key Resolve / Foal Eagle', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Sung Kim', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'Hyon', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Hyon', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'U.S.', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Ahn Chan - il', 'the World North Korea Research Center', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Cuba', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Kim Yong - hyu', 'North Korea', 'Dongguk University', 'North', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67421693  0.54325086

She was indicted for jeopardizing flight safety and the incident has tarnished the airline company’s brand image significantly, with some customers boycotting its service.According to the data provided by Incheon International Airport Corp. and Korea Airports Corp., Korean Air transported a total of 482,000 passengers through its domestic lines last month, down 6.6 percent from a year earlier.The decline contrasted with a 13.2 percent hike for its smaller rival Asiana Airlines Inc., which flew 358,000 customers last month. The gap between the two largest airlines in terms of passengers narrowed from 158,000 to 76,000 over the past one year.This also comes despite an 11.5 percent on-year increase in the total number of passengers using domestic flights provided by seven carriers. Industry experts attribute the lackluster results of Korean Air to customers’ avoidance of its service in the wake of the incident.“It seems that there are not a few passengers opting for other airline services following the incident, given that there are many options available when it comes to domestic flights,” an industry expert said. Korean Air also underperformed next to other airliners on international lines. The company transported a total of 1.38 million passengers through its international flight services last month, up 2.5 percent from a year earlier. This is lower than the industry-wide 9.2 percent hike in the number of passengers traveling overseas, the data showed.In particular, Asiana Airlines seems to be basking in its rival’s setback with the number of international passengers using its flights growing 9 percent. Low-cost carriers also saw their international passengers jump across the board.Korean Air said that there is no marked change in its booking ratio and that there is no relations between the number of passengers and the incident since most of tickets were booked months earlier. It expects that bookings for February and March are about 5 percent higher than last year.

South Korea hopes to eventually link its rail network to Russia’s Trans-Siberian Railway via North Korea.The foreign ministry said it signed a deal with state rail operator Korea Railroad Corp. to form a task force in January to set details of the train project, including timing, route and participants.The envisioned express train is likely to pass through countries including China, Mongolia, Russia and Germany, with the route expected to span more than 10,000 kilometers and tap the existing Trans-Siberian and Trans-China Railways, it said.The one-off project worth more than 1 billion won ($920 million) is expected to draw diverse participants including college students and politicians aboard the train. Cultural events will be performed at stops of major cities.“The government is pushing to run the express train in summer on a journey that would take two or three weeks,” a ministry official said.The ministry said it plans to hold a variety of events to mark historic and diplomatic milestones through the project.This year marks the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule.

""The incumbent government is on the same line of previous governments' unification policy, which seeks unification (of the Koreas) in a gradual and step-by-step manner, based on autonomy, peace and democracy,"" the official noted.The government's stance is that the two Koreas should first built trust through dialogue and cooperation for the phase-in of unification because the South and the North currently suffer a lack of trust and dialogue, the official added.Since President Park's inauguration in 2013, she has highlighted efforts to expedite preparations for unification, with the North accusing Park of advocating unification through the absorption of the communist country into the capitalist system.The official also repeated the ministry's intention to intervene in a local activist group's provocative campaign to send DVDs of an anti-Pyongyang film in balloons across the border. The U.S. comedy ""The Interview"" revolves around a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The local group is planning to launch balloons carrying the DVDs to the North in a campaign meant to spread dissenting messages in the reclusive country later in the month.""We plan to ask them to make a wise choice (to stop) to prevent any risks that can be posed on the life and property of citizens at the border area,"" the official said.The North has previously threatened to retaliate against anti-North campaigns.

The president, however, refuted allegations that her aides tried to intervene in state affairs, calling them “nothing but groundless rumors.” The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy lashed out at the president, saying Park had refused the people’s demand for her to replace her aides as part of her reform drive, and that they could expect nothing further from her.In the 25-minute speech, the president vowed efforts to speed up her reform drive aimed at revitalizing the nation’s sluggish economy, to eradicate wrongdoings in the public and private sectors and to improve inter-Korean ties this year.President Park Geun-hye speaks at her New Year’s press conference at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday. (Yonhap)The president, dressed in her signature red jacket, pledged to initiate an intensive reform of debt-ridden public institutions, the labor market, the education sector and the public pension system. It was her second meeting with the press since she entered office in early 2013.Expectations were high over how Park would respond to growing calls to replace key aides and her “secretive” management style, and how she plans to deal with North Korea amid escalating tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.Calling former officials involved in the leak incident “unpardonable,” the president said she was “sorry” and “heavy-hearted” for disappointing the people. The president said she would appoint a new presidential special adviser for smooth communication with the people as part of the Cheong Wa Dae reorganization plan, and launch a new office to conduct special inspections on her family. However, the president said she would keep the three secretaries who were allegedly involved in an influence-peddling scandal, overturning expectations that she would carry out another reshuffle to clear the atmosphere and start afresh with new members this year. “I found no reason to replace the three secretaries,” Park said at the conference broadcast live nationwide. “I believed that the three did nothing wrong (in the beginning) but confirmed it through the (prosecution’s) investigation into the scandal later on that there really were none,” she said. “If I were to dismiss the secretaries only because of such allegations, who would work at my side?”Park also spoke highly of her chief secretary, saying he had no vested interests and was not reluctant to give up his post. The president said she would decide on Kim’s fate later, when all pending issues were resolved, stressing that it is the time to focus on economy.The news conference was held amid the main opposition calling for a massive reshuffle at Cheong Wa Dae and launching a special independent counsel probe over the influence-meddling scandal involving Park’s former aide Chung Yoon-hoi and her own brother Park Ji-man.The prosecution concluded last week that the document had been fabricated by an intelligence officer and leaked to the media by two police inspectors.Park, citing the prosecution’s interim reports over the scandal, said she felt no need to set an independent probe. Such a probe would only cause social confusion, she said. On Chung Yoon-hoi, Park said he left her a long time ago and rebutted the allegations that he had meddled in personnel affairs at the Culture Ministry. “It’s an absurd rumor,” she said. “I found no reason to answer. It has all been fabricated by someone who must have been pursuing power.” On a possible amendment to the Constitution, Park said now is not the time for revision but to concentrate on economic revitalization.“I believe that a constitutional revision should take place on the premise of a public consensus and if it brings benefit to people’s lives,” she said. “If we spend all of our time revising the Constitution and fail to revive the economy, the harm will go straight to the people.”On granting special paroles for imprisoned business tycoons, Park said it is a matter for the Ministry of Justice to decide.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","the president however refuted allegations ,leak incident unpardonable the president ,president saying park had refused ,president however refuted allegations ,unpardonable the president said she","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Blue House', 'Park', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park', 'inter - korean', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Park ’s', 'Park Ji', 'Park', 'the Culture Ministry', 'Park', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24950925  0.92979437

(Yonhap)""My heart is heavy and (I am) sorry for the people who are feeling despondent because of the document scandal,” Park said.She said it was unforgivable for high-level officials to seek personal gain, adding that she would reinforce discipline within the civil service. The scandal centered on allegations that Park’s former aide Chung Yoon-hoi was meddling in state affairs including the president’s personnel decisions. The prosecution has since determined that the allegations were false, and that the Cheong Wa Dae intelligence reports regarding them were fabricated by police Superintendent Park Gwan-cheon and leaked to the media by two police inspectors.Regarding the calls for her to replace key aides including Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and those implicated in the allegations surrounding Chung Yoon-hoi, Park indicated that such changes will not be made in the near future.“(Kim) is very rare in having no ulterior motives, and because of this he helped (me) despite the difficulties in family life and when he has no need to cling to his post,” Park said. She also said there was no reason to dismiss the senior secretaries implicated in the document leak scandal as they were proven innocent.For much of her address, Park focused on the economy, highlighting her administration’s three-year economic plan.In the address Park used the word “economy” on 42 occasions to stress that South Korea is now faced with a “golden opportunity” to revive the economy and achieve “national innovation.” As part of the plans, Park said that the government would address wrong practices and collusion within the public and private sectors to strengthen the foundations of South Korea’s economy.President Park Geun-hye fields questions from the media on Monday. (Yonhap)As for paroling imprisoned business leaders, Park avoided a direct answer and reiterated her previous position. “Businesspeople receiving special treatment is not right, but nor should they be treated with prejudice. (The issue) should be decided by the Ministry of Justice after taking into account public sentiment and fairness,” she said. The president also stressed the need to reform the pension system in the public sector, a task Cheong Wa Dae had hoped to carry out by the end of last year. Park said the system would require about 10 trillion won ($9.2 billion) in government subsidies over 10 years, and called on the parties to draw up reform plans by April -- a deadline proposed by chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung of the ruling Saenuri Party. The president also said the plans to halve university tuition fees would be completed within the year.As for the free-trade pacts, the government would come up with follow-up measures to maximize benefits for local industries, she said. Regarding inter-Korean relations, Park urged North Korea to respond to Seoul’s calls for dialogue and suggested holding a round of family reunions on Lunar New Year’s Day. Seoul and Pyongyang must plan various events together to mark the 70th anniversary of liberation from Japanese colonial rule, she said. “An inter-Korean summit can be held if it will help (inter-Korean relations). There are no preconditions,” she said. However, Park said North Korea must show sincerity and that peaceful reunification cannot be discussed without Pyongyang’s denuclearization.“I think that an open mind and sincere stance are essential to solving problems through dialogue. For example, peaceful reunification cannot be discussed without things like denuclearization, although this is not a precondition. (I am of) the position that this matter must be resolved through processes such as multilateral talks.”By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","monday apologized for the document ,family reunions on lunar new ,the president also stressed the ,hye on monday apologized for ,apologized for the document leak","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Yonhap)As', 'Park', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'Dae', 'Park', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'japanese', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Choi He - suk']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11721605  0.58420634

The abrupt resignation of Kim stirred controversy as he was defying Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon’s order to appear before the National Assembly and clearly showed that Cheong Wa Dae, the nation’s top office, is in a disarray.Park accepted Kim’s resignation on Saturday afternoon. “Kim Young-han, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, was removed from his position as of today as his resignation was accepted this morning,” said Presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook on Saturday. “His resignation was submitted yesterday, and President Park sanctioned the documents related to his resignation presented by Kim Ki-choon, presidential chief of staff,” said Min.However, questions remain as to whether she would accept the growing calls for changes in Blue House and choose to replace her key aides at a time when she desperately seeks a momentum to push her reform agendas. Park is expected to announce her new state agenda and her vision on unification at the meeting with the press. The president will then take answers from 15 reporters, on a wide range of issues, according to officials.Expectations are also high on how Park plans to tackle thorny issues such as the leak scandal at the conference to be televised nationwide.Local reports said last week that Park may consider offering a public apology at the conference for causing public concern over a recent document leak.Munhwa Ilbo quoted a senior party official as saying that messages were sent from the ruling Saenuri Party to Park “through multiple channels” urging her “to show herself taking responsibility for causing the incident” and “to promise to conduct a reshuffle” at the press conference.Park has remained silent about the prosecution’s investigation into a leak of documents involving her former aides. The prosecution concluded on Monday that a police superintendent who worked as an intelligence officer at Cheong Wa Dae fabricated the so-called “Chung Yoon-hoi documents” and delivered them to the president’s brother under the instruction of his “direct superior” Cho Eung-cheon.The scandal, although evaluated by the prosecution as groundless, has dealt a heavy blow to President Park. Her approval ratings hit a nadir shortly after the scandal broke out late last year.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","friday over recent document leak ,kim resignation on saturday ,public apology at the conference ,dae officials the abrupt resignation ,wook on saturday his resignation","['Park Geun', 'Civil Affairs Kim Young - han', 'Kim', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Kim Young - han', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Blue House', 'Park', 'Park', 'Munhwa Ilbo', 'Saenuri Party', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Cho Eung - cheon', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20552413  0.42838788

During their summit meeting in June 2013, Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping resolved to set up a regular meeting of their national security advisers, with the inauguration gathering held in November that year in Seoul.The planned second gathering in Beijing is expected to draw keen attention as it will come amid some signs of a possible breakthrough in the relations of the rival Koreas.Hopes for an inter-Korean summit meeting have been growing since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un alluded to a summit in his New Year’s address. “Depending on the mood and circumstances to be created, there is no reason not to hold the highest-level talks,” Kim has noted. Three days earlier, South Korea had proposed holding inter-Korean talks sometime in January to discuss bilateral issues.The North, however, has yet to officially react to the offer. The latest developments on the Korean Peninsula are likely to dominate the forthcoming Beijing meeting of South Korean and Chinese officials. During the meeting, Seoul is expected to urge, as it has often done before, China to use its influence in inducing progress in inter-Korean relations while stressing Seoul’s long-held stance that the North Korean nuclear issue should first be resolved for the South to proceed meaningful with the North. The officials may also delve into the latest South Korean security issues, including the speculated deployment of U.S. missile defense and THAAD missiles systems on the peninsula as well as the recent signing of a military intelligence sharing pact between Seoul and Tokyo, according to the sources. “Who National Security Adviser Kim will meet with (during the visit) has not been determined,” one of the government sources said.

No co-hosting plan is under government consideration, it said.The possibility of co-hosting was first raised when the International Olympics Committee (IOC) in December approved a set of recommendations for its Olympic 2020 Agenda, which included a cost-saving option for an Olympic host city to co-host the games with foreign cities.The move raised the possibility of co-hosting the PyeongChang Olympics with the Japanese city of Nagano, the host of the 1998 Winter Olympics, while local civic groups proposed co-hosting with North Korea.PyeongChang won the bid to host the 2018 Olympics in 2011, beating Munich and Annecy, France, in an IOC vote, after losing its two previous bids.

It will be her second press conference since taking office in early 2013. Last year, she announced a three-year plan to reinvigorate the economy by driving out irregularities in both the private and public sectors. She also vowed to kick-start preparations for reunification, calling it an “economic bonanza” for Korea and neighboring countries. President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)But this year, the president seems to be thinking carefully about bringing up thorny domestic issues such as the Blue House document leak at the conference to be televised nationwide. Expectations are also high for how Park plans to deal with North Korea amid escalating tension between Washington and Pyongyang, and also the communist regime’s insistent nuclear threat.NPAD floor leader Rep. Woo Yoon-keun urged Park on Thursday to offer a public apology for causing concern over the recent document leak incident. “President Park Geun-hye should replace all of her senior aides at Cheong Wa Dae to take responsibility for causing public concerns over mismanagement,” he said in a party meeting at the parliament. Saenuri Party Rep. Cho Hae-jin also called for a massive shake-up at Cheong Wa Dae, saying the nation’s top office could repeat the same mistakes if it does not fix its management system now.“Cheong Wa Dae, the nation’s top office, producing documents written based on rumors and that file circulating (outside of the office) obviously shows that discipline is completely out of order,” the lawmaker said. “Those who let that happen should take responsibility.” Local reports said Park may consider offering a public apology at her New Year’s press conference Monday for causing public concern over a recent document leak.Munhwa Ilbo quoted a senior party official as saying that messages were sent from the Saenuri Party to Park “through multiple channels” urging her “to show herself taking responsibility for causing the incident” and “to promise to conduct a reshuffle” at the press conference.Park has remained silent about the prosecution’s investigation into a leak of documents involving her former aides.

The Cabinet members, including Prime Minister Chung Hong-won and senior presidential secretaries, are expected to attend the meeting with the press. The president is likely to announce a detailed plan to speed up her three-year “economic innovation” road map, and push ahead with reform drives aimed at creating more jobs, cutting government subsidies for the civil servants’ pension and eradicating wrongdoings at public agencies and institutions. Park is also likely to present her vision for unification and thoughts on the proposed inter-Korean dialogue. Seoul proposed a ministerial talk with Pyongyang later this month to discuss a reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War and other issues. In a New Year’s address, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un demonstrated his desire to hold a “top-level meeting” but said he would do so if Seoul and Washington would end their joint annual drills. Other domestic issues such as scandals involving Park’s former aides and plans for a Cabinet reshuffle are expected to be highlights of the conference.Some observers say that Park will not replace her ministers or secretaries at the presidential office as an investigation by the prosecution has concluded that the allegation that her aides meddled in state affairs was false.It will be her second press conference since taking office in early 2013. The president has rarely appeared before reporters covering Cheong Wa Dae or held meetings with journalists over the past two years.The presidential office is reportedly considering holding separate meetings with managing editors and political desks early this year to avoid criticism over her lack of communication.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday the president will unveil ,new year press conference monday ,conference monday morning to announce ,her second press conference ,on wednesday the president will","['Park Geun', 'inter - korean', 'Yoon Doo - hyun', 'Chunchugwan', 'Cabinet', 'Chung Hong - won', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Park ’s', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Cho Chung - un']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34323695  0.73303139

Kim Moo-sung (right) and Supreme Court Chief Justice Yang Seung-tae (left) attend a New Year meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Friday. (Yonhap)The president also urged leaders to join efforts to push ahead with her reform agendas aimed at eradicating corruption both in public and private sector, and at easing old regulations to revitalize the nation‘s economy.Ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, for his part, stressed economic issues calling on political circles to support the business community. “It would be good if the political arena supports businesspeople to work actively,” Kim said. The comment was taken as a hint about his recent statement regarding the need to release imprisoned businessmen on condition. Kim also said that the party would serve as a bridge for the government to reach out to the opposition party and the National Assembly, in an apparent bid to dispel rumors of heightened tension between himself and the president, and the pro-Park Geun-hye faction. Although Kim was considered pro-Park in the past, he has long since grown apart from her, and a faction led by Rep. Suh Chung-won has been speaking out against him in recent weeks. At the faction’s year-end lunch on Dec. 30, pro-Park lawmakers criticized Kim, accusing him of wielding too much power.At the meeting, three-term lawmaker Rep. Yoo Ki-june claimed that Kim was leading the Saenuri Party down a path that was “neither ruling party nor opposition,” while former party secretary general Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun accused Kim of failing to mend ties with Cheong Wa Dae. “The Cheong Wa Dae-(ruling) party relations are more rickety than ever before and are fracturing, but the efforts to oil and strengthen (the relationship) are weak,” Yoon said. While Kim has denied friction with the presidential office and refuted the accusations that he has too much power, the pro-Park faction appears ready to take a larger role in party operations this year. For the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the meeting marked the beginning of a year riddled with uncertainties. The party is set to elect its new leader in February, who will be tasked with leading the party out of instability, and to put factionalism to rest. The main opposition’s relationship with the presidential office also appears likely to remain shaky. Ahead of the meeting, the NPAD opened the year with criticism packaged as suggestions for the administration. Citing survey results showing that only about half of the country approves of changes made during the first two years of the Park administration, NPAD spokesperson Rep. Park Wan-ju called on the government to make “real efforts” towards reunification of the two Koreas and more careful personnel decisions for the highest posts in the government. The NPAD spokesperson also honed in on the changes in welfare and economic policies, calling on the president to keep the promises she made during her election campaign in 2012.

On her message board, Park wrote: “By welcoming the Year of the Sheep and the 70th anniversary of Korea’s independence, I wish for peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.”President Park Geun-hye leaves Hyeonchungtap Memorial Tower at the National Cemetery with Cabinet members and presidential secretaries after paying her respects to fallen war heroes and patriots on Thursday. (Yonhap)In her message to the military, Park called on the nation’s armed forces to maintain military readiness, calling it essential for laying the groundwork for peaceful reunification, as well as for revitalizing the economy and promoting nationwide reform.The message was released at midnight on New Year’s Day and a few hours before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was willing to hold summit talks with Park.Cheong Wa Dae’s response to Kim’s message was not immediately released.However, both leaders calling for a shift in ties raised hopes for an inter-Korean summit this year.2014 has been a year of near-zero accomplishment on cross-border relations.Early last year, President Park vowed to kick-start preparation for re-unification of the Koreas, calling it an “economic bonanza” for Korea and neighboring countries. In her speech delivered in Dresden, Germany, Park proposed to provide humanitarian aid for mothers and newborns and infrastructure projects for North Korean people in poverty. Despite her efforts, distrust between the two nations has deepened as Pyongyang has insisted on developing its nuclear program, while Park has pushed the North to renounce its nuclear ambitions and improve its cruel human rights conditions.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","patriots on thursday yonhap in ,70th anniversary of korea independence ,last year president park vowed ,patriots on thursday yonhap ,hours before north korean leader","['Park Geun - hye', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'Chung Hong - won', 'Cabinet', 'Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Hyeonchungtap Memorial Tower', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Park', 'Kim ’s', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Koreas', 'Korea', 'Dresden', 'Germany', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.27214691  0.83963233

Korean leader open to inter-Korean summit talks,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said Thursday he is willing to hold summit talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye this year with the aim of making a ""big shift"" in inter-Korean ties.  In his New Year's Day address, he said Pyongyang will ""make every effort"" to advance dialogue and cooperation with Seoul.  ""Depending on the mood and circumstances to be created, we have no reason not to hold the highest-le...","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said Thursday he is willing to hold summit talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye this year with the aim of making a ""big shift"" in inter-Korean ties.  In his New Year's Day address, he said Pyongyang will ""make every effort"" to advance dialogue and cooperation with Seoul.  ""Depending on the mood and circumstances to be created, we have no reason not to hold the highest-level talks,"" he said in the nationally televised speech.   He used much of the 30-minute speech to emphasize the need for improved relations between the rival Koreas, along with the importance of developing the communist nation's military capability and the living standards of its people.    (Yonhap)Kim said high-level talks and other kinds of negotiations between the two sides can be resumed if the South really wants to improve bilateral ties via dialogue.   He said he would actively seek the development of Mount Kumgang and other tourist zones to draw foreign visitors in a bid to diversity the country's external economic relations.   His remarks raised hope that the North will respond positively to the South's new offer of ministerial talks.   Earlier this week, the South's presidential panel on reunification proposed talks with the North in January to discuss pending issues, including the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.   South Korea hopes for significant progress in inter-Korean ties this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 35-year colonial rule.   The South's president is also eager to bear fruit in her push for easing military tensions on the peninsula as she enters the third of her five-year tenure.   Kim echoed Park's stated goal of laying the groundwork for the reunification of Korea, saying the ""tragic"" division can be no longer tolerable and acceptable.  But he condemned regular joint defense drills of South Korea and the U.S. for deepening tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  He demanded Washington end its ""anachronistic hostile"" policy toward Pyongyang.   ""There is no need to say it twice that in a tense mood that such war-preparatory exercises, trust-based dialogue can't be possible, and North-South relations can't move forward,"" he said.   Kim added his regime will stick to its ""military-first"" policy and the strategy of simultaneously developing the economy and its nuclear program.   ""We will deal resolutely with any provocation and war move that infringe on our sovereignty and dignity and take punitive steps,""he said.  It marked Kim's third New Year's Day speech. As usual, this year's address was closed watched by the outside world for clues to Pyongyang's external policy.   Earlier in the day, he began his official activity in 2015 with a visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a mausoleum in Pyongyang, which commemorates his late father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather Kim Il-sung.    Many analysts said the North's flamboyant leader would step up efforts to tighten his grip on state affairs and focus on his own priorities after the end of a three-year mourning period for the death of his father in December.

267,267,267,Park calls for military readiness amid tensions with N. Korea,"President Park Geun-hye called on the military Thursday to maintain its readiness, saying robust security is a must to lay the groundwork for potential unification with North Korea.   ""We should end the history of division by putting an end to the Cold War on the Korean Peninsula,"" Park said in a New Year's message to the country's 650,000-strong military.   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the capitalisti...","President Park Geun-hye called on the military Thursday to maintain its readiness, saying robust security is a must to lay the groundwork for potential unification with North Korea.   ""We should end the history of division by putting an end to the Cold War on the Korean Peninsula,"" Park said in a New Year's message to the country's 650,000-strong military.   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the capitalistic South and communist North after its liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.   The comments came three days after South Korea proposed that the two rival Koreas hold ministerial talks in January to discuss such bilateral issues as the reunion of families separated by the war.   Still, it remains unclear whether North Korea will accept South Korea's offer.   She also expressed hope that the military will receive public trust and love by establishing a new military culture, remarks apparently aimed at boosting morale in the military.   South Korea's military came under fire last year over a series of deaths blamed on a deep-rooted culture of abuse and bullying in barracks.   In June, an Army sergeant who had been bullied by his comrades went on a shooting rampage near the border with North Korea, killing five people and wounding seven others.   All able-bodied South Korean men must carry out compulsory military service for about two years in a country facing North Korea across the heavily fortified border.
