(KAI), to undertake an ambitious project to build indigenous fighter jets.   ""With the signing of the contract with KAI on Monday, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration will officially set about the fighter jet development project,"" DAPA said in a statement.   The project will take 10 years and six months before completing the developmental phase by the first half of 2026 and producing the initial batch of aircraft by 2028, according to the state procurement agency.   The project, known as KF-X, is designed to replace the Air Force's aging fleet of F-4 and F-5 combat aircraft with home-grown fighters to be equipped with combat capabilities suitable for future warfare.    KF-X finally took off, putting behind an array of controversy, including the U.S.' refusal to transfer core fighter technologies for the project.   In April, the U.S. State Department denied an export license on four out of the 25 combat jet technologies American defense giant Lockheed Martin tried to provide to South Korea.   The decision was belatedly announced by DAPA in September, causing public criticism over DAPA's suspected attempts to cover up what could have been a major hurdle to the project.   DAPA later decided to replace the four rejected technologies --an active electronically scanned radar, infrared search-and-rescue system, electro-optical targeting pod and radio frequency jammer-- with locally procured ones.   The setback had also raised concerns that a possible delay in the execution of the project may leave the Air Force without fighter jets before the project's completion.   But, KF-X received a boost from the U.S. pledge to transfer the rest of the 25 jet technologies earlier in the month.    South Korea has also secured this month Indonesia's partnership in the project, in which the Southeast Asian country will shoulder 20 percent of the development costs.   Under the Monday deal, DAPA will finance 60 percent of the 8 trillion won (US$6.9 billion) costs required in the development phase, with KAI to pay 20 percent.   A total of eight test planes will be initially produced, with six of them for flight testing and the two others for ground testing. Indonesia will bring one of them home, along with aviation technologies to be transfered to the country.   ""This development project seeks to acquire medium-class Korean-type fighter jets through the joint investment of the South Korean government, Indonesia and foreign and local companies so that we can meet our Air Force's post-2020 air power demand on our own and tap into the global combat jet market,"" DAPA said.   The defense procurement agency also said the project will have a spill-over effect to bring the country's aviation industry one step forward.   ""DAPA will utilize the local aviation industry's technologies and manpower that have been accumulated over the past 30 years and will do its best efforts to procure the needed fighter jets on time,"" DAPA Minister Chang Myoung-jin said.

General Assembly on Nov. 19 passed a resolution that, for the second consecutive year, calls for referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations. The resolution led to the U.N. Security Council holding the second-ever meeting on the North Korean human rights problem on Dec. 10 following the first one last year. The resolution was later formally adopted at the General Assembly on Dec. 18. During the visit to London, Kim contended that the country is making efforts to improve its human rights record while reaffirming Pyongyang's existing position that last year's landmark U.N.Commission of Inquiry's report on the North's human rights situation contained unilateral claims from North Korean defectors.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.In June, the U.S. State Department said in its annual human rights report that the North's human rights record ""remained among the worst in the world"" last year with public executions, political prison camps, torture and other abuses.

YonhapSouth Korea announced Friday it will hold foreign ministerial talks with Japan next week on the ""comfort women"" issue, raising hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to clear one of the biggest hurdles to their closer diplomatic ties.Japan's top diplomat Fumio Kishida plans to visit Seoul for the meeting with his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se on Monday, Seoul's Foreign Ministry said.They will ""exchange opinions on pending issues between the countries and issues of mutual concern, including the Japanese military comfort women issue,"" it said in a statement.On the eve of their talks, the two sides will also hold director general-level consultations on the issue in Seoul, which will be the 12th round.Yun and Kishida are widely expected to focus on resolving the row over hundreds of thousands of Korean women forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese troops during World War II. Korea was under Japan's brutal colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. The long-standing dispute has been a thorn in the relationship between the neighboring countries despite growing economic and cultural exchanges.South Korea insists that Japan come clean on its wartime atrocity for forward-looking relations. It calls for Tokyo's formal apology and compensation for the victims, mostly in their 80s and 90s.Japan, however, claims that it has no more legal responsibility, as all related legal issues were settled in the1965 deal to normalize bilateral diplomatic ties. But it has also said it is willing to provide those victims with financial assistance on a humanitarian basis. Both sides admit to the need for an early resolution to the feud. In their first-ever summit in early November, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan agreed to facilitate relevant negotiations.Park openly said her government wants to resolve the issue by the end of this year.In a positive development for Seoul-Tokyo ties, a Japanese reporter indicted for defaming Park was acquitted last week by a South Korean court. South Korea's Constitutional Court also recently refused to hear a petition against the 1965 agreement between the two nations.The upcoming Yun-Kishida meeting had been unexpected before Japanese media reported Thursday that Abe instructed his foreign minister to travel to Seoul next week.In Tokyo, Kishida told reporters that he's ready to do his best to produce a deal on the comfort women issue.""We have been trying to accelerate talks and seek an early settlement. This is part of that effort,"" he said.Japanese media reported the minister would bring a package of proposals that include letters from Abe to the victims and the creation of a 1 billion won (US$850,000) fund to help the comfort women. It remains unclear whether South Korea will accept Japan's offer, whatever it is. South Korean officials are taking a cautious stance.Kishida's trip would be ""very meaningful itself. He is unlikely to come here empty-handed. But it's hard to predict the outcome (of talks),"" a government official said.Another official said what's more important is whether or not the victims can accept Japan's offer.The issue is highly emotional and political in a country that is scheduled to hold general elections in April next year.Many Koreans accuse the Abe administration of refusing to offer a sincere apology for Japan's wartime wrongdoings.

A total of 124 South Korean firms are running factories with about 54,000 North Koreans working in them.Kaesong has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea has benefited from cheap but skilled North Korean labor.The South's firms were exempted from land use fees for a decade under a 2004 deal. The two sides launched talks over the issue again in late 2014.""The government hopes that the agreement will help South Korean firms focus on their businesses in a stable manner,"" said a ministry official, asking not to be named.The North initially claimed that the South should pay $1 per square meter for all areas that were supposed to be developed under the 2004 agreement, according to an industry source.But Seoul insisted that it will pay only around half of the North's offered price for the land that the South's firms are actually using. They are currently using about 25 percent of the 1 million square meter land.""The government hopes that the two Koreas could resolve other pending issues related to the operation of the factory zone through dialogue,"" the official added.The operation of the complex has been affected by the ups and downs of inter-Korean ties.

It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.The South has been exempted from land use fees for a decade under the 2004 deal and the two sides have been in talks over the issue since last year.The North claims that the South should pay $1 per square meter for the total amount land that was supposed to be developed under the 2004 deal, according to an industry source. But Seoul insists that it will pay around half of the North's offered price for only the land that the South's firms are currently using.The ministry declined to elaborate, apparently as negotiations are under way, but it added that Seoul is seriously in talks to minimize costs for the South firms.""The two sides are consistently in talks over the matter,"" said Park Soo-jin, the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a regular press briefing. ""The two Koreas are seeking to complete the talks within this year.""On Nov. 4, North Korea denied entry to two South Koreans to the factory park amid speculation that it may be trying to gain leverage in the talks on the land use fee.Two days later, the North overturned its ban on the entry of the two, including a vice chairman of the South's committee on the inter-Korean facilities.Ending a months-long wage dispute, the two Koreas agreed in August to raise the minimum wage for the North's workers by 5 percent to $73.87 per month.

The establishment was seen as aimed at bolstering Beijing's economic clout by creating a counterbalance to the U.S.-led Asian Development Bank.In the run-up to the AIIB's establishment, the U.S. voiced strong concerns about its governance and transparency, reportedly asking allies, such as South Korea, not to join it.""The response of the Obama Administration to the new MDBs has evolved over time,"" a Congressional Research Service report said.""The Administration initially lobbied several key allies to refrain from joining the bank. Ultimately, these lobbying efforts were largely unsuccessful, as several key allies in Europe and Asia, including the United Kingdom and South Korea, joined.""In deference to the ally, Seoul waited until U.S. concerns about governance and other problems with the bank eased before announcing its participation. South Korea was one of the last to join the bank among the founding members that also included Britain, Germany and other key European nations. However, recent comments from the administration have been more positive, the report said. During Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Washington in September, the White House emphasized that the U.S. welcomes China's growing contributions to financing development and infrastructure in Asia and beyond, the report noted.Xi also reportedly committed that the AIIB would abide by the highest international environmental and governance standards, and pledged to increase China's financial contributions to the World Bank and regional development banks, signaling its continuing commitment to existing institutions, the report said.""Congress may want to exercise oversight of the Administration's policy on and engagement with these new MDBs,"" the report said without elaborating.Another key multilateral development bank mentioned in the report was the New Development Bank (NDB), often referred to as the ""BRICS Bank,"" which Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa signed an agreement in July last year to establish.Proponents of such new MDBs argue that the infrastructure and financing needs of developing countries are beyond what can be met by existing MDBs, while others have been more concerned about whether they will diminish the influence of existing institutions, where the U.S. for decades has held a powerful leadership, the report said.

It was believed to be the first time that Kim has publicly claimed development of an hydrogen bomb, which is much more powerful than conventional nuclear weapons.  But the White House effectively rejected the claims, saying U.S. intelligence ""calls into serious question those claims."" Officials in Seoul also expressed skepticism, saying Pyongyang is not believed to have such capabilities when it has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads.  Joel Wit, editor of the website 38 North, said during a press briefing that the North's H-bomb claim is ""technically unlikely, but boosting yields with fusion fuels is not."" He also said Kim's pronouncement states exactly what North Koreans have been saying for years.  ""Every country that has built nuclear weapons has done that as next step in the development process,"" he said.  But beyond 2020, Wit said that the North could deploy a single-stage thermonuclear weapon with a yield of 100 kilotons and could make significant progress on a two-stage weapon. That yield is hugely more powerful than conventional nuclear bombs, considering the yield of the nuclear device the North last tested in 2013 was estimated at about 7 kilotons.  Wit also said the U.S. should accept the North's demand for peace treaty negotiations.  Pyongyang has stepped up the demand in recent months as the six-party nuclear talks have long remained stalled. The U.S. has flatly rejected the idea as a nonstarter as long as the North has nuclear ambitions. U.S. officials have stressed that should first focus on negotiations to end its nuclear program.  ""Everyone thinks it's not serious,"" Wit said of the North's demand.

Let's say to them, 'Hey sure, peace treaty talks, happy to do it, but you have to address our issues too, denuclearization.'""  The expert said that one of the reasons for the North's development of nuclear weapons was because the country feels threatened, and one of the ways to address the threat is to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War with a peace treaty.

International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano addresses a news conference after a board of governors meeting at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, December 15, 2015. (Reuters)""The decision by the Board of Governors today ... will open a new chapter for cooperation between Iran and the agency,"" Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, told reporters after the resolution was passed by consensus unopposed.The IAEA produced a report this month that strongly suggested Iran engaged in coordinated activities aimed at developing a nuclear bomb up until 2003, though it found no credible sign of weapons-related work beyond 2009.Despite the finding -- the clearest indication yet by the IAEA, after 12 years of investigation, that Iran was pursuing atomic bomb capability even though it denies that accusation -- the international response to the report has been muted.The United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and China reached a deal with Tehran in July under which sanctions weighing on Iran's economy will be lifted in exchange for restrictions on the Islamic Republic's atomic activities.Those six powers want to press ahead with implementing the July accord, regarded as a breakthrough after years of increasing confrontation over the issue that raised fears of a wider Middle East war.They hoped that the IAEA report, produced under the deal, would draw a line under the long-disputed issue of so-called ""possible military dimensions"" to Iran's activities.They have also highlighted, however, that even after the investigation of Iran's past is closed, the IAEA will continue to police Tehran's activities.""Closing the PMD agenda item will in no way preclude the IAEA from investigating if there is reason to believe Iran is pursuing any covert nuclear activities in the future, as it had in the past,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday after the resolution was passed.Soon after the resolution was passed, Najafi said Tehran was racing to implement its side of the deal.""We are intending to complete this process within two to three weeks, so accelerate the implementation day as soon as possible,"" he said, meaning the nuclear restrictions would be in place well before a parliamentary election in February.IAEA Director-General Yukiya Amano, however, said his agency would then need weeks to verify that all the required measures, such as the removal of centrifuges that purify uranium and the reduction of Iran's enriched-uranium stockpile, had been taken.Only once the U.N. agency's inspectors have verified that all the restrictions are in effect will international sanctions battering the Iranian economy be lifted.""We understand that Iran is undertaking the preparatory steps at quite high speed,"" Amano told a news conference, adding that it was difficult to say how much additional time the IAEA would need. ""Not days, not months. Weeks' time for us,"" he said.Supporters of the July deal argue that it gives the IAEA far more intrusive powers to inspect Iran's facilities and to monitor what it is doing, and that it extends the time Tehran would need to build an atom bomb if it chose to do so.With companies from the six powers and other nations lining up to do business in the Islamic Republic once sanctions are lifted, there had been little opposition to the resolution.Beyond the IAEA board, however, some have argued that a full examination of Iran's past violations of its nuclear non-proliferation obligations has been sacrificed for the sake of the political agreement clinched in Vienna in July.""Iran's cooperation was certainly not sufficient to close the overall PMD file,"" the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, which closely tracks Iran's nuclear dossier, said in a statement.At the Vienna headquarters of the IAEA, such criticism though was scarce, and many diplomats saw it as a significant moment after more than a decade of strife.""It's not something one should celebrate,"" one Vienna-based diplomat said on condition of anonymity. ""But for Iran it's a great day, undoubtedly. I could see them in the room, they were holding their breath.""

It was the first time that Kim has publicly mentioned the North's development of an hydrogen bomb, which uses more advanced technology and is considered much more powerful than conventional nuclear weapons.  But the White House effectively rejected the claims, saying U.S. intelligence ""calls into serious question those claims."" Officials in Seoul also expressed skepticism, saying Pyongyang is not believed to have such capabilities when it has not yet mastered the technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads.  ""While Kim's assertion about hydrogen bombs is being met with expert skepticism, experts have frequently underestimated North Korea's nuclear and missile programs due to ideologically driven analysis, political expediency and the belief that a technologically and economically backward nation could not achieve the necessary breakthroughs,"" said Bruce Klingner, a senior Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation.  ""Skeptics initially dismissed evidence of North Korea's plutonium-based nuclear weapons, highly enriched uranium program, involvement in constructing a Syrian nuclear reactor and ability to develop long-range missiles,"" the expert said in an article to the National Interest magazine.  Klinger argued that the North is already a nuclear threat regardless of the validity of Kim's hydrogen bomb assertion, adding that the communist nation is believed to have 10-16 nuclear bombs currently and the arsenal could expand to as many as 100 in five years.  Pyongyang's missile capabilities have made progress big enough to threaten the U.S., he said.  ""Experts will assess and debate North Korea's latest nuclear claim, but the regime already poses a serious and growing nuclear threat to the United States and its allies,"" Klinger said.  Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said that it appears to be ""a bit of a stretch"" for the North to build a staged thermonuclear weapon in which the radiation from a fission primary compresses a secondary stage of thermonuclear fuel.  And a more technically plausible scenario is that the North might be experimenting with fusion fuels, such as deuterium or lithium, to boost the yield of a fission explosion, he said.   Still, however, the expert called for caution.  ""So, while a staged thermonuclear weapon is likely more than North Korea can, at the moment, achieve technically, it is a mistake to rule out the aspiration by Pyongyang,"" he said.

Gen. Bernard Champoux, the commander of the Eighth Army, at the under-construction Camp Humphreys.   The USFK opened the construction site to a group of South Korean reporters on Thursday as it announced the delay in the relocation plan.   The delay is wrought by a contracted construction company, which went bankrupt, as well as a major revision in American troops' family accompaniment program in 2013, which led to changes in the overall construction plan, Kim noted.   Bucking the relocation plan, however, the USFK's 210th Field Artillery Brigade based right below the Demilitarized Zone retains its current location, Lt. Gen. Champoux said.  The artillery brigade is in charge of a grave mission, the U.S. commander said, referring to its task to counter North Korea's artillery attacks at a time of emergency.  The artillery brigade will stay put until South Korea becomes able to fully take over the mission of the USFK brigade on its own, he said.   The expanded military garrison in Pyeongtaek, which will be the U.S. military's largest compound in the world, will encompass 14.7 million square meters and house more than 513 buildings for the U.S., as well as South Korean troops, according to officials.  The construction was about 86 percent complete as of November, and will be wrapped up by the end of 2016, the officials said.   Champoux stressed the strategic advantage the upcoming relocation would have on the combat readiness of the U.S. forces, trying to dispel security concerns resulting from the USFK's move away from the Demilitarized Zone, where the two Koreas stand heavily armed.   If any provocations occur by the North, emergency troops will move to contain them, the U.S. lieutenant general said, highlighting that the USFK will keep up its readiness regardless of the new location.   Situated close to the port of Pyeongtaek and the Osan Air Base, the Pyeongtaek base will also make it easier for the U.S. to deploy additional forces in South Korea in the event of war with North Korea, Kim said, adding that it will also boost survivability of American troops from North Korea's grave artillery threats.   About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the divided peninsula technically at war.

But Seoul said such a one-off event is too insufficient to fulfill the expectations of the surviving 66,000 family members in South Korea.The North is seeking to press Seoul to reopen the tour program, apparently to earn hard currency at a time when the North is under relevant United Nations Security Council sanctions banning the North's nuclear and missile tests.The Friday talks will be represented by Vice Unification Minister Hwang Boo-gi from the South and Jon Jong-su, vice director of the secretariat of North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea.

The North also recently conducted a test on the SLBM, further escalating nuclear threats.The meeting was attended by Hwang, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy Sung Kim and Kimihiro Ishikane, a director general at Japan’s Foreign Ministry.“(The three nations concur that) North Korea should come out for talks, the ‘exploratory talks,” without conditions,” Hwang said in a meeting with reporters.Seoul has been pushing for what it calls “unconditional” exploratory talks with the communist regime as a pre-step to resume the long-stalled six-party denuclearization talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia. Pyongyang has so far refused to respond to the overtures, while calling itself a nuclear power in its constitution and through various media statements.Touching on the 2005 joint statement from the six-party talks, in which the North agreed to a set of denuclearization steps, Hwang urged Pyongyang to stop nuclear and missile tests, freeze its nuclear activities and accept inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. He called these procedures a “starting point” to fulfill its past commitments.As for a “new element” in the efforts to denuclearize North Korea, Hwang said that while Seoul and partner nations continue to maintain a two-track stance employing both dialogue and pressure, they would explore various other options “depending on situations.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","their trilateral meeting on thursday ,escalating nuclear threats the meeting ,missile during their trilateral meeting ,pyongyang to stop nuclear ,top nuclear negotiators of south","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'North Korea ’s', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Joon - kuk', 'Pyongyang', 'SLBM', 'Hwang', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Sung Kim', 'Kimihiro Ishikane', 'Japan ’s Foreign Ministry', 'North Korea', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'Hwang', 'Pyongyang', 'the International Atomic Energy Agency', 'North Korea', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'song Sang - ho']",4,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.52591044  0.49633151

""This time, we assume the North failed to launch the missile as its trajectory cannot be verified at all,"" said Joo.The North's firing of a SLBM falls just a little more than a week before the two Koreas plan to hold vice-ministerial talks at a joint industrial park in the North's border city of Kaesong on Dec. 11.The NIS, meanwhile, said that the status of Jo Yong-won, a senior official in the North's ruling party, is presumed to have sharply risen in the rankings of those in power in North Korea, given the frequency of his accompanying the leader on on-site inspections.Jo, assumed to be in his late 50s, is handling work on surveillance and censorship at the Organization and Guidance Department of the Workers' Party of Korea.The Unification Ministry said earlier in the day that Jo recorded the second-most appearances in Kim's entourage after Hwang Pyong-so, the North's chief military official on political affairs.""As the frequency of contact with the leader is a yardstick for gauging power in North Korea, Jo's rank is presumed to have considerably risen,"" Joo said.

The communist state is believed to have tried to fire a KN-11 missile from a submarine in the East Sea between 2:20 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. Saturday, but it stopped short of soaring from the waters, the sources said. Seoul’s Defense Ministry declined to officially confirm the report. “The cover of the capsule where the missile was placed has been found,” one source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.  An image published in North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper on May 9 shows a ballistic missile believed to have been launched from underwater. (Yonhap)The discovery marks the first test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile since May, when Pyongyang claimed it had successfully ejected a “strategic submarine ballistic missile” from the waters while leader Kim Jong-un observed. The test of a dummy projectile took place from a newly developed 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine at a shipyard in Sinpo, during which it is widely known to have flown about 150 meters. The North was likely to carry out the latest experiment at the same place, instead of using a ground SLBM launchpad believed to be incomplete. Concerns had arisen in recent weeks that the Kim Jong-un regime may be counting down to a fresh rocket test after it set an extensive no-sail zone in the waters off its eastern coastal city of Wonsan, effective from Nov. 11 to Dec. 7. Seoul forecasts that it will take at least two years for Pyongyang to be able to deploy a submarine carrying a ballistic missile, and Saturday’s perceived failure may demonstrate that it has yet to master the technology. With ejection marking a crucial early stage in the SLBM development, the new test is deepening concerns as despite the failure it could help eventually secure a second-strike capability, boost the country’s nuclear deterrence and thus bring its threat to a new high. Missile launches from submerged vessels are more challenging to detect than land-based ones.Pyongyang is believed to have conducted a series of ejection tests as part of its drive to secure the triad of delivery tools of a nuclear arsenal, consisting of strategic bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles and SLBMs. It is believed to operate some 70 submarines, about 20 of which are the 1,800-ton Romeo-class and about 40 of which are the 325-ton Sangeo-class vessels. Albeit old and equipped with outdated weapons, they outnumber South Korea’s fleet.The findings came just a day before President Park Geun-hye departs for Paris for a U.N. climate change conference where she will gather with the leaders of more than 140 countries, including U.S. President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has been seeking to visit Pyongyang.Last Thursday, the two Koreas also agreed to hold high-level talks in the North’s western border city of Gaeseong on Dec. 11.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","failed to launch ballistic missile ,submarine launched ballistic missile since ,missile and saturday perceived failure ,carrying ballistic missile and saturday ,have failed to launch ballistic","['North Korea', 'Seoul', 'kn-11', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'North Korea ’s', 'Rodong', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Sinpo', 'SLBM', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Wonsan', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'SLBM', 'Pyongyang', 'Romeo', 'Sangeo', 'albeit', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Paris', 'U.N.', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'Gaeseong', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66033655 -0.09561484

The construction work for the Jeju civil-military sea port base, spanning nearly 500,000 square meters with docks running some5 kilometers in the direction of the East China Sea, is 96 percent complete as of late November, according to Capt. Kang Dong-kil, who is in charge of organizing the construction.The Navy opened the new base to a group of South Korean journalists last Wednesday ahead of its official launch scheduled for January.A total budget of 1.02 trillion won ($882.3 million) has been spent to build the harbors, separated into the warship zone and the cruise vessel area. It also includes a base complex, which houses the Navy's office and residence facilities, in addition to other amenities like a culture center and sports ground that can be shared with civilians.The dual-use base is capable of simultaneously docking up to 20 combat ships and two of the biggest cruise ships, larger than 150,000 tons.Now, the Navy has the drainage and paving works to finish in the final stage of the construction before wrapping up the new structure in December, which is about a 10-minute drive eastward from Jeju's largest tourist area of Jungmun along the south coast.The Navy stressed the new base will dramatically enhance the Navy's ability to counter North Korea's potential provocations at the sea borders both in the west and the east.Launched from the new port, it will take a South Korean warship 15 hours to reach the waters close to the border island of Yeonpyeong in the Yellow Sea, six hours faster than when launched from the major Navy base in Busan, according to an official. Yeonpyeong, located along the inter-Korean maritime border known as the Northern Limit Line, has often been a venue of inter-Korean military tensions following the North's deadly shelling of the border island in November 2010.Seen as a naval choke point where North Korea has to pass through to sail out to sea, the naval base on Jeju could also intercept North Korea's possible naval shipment of weapons of mass destruction to the outside world, the official said.The new naval compound also has in mind the mission to defend Ieo Island, known as Socotra Rock, a strategically important South Korean submerged rock located nearly 300 km southwest of Jeju.China has previously laid claims to the resource-rich rock, which South Korea controls with the presence of its maritime research center there.The Jeju base will cut a naval warship's travel time to Ieo Island from 13 hours to four, according to the Navy. The Navy will open a new installation on Jeju Island on Dec. 1 while the Navy's 7th Task Flotilla and a submarine unit will move to that location next month.With the relocations, Jeju will host more than 3,000 Navy troops along with an 8,500-ton guided missile destroyer and some 20 other warships at all times.The opening of the port will also put an end to the two decades-long naval project often fraught with opposition and protests from the residents of a nearby village and environmentalists. The naval base project was first spawned in 1993, with the Navy finally picking the current location in 2007.As the Navy began its construction work in 2010, the villagers allied with environmentalists and religious leaders kicked off a long series of protests, which continued into present day.The massive protests led to a major delay in the construction work, originally scheduled to finish by 2014, with some 700 residents of the Gangjeong Village and activists arrested for their protest rallies.

54,54,N.K. apparently fails to launch ballistic missile from sub,"North Korea apparently failed to launch a ballistic missile from a submarine, a South Korean official said Saturday, in a sign that Pyongyang has yet to master the technology.North Korea is believed to have fired a KN-11 missile from a submarine in the East Sea roughly between 2:20 p.m. and 2:40 p.m., but the submarine-launched ballistic missile failed to soar from the waters, the official said""The North appears to h...","North Korea apparently failed to launch a ballistic missile from a submarine, a South Korean official said Saturday, in a sign that Pyongyang has yet to master the technology.North Korea is believed to have fired a KN-11 missile from a submarine in the East Sea roughly between 2:20 p.m. and 2:40 p.m., but the submarine-launched ballistic missile failed to soar from the waters, the official said""The North appears to have failed in its launch,"" the official said, citing debris from the missile found on the ocean surface. The official asked not to be identified, citing the issue’s sensitivity. An image published in North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper on May 9 shows a ballistic missile believed to have been launched from underwater. (Yonhap)It is the first time that North Korea has fired an SLBM since May when it claimed its leader Kim Jong-un oversaw a successful underwater test-launch of a ""strategic submarine ballistic missile.""In May, South Korea's defense ministry described the North's SLBM launch as ""very serious and worrying,"" though the missile appeared to have flown only about 100 or 150 meters from the surface of the water.The Pentagon has denounced North Korea's test-firing of the missile as a ""blatant violation"" of U.N. Security Council resolutions.  The North's apparent failure shows that North Korea has yet to master the technology needed for SLBMs.SLBMs, if developed in the North, would pose a serious threat because their mobile nature would make them very difficult to detect signs of a launch in advance, analysts said.The latest launch attempt came just a day before President Park Geun-hye is scheduled to leave for Paris for a crucial U.N. conference on climate change.The leaders' event -- the opening of the conference -- is set to bring together leaders from more than 140 countries, including U.S. President Barack Obama, as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.It also came two days after the two Koreas agreed to hold high-level talks in the North's western border city of Kaesong on Dec. 11.The meeting is part of efforts by the two Koreas to implement the August deal that defused military tensions sparked by a land-mine attack blamed on North Korea. The incident maimed two South Korean soldiers near the heavily fortified border separating the two Koreas.Under the deal, the two Koreas held reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War in late October. They still remain technically at war as the conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Officials at the Defense Ministry, the state-run Defense Acquisition Program Administration and think tank Agency for Defense Development are confident they will nail down the technologies and pull off the project on time through research and development at home and cooperation with other countries, such as the U.K., Israel or Sweden. A bilateral working group with the U.S. will be formed in line with an agreement between Han and Carter to facilitate the drive, they say. The technologies are key to formulating integrated systems involving an active electronically scanned array radar, electro optical targeting pod, infrared search-and-track and radio frequency jammer. DAPA head Chang Myoung-jin even vowed during a parliamentary audit last month to complete the development of an AESA radar with air-to-ground capabilities by 2021, three years ahead of the initial schedule. The system is deemed the most challenging among the four. Rep. Chung Doo-un of the ruling Saenuri Party who chairs the parliamentary defense committee speaks during a news conference at the National Assembly on Nov. 17. (Yonhap)Yet the absence of concrete methods, coupled with constant flip-flops in the senior officials’ remarks, has only deepened skepticism. Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition camps have relayed calls to spell out who is responsible for the debacle and how to make sure billions of dollars of taxpayer money will not be misspent, with some members of the parliamentary defense committee, including chair Rep. Chung Doo-un of the ruling Saenuri Party, floating scrutiny by the Board of Audit and Inspection. In a bid to defuse criticism, President Park Geun-hye herself displayed her support for the project upon being briefed by Chang, then sacked her chief foreign affairs and security secretary, Ju Chul-ki, but to little avail. Critics have pointed to Kim Kwan-jin, chief of the presidential National Security Office, as a prime mover, demanding his resignation. As then defense minister, he presided over a controversial defense acquisition committee meeting in March 2014 to upend the earlier selection of Boeing Co. to instead pick Lockheed as a provider of 40 next-generation radar-evading fighters for deployment between 2018 and 2021, despite the slim possibility that the U.S. would issue the unprecedented export license for any of the four technologies. The know-how sharing was part of the 7.3 trillion won deal. At a parliamentary audit late last month, Kim admitted that he came to acknowledge Washington’s rejection last June but did not report to the president until September. “If no one were to carry the ball, we have no option but a formal audit,” Chung told the defense panel on Nov. 17. “If Ju stepped down as a sign to bear the responsibility, we will accept that, but I understand this was not it.” Kim Kwan-jin (left, front), chief of Cheong Wa Dae`s National Security Office, attends a meeting of the presidential committee on unification preparation on Nov. 5. (Yonhap)“To me, this looks like something that is subject to special public questioning rather than a parliamentary hearing with professors,” an industry source said, referring to a session held early this month to facilitate technical understanding. “It’s a multibillion dollar business, yet the people who are representing it now will not be there when the project will kick into high gear and suffer major technical difficulties, unlike their pledges. Who will take the responsibility then?”The outlook is growing darker for the transfer of another 21 technologies, for which DAPA had anticipated to secure the U.S. State Department’s endorsement this month “without any major problem,” as the agency demands specifications of subtechnologies as part of the plan. Seoul and Washington have also yet to hammer out details on the working group plan. No potential pathway appears to be in store for now. The proposal for a state audit is unlikely to translate to reality given the opposition of some ruling lawmakers. On Thursday, the committee decided to create a subcommittee tasked with “managing KF-X related risks” instead. In light of its scale and strategic significance, some observers have argued the program should be steered by a ministerial or intra-agency structure, rather than the procurement agency, so as to facilitate pangovernmental cooperation and boost transparency. Calling for a BAI audit, Rep. Yoo Seung-min of the ruling Saenuri Party has also suggested an official risk management group within the parliamentary panel involving experts. “The committee should play a greater role in keeping the administration in check, together with specialists,” he said during the recent expert hearing. “Fortunately there is apparent consensus that the project should go forward among the lawmakers and in the media, but it is true that officials, especially those who speak at the National Assembly and before the cameras, need to come clean more about the situation now, rather than trying to get off the spot,” a government source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The pair are expected to arrive at Clark Air Base on Saturday, KAI said.  The ferry flight involves the planes being directly flown to their destination and could involve making stops to refuel.  KAI said such delivery methods require careful planning because it has to take into consideration weather conditions and transit through airspace regulated by other countries.  The two planes are part of a $420 million government-to-government deal inked between Seoul and Manila that calls for the export of 12 FA-50PHs.   The two-seat supersonic jets are variants of the FA-50 light attack fighters in service with the South Korean Air Force. The planes that are derived from the T-50 advanced trainer can be armed with air-to-air heat seeking missiles, bombs and rockets, and have an automatic cannon.KAI said that the first transfer adheres to pre-arranged delivery scheduled with the remaining 10 aircraft to be delivered by 2017. The 12 FA-50PHs will be the first supersonic jets used by the Philippines Air Force since they retired their fleet of F-5s.  ""Meeting the delivery time will enhance the trust and confidence of customers,"" the aerospace company said. KAI was able to meet the delivery schedule when it sold 16 T-16 jets to Indonesia.   The company then said it is working to meet the delivery schedules for orders secured from Iraq and Thailand.  KAI has so far received 133 plane orders from Indonesia, Turkey, Peru, Iraq and Thailand for both the T-50 series jets and the KT-1 tandem, prop-driven basic trainers. These orders are worth some $3.3 billion.  The company said it is negotiating with Peru and Botswana to sell the T-50 jets, as well as seeking new customers in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America for the KT-1.  (Yonhap)","sole aircraft manufacturer said friday ,mission jets to the philippines ,the 482 kilometer ferry flight ,first supersonic jets used by ,16 16 jets to indonesia","['Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd.', ""South Korea 's"", 'Philippines', 'Sacheon', 'Seoul', 'Philippines', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'Seoul', 'Manila', 'the south korean Air Force', 'KAI', 'the Philippines Air Force', 'f-5s', 'KAI', 'Indonesia', 'Iraq', 'Thailand', 'KAI', 'Indonesia', 'Turkey', 'Peru', 'Iraq', 'Thailand', 'Peru', 'Botswana']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.36065006  0.82133001

Security Council.The tour has been put on hold since 2008, following the death of a South Korean female tourist by a North Korean solider at the scenic resort.Meanwhile, Seoul is seeking to hold family reunions on a regular basis as time is running out for the separated family members, whose number reaches more than 66,000 in South Korea. But the North has not responded to Seoul's call so far.The upcoming talks are expected to help bring rapprochement to the Seoul-Pyongyang relations if the two sides can yield tangible results, analysts said.The agreement also came as discussion is under way for U.N.

(Yonhap)Three senior officials from each side discussed the venue, date, level of representatives and agenda for the high-level talks. The meeting was held at Tongilgak, a building on the North Korean side of the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjeom.Under the comprehensive Aug. 25 deal that brought the two Koreas from the brink of an armed clash following Pyongyang’s landmine attack on Aug. 4, they agreed to hold government talks in Seoul or Pyongyang “at an early date.”The working-level talks began at around 12:50 p.m. -- more than two hours later than they were initially scheduled to begin due to “technical issues” regarding the setting up of communication lines, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry.At the meeting, the South Korean side was represented by Kim Ki-woong, assistant minister of the ministry’s Special Office for Inter-Korean Dialogue, while the North’s delegation was led by Hwang Chol, a senior official of the North’s Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland.The first round of the meeting, where the two sides explained their respective positions, lasted 90 minutes. The two sides resumed their talks later in the afternoon. South Korea’s Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo said that Seoul’s negotiators would engage in the talks to “prop up the momentum” from the Aug. 25 agreement. “We will engage in the talks to achieve the results that can be accepted by our people,” he added.A day earlier, the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, criticized the South for “scurrying to harm the North in cahoots with foreign forces.”“There has been no change at all in South Korean authorities’ stance since the August agreement,” the daily said. “While speaking of dialogue and cooperation, it has been scurrying to harm the North.”Observers say that the North’s criticism appeared intended to pressure the South to make more concessions in the working-level talks.An issue at stake at the meeting was the level of each representative for the high-level talks. Seoul has wanted to hold talks between its Unification Minister Hong and Kim Yang-gon, the chief of the Workers’ Party’s United Front Department that handles inter-Korean affairs.But Pyongyang has reportedly sought to hold talks between Hong and the chief of the secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland, an organization that Seoul does not see as equivalent to its Unification Ministry.Pyongyang believes that Kim Yang-gon, a secretary of the party, is an official higher than Seoul’s unification minister. The two Koreas also have different sets of priorities for the agenda of the high-level dialogue.Seoul prioritizes setting the issue of families separated since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. But Pyongyang has sought to address the issue of Seoul’s economic sanctions against it and the resumption of the long-stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan.The working level talks were held after Pyongyang rejected Seoul’s overtures for the talks three times, arguing that Seoul authorities had not been sincere about dialogue. The communist regime repeatedly criticized various issues, including South Korean civic groups’ dissemination of anti-Pyongyang leaflets and Seoul’s criticism of the North’s human rights conditions.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","hold government talks in seoul ,koreas on thursday held working ,thursday held working level meeting ,the two koreas on thursday ,two koreas on thursday held","['Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ki - woong', 'South Korea ’s', 'Unification Ministry ’s Special Office', 'Hwang Chol', 'the North ’s Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland', 'Tongilgak', 'north korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'south korean', 'Kim Ki - woong', 'the ministry ’s Special Office', 'Hwang Chol', 'the North ’s Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland', 'South Korea ’s', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Seoul', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'south korean', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'Unification', 'Hong', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'the Workers ’ Party ’s United Front Department', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Hong', 'the Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland', 'Seoul', 'Unification Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67256808  0.75942719

This installment looks into the strengths and weaknesses of the Communist Party of China. -- Ed.The greatest vulnerability facing the Communist Party of China is that it has never been given a popular mandate to rule the nation, China expert Yang Gab-yong said, underscoring the importance of the trust of the Chinese people to keep its governing legitimacy.  Yang Gab-yong (Song Sang-ho/The Korea Herald)Yang, head researcher of the Institute of China Studies at Sungkyunkwan University, said that the party has hitherto secured its legitimacy based on the fact that it founded the country and has achieved economic growth.“It is a somewhat vulnerable system in which people recognize and accept the governing party based on its historical legitimacy and the legitimacy based on the economic achievements. The question is: What if the public no longer upholds the party’s legitimacy?” he told The Korea Herald.To maintain its political legitimacy, the party has constantly pursued innovations to win the hearts of the Chinese, he noted. The party has also been running training and educational programs for Communist Party elites that represent the present and future of the party.Touching on Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s recent moves to consolidate his leadership position, the scholar said that Xi has apparently been bolstering his authority to ensure that the power succession process would proceed stably without causing confusion both in and outside of the party.“Xi needs to have adequate authority to ensure stable power succession,” he said. “Should the successors be determined, uncertainties over the power transfer will be reduced, which would help forestall potential confusion.”As for the party’s decision-making process, he said it would be wrong to believe that the process would be a top-down, inflexible and rigid one.Following is an interview with Dr. Yang.Korea Herald: The Communist Party has ruled the country since modern China was founded in 1949. How has that been possible?Yang Gab-yong: There are both external and internal factors. The external factor is the Cold War during which the U.S. recognized the strategic value of China amid its rivalry with the then Soviet Union. The U.S. wanted to bring China onto its side while China also had a confrontational relationship with the Soviet Union. The U.S. didn’t want to see China’s power weaken too much as it wanted China to play some role in keeping the power dynamics in its favor. So, there was this external environment that recognized the existence of China no matter what China did domestically – even if that might be a one-party dictatorship.When it comes to domestic factors, there has actually been no alternative that could supplant the Communist Party. And the party has “historical legitimacy” as it was the very party that founded the country. Since the Opium War (in 1840), China had explored ways to reestablish itself and find its own path toward the future. In the process, Sun Yat-sen, a Chinese revolutionary leader, favored republicanism, while Mao Zedong pushed for communism. After all, the Communist Party won in the competition over ruling ideologies and established China in 1949. For the Chinese people, the party ended the century of humiliation and laid the basic foundation for China to thrive economically. This gives the Communist Party historical legitimacy, which has been deeply lodged in the Chinese psyche.However, the historical legitimacy has faded with the lapse of time, meaning the party needed something else to ensure its legitimacy. After it adopted the policy of reform and openness (in 1978), China’s economy grew and the fruits of its growth have been shared among the people. Thus, Chinese have naturally thought of the party as the organization that has not only established their country but also fed them. People also anticipate that the party would lead their country on a path toward economic prosperity in the future as well. Therefore, the party has been something that they are thankful for.KH: You said that the Chinese feel grateful to the Communist Party for the founding of China and its economic growth. Is that sentiment shared by the majority?Yang: Well, there are those with vested interests in the party. For them, the party’s existence itself is linked to their own personal interests. They think that if the party is doing well, things will be going well for their country as well as themselves. We can also think of those who are apathetic about politics. Many Chinese show little interest in politics, unlike Korea where people’s confabulations are oftentimes dominated by political issues. Chinese rarely talk about politics, while they enjoy talking about bread-and-butter issues or their day-to-day lives. In fact, people’s political orientations have been influenced by the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), an intense sociopolitical movement to promote communism and eliminate capitalist ideas. Those in their 70s, who were “sent down” to work in rural areas during the revolution, believe that if power is concentrated or monopolized, it would have adverse effects. Their thoughts are largely liberal. But those who were part of the “Red Guards” or those in their 30s or early 40s who grew up after the country adopted the policy of reform and openness … they believe that the growth of the party and the country correlates with their own growth. They believe the party’s future mirrors their own, because they have grown up benefiting from the party’s economic achievements.There are of course those who are critical of the Communist Party. But they can hardly be grouped as a collective voice to challenge party affairs. This is in part because of the culture in which people rarely rally unless a prominent leader, whose interests are usually aligned with those of the Communist Party, encourages them to move. It is different from Korea’s culture in which an ordinary individual can encourage and push others to stage a collective movement against whatever they are unhappy about.KH: What are the vulnerabilities or weaknesses of the Communist Party?Yang: The biggest vulnerability stems from the fact that Chinese people have never directly entrusted the Communist Party with any mandate to rule the nation, for example through electoral procedures. The Communist Party has about 87.9 million members -- only a fraction of the Chinese population of more than 1.3 billion. It is like a small minority leading some 1.22 billion people -- something unthinkable in a democracy.It is a somewhat vulnerable system in which people recognize and accept the governing party based on its historical legitimacy and the legitimacy based on its economic achievements. The question is, what if the public no longer upholds the party’s legitimacy? Another weakness is the paradox of economic success. There have been income disparities and excessive development gaps between regions and between urban and rural areas. These issues could lead people to question the legitimacy of the governing party. The Communist Party is aware of these potential problems and has been striving to address them.KH: The Communist Party’s decision-making mechanism appears to have changed as its leaders have changed from such charismatic leaders as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping to others like Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping. What is your take?Yang: Over the last six decades, the Communist Party has basically maintained the collective leadership mechanism under which Communist Party leaders share their roles (according to their specialties) and respect the roles of their colleagues in the decision-making process -- or seek consensus when there is an issue that goes beyond any single individual specialty.Although the collective leadership was in place, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping had charismatic authority bestowed on them because of two things: their participation in the anti-Japanese campaign (1937-1945) and the “Long March” (the Communist Party’s military retreat between 1934 and 1935 to evade the pursuit of the Chinese Nationalist Party). But after the era of Deng Xiaoping, the charismatic authority disappeared. As society has become more pluralistic with the emergence of technocrats with specialties and expertise, there was no need for the country to rely wholly on a charismatic leader. In the past, the country, which lacked social capital and resources, might have needed the charismatic authority to push for revolution and economic development. Instead of this charismatic authority, Chinese leaders -- after Deng Xiaoping -- have relied on the institutionalized authority to rule the nation. In other words, their authority stems from institutions. Current leader Xi has been seen strengthening his authority by institutionalizing his leadership.What Jiang, Hu and Xi have in common is the fact that they all took the top posts in the party, government and military through the institutionalized authority. But under the collective leadership system, these leaders can be seen as a first among equals, meaning that the leader lacks the authority or power to push for future national strategies or power succession on their own terms. This is partly the reason why Xi has been seeking to consolidate his authority.Xi’s pursuit of a stronger authority appears to be related to power succession. In 1992 when the 14th National Congress of the CCP was held, Deng Xiaoping and other senior leaders designated Jiang and Hu as successors that would lead China between 1992 and 2012. Following that decision, the power succession process proceeded stably.  Should a competition be employed to pick successors, it could trigger confusion or infighting, for which a coordinator is needed. The coordinator needs to be Xi, and to undertake the coordinating role, Xi needs to have an adequate amount of power. Xi may want to pick two successors who would lead the nation for the next two decades following the end of his term in 2022. Should the successors be determined, uncertainties over the power succession will be reduced, which would help forestall potential confusion.KH: The role and behavior of senior Communist Party officials are important as people identify them with the party as well as the government. Yang: As the Communist Party has never been given a popular mandate to lead the nation, it is of paramount importance for the party to maintain trust with the people. For this, the party should keep pursuing innovations. At the core of party innovations is Communist Party elites -- the reason why the education and training for them are crucial.At various institutions such as the Communist Party’s Central Party School, there have been training programs for party elites. During training sessions, Communist Party officials are given ideological training and other classes. Through this process, the party conducts evaluations on trainees based on which they happen to discover talented officials and sometimes bring them to higher posts, or relegate those who are underperforming. China’s top decision-making panel, the Politburo, has also been running educational programs such as regular group study sessions to keep reinventing itself. Through the study, Politburo officials exchange their views on a wide range of topics and coordinate their stances to ensure a unified voice. The study session usually consists of some 50 officials including government speakers. Under Hu Jintao, the Politburo held collective study sessions every 45 days, while under Xi, these sessions have been held every month.The sessions are marked by heated debate on multiple pending issues such as the environment, defense, foreign affairs, education, governance and even sports. It would be a mistake if you believe that the decision-making process is only a top-down, Lenin-style inflexible one. All those in the dynamic group discussions exchange their views freely and candidly without caring too seriously about what others might think about their opinions.KH: You said that through group study sessions, the politburo gets to have a unified voice. But in the Communist Party, there have traditionally been divergent policy lines. How can unity be forged?Yang: There are still divergent views within the Politburo. For example, officials share the need for reform, but they differ over the width and scope of the reform. But when a policy decision is presented to the public, the announcement comes only after internal consensus is reached. Without any agreement, nothing would be divulged to the public. When there is internal conflict over an issue, the decision-making process might be put on ice or delayed until conditions are forged for building consensus.There was a case of Bo Xilai, an ill-fated politician, when some confusion in the decision-making was revealed, but it was an extremely rare case. A decision represents unity over a particular issue, but the process of reaching the consensus is not an easy one as it comes only after heated discussions and even onsite inspections if need be. KH: Do you think that the rule by the Communist Party will be sustainable?Yang: There are two conditions to that end. One is China’s continued economic growth. As the Communist Party has never been given any procedural legitimacy, it needs something to offset the absence of it. That is to continue economic growth to ensure that people have stable ways to bring home the bacon. By what percentage the Chinese economy will grow doesn’t really matter. What matters is whether the party can continue to create jobs and address unemployment issues, and prop up economic growth.Another condition is the Chinese government’s crisis management capabilities that affect public trust and sentiment about the party. As Chinese society becomes diverse, a host of things over which the party’s control does not extend have taken place, including drug dealing, human trafficking and other crimes -- plus natural disasters. Should the party fail to properly handle these unexpected situations, people would start to show skepticism over the party’s capabilities, which would dent the public trust.KH: The Communist Party has kept reforming itself to adapt to changing domestic and external environments. One example would be Jiang’s “three representations” theory to modernize the party and allow entrepreneurs and professionals to join it.Yang: The Communist Party is quite flexible, practical, open-minded and inclusive, although stereotypical ideas continue to remain that the party is rigid, dogmatic and inflexible. The party has continued to expand its boundaries to represent diverse groups of Chinese people as shown in Jiang’s three representations theory. Had the party stuck to its own socialist principles in a rigid manner, it wouldn’t have joined the World Trade Organization, the core capitalist institution. Of course, there are concerns that the changes in the party could undermine its identity as a communist party or its socialist principles. Thus, the party has been conducting exhaustive tests before actually applying anything new at a national level -- a reason why they have employed the cautious policymaking methodology of proceeding from “point to line and then to surface” in a gradual progression. If any policy experiment does not work as intended at one experimental point, its application would not be extended. They would stop the experiment or go back to the drawing board and start it afresh in their quest of viable policy options. History shows China has pursued constant change. The country that has upheld Confucianism for thousands of years adopted socialism. And later, it accommodated capitalism. In this respect, there is also a possibility that the Communist Party would change the party’s name into one that better represents a wide range of its members, such as “Chinese Society Party” or “Chinese Democratic Society Party.” The party may think that the name in itself is not important, and that what counts is the content that the party carries as a container to accommodate diverse hopes and wishes of the Chinese people.KH: Lastly, what major challenges do you think the Communist Party faces on its path toward the future?Yang: As there has been a growth of China’s middle-class, which might seek to raise their voices to protect their interests, the party needs to think about what kind of governance system would be effective to handle them. Another issue concerns those in the lowest income brackets that seem to be increasingly away from the party’s boundaries even though the party was founded based on their support. Thus how to take care of them is a major task.As the party continues to seek innovations and reform, it also needs to restore the role of the press. Currently, the Chinese media are under the control of the party and merely serve as a window to promote its guidelines. The party is leading its own reform, but it should not forget that it is the very subject of reform. For the reform to succeed, the third party, the media, can play a positive role.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)**Yang Gab-yong ● Yang, the head researcher of the Institute of China Studies at Sungkyunkwan University, is noted for his extensive research on the elites in China’s Communist Party, government reform and education training of senior party officials.● He previously served as a research professor at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on China at Kookmin University and senior researcher at the China Research Center of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. ● He has authored or coauthored various books and academic papers, including “A Study on Changes in China’s Top Political Elites,” “China-style Democracy and its Method to Recruit Elites” and “China’s Governance Reform: Perceptions, Issues and the Future.”● He obtained his bachelor’s and master’s degree from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in 1991 and 1996, respectively.

But further consultations over the technology transfer are expected to be time consuming, observers noted, raising concerns over a potential delay in the KF-X project, which is already a decade behind schedule due to feasibility concerns.Last week, the two sides held consultations over the issue in Seoul. The second round of talks are to be held next week in Washington.As part of their bilateral defense technology cooperation, Seoul and Washington have agreed to institute the Defense Technology Strategy and Cooperation Group. When the inaugural session of the DTSCG is held, the two sides are expected to discuss the technology transfer concerning the KF-X project.Meanwhile, local news reports on Wednesday said the board of directors of Korea Aerospace Industries, the nation’s sole aircraft-maker in charge of the KF-X project, reportedly raised the need to discuss ways to recoup the company’s investment in the project during a session last week.The project that involves both the development and production of the new fighter is estimated to be worth nearly 20 trillion won ($17.4 billion).KAI denied that the board of directors had demanded ways to withdraw its investment in the project. It argued that it was the directors’ obligation to discuss and check risks involved in any project, and that the process of contemplating potential risks was part of normal business.The KF-X project is Korea’s largest-ever defense project to develop an indigenous fighter by 2025 to replace the aging fleet of F4 and F5 fighters. With a budget of 8.5 trillion won, Seoul plans to develop the fighter and spend an additional 10 trillion won to produce 120 KF-X fighters by 2032.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","washington officials are reportedly opposed ,fighter by 2025 to replace ,attend parliamentary session on wednesday ,lockheed martin had planned to ,on wednesday yonhap lockheed martin","['South Korea ’s', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Han Min - koo(left', 'Chang Myoung - jin', 'the Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Martin', 'the U.S. State Department', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'the U.S. State Department ’s', 'the Arms Export Control Act', 'Seoul', '2021.seoul ’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Lockheed Martin', 'U.S.', 'KF', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'the Defense Technology Strategy and Cooperation Group', 'DTSCG', 'KF', 'Korea Aerospace Industries', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33432749  0.32158998

The same people benefiting from this, on the other hand, must accept lower wages just before retirement, with the money saved used to hire new employees.  Choi then said moves by state-operated corporations to use the national competency standards criteria when hiring workers is helping to build public trust and pioneering a culture that rewards real-work capability over mere education background.  He said the government intends to open some senior positions at public corporations to outside talent that can fuel innovation and change.On the overall state of the national economy, the finance minister said the rebound in consumer spending is helping to push up growth. He, however, cautioned that uncertainties surrounding U.S. rate hikes and the recent Paris terror attack are contributing to downside risks that need to be checked carefully.

Japan colonized Korea from 1910-45.  Experts said that the two sides, which both acknowledge a need to cooperate on North Korea contingencies for their own national security, should sit down and discuss the issue rather than letting the issue fester or develop into yet another diplomatic row.“Japan is, of course, seeking to secure its freedom of action in preparation of a contingency involving North Korea, while South Korea is concerned that Japan would step in, take the initiative and seek to expand its influence in the event of a contingency,” said Nam Chang-hee, security expert at Inha University.“Here, Japan wants to employ the international law that recognizes the North as a sovereign nation, while South Korea is seeking to use its domestic law to claim the North. Thus, it is a situation in which the domestic law collides with international law.”For more than five decades, Japan has recognized the North as a state. During the negotiations with Seoul to normalize bilateral relations, Tokyo refused to recognize Seoul as representing the entire peninsula -- a reason it has sought to engage in separate negotiations with Pyongyang to settle all compensation issues stemming from its colonization.“Although South Korean negotiators at the time argued that Seoul represented the entire peninsula, Japan apparently thought differently,” said Nam Ki-jeong, a professor at the Institute for Japanese Studies in Seoul National University.""So there has been some war of nerves between them. But that war waned after the two Koreas joined the United Nations in 1991. Seoul also did not seriously object to Tokyo’s attempt to normalize ties with Pyongyang.”Some military experts have said Seoul’s demand for consent for Tokyo’s intervention in a North Korean contingency could impede Tokyo’s military operations to support the U.S., which may intervene in the contingency to support its ally, the South. They, therefore called on the three nations to discuss this issue in earnest and move to bolster trilateral security cooperation.“I see this as an issue which needs trilateral discussion. If Japan is attacked because it is selflessly supporting the ROK (Republic of Korea) and the United States, and the ROK doesn’t want Japan to strike back, wouldn’t the ROK and the United States have a responsibility to cover Japanese equities?” said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the U.S.-based think tank RAND Corp.  “Each country -- the ROK, Japan and the United States -- has expectations of what they would need in a conflict. Unless they share and resolve those expectations, the potential for anger and dissatisfaction exists. Our countries need to work closely together.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","colonization although south korean negotiators ,korean contingency could impede tokyo ,south korea is facing diplomatic ,for japanese studies in seoul ,korea is facing diplomatic dilemma","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'South Korea ’s', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Gen Nakatani', 'Seoul ’s', 'Han Min - koo', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Koreans', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Nam Ki - jeong', 'the Institute for japanese Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'Koreas', 'the United Nations', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'north korean', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'ROK', 'the United States', 'ROK', 'Japan', 'ROK', 'the United States', 'japanese', 'Bruce Bennett', 'RAND Corp.', 'ROK', 'Japan', 'the United States', 'Song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 3.          0.          1.         ... -0.66259873  0.34590077

Adding to Orascom's woes, the North's government has also launched a competing local telecom operator wholly owned by the state.  Orascom has been in talks to merge the two operators, but Pyongyang wants to take control in case of a merger.  ""In the group's management view, the control over the Koryolink's activities was lost,"" Orascom said in its third-quarter financial results report released last week, citing ""a disagreement from the Korean side to grant the management the rights to control in case of the merger.""  Orascom has a 75 percent stake in Koryolink, with the North's communications ministry holding the rest.   Since starting the service in 2008, the number of subscribers has grown steadily to 3 million today, an impressive number considering that the North is one of the poorest nations in the world and government permission is necessary to buy mobile phones.  But the Egyptian firm has been unable to transfer its profits home due in part to international sanctions on Pyongyang and in part to problems associated with huge gaps between the government-set official exchange rate and the black market rate.  The North's government maintains the official exchange rate at about 100 won per the U.S. dollar, more than 80 times higher than black market rates, which are seen as the real value of the North Korean won.   At the official rate, Orascon's holding at the end of last year was worth $585 million, but it's worth only about $7.2 million at black market rates, according to Martyn Williams, a U.S. expert who operates North Korea Tech, a website specializing in North Korean affairs.   The dilemma is the North can neither pay the money at the official rate nor recognize the black market rate.  Orascom's ""problem is that conversion at the official rate is only possible with permission from the government, and the government clearly doesn't want to let such a large amount of money leave the country and might not even be able to afford it,"" Williams said in an article on his website.  Still, Orascom Chairman Naguib Sawiris held out hope for a resolution.  ""We are very proud of the success of our operation Koryolink. We have around 3 million people today carrying our phones in the DPRK,"" he said in a statement last week.

(National Police Agency)After the news went viral, some netizens raised alarms over “potential” terrorists here, calling for stepped-up readiness to combat security threats. Kim Ji-won, a 21-year-old university student based in Seoul, said she had witnessed a group of high school students wrongly accusing Muslims on the street following the Paris attack. “A group of high school students called my Malaysian friend in hijab ‘terror’ on the street,” Kim said. “I am worried that this tension heightens Islamophobia here.”Shekh Almamun, a Bangladeshi migrant worker rights activist and Muslim living in Korea, told The Korea Herald that he had been closely browsing Korean newspapers and comments online. “I was shocked to see some online comments saying that all Muslims here should be kicked out,” he said. “I hope the Korean government and Koreans do not mistake all the Muslim migrant workers as members of the Islamic State.”“We are just ordinary people working and living here who equally despise atrocities committed by a few extremists against innocent people in Paris,” he said. “The Islamic State does not represent all the Muslims. What the group does is far from what Muslims believe.” The Bangladeshi man was also worried that growing anti-Muslim sentiment would lead to what he called wrong crackdowns by the government on migrant workers here in the name of security. An expert on the Middle East also pointed out the panic over terror attacks and Islamophobia are understandable, but would not help the country in diplomatic or economic respects. “The paradigm of the attacks by the Islamic State has changed. It broke into ordinary places, like cafes, concert halls. South Korea cannot be an exception to the terror attacks,” said Lee Hee-soo, cultural anthropology professor at Hanyang University. South Korea has been included on the list of 62 nations taking part in the air strikes in Syria and Iraq, which the Islamic State vowed to attack as a part of its “crusader campaign.” “But South Korea has always been on good terms with Islamic countries. We should join the international fight against terrorism, but refrain from blindly looking at the Islamic part of the world from Western perspectives,” he added. “It would be a mistake to turn back on Muslims because of a few extremists as we are importing the majority of our energy from the Middle East and the Islamic world is generally favorable to Korea, thanks to Korean pop culture,” he said. “The unnecessarily mounting Islamophobia could make the society unstable and more fragile to the terror attacks,” he said. “The country should not draw attention from the radical group.”“As a middle power, the country should rather try to employ balanced tactics and tackle the extreme conflicts based on humanitarian standards,” he said. Kim Seong-in, a refugee rights activist of advocacy group NACEN, also expressed worries over asylum seekers, many of whom are coming from war-stricken Syria and seeking shelter here. “The growing hatred toward the Islamic world would likely take a toll on the prospects for the rising number of Muslim asylum seekers here,” he told The Korea Herald. “I agree with the need for enhanced security controls, but it should not close its door to those in need of help.“By doing so, Korea would only lay bare its weak and fragile tolerance toward the outside world.” In response to the growing fear, the rival parties are scrambling to pass the antiterrorism bill to allow the security agency to have more authorities to identify and investigate those suspected of being linked to terror groups. The government will also spend an extra 100 billion won ($86 million) on countermeasures against possible terrorist attacks next year and ramp up immigration controls. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","terrorist groups since 2010 ,school students wrongly accusing muslims ,week deadly attacks in paris ,terrorist attacks next year and ,and deported 48 foreigners suspected","['Paris', 'indonesian', 'Muslims', 'anti - islamic', 'indonesian', 'Nusra Front', 'al - Qaida', 'NIS', 'South Koreans', 'the Islamic State', 'Paris', 'indonesian', 'the Nusra Front', 'National Police', 'netizen', 'Kim Ji - won', 'Seoul', 'Muslims', 'Paris', 'malaysian', 'Kim', 'Islamophobia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Muslim', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'korean', 'Muslims', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'muslim', 'Islamic', 'Paris', 'Muslims', 'Muslims', 'anti - muslim', 'Islamophobia', 'the Islamic State', 'South Korea', 'Lee Hee - soo', 'Hanyang University', 'South Korea', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Islamic', 'South Korea', 'islamic', 'islamic', 'Muslims', 'islamic', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Islamophobia', 'Kim Seong - in', 'NACEN', 'Syria', 'islamic', 'muslim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea']",13,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.41869488  0.46289665

This installment looks into the intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry and China’s revisionism. -- Ed.China and the U.S. have been restraining themselves to conserve their strength, as they are caught in a long-term geopolitical rivalry, French China expert Francois Godement said, noting the limitation of conflict is the “main zone of bilateral cooperation.”During an interview with The Korea Herald, the scholar also underscored the need for the two powers to “make adjustments” in their external policies to promote stability and prevent needless conflicts.“For the U.S., promoting international legality in the geopolitical arena should be matched with acceptance for more representation of China and other major emerging countries in international economic institutions,” he said.“For China, it should demonstrate that it is not promoting a return to the ‘sphere of influence’ geopolitics that has always resulted in major conflicts in the past.”Touching on the widespread geopolitical interpretation of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which observers say could challenge the U.S.-led institutions such as the World Bank, he said the alleged risks were “vastly exaggerated.”""The AIIB has been designed almost as a business school case study -- a model whereby China can transfer management recipes from international institutions. And it is one in a gamut of Chinese funds active in the One Belt One Road initiative, for example,” he said. “A much more consistent challenge is the rise of financing completely outside international institutions -- commercial and tied aid through bilateral relations with complete opacity, but with resources that dwarf those of existing international institutions.”As for Beijing’s hopes to realize its one-China dream, he said “fast” reunification may be unlikely.“Politically, it (Taiwan) is one of the world’s liveliest democracies -- the risks of absorption in China’s top-down system are huge, as even the much more muted Hong Kong model demonstrates,” he said.“Political change in the mainland is the key, but it is as of yet unpredictable. Meanwhile, avoiding provocations on both sides seems to be the essence of wisdom.”The following is the full interview with Godement.Korea Herald: Chinese leader Xi Jinping has talked about his government’s main objective -- the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. What does this mean? How do you think Xi has been pushing to achieve that objective so far? Francois Godement: The “rejuvenation” of the Chinese nation, and the “China dream,” an expression that he also uses, are each interesting in their own way. “Rejuvenation” is a paradoxical term when population aging is actually looming ahead for China, with all its predictable economic and social consequences. And the past decades have been a period of extraordinary dynamism -- it is hard to see how China’s tempo could accelerate further. But what Xi Jinping means is going back to the roots of China’s historical greatness, and reclaiming them. This is a wider basis for legitimacy than Communist ideology, although of course Mr. Xi is also a staunch defender of the party. “Rejuvenation” also implies that China’s international standing was greater in the distant past, and that this position must be reclaimed. This is a conservative dictum -- quite close to the “restoration” (tongzhi) ideal of mid-19th century China.The “China dream,” less used recently, is an apposite dictum. First, it is a take on the “American dream,” and in both cases, the expression looks to the future rather than to the past. In his first speech when Mr. Xi was designated as China’s leader in 2012, he also extolled “people’s yearning for a good and beautiful life” and “happiness.” These terms, focused on the individual rather than on the collective, identify more with the French or American revolutions than with Leninism. Mr. Xi is pragmatic and diverse; he stands both for unabashed nationalism and for individual happiness.KH: Do you regard China as a revisionist or status-quo power?Godement: “The best defense is attack,” says an old French proverb. China’s economy may have boomed for almost four decades, but the regime feels threatened from the outside. The fall of other socialist states in Europe, the attractiveness of political democracy, the “soft power” that is now further enhanced by the IT age and social media are indeed issues for the Chinese leadership. Chinese society is individualistic, porous and increasingly outward looking. It is after 1989 that nationalism has been revived, from enhanced territorial claims to historical grievances, including at all levels of education. “Revisionism” follows on, since it is basically a method to redress perceived grievances. As a mobilization tool to keep in line the population -- especially the young -- by emphasizing both grievances and lofty international goals, historical revisionism is effective. There are, of course, more objective reasons for “revisionism.” The PRC (People’s Republic of China) was not a member of international institutions between 1949 and 1972. The Cold War ran on the supremacy of the U.S. and USSR. And when it ended, a short phase of U.S. leadership ensued. Not only has the economy boomed for 37 years, but also China has consistently outstripped every other nation in terms of the military budget’s yearly increase. It is hard there to distinguish the consequence from the cause. China’s economy, based on huge savings and external surpluses, shielded by its developing economy status, allows for much influence. The mere existence of two sets of rules -- one for developed economies, one for developing economies -- becomes an international challenge once a developing economy -- China -- becomes the world’s second largest. China navigates between these special advantages -- including a semi-closed capital account, a quasi-pegged currency and very little regard for labor and union standards -- and the realistic perception that if free trade, which has been very favorable to China, is to endure, then there have to be benefits for everybody. Hence the adoption by China of the “win-win” rhetoric once owned by the United States in the early 1990s. Hence also the push for inclusion in the IMF’s reserve currencies, and for market economy status. A booming export economy has a lot to lose from a breakdown in international economic institutions. More broadly, China’s strategic culture has always been torn between a “soft power” line, where the mutual advantages of trade and interchange ensure Chinese influence, and a bellicose streak. In geopolitical terms, China always advocates “stability” (by which it usually means a guarantee against regime change) but is not, or not yet, a status quo power. We can see that very clearly with territorial claims, but also with the reluctance to even state exactly what these claims are in many cases. A weaker China has signed up to many compromises in the past, (but) a stronger and ascending China finds it much harder to do so. This is in part because political leaders and activists could easily challenge one another on the basis of insufficient patriotism, and in another part because China’s rise is not finished and it is easy to guess that waiting, holding firm and wearing out opposing parties may produce better terms in the future. It is a thin line, but so far China has avoided the risk of any major conflict.KH: Many have talked about a “power shift” in Asia that has been triggered by the rise of China. Do you think that a regional power shift is really taking place? What are its implications on the overall security and that of South Korea?Godement: China’s march to the so-called regional hegemony is made of two trends. One is the anticipation by everyone of even more growth and capacities in the near future. If China’s military budget is already four times the ROK’s (Republic of Korea), and more than twice Japan’s, one can guess what will result in the future. But a military predominance (excluding the American balancer) could be matched by a consistent regional union based on democracy -- one that would be open to China but mindful of rules and restraint. That is not the case. While it is fashionable to decry the European Union’s clumsiness and its inward-looking attention, it is either resisting shocks or absorbing them. Southeast Asia, beyond negative principles -- conflict avoidance, nonintervention, and preference for consensus -- has no integrative method, and little unity on sensitive issues. The return of historical issues in Northeast Asia -- without ascribing responsibilities -- has created a triangle where China, with a public opinion under control and a centralized political system, has a maneuvering advantage. South Korea’s predicament is nothing new -- even though it is dynamic, it is still the smaller fish. If we had a triangle of cooperation in Northeast Asia, South Korea would not have a bargaining advantage over the larger economies of China and Japan. If this is a competitive triangle, then it is tempting for South Korea to play a balancing role -- in effect, trying to get more from one or the other. Yet two things appear clear: Korean reunification cannot happen without Chinese neutrality to the event, but China will not push for it. KH: Xi has talked of a new type of great-power relations with the U.S. How do you think China will manage its relations with the U.S.?Godement: There is no question that in spite of economic interdependence, the relationship is a competitive one for the foreseeable future. Both sides see threats to their role in the international order. China will no longer be contained, the United States will not give up its prevailing role in the international order. Both sides are in for the long haul -- in fact, this may explain why the Obama administration has been so restrained in its military engagement around the globe, from Ukraine to Syria and Afghanistan. And why China has skirted actual regional conflicts, conserving its strength instead. The limitation of conflict is the main zone of cooperation, along with non-vital issues -- climate and environment are one such example, just as an avoidance rule on terrorism: Neither side will hurt the other’s fight against terrorism, although they show little active support for one another. Could economic interdependence change that? President Park Geun-hye has described “Asia’s paradox,” whereby geopolitical clashes challenge economic growth. In U.S.-China relations, could economic benefit contain the strategic competition? Both sides must make adjustments. For the U.S., promoting international legality in the geopolitical arena should be matched with acceptance of more representation of China and other major emerging countries in international economic institutions. For China, it should demonstrate that it is not promoting a return to the “sphere of influence” geopolitics that has always resulted in major conflicts in the past. KH: The importance of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in terms of geopolitics seems to be growing particularly when the U.S.-China competition is intensifying. What do you think? Godement: China will not “use ASEAN,” because that would imply that ASEAN has a unitary stance and can be swayed as a whole. Recent history demonstrates that it is far more easily divided, and that is a weakness that any realist diplomacy -- but first of all China’s -- can exploit easily. True, China has made ASEAN as a whole a “strategic partner,” but that is more a matter of avoiding polemics than of positive action. Trade bargaining has created some results: the ASEAN Free Trade Zone and now the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) project, but these are more superficial deals than either the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) or the FTA concluded by the EU with Korea, and perhaps at some point with Japan. There is some U.S. responsibility, however, in the fraying of the regional order in Northeast and Southeast Asia. Following the adage that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” the U.S. has based much of its action on the transitory postwar order, conceived around hub-and-spoke alliances and with minimal attention to regional developments. There are now some adjustments with ASEAN and with the TPP. But by and large, the U.S. has acted as if the postwar order, based on a power balancer from outside the region, was eternal. The very successes of Asia challenge this view. KH: Amid uncertainties over the regional security and order, some stress the need to build a multilateral security cooperation mechanism in Asia, just as Europe has done. Would it be possible to build such a mechanism?Godement: I earlier regretted Asian division. But a grand scheme is not the way Asian history moves forward. We already have a surfeit of regional organizations, almost always with very limited common competences. Europe was built first among five, then seven, nine, 12, 15, 27 and 28 … What is much more important now for Asia is acceptance of existing international rules, of legal arbitration, and much more limited partnerships of cooperation. This is true above all of China, Korea and Japan -- although a full resolution of issues cannot be made without Russia, and in practice without Taiwan. We need more resolution of territorial issues among ASEAN members. China, the Philippines and Vietnam are a dangerous triangle, even if they have at some point agreed on common offshore exploration -- a development now well forgotten. Sixty years after the first attempts at European defense, Europe is not fully capable of defending itself without a U.S.-NATO contribution. Defense is the last mutualized area in international integration processes. More limited steps -- confidence building, conflict prevention and crisis mechanisms -- are more realistic priorities for Asia. CSCAP (Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific) -- in which both Korea and Europe have a hand -- has started on that road, which appears to be a slow one.KH: One crucial variable in China’s push for regional influence is Japan. What kind of a China-Japan relationship do you think China will pursue?Godement: Here is real interdependence limiting conflict. Even after some recent diversification, Japan’s big companies depend on China’s factories and the Chinese market. Northeast China is deeply integrated into Japan’s production chain. This has literally obliterated the polemics about Japan’s external trade surplus, which has instead moved to China. Adding to that, the absolute preference for peace of Japanese citizens is a huge restraining factor in a democracy. Even as relations with China have soured, this preference has not abated. Fundamentally, Japan had turned down in the 1980s what could have been a deeper form of Asian integration around Japan’s powerhouse -- a path divergent from the German case. And on defense issues, in spite of some debate Japan has been mostly reactive rather than proactive. Current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe must campaign hard to accomplish limited changes -- this in the face of literally 17 years of Chinese polemics and incidents that abated only between 2006 and 2009. Broadly speaking, Japan competes with one hand tied behind its back, and this is still by consensus.But the above applies to Japan. What about China? There is no doubt that there is a widely shared psychological of triumph in superseding Japan -- in economic size, in military budget if not yet capacities, in international echo. Frequent changes of leadership in the Japanese democracy also convey a sense of either weakness, or vulnerability to Chinese leaders who stay on. But if we do not believe Taiwan can be reunited under widely different systems, how could we believe that Japan could be Finlandized -- e.g. relegated to quasi-neutrality with a defensive military force outside any alliance? Influence is one thing, and China has gained that over Japan (although one would be surprised by the practical results of many low-key Japanese international programs). Subjugation or dominance is another story, and realistic Chinese leaders must see this.

But its ambitious plan has faced serious setbacks as foreign investment remains lackluster due to the North's provocations.The North has undergone difficulty in earning hard currency due to heavy sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council following the North's nuclear and missile tests.In another attempt to revitalize the economic zone, North Korea said it plans to pursue development projects in seven areas, including tourism and logistics. It also unveiled a list of eight North Korean firms that will be able to create a joint venture with foreign companies.The North said that profits and other proceeds generated at the zone can be repatriated outside North Korea ""without restriction,"" in what is seen as investment incentives to foreign investors. It also hinted at assuring autonomous operations for firms at the zone.""It is noteworthy that North Korean firms will be allowed to enter the economic zone, aided by foreign investment,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far East Studies of Kyungnam University.Analysts said the North's move indicates its attempt to boost its fragile economy by actively attracting foreign investment at a time when the North's international isolation is deepening.They said that the North's move may be aimed at achieving some accomplishments on the economic front ahead of its ruling party's congress slated for next year.The Workers' Party of Korea plans to convene the first congress in more than three decades in early May where the North may unveil a new line of policies.The North's move to foster logistics in the port of Rajin is also likely to lend support to a trilateral project which calls for the shipment of Russian coal to South Korea via the North's port, experts said.

The trilateral project will be carried out until Nov. 30.It is a symbol of three-way cooperation at a time when inter-Korean exchanges have become stagnant following the deadly sinking of a South Korean warship by the North in 2010.In November 2014, the first shipment carrying 40,500 tons of Russian coal smoothly arrived in South Korea in the first operation of the project. The second test was conducted in April.The initiative involves three South Korean firms -- top steelmaker POSCO, shipper Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. and state train operator Korail Corp.A group of some 20 government and company officials are set to cross the border between Russia and North Korea on a bus later in the day after they departed from Vladivostok a day earlier, according to the Unification Ministry.They will stay in the North's city till Friday to check the Rajin port's capacity to handle shipments and to see how smoothly vessels can be berthed there, the ministry said.The South Korean firms will decide on whether to clinch a formal contract based on the outcome of the pilot operation. It is highly likely that the signing of a formal deal could be delayed into next year.""It is unclear when the formal contract could be signed,"" said a ministry official, asking not to be named.The project is also part of President Park Geun-hye's vision for a united Eurasia, known as the Eurasia initiative, which calls for linking energy and logistics infrastructure across Asia and Europe.The project is regarded as an exception to South Korea's punitive sanctions on the North, which has suspended almost all trade and exchange programs, apart from a joint factory park project in the North's border city of Gaeseong.

The Saenuri Party will hold a meeting with the government this Wednesday to discuss plans to sign into laws a total of five pending antiterrorist bills as time is running out for the 19th Assembly. Six months remain before the incumbent lawmakers finish the current term.“We have to realize that no city in the world is immune to terror attacks. ... Even though the lawmakers have proposed antiterrorism bills, they haven’t managed to reach parliamentary committee as the main opposition has concerns over the NIS’ extended role,” said Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. The Saenuri Party Chariman Rep. Kim Moo-sung. YonhapThe bills aim to build an overarching agency to assess potential terror threats and implement counterterrorism policies. The NIS would lead the cross-government agency, tentatively called the “Synchronized Response Center for Terrorism,” to coordinate the government’s counterterrorism efforts. If implemented, the government would be able to collect information on potential terror suspects to prevent and take measures against them, such as banning the suspects from entering the country or trading foreign currency. The pending bills were all submitted by Saenuri Party lawmakers.Citing the intelligence report from the NIS last month that the NIS that two Korean nationals had reportedly attempted to join the Islamic States, Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, a former NIS official, reiterated the need for the legislation of antiterrorism bills.“Presidential decrees issued in 1982 are all the legislation we have related to antiterrorism. If terror attacks happened on Korean soil, we would never know how to deal with that. We should stop doing nothing on the bills that most advanced nations had implemented,” said Lee in a statement on Monday. But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy opposed the move and rebuked the bills as an attempt to extend the power of the NIS, an agency that the NPAD had claimed to have involved with illegal activities to support the government. “Considering the NIS’ past activities, I don’t think the NIS would fulfill the role (of addressing terrorism). It is like a weak company being assigned to lead important business,” said NPAD whip Lee Jong-kul, referring to allegations against the NIS of manipulating public opinion during the 2012 presidential election. The NPAD also cautioned that bills related to cybersecurity would pave the way for the NIS to conduct surveillance on ordinary citizens. The NPAD asserted that an independent agency, not the NIS, should overseas the government’s efforts to address cyberterrorist attacks.  “We need to create an independent body under the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning as Rep. Byun Jae-ill  had proposed in his draft bill. I believe (the NPAD alternative) would make terrorist threats disappear and achieve cybersecurity,” said NPAD Rep. Choi Jae-cheonon Sunday.

For this, the president offered to launch a multinational development bank to finance infrastructure works in Northeast Asia.“It will be good if we could establish a development bank specializing in Northeast Asia and cooperate with ADB, which oversaw Asia’s development for a long time, as well as the AIIB,” she said, referring to the Asia Development Bank. The ADB was conceived in 1966 for postwar rehabilitation in Asia and the Pacific, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has been proposed by China as a new international financial institution for infrastructure construction in the Asia-Pacific region.Park’s top economic aide told reporters later the proposal was offered on the premise of Pyongyang discarding its nuclear weapons under development for deterrence against what it calls Washington’s hostile policy.The remark came a few days after Park expressed her hopes for an inter-Korean summit.Before she left for a 10-day tour for three separate regional meetings on Saturday, Park said that she has “no reasons not to hold a summit” with the North.At the meeting with leaders of the 20 advanced countries, Park sat next to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the sessions, where they exchanged pleasantries after their first-ever summit in Seoul earlier this month.According to Kyodo news agency, Abe told Park that there has been a good atmosphere in Japan over bilateral ties since their summit in Seoul. Park told Abe that she was glad to hear that, the Japanese media said, quoting Japan’s Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshige Seko.Kim Kyou-hyun, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, later confirmed that Park and Abe had a chat, but they didn’t talk about the issue of former sex slaves, he said. In the previous meeting, Park and Abe agreed to speed up the negotiations this year on Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II, without setting a specific deadline. Korea wants a proper apology from Japan and compensation for sex slaves, while Tokyo claims the issues have been settled in 1965 when the two normalized their diplomatic ties.On the sidelines of the G20 meeting, Park also held a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron and offered condolences for the British citizens who died in the Nov. 13 Paris terror attacks.To improve capabilities to better deal with crises, the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral ties, said Park’s spokesman. Last year, South Korea helped evacuate nearly 50 British people from Libya.The two leaders also agreed to cooperate in peacekeeping operations in Africa and to expand ties to end an Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.South Korea completed its Ebola relief mission in the West African nation earlier this year. The mission was the first case of the South Korean government sending an emergency relief team overseas to fight the epidemic outbreak.By Cho Chung-un and news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","pyongyang to abandon its nuclear ,president offered to launch multinational ,korea abandons the nuclear weapons ,pyongyang discarding its nuclear weapons ,south korea completed its ebola","['Park Geun - hye', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'G20', 'Turkey', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Antalya', 'AIIB', 'the Asia Development Bank', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Park', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Kyodo', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Hiroshige Seko', 'Kim Kyou - hyun', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Abe', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Park', 'british', 'David Cameron', 'british', 'Paris', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea', 'british', 'Libya', 'South Korea', 'west african', 'south korean', 'Cho Chung - un']",8,"[ 4.          1.          0.         ... -0.78797346  0.52947336

In addition to the MDA, other participants included the Ballistic Missile Defense System Operational Test Agency, Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense, the U.S. European Command and U.S. Pacific Command, it said.""The test stressed the ability of Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense weapon systems to negate two ballistic missile threats while Aegis BMD (ballistic missile defense) simultaneously conducted an anti-air warfare operation,"" the MDA was quoted as saying.""This was a complex operational test of the BMDs which required all elements to work together in an integrated layered defense design to detect, track, discriminate, engage and negate the ballistic missile threats,"" it said.Assets involved in the test included a THAAD battery consisting of a THAAD Fire Control and Communications unit, THAAD launcher, and an AN/TPY-2 radar in terminal mode; a second AN/TPY-2 radar in forward-based mode; Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications; and the USS John Paul Jones Aegis BMD-configured ship with its onboard AN/SPY-1 radar, the agency said.The test, which was formally designated ""Flight Test Operational-02 Event 2a,"" began when an Air Force C-17 aircraft launched a short range air launch target around 11:05 p.m. (Eastern Time) on Oct. 31. The THAAD AN/TPY-2 radar in terminal mode detected the target, relayed track information to other assets and launched a interceptor missile and successfully intercepted the target.While THAAD was engaging the first target, a second and third targets were launched. The USS John Paul Jones launched a SM-3 missile to intercept the second target, but ""an anomaly early in its flight"" prevented a midcourse intercept, the MDA said.But the THAAD interceptor, in its terminal defense role, successfully intercepted the target in a demonstration of the importance of layered defense, the agency said. Aegis BMD successfully engaged the third target with an SM-2 missile, it said.The MDA said it is looking into what went wrong with the SM-3 missile.The U.S. wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and has increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a move.Seoul and Washington have claimed they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attends a military gathering of service members in Pyongyang, the Korean Central News Agency reported on Nov. 7. (Yonhap)“Pyongyang has declared a wide no-sail zone in the East Sea area, and we are looking at the possibility of the North launching a Scud missile or a new type of a ballistic missile,” the source said, declining to be named.Some observers raised the possibility that the North could conduct a test to develop a submarine-launched ballistic missile. In May, the North conducted an ejection test of the SLBM. Seoul believes it would take four to five years for the North to fully develop and deploy the SLBM. The North was expected to launch a long-range rocket under the pretext of space development around Oct. 10 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers Party. It has argued it has the “sovereign right” to launch a satellite. But the North did not push ahead with the satellite launch, amid pressure from Seoul, Washington and Beijing on it to desist from the launch.Some argued that even though the North declared a no-sail zone, it might not conduct any launch that would put it in a difficult diplomatic position. In August, the North set a no-sail zone and put its ship-to-ship missiles and coastal artillery in a combat-ready position, but it did not fire them.Should Pyongyang engage in yet another provocation, it would hamper the emerging mood for inter-Korean cooperation and exchanges, analysts said. It would also strain ties with China, which the North has recently sought to restore.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","test launch rocket north korean ,launch rocket north korean leader ,launched ballistic missile in may ,rocket north korean leader ,launch rocket north korean","['North Korea', 'Wonsan', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'Yonhap)“Pyongyang', 'SLBM', 'Seoul', 'SLBM', 'Workers Party', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49531561  0.42446241

But the administration of former President George W. Bush de-listed it in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.Calls grew early this year for putting the North back on the list after the FBI determined the regime was responsible for the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, though the U.S. left Pyongyang off the list in its annual terrorism report issued in June, saying Pyongyang is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since the plane bombing.

In the reshuffle, Kim was assigned as the commander of the 9th corps, stationed far back from the inter-Korean border.North Korea's 6th and 15th military divisions are in charge of defending the military demarcation line facing South Korea under the leadership of the second corps. Kim is believed to be among several military officials deeply involved in the provocation that escalated military tension with South Korea.North Korea buried landmines in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone, which blew up and maimed two South Korean soldiers in August. With an exchange of live fire between the countries later in the month, inter-Korean tension escalated before a last minute negotiation on Aug. 25 ended it.The reshuffle may have been decided in a ruling party meeting held right after the inter-Korean negotiation.Holding the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea on Aug. 28, the North said it sacked some members of the commission, but details were not released then. ""Under the quasi-war state declared after the landmine and shelling provocations, the second corps' shoddy artillery deployment may have been the reason (the reshuffle),"" another government source said. It is yet to be seen whether the decision was punishment, he said, adding that by any measure, it has something to do with the quasi-war posture the military took during that tense period. Despite the reshuffle, Kim is believed to be maintaining his position inside the powerful military group, given he was listed as a member of the funeral committee of influential government figures set up after the death of Ri Ul-sol, marshal of North Korea's military, last Saturday.The commanders of the North Korean front-line divisions are also staying at their current posts, according to the sources.

The new approach is worth trying despite some risks, including the North's demand for an immediate end to the South Korea-U.S. alliance, according to Joel Wit, a former Washington negotiator with Pyongyang. Speaking at a forum in Seoul, Wit pointed out that there is a consensus that the Obama administration's policy on North Korea has failed.But there is no consensus on what to do as an alternative, said Wit, who has long followed the North Korea issue. He is now a senior fellow with the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.A dilemma is the sequencing. The U.S. wants North Korea's denuclearization in advance, while Pyongyang says a peace treaty should precede it to replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement that effectively ended the Korean War.Wit called for renewed diplomacy for talks on an ""unconditional peace treaty along with denuclearization negotiations.""""It's complicated and difficult but probably the only path forward that could make significant progress by affecting core security concerns and political relations,"" he said. ""And I think the risks of adopting this alternative track are not that great.""On worries that Pyongyang would demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the peninsula at the beginning of the talks, he said North Koreans are ""not stupid"" as they know it would mean an end to the process.""It may be a litmus test to see where they are in their thinking,"" he added during the session hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.He argued the Kim Jong-un regime is winning the diplomatic battle with the U.S. government.For the past two decades, American presidents presented a choice to North Korea between giving up its nuclear weapons program and establishing better ties with the international community.Today, however, Kim is increasingly offering his own choice between ""accommodation and acceptance"" of a nuclear-armed North Korea or tensions and instability on the peninsula, said Wit.Kim's aggressive moves are based on the rapid expansion of the North's nuclear and missile capability, he added.The secretive communist nation is believed to have 10-16 nuclear weapons - six to eight plutonium bombs and four to eight uranium ones.Wit predicted the North will increase the number to as many as 100 by 2020 under the worst-case scenario.As for speculation about why Pyongyang has not fired a long-range rocket recently, he said there was no evidence of its preparation for such a launch other than media-led guesswork.

Asked about the media reports, Liu replied that such speculations were ""reported by foreign media, but were they reported in Chinese and North Korean media?"" Liu also told Suh that his visit to North Korea was aimed at making progress in bilateral relations with the North.

Some 500 South Korean vessels sail the region annually.The UAE, since 2011, has also been home to some 150 South Korean troops in the ""Ahk"" unit, which is charged with training special forces and conducting joint military drills.The extension plan aims to prolong the units' missions by one additional year to the end of 2016.Stressing the necessity of the extension, a ministry official said the plan reflects the increased dependency of the Combined Maritime Forces, led by the U.S. and operating in the maritime area, on the South Korean unit.The recent withdrawal of three European destroyers and a patrol plane from the region have raised the importance of South Korea's presence all the more, the official said in a background briefing.Referring to the Ahk unit in the UAE, the official said the extension may help bolster South Korea's capabilities to protect its citizens in the Middle East region in the event of an emergency situation. The parliamentary committee for national defense plans to table the bill on the extension plan on Nov. 18 to be voted on in the general assembly meeting tentatively scheduled for Nov. 26.  Budgets of 30.1 billion won ($26 million) and 7.9 billion won are estimated for the extended stationing of the Cheonghae and Ahk units, respectively.

AFP/YonhapNo agreements or joint statements are expected from the encounter between two sides that still refuse to formally recognise each other's legitimacy, and the meeting's lasting significance remains to be seen.But the encounter is undeniably historic: the previous occasion was in 1945, when Communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong met with China's nationalist President Chiang Kai-shek in a failed reconciliation attempt.The later Communist takeover forced Chiang's armies and about two million followers to flee to Taiwan, then a backwater island province, leaving a national rupture that has preoccupied both sides ever since.Since taking office in 2008, Ma's Beijing-friendly policies have drawn the two sides closer, yielding a tourism boom, the opening of flight routes, more than 20 trade agreements -- and Saturday's summit.","summit on saturday in singapore ,singapore afp chinese president ,and taiwan hold historic summit ,2015 the leaders of china ,singapore afp chinese president xi","['SINGAPORE', 'AFP', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Taiwan', 'Ma Ying - jeou', 'Singapore', 'Ma', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Taiwan', 'Ma Ying - jeou', 'Shangrila', 'Singapore', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'AFP', 'YonhapNo', 'communist', 'Mao Zedong', 'China', 'Chiang Kai - shek', 'communist', 'Chiang', 'Taiwan', 'Beijing']",10,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.51427943  0.64856714

This can be done through negotiations and the establishment of reasonable maritime rights,"" Xi said.China criticized last week's patrol of the USS Lassen, a guided-missile destroyer, within the 12-nautical-mile (22-kilometer) territorial limit of Subi Reef, one of the South China Sea features that have been claimed, expanded and reinforced by China over objections of other claimants, particularly the Philippines.The U.S. Navy said it wanted to demonstrate the principle of freedom of navigation.China has called it a ``deliberate provocation,'' and sent two warships to shadow the U.S. vessel and issue warnings. Although China labeled the action illegal, international law allows warships to transit other countries' territorial seas under the principle of ""innocent passage.""In an apparent reference to the U.S., Xi said that China welcomes countries from outside the region to participate ""in the peace and development of Asia and leave a positive influence.''China ""is committed to working with countries with direct stake in the issue to solve the disputes on the basis of respect of historical facts, according to international laws and through discussions and negotiations,"" Xi said.The U.S. does not recognize the man-made features as legitimate islands entitled to territorial seas, and U.S. officials say they plan to patrol near them on a regular basis to enforce that view. China has reclaimed approximately 2,000 acres (809 hectares) of land in the Spratly island chain since last year, and is now adding harbors, housing and airstrips.","president xi jinping on saturday ,navy moves to challenge beijing ,singapore ap china president xi ,freedom of navigation china ,singapore ap china president","['SINGAPORE', 'AP', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', ""the U.S. Navy 's"", 'Beijing', 'the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies', 'the National University of Singapore', 'Xi', 'China', 'Xi', 'China', 'Subi Reef', 'China', 'Philippines', 'the U.S. Navy', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Xi', 'China', 'Xi', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China']",0,"[ 0.          8.          0.         ... -0.40211034  0.78319627

The military will also launch a marine forces brigade on Jeju Island next month.However, Ulleung currently maintains only a base for reserve forces, led by a major-level officer from the Marine Corps.If carried out as envisioned, the deployment on Ulleung, 90 kilometers west of Dokdo, could give a strong warning against Japan, which has repeatedly laid territorial claims to the rocky islets.It is also anticipated to step up deterrence against North Korea's potential aggression because the completion of the U-shaped marine forces line-up could provide capacities to infiltrate to the center of North Korea from its shares in the event of an emergency situation. ""The Marine Corps forces to be based on Ulleung will be in charge of defending the strategic island as well as disaster response and other civilian protection duties,"" the official said. Referring to the plan, another military official said specifics of the plan have yet to be determined, including the size of the troops to be deployed on Ulleung.

(Yonhap)Public opinion is divided over how Seoul should handle the issue: Some argue that Seoul should keep a low profile and prevent itself from falling into a situation in which it has to choose between the U.S. and China. Others argue that Seoul should present a clear position against China’s maritime assertiveness given its national interests in keeping major shipping lanes out of China’s hands.Mindful of the complexities of the issue, which has developed geopolitical overtones with the U.S. launching a freedom-of-navigation naval campaign, Seoul had maintained a cautious stance. It had argued that the issues should be resolved peacefully through dialogue in accordance with the existing international rules.But Defense Minister Han Min-koo went a step further this week, appearing to take the side of the U.S.“The South China Sea is a crucial maritime traffic route where 30 percent of South Korea’s exports and 90 percent of energy imports pass through, and where South Korea has great interests,” Han said during a meeting of defense ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, South Korea, the U.S., China and Japan.“The government of the Republic of Korea’s position is that the dispute involving the South China Sea should be resolved peacefully, and that the freedom of navigation both at sea and in the air should be guaranteed.”The pressure on Seoul to take a clear position over the South China Sea dispute has been ratcheted up in recent months with the leaders of the U.S. and Japan touching on the need for Seoul to raise its voice on the issue during their summits in October and earlier this week, respectively.During a joint press conference following their summit in Washington on Oct. 16, President Barack Obama asked Seoul to speak up “when China fails to follow international rules and standards.”Opinions in Korea are sharply divided.Chun Young-woo, former presidential security adviser, criticized the Park Geun-hye administration for its “silence” on the issue.“Given that Korea imports a vast majority of its energy through the South China Sea route, the route is a lifeline for Korea. In this respect, the issue of securing the freedom of navigation is a more crucial security issue for Korea than for Japan,” he said in an interview with the local daily Munhwa Ilbo.“It is quite a shame that a situation has taken place where Obama had to ask Seoul’s position over the South China Sea (during the summit), because the Park Geun-hye government has remained silent over it.” But some others have argued that it is better for Seoul to maintain strategic ambiguity over the issue rather than taking the side of any major power not to get unnecessarily embroiled in a war of nerves between Washington and Beijing.“There is no reason for South Korea to speak up when it is not a direct claimant like Vietnam and the Philippines,” said Kang Jun-young, political science professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “It would be better for Seoul to just maintain its hitherto position that the maritime disputes should be resolved peacefully among the claimants in accordance with international rules rather than appearing to be siding with anyone.” By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","diplomatic challenge to south korea ,tricky diplomatic challenge to south ,jun young political science professor ,china others argue that seoul ,war of nerves between washington","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Han Min - koo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Seoul', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Han', 'Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'the Republic of Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Barack Obama', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Korea', 'Chun Young - woo', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Munhwa Ilbo', 'Obama', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines', 'Kang Jun - young', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 4.          5.          2.         ... -0.60817057  0.50421852

Han's stress of freedom of navigation, which has often been highlighted by the U.S. in the South China Sea issue, appears to be in harmony with the ally, rather than with China. ""The dispute should be settled peacefully through an agreement among related parties and in accordance with international standards,"" Han noted. Regional tensions have grown amid China's ongoing construction of artificial islands, called Spratly, in the South China Sea, seen as a move to bolster its territorial claims in the waters also claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam.Last week, the U.S. guided missile destroyer USS Lassen sailed close to one of the China-built islands, flaring up tensions between the super powers over the disputed waters. The defense minister also called for North Korea's denuclearization during the general session address, warning that the country's development of missiles and nuclear weapons is escalating regional tensions.""The Republic of Korea is combining dialogue and pressure to achieve the denuclearization of North Korea,"" he said. ""North Korea should stick to the United Nations Security Council resolutions and return to the six-party talks to denuclearize in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.""The ADMM-Plus kicked off Tuesday for a three-day run in Kuala Lumpur, involving the 10 ASEAN nations plus eight dialogue partners including South Korea, Japan, China Russia and the United States.Disputes between the United State and China over the South China Sea overshadowed the regional security forum, with the member countries failing to adopt a joint declaration due to the friction.Member countries of the ADMM-Plus had intended to adopt a joint statement following the general meeting held in Kuala Lumpur earlier in the day, but the efforts fell through after China voiced strong protest, a South Korean official said.China did not accept the draft of the declaration which mentioned the establishment of a Code of Conduct (COC) of Parties in the South China Sea that will govern the activities of the countries involved in the territorial dispute in the region.The U.S., meanwhile, insisted the binding COC as well as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, a non-binding document signed by China and the ASEAN countries in 2002, should be laid out in the ADMM-Plus joint declaration, the official noted.""The Chinese side expressed its rejection under the understanding that the South China Sea issues are basically matters pertaining to diplomatic authorities and this matter should not be reflected on the document of defense authorities' forum,"" the official added.As the China-U.S. bickering grew further, ASEAN countries suggested listing the issue in a Chairman's Declaration, but China vetoed it as well.The U.S.-China rivalry has overrode other issues during the meeting of their defense ministers, Ashton Carter and Chang Wanquan, held on the sidelines on Tuesday, according to sources.During the meeting, the U.S. side insisted that it will continue operations in the South China Sea while the Chinese side lodged a strong protest against the sailing of the USS Lassen in the area last week.Meanwhile, following a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Han told reporters that he proposed opening one more hotline each for the Navy and the Army of the two countries in a bid to stave off any accidental clash in the sea and air. The response was ""positive,"" he added.Han said that the Chinese side also requested building a hotline between defense ministries of the two countries ""as soon as possible"" and invited him to visit China earlier next year.

The North has exempted South Korean firms a fee on their land use for the past decade, but the exemption expires this year.

(Yonhap)Analysts say that South Korea has secured more “autonomy” in its foreign policy decisions as its national power has grown amid the relative decline of the U.S. superpower status, the rise of China and the continued deterioration of North Korea’s political and economic systems.“In the past, South Korea depended wholly on the U.S. to defend itself against the North. But now, its capabilities (both economic and military) have increased, giving rise to more room for autonomy in the Seoul-Washington alliance,” Kim Tae-hyun, diplomacy professor at Chung-Ang University.“The U.S. is also cautious in handling its ally, South Korea, as it has experienced a set of cases that triggered deep anti-American sentiment here. The competition between the U.S. and China has also expended the space for Seoul’s diplomacy to maneuver to a certain extent.”In the 21st-century international politics, countries have become freer in pursuing their pragmatic policy approach based mostly on interests, whereas it was difficult during the Cold War as they were forced to choose between the U.S. and the then Soviet Union.In what analysts call a “multipolar” world consisting of multiple major countries, opportunities to pursue mutual interests have increased as many countries, economically intertwined, do not see world affairs as a “zero-sum” game in which one side’s gain means the other side’s loss, experts said.“Based on the Cold War-era logic, you would be labeled as a betrayer or opportunist if you sought to be on good terms with both sides in different camps. But from the 21st-century viewpoint, this is only natural,” said Suh Jin-young, professor emeritus at Korea University.Seoul has recently made a series of foreign policy decisions that apparently prioritized economic interests while paying less attention to political or alliance factors in the decision-making process.During a summit between South Korea and China, the two sides agreed to explore the possibilities of a joint fund to support bilateral efforts to connect the two nations’ ambitious projects to link them with the world through massive infrastructure construction programs. Seoul’s project is called the Eurasia Initiative, while the Chinese one is called “One Belt One Road.” Washington has apparently seen Beijing’s high-profile project as a long-term plan to expand China’s sphere of influence. Seoul has also opted not to join the U.S.-led economic sanctions against Russia, which were slapped on the country after the Ukraine crisis last year. It has also joined the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, an institution that some U.S. scholars say could challenge U.S.-led financial institutions such as the World Bank.The South was also seen leaning toward pragmatism when it chose to buy four aerial refueling tankers from a European company in June, despite the rampant speculation that it would choose to purchase American tankers in consideration of its alliance with the U.S.South Korea is not the only one that has been pursuing interests over political relations. Britain has also been seen moving closer to China as it joined the AIIB and described its ties with China as being in a “golden era.”“Considerations of economic interests are also very important for national security. If your economy is broken, that could be as dangerous as being broken by a military conflict,” said Chun In-young, professor emeritus at Seoul National University.Observers stressed the need for Seoul to establish a firm foreign policy identity and strategy, to help countries around the world understand South Korea’s diplomacy and prevent them from looking at it with suspicion.“Seoul needs to have a firm strategy based on national interests and proclaim it to the world. This could be a middle-power strategy.

It is the government’s conclusion that the privately-authored system has failed,” Hwang said during a joint press conference with Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea at the Seoul Government Complex. “We need to make a textbook based on objective facts, and true to constitutional values.”He said that current history circles were dominated by left-leaning scholars, and private publication could only create textbooks that were favorable to the leftists and North Korea.The decision added fuel to the widespread protests nationwide led by the progressives, students, teachers and scholars, who have denounced the government decision as being unilateral with some suggesting it was politically motivated to glorify the past dictatorships.Lawmakers of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy (right photo) hold a rally in front of the National Assembly urging the government to withdraw its state textbook plan, while members of the ruling Saenuri Party (left photo) show their support for the plan on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy boycotted the plenary session of the National Assembly to protest the government’s decision.NPAD chief Rep. Moon Jae-in said the government “trampled the dominant public sentiment” against the state textbooks. “Ignoring the majority and pushing ahead with an illegal system, isn’t that dictatorship?” he said. But Rep. Kim Moo-sung, chief of the ruling Saenuri Party, bashed the NPAD for boycotting the session and said, “Dragging the textbook issue into a political standoff while people’s livelihoods are at stake is just not right.”Korea currently allows eight private publishers to author textbooks, and authorizes them for use. The system was implemented for Korea’s modern history lessons in 2002, and expanded to encompass the entire secondary history education system in 2011.Despite giving the go-ahead to the current textbooks in the screening process, the government in 2014 said they were too biased to use. The move came after President Park Geun-hye emphasized the importance of “correct history education” on a number of occasions.Hwang said that the nationwide rejection of a history textbook by Kyohak Publishing ― which was disputed for allegedly being of poor quality and overly favoring the conservatives ― showed just how lopsided the current history education system is. “After a series of threats and pressure from ‘certain parties’ on some 20 schools that chose the Kyohak book, only three schools are now using it. The remaining 99.9 percent use textbooks that are supposedly biased,” said the prime minister.Hwang said that the current textbooks have only a minimal description of North Korea’s torpedo attack on South Korean corvette Cheonan, “as if to back absurd claims that the ship was sunk by the U.S., or by rocks.” He also pointed out that teachers’ guides recommend to tell students that the Korean War was an “ideological war sparked by internal conflict of the Korean people.” “There are even questions that ask what juche ideology (Pyongyang’s official governing philosophy) is,” he said.Even though all textbooks say that juche is used to justify the North’s dictatorship, Vice Education Minister Lee Young said that the books devote five or six lines to describe the ideology and only about six words on its negative aspects. “Students will be affected by the portion that is described in length. I’m sure this is what most people will think,” he said.Last week’s poll by Gallup Korea showed that 36 percent of the respondents support the state textbooks while 49 percent opposed it. The ministry on Tuesday also posted the reviews of the public opinion on the issue it had gathered for the past 20 days, which showed that 152,805 people submitted written petition for the policy while 321,075 petitioned against it in paper. Additional 131,384 petitioned online against the policy. But the number showed huge disparity from the figure claimed by the NPAD, which said that over 1 million people handed in their signatures in protest of the policy. The ministry said the current system limits the ministry’s capacity to right the errors in textbooks, because of “rampant lawsuits by authors challenging the government order to revise the content.” The authors of six history textbooks are currently locked in a legal battle with the ministry over the content, and the case is still pending at the Supreme Court.Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea added that he would ensure that the new textbooks will be free from errors and bias, and said consultants from various fields will supervise the books. He said the ministry may display parts of the textbook online to receive feedback from the general public during the publication process.In addition to addressing the supposed bias, the new textbooks will place more emphasis on Korea’s ancient history, which is expected to downsize the section dealing with modern history in the textbook. In light of the textbook spat, there had been calls from the conservative media to reduce the portion of modern history that has is at the center of ideological dispute.Minister Hwang’s emphasis on ancient history also indicates that the new books will impose the government’s position on some disputed parts of Korea’s history. While stressing the necessity for “a unified voice,” Saenuri has pointed out that countries like China ― which has attempted to claim the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo as its own ― allows government to actively organize its ancient history. The minister also said the entire process would be transparent, although the ministry said it will respect the authors’ wish to remain anonymous for “obvious reasons,” referring to outside pressure.The specifics of the state textbooks will be unveiled at Wednesday’s briefing by the National Institution of Korean History, which will oversee its publication process.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","nationwide rejection of history textbook ,korea would officially reinstate government ,reinstate government issued history textbooks ,bias the new textbooks ,authors of six history textbooks","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'South Korea', 'Hwang', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'North Korea', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Assembly', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang', 'Kyohak Publishing', 'Kyohak', 'Hwang', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Lee Young', 'Gallup Korea', 'the Supreme Court', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Korea', 'Hwang', 'Korea', 'Saenuri', 'China', 'korean', 'Goguryeo', 'the National Institution of korean history']",16,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.412366    0.21090582

This installment looks into China’s relations and strategy for dealing with the two Koreas. -- Ed.China has apparently reevaluated the value of its communist brethren, North Korea, as a source of strategic leverage amid its reemergence as a great power, according to renowned China expert Suh Jin-young.Suh, professor emeritus at Korea University, also told The Korea Herald that due to the complexities of the love-hate relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang, Seoul’s diplomacy should be “prudent, cautious and sophisticated.”Suh Jin-young (Song Sang-ho/ The Korea Herald)""During the Xi Jinping era, China has reevaluated the value of North Korea and showed its intention not to bring its relations with Pyongyang to a catastrophic state,” the scholar said in a recent interview.“China, of course, feels concerned about the possibility that it could get embroiled in an unnecessary conflict because of the North’s provocative acts. But China can exert some influence in its relations with the U.S. and South Korea due to the North Korean card.”After several years of diplomatic estrangement, Beijing sent Liu Yunshan, a senior Communist Party official, to attend the 70th anniversary last month of the founding of the North’s Workers Party, setting in motion bilateral efforts to mend their ties.Touching on the unification of the Korean Peninsula, Suh highlighted the need for creative ways to forge an institutional guarantee that a unified Korea would not undermine the security interests of China, the U.S., Japan and other parties in the region.  “The then Soviet Union and other parties wanted an institutional guarantee to prevent Germany’s military recrudescence, and they found a solution through the NATO mechanism,” he said. “Korea should also find an institutional guarantee, with which China, the U.S. and others would not, at least, hinder the unification process.”He raised the possibility that the six-party talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia could be developed into a mechanism to ensure that Korea’s unification would not hamper regional stability.The following is the interview with Suh.Korea Herald: What kind of strategic interests would China pursue in its relationship with the Korean Peninsula?Suh Jin-young: If you look at the geopolitical aspects of the peninsula, it can be a point where two civilizations can meet and blend as it can serve as a bridge between maritime and continental powers. It can also be a very problematic point where the two civilizations can clash with each other.From the perspectives of China and Russia, the Korean Peninsula is a gateway to advance into the Pacific, while for the U.S. and Japan, it is a bridgehead to make their way into the Eurasian continent. So there have historically been many clashes on the peninsula and also amalgamations of different civilizations. One positive case of peninsular geopolitics would be the Italian Peninsula, where the Roman Empire flourished and thrived. I want to look at the destiny of the Korean Peninsula in a positive light. It is not always destined to be a victim of great-power rivalries or conflicts. Should Korea build internal capabilities to blend and manage different civilizations, it could open a new era in the 21st century. KH: Have there been differences in China’s foreign policy approach toward the Korean Peninsula after Xi took power some three years ago?Suh: During the Cold War, the world was divided by the two camps (one led by the U.S. and the other by the Soviet Union). The camps, which were different in terms of ideologies and political systems, were completely separated with China and North Korea maintaining an alliance “forged in blood,” and South Korea and the U.S. having their security alliance.After China adopted the policy of reform and openness (in 1978), the country’s foreign policy started shifting its focus to pragmatism. In line with this, China sought to forge a normal state-to-state relationship with the North, while trying not to damage the framework of the blood-forged partnership with the North. During the Hu Jintao era, Beijing tended to feel the considerable burden vis-a-vis Pyongyang. This continues into the Xi Jinping era. But what we should note is that Xi has employed a great-power diplomacy that differentiates his policy from those of Hu and Jiang Zemin. Hu and Jiang held the policy of “taoguang yanghui” -- literally, hide brightness and nourish obscurity. So, China kept a low profile and refrained from revealing itself, while trying to catch up with the U.S.But after Xi took office, China began raising its voice on the global stage. It has used a great-power diplomacy and risked taut tensions with the U.S. I think that in the midst of the growing geopolitical tensions, China might have started reevaluating the strategic value of North Korea. In the past, China thought of the North as some sort of liability. But during the Xi era, China has reevaluated the value of its communist neighbor and showed its intention not to bring its relations with Pyongyang to a catastrophic state. China, of course, feels concerned about the possibilities of entrapment, as it could get embroiled in an unnecessary conflict because of the North’s provocative acts. But China, I believe, maintains a long-term vision for the North, and recognizes the North as diplomatic leverage. China can exert some extent of influence in its relations with the U.S. and South Korea due to the North Korean card. That said, China is unlikely to abandon the North.KH: North Korea and China regard themselves as close allies. But there has also been political distrust. What’s your view?Suh: China has historically maintained deep relations with several countries including North Korea and Vietnam. China’s feelings toward these are an intricate mixture of love and hatred. The two countries might have had expectations about China, with which they shared ideological and political common grounds in the past. But when they felt betrayed (by China), the psychological scars must have been very deep.So due to the complexities of the relationship, it would take a considerable amount of time for China and North Korea to overcome their distrust. It is like a couple holding feelings of both love and hatred. One cannot easily dump the other due to the feelings built over long periods of time. So the complexities would last for long, and Seoul should pay attention to how the complexities would affect its diplomacy.When dealing with the Pyongyang-Beijing relationship, Seoul should take a cautious, prudent and sophisticated approach rather than regarding the bilateral ties just as a normal state-to-state relationship. For instance, if a third person barges in and tells a couple in a verbal fight that the two should go separate ways, how would the couple respond when the fight is over and they restore their feelings of love? KH: Would it be safe to say that China and North Korea are on a path toward reconciliation? Last month, China sent Liu Yunshan, the fifth-highest Communist Party official, to attend the North’s military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party on Oct. 10.Suh: I think the two sides demonstrated their resolve to normalize the chilled relations based on the shared understanding that any further deterioration in their ties would not be in their interests. Compared with the levels of the officials that Beijing sent to Pyongyang in the past, Liu’s position is not that high. I think that by sending him, China reciprocated the visit by Choe Ryong-hae, a secretary of the North’s Workers’ Party, to China’s military parade in September to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.The most crucial issue facing the two nations is Pyongyang’s nuclear development and its provocations against South Korea. China wants the North to promise not to do such things that would put China in a difficult diplomatic position, make China lose face or undermine China’s national interests to a certain extent. The North does not seem to have offered any (positive) response to China’s demands yet. This is the reason why summit diplomacy between the two has not worked out well. We should wait and see how the two sides entangle the complex web of the bilateral issues and how they would compromise. After its military parade, Pyongyang is likely to review its next steps based on its strategic calculations of potential rewards from the U.S., the South and other parties. The next steps may include its return to the negotiating table, namely the six-party talks. For the talks to resume, concessions on the part of the U.S. and the North are crucial. Ahead of the presidential election in the U.S., the Obama administration may want to make some achievement vis-a-vis the North’s nuclear issue. Thus, the opportunities could possibly emerge for an attempt by either side to seek solutions.KH: Do you think China is seeking to keep an “equal distance” with the South and the North?Suh: China wants to normalize its relations with the North, while also pursuing deeper cooperation with the South. China does not necessarily have to choose between the North and South, just as the South does not need to choose between the U.S. and China. Strictly from the perspective of national interests, China wants to keep good ties with both.This is possible in the international politics of the 21st century, although it was unthinkable during the Cold War. Based on the Cold War-era logic, you would be labeled as a betrayer or opportunist if you sought to be on good terms with both sides in different camps. But from the 21st-century viewpoint, this is only natural. Seoul should also recognize this.One of the things that I have emphasized when I chaired the committee of South Korean and Chinese scholars is that when South Korea and China think of advancing their relations, they don’t need to be bound or fettered too much by the presence of the U.S. and North Korea. I told Chinese scholars that if they should continue to take issue with the South’s special relations with the U.S., there would be no relations between the South and China, because the strategic relations between the South and China can develop based on the South-U.S. alliance. I told them that if they force the South to choose between China and the U.S., the South can’t maintain its ties with China. I have also told Seoul officials that they should recognize the special relations between China and the North. I have told them that it is inappropriate for the South to call on China to abandon the North without recognizing their special traditional relationship, when the South keeps its special relations with the U.S. It is like a married woman asking a man to dump his wife while the woman refuses to divorce her own husband. What is appropriate is that both get divorced and start a new married life together. So from China’s perspective, what the South has demanded could be seen as irrational, selfish and narrow-minded.As a scholar, I know how important the South’s alliance with the U.S. is. So, I tell both sides that they should recognize each other’s special relations with others, and that based on such a recognition, they can develop their bilateral partnership. KH: Although we should employ a diplomatic strategy that befits the post-Cold War era, the Cold War mentality seems to still live on. Suh: That mentality will not vanish overnight. Although the Cold War ended, differences in ideologies and values still exist, thereby allowing the confrontational structure to live on to date. Because of this, it would take a considerable amount of time for South Korea and China to build genuine trust. The relationship between South Korea and the U.S. has evolved into a value-based alliance, meaning the allies now share basic values. The relationship between South Korea and China is not based on values, but I describe it as a “solidarity of humanities,” which refers to a friendly relationship anchored in historical and cultural common grounds. The value-based alliance does not necessarily have to clash with the solidarity of humanities. In the world of human psychology, there is a complicated series of layers. The value-based partnership fits into the “rationality layer,” whereas the solidarity of humanities is relevant for the “layer of emotions.” The two are different layers, but both are needed for human beings. We need a sphere for values as well as one for emotions to have a holistic personality. Likewise, for a country’s diplomacy to become complete, it should have both a value-based alliance and a partnership based on humanities. Chinese leader Xi has talked much about neighborhood diplomacy, calling China’s neighbors a “community sharing a common destiny.” That community actually refers to the solidarity of humanities.KH: What is China’s position about the potential reunification of the Korean Peninsula?Suh: For the short term, maintaining the status quo on the peninsula would be most favorable to China. If the unification process should be set in motion, China would want a government that is friendly to it, or at least does not antagonize it, to lead the process. But the question is how we can guarantee it.If you look at the case involving Germany, the German military was incorporated into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to make it difficult to use its force in an unbridled manner. The then Soviet Union and other parties wanted the institutional guarantee to prevent Germany’s military recrudescence, and they found a solution through the NATO mechanism. Korea should also find an institutional guarantee to ensure that a unified Korea would not pose any threat to China, the U.S. or Japan. With the guarantee, China, Japan and other parties would not oppose or impede the peninsular unification. In Korea, there have not been any serious discussions yet about the institutional framework to facilitate the unification process. I think the six-party talks could be developed into an institutional foundation. I hope scholars can put forward creative ways regarding the institutional guarantee, without which China, the U.S. and Japan would not be thoroughly assured that a unified Korea would remain friendly to them.KH: What do you suggest for Seoul’s diplomacy amid the intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry?Suh: In international politics, there are largely three ways for a country to respond to great-power politics. One is “bandwagoning,” which is allying with a great power, just the way South Korea and Japan have done. Another is “challenging” as China challenged the Soviet Union and the U.S. during the era of Mao Zedong. North Korea has also challenged the U.S. The other is “balancing,” which is what the 19th-century Britain did. If you want to become a balancer, you should have sufficient influence that would tip the scale in favor of one of the major powers. But without adequate influence, you can’t be a balancer as nobody would look at you importantly if you can’t play a balancing role in the great-power relations. In the 21st world politics, all three -- bandwagoning, challenging and balancing -- do not seem to be suitable for South Korea.Thus, I thought of the concept of the “bridging diplomacy,” which I also call a “diplomacy of real estate agency.” If you want to play the role of a real estate agent between the two major powers, you need to meet two requirements. One is trust. You should build the reputation as a reliable real estate agent who can lead any bargaining between the major powers toward a “win-win” outcome. To this end, you need to have capabilities to gather intelligence and employ a “smart diplomacy.” The bridging diplomacy is easier said than done.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)*Suh Jin-young● Suh, head of the private Institute of Social Sciences, is known for more than four decades of extensive research on China’s history, politics and foreign policy, and a large number of his books and reports on these subjects. ● He has taught political science at Korea University for more than three decades since 1980.

It has long claimed its “sovereign” right to launch “satellites” for space development, and that it would continue to strengthen its “nuclear deterrence” against the U.S.At the meeting, the two sides did not discuss the U.S.’ potential deployment of an advanced missile defense asset, called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, to the peninsula due to the sensitivity of the issue, Seoul officials explained. The guideline to cope with Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile threats employs the so-called “4D” concept, the centerpiece of the allies’ proactive defense strategy. The 4D stands for “detect, defense, disrupt and destroy” -- the four major steps to fend off Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile attacks.“Detect” represents the allies’ procedures to track North Korea’s missile movements with various intelligence-gathering assets, while the “defense” refers to a set of the allied defensive operations to minimize any damage from potential attacks. “Disrupt” means striking North Korea’s core missile facilities including supporting installations, while “destroy” refers to the allies’ efforts to demolish the North’s mobile launchers, called TEL (transporter erector launcher), and incoming missiles.The new plan to pursue a conditions-based OPCON transfer cited Seoul’s enhanced intelligence and command-and-control capabilities as one of the conditions that allow Seoul to assume OPCON. Both had agreed that Seoul would assume OPCON once the South’s “critical” military capabilities are secured, and the security environment on the peninsula and in the region is conducive to a stable OPCON transition. These agreements came amid escalating controversy here over the potential deployment of THADD and Seoul’s jet fighters procurement programs. Pentagon had rejected the transfer of key technologies for a Korean Fighter Experimental project that aims to procure 120 combat fighters by 2020. In a joint press conference, Secretary Carter dismissed the speculation that Washington is unilaterally pursuing the deployment of the THAAD missile defense battery to South Korea, echoing the Pentagon’s recent dismissal of a Lockheed Martin official’s claim that the allies had been discussing it. Carter also highlighted bilateral efforts to keep float the KF-X project. He said the two sides would build a forum to discuss the botched procurement project, while reiterating the Pentagon’s rejection of the technology transfer that Washington said would violate U.S. law.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","2020 in joint press conference ,korea echoing the pentagon recent ,monday approved an operational guideline ,incoming missiles the new plan ,provocations during their annual security","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'North ’s', 'TEL', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'THADD', 'Seoul', 'Pentagon', 'Korean Fighter Experimental', 'Carter', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Pentagon', 'Lockheed', 'Martin', 'Carter', 'Pentagon', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",18,"[ 2.          0.          1.         ... -0.43062648  0.76108903

YonhapThe two, however, urged to keep the significance of the year 2015 in mind in the negotiations, said Kim Kyou-hyun, Park’s top aide on foreign affairs, indicating that joint efforts would be made for a possible conclusion by year-end. The two countries have been holding bilateral negotiations on compensating South Korean women who served as sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II since April last year.They have held nine rounds of working-level talks on the issue so far. No significant progress has yet been made. “While we discussed the matter of comfort women, I believe that we should not leave any obstacles for our future generation for the sake of building a future-oriented cooperation,” Abe said after holding the summit talks for 100 minutes in total.Park, for her part, urged Abe to mend the ties by curing “the pain of the past,” calling the pending issue of sex slaves “the biggest obstacle” to bilateral ties.She also mentioned a message left by a Japanese diplomat in the 17th century, Hosyu Amenomori, quoting him as saying that the two should strive for “relations of integrity and trust.” She was seen as pressing Abe to deliver a proper apology over Japan‘s colonial aggression as a foundation for building a future-oriented relationship.South Korea demands Japan take steps toward what Seoul regards as proper atonement for its wartime atrocities, while Tokyo insists all issues related to its 1910-45 colonial rule were settled in 1965 under a treaty that normalized bilateral ties in return for an economic aid package from Japan.“Trust is the most important element in diplomacy. I expect this summit will be a meeting that cures the pain of the past and also an opportunity for the two countries to improve relations through an honest discussion,” said Park at the beginning of the meeting.Abe also vowed to work together with Park to open a new chapter in the bilateral relationship, reiterating his earlier position without mentioning his view on the issue of Japan’s wartime atrocities.“I think highly of the development of the bilateral relationship in the past 50 years (after the 1965 diplomatic normalization),” Abe said.“Based on the past relationship, I will work together with President Park to open the new future of Japan-Korea ties.”The remarks came at an expanded summit that followed a closed-door meeting where they intensively discussed the issue of sex slaves, known euphemistically as “comfort women,” for an hour -- 30 minutes longer than originally scheduled. In the second part of the meeting, the two sides also discussed other regional issues including North Korea and economic cooperation, such as Seoul‘s possible participation in the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership. To join the TPP, South Korea must seek the consent of all 12-founding members, including Japan.“The two sides discussed ways to work together to promote economic integration including a trilateral free trade deal between Korea, China and Japan and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and also TPP,” said An Chong-beom, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs.While the much-anticipated talks ended on a friendly note, critics here said Seoul failed to make Japan offer an apology over its wartime atrocities.Park has been maintaining her two-track foreign policy toward Japan, preconditioning the summit meeting with Abe’s delivery of a sincere apology for comfort women. Seoul has been making moves to strengthen regional ties to better contain North Korea’s provocations while faced with pressure from the U.S. to improve ties with Japan to cope with China’s growing regional influence.Activists protesting the visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are blocked by police in downtown Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)The meeting, the first of its kind in over three years, ended without an official luncheon, drawing a contrast to the friendly banquet hosted by Park for Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Saturday.Abe was visiting Seoul for his first time in nine years, but returned Monday afternoon without making many public appearances during his 28-hour stay. Seoul provided protocol suitable for his “working visit” as he was visiting primarily for a trilateral meeting that ended Sunday, officials said.It was reported that Abe had considered visiting a traditional Korean wine house in central Seoul or a Japanese education institute as part of his public diplomacy and also to send a friendly gesture to Koreans who mostly view Japan’s atonement for wartime atrocities as a base for a renewed alliance. Abe also turned down demands by victims of sexual slavery to visit their joint residence in Gyeonggi Province. Currently, a total of 47 identified South Korean comfort women, mostly aged around 90, are living, down from 120 in 2007.A Korean woman who was forced into sexual slavery during the World War II sheds tears while watching TV news on a summit between Park and Abe on Monday.

In other words, during periods when the North Korean government has cracked down on the markets, like 2009-2010, markets generally have not permanently closed on any noticeable scale,"" Silberstein said.  ""North Korea seldom adopted policies of market repression with the intention of closing down the markets for the long term,"" he said in an article on 38 North, a website run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.  Since the early 2000s, the North's markets have seen overall growth, Silberstein said. While growth has been only marginal in some cities, other cities like the border city of Sinuiju have seen markets grow by over 110 percent between 2003 and 2014, he said.  In a number of instances, the complete elimination of local markets might not have been the intention of North Korean authorities, he said, adding that the regime could have wanted to remove certain types of traders, such as particularly wealthy ones, without doing away with the market system entirely.  ""The rise of markets is perhaps the most crucial institutional change that has occurred in the North Korean economy since central planning broke down in the 1990s,"" the expert said. ""Though marketplaces first arose as an illegal phenomenon outside the country's official economy, the state gradually formalized and regulated certain sites and incorporated them into the official economic system.""  Silberstein said the widespread perception that market activity in the North would be most prolific near the border with China is wrong, pointing out that the city with the largest aggregate market space per capita is the western port city of Nampo, followed by Haeju in South Hwanghae province.  The main reason for such southern cities having greater market space is because farming is more  prolific in the region and growers there may have more agricultural produce from farms and kitchen gardens to sell at markets, he said.

Sohn Hyuk-sang, a professor at Kyung Hee University’s Graduate School of Public Policy and Civic Engagement, stressed the need for across-the-board cooperation not only within government organizations, but also with businesses and civil society in carrying out a new global development agenda over the next 15 years. Sohn Hyuk-sang, a professor at Kyung Hee University’s Graduate School of Public Policy and Civic Engagement (KOICA)Set forward in September by 193 U.N. member states, the Sustainable Development Goals touch on growth, environment and other social dimensions, thus making it unfeasible for one agency to take the driver’s seat, he said. “Whether it be an independent committee, presidential or prime ministerial, or new agency or one that combines existing organizations, there needs to be an institution to cover all the various fronts, and this is impossible without the political will at the very top level,” he said in an interview with The Korea Herald on the sidelines of the Seoul ODA International Conference hosted by the Korea International Cooperation Agency here last week. Sohn, who also heads the Korea Association of International Development and Cooperation, expressed concerns over the current aid regime, where some state agencies, powered by their financial clout and formidable say in policymaking, push ahead with conflicting targets without a grand vision, or taking into account the voices from academia. The lopsided structure often leaves Seoul’s policy unaccountable, such as its “prior partner country” strategy and failure to scale up its official development assistance to 0.25 percent of gross national income by 2015. This could in turn hurt the country’s prestige and commitment as an emerging donor, he pointed out. “We have to crush the structure under which a few government officials dominate the policymaking process,” Sohn said. “After some 25 years since the country became a donor, it’s time for self-reflection and forge an inclusive partnership with civil society, corporations, universities and foundations. “Once the understanding of various stakeholders form the foundation, our policy can better embrace universal value, drum up national consensus and ensure long-term execution free from government changes and partisan bickering.” Though he welcomed Korea’s joining in the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, the professor cautioned that the government will have to have “strategic thinking” about how to harness the institution to maximize its own interests. Given limits in Seoul’s financing and analytical capacity in big infrastructure projects, it needs to expand collaboration with not only China, but also other major economies, as well as international organizations, he added. “Korea’s strategy should much hinge on that of China, whether China envisions the AIIB as an alternative of the traditional western Bretton Woods institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, which I believe would be unlikely at least until it becomes the so-called ‘G1,’ or as a niche market or a complimentary one between the camps,” Sohn said. “In the infrastructure market, minimizing risks is key. While boosting our own ability, we should more actively pursue partnerships with those with better capital raising capabilities and guarantee schemes. We can’t miss the opportunities out there ― infrastructure has already become one pillar of development cooperation.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","system the government should rethink ,korea strategy should much hinge ,the government should rethink ,government changes and partisan bickering ,government should rethink its top","['Korea', 'Sohn Hyuk - sang', 'Kyung Hee University ’s Graduate School of Public Policy', 'Sohn Hyuk - sang', 'Kyung Hee University ’s Graduate School of Public Policy', 'U.N.', 'the Sustainable Development Goals', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Korea International Cooperation Agency', 'the Korea Association of International Development and Cooperation', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'China', 'Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Korea', 'China', 'China', 'AIIB', 'Bretton Woods', 'World Bank', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",10,"[ 0.          4.          0.         ... -0.66554159  0.25269866

Carter was then driven to Observation Post Ouellette, just yards from North Korea's side; South Korean officers gave him the lay of the land. At Panmunjom, the so-called truce village where the July 1953 armistice was signed pausing the Korean War, Carter, flanked by U.S. and South Korean soldiers, looked across the line dividing the Koreas and then turned to tell reporters the U.S. alliance with South Korea is ``iron clad.'' ``Being here shows you up close how dangerous this part of the world is,'' he said. A United Nations coalition led by the United States fought on South Korea's side during the 3-year war against a North Korea backed by China and the Soviet Union. No peace treaty was ever signed, and the border area is considered one of the most heavily armed in the world. It was Carter's first visit to the DMZ as defense secretary and marked the start of a week-long Asia tour that also will take him to Malaysia. Asked whether he saw any reason for optimism about getting North Korea off its nuclear path, Carter noted that the Communist country's leadership is largely a mystery to Washington. He called on the North to avoid provocations and to carry out steps to end its nuclear program, as envisioned in talks it held from 2003 to 2009 with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea.  Pyongyang, believed to already possess a small number of nuclear weapons, has since stated that it would never return to the six-party talks. ``They should be on a path of doing less, and ultimately zero, in the nuclear field,'' Carter said. On Monday Carter is attending an annual security conference with South Korean defense leaders in Seoul. The talks are expected to focus on Seoul's progress in developing the military capacity believed necessary to no longer require the Americans to command South Korean forces in the event of a North Korean invasion. The South Koreans were to have taken the responsibility for wartime command of its forces several years ago but talked the U.S. into delaying the transfer indefinitely while it seeks to improve several aspects of its military.

(Yonhap)They also agreed to speed up their negotiations on a trilateral free trade deal and strengthen cooperation on electronic commerce, energy imports and an array of global issues including climate change and sustainable development.These agreements were reached as South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held a trilateral summit in Seoul for the first time since the fifth summit in May 2012.“In the joint declaration, we reaffirmed that the Trilateral Summit is to be held on a regular basis (as specified in the 2008 Joint Statement for Tripartite Partnership),” Park said during a joint press conference at Cheong Wa Dae.“Based on the spirit of facing history squarely and advancing towards the future, we agreed to work together for regional peace and stability.”Noting that the next trilateral summit will be held in Japan next year, Abe said that the agreement to “normalize” the three-way cooperation mechanism is a “very big” achievement.“Japan, South Korea and China, these three nations share the big responsibility for regional peace and prosperity, and the international community’s stability,” he said. “Taking today’s discussions as a starting point, next year’s summit will produce many fruits.”Li called multilateral cooperation “international trends,” expressing hopes that the three-way partnership would fare well in the “right direction.” During their talks, the leaders agreed to accelerate their negotiations for the “comprehensive, high-level and mutually beneficial” trilateral free trade pact.The negotiations have not yielded any tangible progress yet due to differences over services, investment and other sectors. Since November 2012, the countries have held eight rounds of negotiations.The leaders also agreed to “exert their leadership” influence to induce progress in the ongoing negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a mooted free-trade deal involving the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, South Korea, China, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand. Launched in November 2012, the negotiations over the RCEP have yielded progress in the liberalization of investment and service sectors. Seoul officials said that if the deal is clinched, it would establish a “firm foundation for stable regional trade and investment.”To explore new areas of economic cooperation, the leaders agreed to organize a trilateral consultative body that Seoul officials say would find the synergistic effect of the three governments’ economic policy focusing on creativity and innovation.To further promote electronic commerce among the three nations, the leaders agreed to strengthen cooperation in sharing information and conducting joint research and training on creating a region-wide integrated “digital market.”On the part of energy imports, the leaders agreed to step up their cooperation to secure stable importation of liquefied natural gas through various means, such as mapping out joint responses to future LNG supply crises and jointly utilizing infrastructures for LNG imports.The three nations account for some 57 percent of the world’s LNG imports. As for cooperation on global issues, the leaders agreed to work closely together for the successful hosting of the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The pivotal session of the conference, where the world is set to reach a new international climate agreement, will be held in Paris, France from Nov. 30 through Dec. 11. The issue of climate change is of great importance for the three nations as they account for some 30 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. The three nations have a combined population of some 1.5 billion -- a fifth of the world’s population.On the part of North Korea, the three leaders reaffirmed their “firm” opposition to the development of nuclear weapons on the peninsula and any action that would cause peninsular tensions or violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.A day earlier, Park and Li held a bilateral summit during which the two sides signed 13 memorandums of understanding and another agreement, all of which were related to economic cooperation.At the talks, the two sides agreed to make efforts for the bilateral free trade agreement to take effect within this year by speeding up domestic legal procedures. The leaders also agreed to establish a cooperative mechanism to bolster cooperation in the robot industry. Seoul expects the agreement to pave the way for it to advance into China’s massive robot market, which is estimated to be worth $2.71 billion. Also notable was that the leaders agreed to explore the possibilities of a joint fund to support bilateral efforts to connect the two nations’ ambitious projects to link the countries with the world through massive infrastructure projects. Seoul’s project is called the Eurasia Initiative, while the Chinese one is called “One Belt One Road.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sunday yonhap they also agreed ,china and japan on sunday ,trilateral summit in seoul for ,agreed to accelerate their negotiations ,sunday agreed to further institutionalize","['South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'yonhap)they', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'Seoul', 'the Trilateral Summit', 'Park', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'China', 'the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership', 'Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'India', 'Australia', 'New Zealand', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'LNG', 'LNG', 'LNG', 'the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change', 'Paris', 'France', 'North Korea', 'U.N.

First the U.S. sent a warship, in its most direct challenge yet to Beijing's artificial island building. Then, over Chinese objections, an international tribunal ruled it had jurisdiction in a case brought by the Philippines on maritime claims.Neither action appeared likely to stop China in its tracks, as it seeks to assert its control over resource-rich waters that it considers vital to its security. Beijing is expected to put a higher priority on what it sees as its strategic interests than its international reputation.But it could damage China's efforts to win more respect on the global stage as it emerges as an economic and military power. The United States, which has had little success to date in its five-year effort to put diplomatic pressure on China over its uncompromising pursuit of claims to more than 80 percent of the South China Sea, is hoping that makes a difference. It welcomed the tribunal decision and said it expected Beijing to abide by the final ruling next year. Although the tribunal was set up on the basis of a provision of the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea that both the Philippines and China have ratified, China has boycotted the proceedings. On Friday its Foreign Ministry declared that the ruling on jurisdiction was “null and void” and would have no binding effect on China.The Philippine case, which was filed before the tribunal in The Hague in January 2013, contends that China's massive territorial claims are invalid under the convention. The tribunal on Thursday decided it has jurisdiction in the case.The tribunal will also examine whether a number of Chinese-occupied reefs and shoals - including an artificial island that was skirted by a U.S. warship this week in a freedom of navigation maneuver that riled Beijing - do generate, or create a claim to, territorial waters and an economic zone. A U.S. ally, the Philippines, contends that they do not. “The fact that the tribunal did not reject jurisdiction on anything in the case brought by the Philippines, and could end up ruling against it on all these counts, introduces uncertainty and anxiety for China,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.Malcolm Cook, senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, said that outside of China, many maritime law experts feel the Philippines has a strong case and are skeptical of the legal basis for China's expansive claims, which it says are rooted in history. China roughly demarcates this vast area on maps with a nine-dash line.Despite China's latest legal setback, both Glaser and Cook didn't expect it to change course. “The Chinese navy has a very strong interest in gaining greater sea control over the South China Sea and this interest and its pursuit will likely not be affected by tribunal rulings,” Cook said.In all, six Asian governments have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, straddling some of the world's busiest sea lanes and in areas with rich fishing grounds and potential undersea oil and gas fields. China's massive construction to transform at least seven shoals and reefs into islands in the disputed Spratly Islands have ratcheted up tensions.Glaser said China views these waters off its east coast as vital to its security. China needs to control this area to avert any potential crisis intervention by the United States, which since World War II has been the predominant military force in the Asia-Pacific. The ruling Communist Party also needs to be seen as defending national sovereignty.Since announcing in 2010 that the U.S. has a national security interest in resolving disputes and maintaining peace and security in the South China Sea, Washington has failed to get Beijing to moderate its behavior. In fact, the opposite has happened. When the U.S. called for China and other claimants to halt land reclamation last year, Beijing appeared to double down, building airstrips and other facilities that could have military uses.Tuesday's sail-by of Subi Reef by the USS Lassen _ following long demands from Congress for action and months of debate within the Obama administration _ was the toughest U.S. step to date to challenge China's island-building. The guided missile destroyer sailed within 12 nautical miles (22-kilometer) of the reef to underscore Washington's position that the geographic alteration would not allow the previously submerged reef to generate territorial waters. Subi Reef is one of the land features under scrutiny by the tribunal. Lynn Kuok, a fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said the combination of legal pressure and freedom of navigation operations could yet prod Beijing into conforming more to the U.N. convention, even if it does not change its official stance on its South China Sea claims.“As China grows in strength as a maritime power, Beijing might realize that the country's interests are best protected by upholding rather than undermining the convention,” she said.

The South Korean budget is still subject to approval by the parliament's defense committee and the parliament itself.However, the budget approvals here and in Indonesia also follow earlier reports that the U.S. State Department has refused to provide at least four out of 25 key technologies considered vital to the development of a fighter jet with stealth capabilities, citing International Traffic in Arms Regulations.South Korean developers insist the country may still develop its own technologies, but many question the possibility.Under the multi-billion-dollar program, the country plans to build 120 combat jets by 2025.

A trilateral summit has not been held since 2012 due to a territorial dispute between China and Japan, as well as Japan's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation.

Seoul's Defense Minister Han Min-koo said that Washington has made no request to Seoul with regard to the issue as there has been no decision yet within the U.S. government. The Pentagon also said it has made no final decision on the issue, nor has it had any formal consultations with the South.It is not known what was behind Lockheed Martin's flip-flop, including whether Trotsky was truly not familiar with what's going on between the two countries or whether the company wittingly made the mistake in an attempt to promote the issue ahead of the annual defense ministers' talks.Lockheed Martin voluntarily called Thursday's news conference about missile defense at the National Press Club, where correspondents of many foreign countries are stationed. It is without a doubt that questions about THAAD are asked at such events.A similar incident happened in April when a senior Lockheed Martin official told the New York Times days before Carter's trip to Seoul that the company has been providing the U.S. and the South Korean governments with THAAD-related information. South Korea strongly denied the claim.THAAD, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is considered one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, and is manufactured by Lockheed Martin.The U.S. wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and has increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a move.Seoul and Washington have claimed they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.

Yonhap“Capitalizing on domestic technology and infrastructure, South Korea will localize key equipment and components. We will develop fighter jets so that we can upgrade their capability by ourselves,” said Chang at a parliamentary meeting. Lee Bum-seok, state-run Agency for Defense Development’s senior researcher for radar technology, echoed the remarks and said that Seoul was capable of developing four of KF-X’s core technologies — active electronically scanned array radar, infra-red search and track, electronics optics targeting and radio frequency jamming. He said the ADD was also seeking technical cooperation with Britain, Israel and Sweden to minimize risks.The KF-X project hit a snag this year as the U.S. Department of State denied in April export licenses for the four technologies U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin offered for the KF-X project. Washington cited that the transfer would violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations.While the military agency assured that the project could proceed without the intended transfer, critics have slammed the government for hiding the low possibility of the U.S. technology handover from the start, and also resorting to what they called a farfetched plan.In an unusual bipartisan move, the lawmakers of the Defense Committee said that the 18 trillion-won ($15.9 billion) procurement program needed stricter public scrutiny to avoid wasting taxpayers’ money. They also called for a parliamentary inspection into the KF-X program and held high-profile defense officials accountable for the tech transfer failure.Rep.

The parliamentary meeting meanwhile approved the relevant defense budget later in the day.Meanwhile, the Defense Committee on Friday approved 67-billion-won ($58.5 million) 2015 budget for the KF-X project.

It is not clear how sincerely Abe will deal with the issue at the bilateral summit.The issue warrants urgency as the number of former South Korean sex slaves has dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.Campbell expressed hope that Seoul and Tokyo could find some ""formula"" to go beyond the issue so that the two nations can move toward a future-oriented relationship.Touching on inter-Korean ties, Campbell said she was touched by the commitment by South Koreans to seek better ties with North Korea.South and North Korea reached a landmark deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tension and make efforts to promote inter-Korean exchanges.Campbell said the North's signing of the deal itself is seen as a small sign of hope for better relations between South and North Korea.On the North's human rights issue, Campbell also said she admires South Koreans' willingness to search for ways to persuade Pyongyang to improve its human rights record.

North Korea seemed to make such a decision by taking into account its internal affairs and foreign relations,"" ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said in a regular press briefing.Former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of the current leader, advocated a military-first, or ""songun,"" policy by operating the National Defense Commission as the main decision-making body.But the young leader has shifted his focus to the party since inheriting power in 2011 following the sudden death of his father.Kim is pursuing a dual policy of developing nuclear weapons and boosting the country's ailing economy, a policy South Korea and the U.S. have warned is a dead end for the country.The North conducted a massive military parade on Oct. 10 to mark the party's 70th anniversary. Kim delivered a rare public speech ahead of the parade where the North Korean leader showed his care for people.Experts said that the move could herald the full-fledged start of Kim's era amid prospects that the North's leader is likely to unveil his new polices or conduct a major reshuffle, based on his consolidated power.""Kim is expected to push for an overhaul for the party's leadership and personnel reshuffle at next year's congress,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute.""His grip on power will likely be strengthened further.""The first party congress was held in August 1946 under the regime of Kim Il-sung, the North's late founder and the current leader's grandfather.North Korea used the WPK's congress as a chance to announce new policy lines, including the five-year plan for economic development in 1956. At the sixth congress in 1980, Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, was confirmed as a successor to the North's founder.North Korea has seen its isolation deepening as it is under heavy sanctions by the U.N. Security Council due to its nuclear and missile tests.On the diplomacy front, North Korea's relations with China have been frayed since the North's nuclear test in early 2013.But the North and its treaty ally China displayed a show of solidarity during the military parade as Liu Yunshan, a top Chinese official, attended it in Pyongyang, standing next to Kim.

Bill Urban, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman, said in comments to Yonhap News Agency.Earlier in the day, Mike Trotsky, vice president of air and missile defense at Lockheed Martin, claimed during a National Press Club news conference that the two countries have already been in ""formal and informal discussions"" on the sensitive issue.""The THAAD system is the subject of a policy discussion between the United States and the Republic of South Korea. Those policy discussions are ongoing now,"" Trotsky told reporters.""As those discussions evolve, if there is an interest on the part of both countries to do something with THAAD, then of course, Lockheed Martin will enthusiastically support it,"" he said. He also said the discussions are at ""a very beginning state.""Trotsky's claim came ahead of U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter's trip to South Korea for the annual defense ministers' talks with Seoul's Defense Minister Han Min-koo, raising speculation that it might be a topic for the upcoming talks.The Pentagon spokesman declined comment on whether the issue could be on the agenda.""We are not going to be able to provide any information on what Secretary Carter is going to talk to his South Korean counterpart about until after the meetings occur,"" he said.THAAD, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is considered one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, and is manufactured by Lockheed Martin.The U.S. wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and has increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a move.Seoul and Washington have repeatedly claimed they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.A South Korean government official also rejected Trotsky's claims, saying that there has been no discussion on the THAAD deployment under way between Seoul and Washington as the U.S. has not even made a request for holding such talks.""If the U.S. makes such a request, we will, then, decide on the issue from the perspective of national interests,"" the official told Yonhap News Agency by phone.Trotsky said the U.S. missile defense system is designed in a layered architecture consisting of sea-based Aegis weapon systems, THAAD systems, and Patriot systems to ensure that enemy attacks won't penetrate all those layers. Such a layered system is also necessary for South Korea, he said.""So, having those layers makes it extremely difficult for the enemy to deploy any one technique that would defeat all three systems,"" he said. ""In a country like Korea, it might make sense to have more than one layer, to have a multi-layer system that is comprised of THAAD and PAC-3 or Aegis weapons system and PAC-3.""The official also stressed that THAAD is a purely defensive system.""It can't be used in an offensive way. The entire system, from the hardware to the software, must have an incoming ballistic missile to launch an interceptor,"" he said. ""It's a defensive weapons system. It would have to be completely redesigned to operate as an offensive weapons system.""

KFS’ strategy spans over four sectors -- tree tendering, sapling production and research, exchange of knowledge and consulting -- for Korea’s potential exporters to the Indonesian forest biomass market.KFS allocated 423 million won, or 56.6 percent of the total fund, for the systemic tendering and monitoring of forest plantations created to produce biomass energy. This operation covers the 1,001.8-hectare biomass plantation in Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia. The Indonesian state-run afforestation company is in charge of the on-site management, under supervision of KFS’ Indonesian office KFS assigned 125 million won, or 16.7 percent of the budget, for the management of the saplings and supporting centers. This includes a research center for the development of alternative plantation specimens of the major biomass-producing trees. The sapling farm also functions as a research and community education center, where locals can visit and learn skills on forestry farming. A total of 80 million won, 10.7 percent of the plantation budget, was spent on Korea-Indonesia exchange programs for forestry education and the international symposium on forest biomass. In exchange programs, Indonesian biomass experts were invited to Korea to lecture on Korea’s current status on the overseas afforestation market and the business outlook for global wood pellets as a source of renewable energy. The KFS also invited Korean businessmen to Indonesian plantations for training. The KFS injected 120 million won into consulting and information services for potential exporters to the Indonesian forest biomass market. The KFS accepts applications for state loans twice a year, in March and July, from South Korean exporters engaging in the Indonesian forest biomass and related businesses.    By Chung Joo-won (joowonc@heraldcorp.com)","korean businessmen to indonesian plantations ,business model of forest biomass ,the indonesian forest biomass market ,business outlook for global wood ,biomass energy and encouraged business","['Korea', 'Indonesia', 'indonesian', 'Semarang', 'Java', 'KFS)Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'the Korea Forest Service', 'Korea', 'indonesian', 'KFS', 'Semarang', 'Central Java', 'Indonesia', 'indonesian', 'KFS', 'indonesian', 'KFS', 'Korea', 'Indonesia', 'indonesian', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'KFS', 'korean', 'indonesian', 'KFS', 'indonesian', 'KFS', 'south korean', 'indonesian', 'Chung Joo - won']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44543934  0.64459169

Suh Chung-won, a senior Saenuri lawmaker from the pro-President Park Geun-hye faction, suggested that the recent criticism issued by Pyongyang on Seoul’s plan to reinstate state-authored history textbooks for secondary education was a “public order” to its associates.“The judicial authorities must conduct an investigation to see if there is any truth to this (claim),” Suh said during his party’s Supreme Council meeting. “If this is true, the authorities must find out which pro-North groups and individuals received the order and which actions the said groups and individuals took after the state textbook arose as an issue.”Saenuri chief policymaker Rep. Kim Jung-hoon chimed in by saying that the opposition’s logic in opposing the state textbooks is similar to that of Pyongyang, and added their fight will only fuel the people’s suspicion toward the government. Rep. Lee Jung-hyun of the same party had said earlier the opponents of the state textbooks intend to prepare to “communize Korea.”The ruling party’s accusation sparked furious reaction from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. “What about Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, (Saenuri lawmakers) Yoo Seong-min, Chung Doo-un and Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil (who raised issues about state history textbooks)? Does he (Lee) seek to report them to the authorities?” said NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul on Thursday. “(The comments) make me wonder if these lawmakers can even think normally. They aren’t the pro-Park faction; I would like to call them ‘pro-Park insane’ faction.” The same day, NPAD leader Rep. Moon Jae-in suggested that the president should launch an organization encompassing the education circles, historians and others related to the textbook issue to discuss ways to improve the existing textbook publication system. The current system allows eight private publishers to author textbooks, which the government authorizes for use after a screening process. Activists in support of the government’s plan for state-authored textbooks stage a protest against the current history textbooks in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap“Since the government and the ruling party claim that the current system has problems, let’s discuss the issue from square one,” he said in a press conference Thursday. ““In exchange, the president should temporarily cease attempts to push ahead with plans for the state textbook. ... The political circles should focus instead on policies related to the public.”The Saenuri Party immediately turned down Moon’s request, claiming that it is a “ruse” to drag the textbook issue to the center of the politics.The Park administration’s decision to take back the publishing rights of history textbooks for secondary education from private publishers has sparked nationwide objections, mainly from progressive historians and opposition lawmakers. Since the policy was announced by the Education Ministry on Oct. 12, a myriad of scholars ― including the state-run Academy of Korean Studies ― have issued statements decrying the move and vowing not to participate as authors in what they claimed was a “move to squash out diversity in historical interpretation.”As of this week, 181 scholars outside Korea also have signed a joint statement expressing their concern over the government-issued history textbooks. On Tuesday, President Park Geun-hye reiterated her resolve to push ahead with the contentious policy, saying “correct history textbooks” are essential for “normalizing history education.” Her Saenuri has also been accusing the opposition of attempting to use the textbook issue for political gains.A new poll by Realmeter announced Thursday showed that 44.8 percent of Korean adults support the state-issued textbooks, while 50 percent oppose them. The gap had narrowed from 40.4 percent for and 51.1 percent against in a poll held on Oct. 26-27.Those in their 20s, 30s and 40s overwhelmingly rejected the idea ― disapproval rates of 73.3 percent, 65.8 percent and 59.4 percent, respectively ― but 59.6 percent of 50-somethings and 68.4 percent of 60-somethings approved the policy.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks on tuesday president ,state authored textbooks stage protest ,current history textbooks in gwanghwamun ,opposition lawmakers since the policy ,ruling saenuri party on thursday","['South Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'North Korea', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Saenuri', 'Park Geun', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Suh', 'Supreme Council', 'Kim Jung - hoon', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Korea', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Chung Doo - un', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', '’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon ’s', 'Park', 'the Education Ministry', 'Academy of Korean Studies', 'Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri', 'korean']",16,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.69057393  0.81259364

A month earlier, the North's leader Kim Jong-un sent Choe Ryong-hae, one of his closest aides, to a similar event in Beijing.Speculation has been widespread that the communist allies are mending ties notably strained since the North's nuclear test in early 2013. But it's quite unusual for a senior Chinese diplomat to confirm the mood in public.China is seeking a ""normal"" relationship with North Korea, Qiu said, adding his country is supportive of the denuclearization of the peninsula and reunification.The six-party nuclear talks remain a viable option despite a drawn-out suspension, he stressed. The often-troubled process brings together the two Koreas, China, the United States, Japan and Russia.Some of the participating nations should lower the bar for the resumption of the negotiations, the ambassador said without naming them.The North demands nuclear talks with no preconditions, but the U.S. says Pyongyang should first prove its seriousness on denuclearization through action.""China's view is that starting dialogue is always better than no dialogue at all,"" Qiu said.On the Seoul-Beijing relationship, he said, it's better than ever on the basis of mutual trust.The veteran diplomat also dismissed concerns over a possible military conflict between China and the U.S. locked in escalated tension in the South China Sea.""The two sides may have serious disputes on some issues due to differences in values and political systems,"" he said. ""But there will never be a military clash. You don't have to worry about that.""He cited close economic and trade ties between the global powers.

""North Korea likely has already achieved warhead miniaturization, the ability to place nuclear weapons on its medium-range missiles, and an ability to reach the continental United States with a missile,"" it said.The report also classified the North's behavior as ""hostile,"" the highest in a five-step behavioral assessment scale, and its capability as ""gathering,"" the second-highest after ""formidable"" in a five-level capability assessment ladder.

The U.S. Navy sent a guided-missile destroyer within 12 nautical miles of artificial islands built by China in the South China Sea on Tuesday, a U.S. defense official said, in a challenge to China`s territorial claims in the area. (Reuters-Yonhap)The Cheong Wa Dae official also stressed that South Korea has a “strategic interest” in the South China Sea, saying that it is a key shipping route through which 30 percent of the country’s exports and 90 percent of its energy shipments pass.The remark, seen as South Korean diplomatic rhetoric, appeared to be reiterating its neutral stance over intensifying disputes between the U.S. and China.Seoul has been under growing pressure from Washington to clarify its position over China’s territorial claims in the area and support the U.S. if it takes actions to challenge Beijing. At a summit with Park two weeks ago, Obama said that Washington expects Seoul to speak out if China fails to abide by international norms and rules. Speculations grew fast here that Washington was nudging Seoul over China’s land reclamation projects while flaunting their renewed alliance.Seoul expressed its position a day after a U.S. navy destroyer sailed past one of China’s artificial islands in the South China Sea, which Beijing denounced as a “deliberate provocation.”China’s Foreign Ministry said its officials monitored and warned the USS Lassen as it passed what China claims is a 21-kilometer territorial limit around the Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands archipelago. The U.S. had signaled for weeks that it would undertake the mission to exercise the right to navigate freely in international waters, though it appears to have taken to pushing back against China’s growing assertiveness.China warned that it would not condone any actions that undermine its security. China has built the reef into an island by piling sand atop using dredgers, according to satellite images. The building program appears to be an infrastructure project to construct a runway capable of accommodating aircraft. Washington has warned that China’s artificial islands cannot be considered sovereign territory along with the right to claim the surrounding territorial waters.Under international law, military vessels are permitted to pass in the course of transiting through other country’s seas without notification.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","sea on tuesday defense official ,to challenge beijing at summit ,china sea on tuesday defense ,ocean in november 2009 photo ,china sea on tuesday","['Dae', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Korea', 'U.S. Navy', 'the U.S. Navy', 'the U.S. Navy', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Reuters', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'Park', 'Obama', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Foreign Ministry', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Washington', 'China', 'Cho Chung - un']",0,"[ 1.         12.          0.         ... -0.45896983  0.18943323

Daffalla El Haj Ali, the director general of the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ bilateral and regional department, reached an agreement with Korea on exchanging ministerial and high-level visits, enhancing mutual support at international forums, ratifying investment protection, preventing double taxation, hosting an economic forum and renewing aid facilities in Sudan. “Despite our geographic distance, Korea is dear in the hearts of all Sudanese,” Ali told The Korea Herald in an interview. “The 5th consultation was an opportunity to update one another on development and look toward new horizons for future cooperation.” Daffalla El Haj Ali, the director general of the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ bilateral and regional department. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldA career diplomat since 1980, Ali served as a counsellor in Seoul from 1990-92, and opened the embassy before the first ambassador’s arrival. During that time, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was the director general of the two Americas at MOFA, and the two diplomats met again in 2010 when Ali was a permanent representative to the U.N., he said. The forum was Seoul’s 14th meeting with an African nation as part of efforts to reach out to the resource-rich continent. This year alone, consultations were held with Equatorial Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Namibia, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Ivory Coast, Seychelles, Zimbabwe, the Republic of Congo and Ghana. Khartoum and Seoul established diplomatic relations in 1977, elevating the consular relations initiated a year before. The director general emphasized that Sudan valued Korea’s development experience with much regard. “We want a win-win partnership by combining Korea’s capital and technology and Sudan’s untapped resources in agriculture, minerals and livestock.”For foreign investors, three economic zones ― the Sudanese Free Zones, the Red Sea Free Zones and Al Gaili Free Zones ― operate near Port Sudan along the Red Sea.“Sudan is the gateway to Africa and bridgehead to the Middle East,” he stressed, adding that foreign capital could eye domestic, regional and continental markets.  Daffalla El Haj Ali, the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ director general of bilateral and regional department (center) and Sudanese Ambassador to Korea Mohamed Abdelaal (third from right) pose with Sudanese diplomats at the embassy in Seoul on Tuesday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldTo date, Seoul has provided $3.2 million in official development assistance to Khartoum with the help of the Korea International Cooperation Agency, which has supported a range of capacity-building projects in agriculture, information technology, education, vocational training and community building.A Korean medical center is being built in Wad Madani, capital of Al Gezira state in east-central Sudan, for the purpose of epidemic prevention and disease treatment. Ali pointed to the ongoing construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which came out of intense negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. “The project initially raised concerns from Egypt with regard to control over regional power,” he said, “but as a geostrategic player in the Horn of Africa, we played the role of an honest broker.”The water will be shared and the entire scheme will contribute to regional sustainable development, further establishing peace, stability and prosperity, according to the diplomat.Regarding the country’s relations with its southern neighbor South Sudan, which gained independence on July 9, 2011, after six decades of civil war, he said his government was working with the Intergovernmental Authority for Development to resolve issues left by the comprehensive peace agreement, principally demarcating borders and eliminating rebel groups.

Pakistani Defense Production Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, Lt. Gen. Syed Wajid Hussain and private sector representatives came on the invitation of Korea’s Ministry of National Defense. They attended the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition 2015, and visited the Doosan Defense Systems and Technology facilities in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, where they examined armored vehicles. Pakistani Defense Production Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain (right) speaks to The Korea Herald last week, with Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan (center) and Hajvairy Group chairman Tauqir Awan reflected in the mirror. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“Our Ministry of Defense Production has a mandate to supply domestically produced weapons and equipment to our armed forces, but the rest of the requirements are fulfilled abroad,” the minister told The Korea Herald. “Korea has highly advanced military technologies and products, such as the T-50 fighter trainer and tank engines, which we are interested in.”Pakistan is currently considering the purchase of Korea’s T-50 lead-in fighter trainer to revamp its air fleet training program. In March, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Korea’s Defense Agency for Technology and Quality and Pakistan’s Ministry of Defense Production. Minister Hussain said that Pakistan and Korea have held annual committee meetings on implementing joint ventures in defense production. “There is a proposal to build a shipyard in the Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea, and Korea is a priority partner we want to work with,” Lt. Gen. Syed Wajid Hussain said. The port is a major destination in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “As Korean commercial and military ships cross the nearby sea en route to the Middle East, it could be a commercially viable project,” according to the general. Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan highlighted that the two countries had cooperated in U.N. Peacekeeping operations around the world. Pakistan, since 1960, has become the largest contributor to the global peacekeeping efforts with over 67,000 soldiers serving. Regarding the security situation near the border with Afghanistan, minister Hussain said that 90 percent of the area had been combed through the military operation “Strong Blow” ― combining air strikes, artillery and counterinsurgency ― launched after the school massacre in the northwestern city of Peshawar in December. Rehabilitation and construction have begun, although there was much work left to get rid of terrorism completely, he added. Zhan pointed to the “Peaceful Neighborhood Policy” promulgated by the Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which works to improve security with neighboring countries India, Afghanistan, Iran and China. While Pakistan has maintained that the Kashmir territorial dispute must be part of discussions with India, India has insisted on tackling terrorism first, the ambassador claimed. “The U.N. Security Council resolution states that the issue be resolved through a free, fair and impartial plebiscite that would determine the Kashmiris’ sovereign fate,” Khan noted. “It is their right to self-determination, and should follow their wishes.”Khan added, “Like the divided families in Korea, Kashmiri people are divided on both sides across the world’s most heavily fortified borders.”Crossing the border that separates Kashmir is impossible, but the divided families hold reunions more regularly than the two Koreas, under highly restrictive conditions. The divided families and relatives in India and Pakistan visit each other by obtaining visas, according to the embassy. Lt. Gen. Hussain said that Pakistan’s security situation was similar to Korea’s, with heavily militarized borders with India and Afghanistan bearing similarities to Korea’s demilitarized zone. “Pakistan and India are forced to have large militaries under these tense political and security situations, which could alternatively be used for the development of people’s well-being and community,” he said.

Gen. Theodore Martin, commanding general of the 2ID, whose mission is to defend South Korea in the initial stages of a potential invasion from North Korea until other American units arrive.The artillery-oriented North Korean military has one of the world's biggest artilleries, including long-range multiple launch rocket systems and self-propelled guns, which put South Korea's capital Seoul and the surrounding areas within their range.""I am very fortunate, and I am the only division in the United States Army that has a three rocket battalion rocket brigades,"" the major general said in a press conference Thursday inside the 2ID's Camp Red Cloud in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, located between Seoul and the Demilitarized Zone.""The 210th Field Artillery Brigade has recently been reinforced with an additional rotation rocket battalion,"" the commander noted.Earlier this year, one more artillery unit was added to the 2ID's field artillery brigade to enhance counter-fire response capabilities.""We are very well-provided with precision guided munitions,"" along with an exceptionally trained artillery brigade, Martin said, adding, ""I am very satisfied with my capabilities at this time.""The combat power will remain unwavering even after the 2ID moves its base away from the DMZ, the commander said, referring to its relocation plan, which will start in 2016.Under an agreement between South Korea and the U.S., the entire division will start moving to the military compound in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, 70 kilometers southeast of Seoul, next year until the field artillery brigade last vacates the region presumably around the mid-2020s.He said even after the relocation, the 2ID troops will continue training in Uijeongbu and adjacent border areas by railing their equipment into the areas. ""As far as reacting to an event of crisis, it will make no difference in how we will respond,"" Martin said. ""It does not matter where I am based, because of the wonderful infrastructure that the Republic of Korea has to allow us to rapidly move North or South by rail or road.""Following the 1950-53 Korean War, 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea against North Korea's potential invasion as the war ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.

It has long threatened to carry out a fourth test.The six-party talks, which also involve South Korea, China, Russia and Japan, have not been held since late 2008.

""The U.S. continues to support Korean programs through the transfer of many of our most sensitive defense technologies. However, there is a very small group of technologies that continue to be unavailable for export,"" Army Lt. Col. Joe Sowers, a Pentagon spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency.""The U.S. will work closely with Korea to find ways in which it can continue to not only support the development of Korea's indigenous fighter, but other programs as well,"" he said without elaborating.It is the first time the Pentagon has commented on the issue.Last week, the South Korean Defense Minister asked the U.S. to reconsider its decision not to accept the technology transfer request when he met with U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter in Washington, but Carter turned down the request. The two sides agreed only to establish an interagency working group on defense technology cooperation.The Korean Fighter Experimental project, under which South Korea is to produce 120 combat jets, hit a snag after the U.S. Department of State in April refused to grant permission for U.S.-based Lockheed Martin's export of four out of the 25 fighter jet technologies it has promised Seoul.The defense ministers' talks last week came on the sidelines of South Korean President Park Geun-hye's visit to Washington.

We have not seen North Korea test or demonstrate the ability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon and put it on an ICBM, but prudence warrants that we plan for the worst,"" he said.Urban also noted that South Korea is in the process of securing major capabilities necessary to develop its own Kill-Chain and Korean Air Missile Defense systems that will be interoperable with the U.S. systems.On the possible deployment of the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system to South Korea, the spokesman repeated the existing U.S. position that it has made no decision on the issue.""We have made no final decisions regarding the deployment of a U.S. THAAD unit to the Republic of Korea.

U.S. State Department Special Envoy for North Korean human rights issues, Robert King (left) and State Department Special Representative for North Korea policy, Sung Kim testify during a full committee hearing on ""The Persistent North Korea Denuclearization and Human Rights Challenge"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (AFP)“With regard to the North Korean statement suggesting we enter into peace treaty discussions, we have no interest in entering into any such discussions,” U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Sung Kim said during a Senate hearing on Tuesday.“For us, the priority focus has to be the nuclear issue. As they often do, I’m afraid the North Koreans have their priorities wrong by suggesting that we sort of jump some steps, some very important steps, and start peace treaty negotiations.”Seoul put up a united front with its ally, accusing Pyongyang of trying to avoid increasing international pressure on it to renounce nuclear arms that it claims to have already “miniaturized and diversified.”“North Korea’s attempt at holding negotiations with the U.S. over a peace treaty before its denuclearization is like going backwards in time, as it did in the past,” a senior Seoul official told reporters, declining to be named.“That is actually an attempt to sideline South Korea (in the negotiations) and those schemes will no longer work. Those days (when that worked) are gone.” Seoul and Washington have long been reluctant to discuss Pyongyang’s proposal as it involves the withdrawal of U.S. forces on the peninsula and of the U.S.’ guarantee of the nuclear umbrella, both of which would shake the foundation of their alliance.Under the Joint Statement that was issued on Sept. 19, 2005, at the now-dormant six-party denuclearization talks, the concerned parties are to have separate talks on establishing a durable peace treaty. The parties include two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia.Pyongyang seems to be trying to set the mood for talks on the peace treaty as the atmosphere seems to be turning favorable for the resumption of the six-way dialogue, said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University.“The North is calling for talks on the peace treaty as the mood is emerging for the six-party talks after the two Koreas reached the Aug. 25 deal to defuse cross-border tensions and when neighboring states have been holding a flurry of talks on the resumption of the six-way forum,” he said.“What the North seems to be proposing is to sign a peace treaty first before discussing its denuclearization. We can say that the North is trying to put the peace treaty on the agenda (for future six-party talks).”The six-party talks were last held in December 2008. Seoul and Washington have called on Pyongyang to first demonstrate that it is sincere about its denuclearization, while Pyongyang and Beijing called for the unconditional resumption of the talks. To forge a fresh momentum for the talks, Seoul has proposed holding unconditional “exploratory” talks on the North’s nuclear arms before holding the six-party talks.

The opposing remarks by Nakatani were not released in the Defense Ministry's press briefing on the talks Tuesday and became known to the public through Japanese news reports.The differing stances highlight South Korea's security concerns over Japan's growing military presence in the Asian region at a time when North Korea's nuclear and missile threats are fast advancing.

The May 24th Measure has prohibited all inter-Korean economic activities, except for the Kaesong Industrial Complex.On the Pyongyang-Beijing relationship, he pointed out that it has repeatedly gone through ups and downs every a few years.The relations between the two sides appear to be warming with a visit to Pyongyang by Liu Yunshan, the ruling Communist Party's fifth-ranked official, earlier this month. Liu made the trip to North Korea to attend a massive military parade, becoming the highest-level Chinese official to travel there in years.

""We are committed to using the full range of tools -- deterrence, diplomacy, and pressure -- to make clear that North Korea will not achieve security or prosperity while it pursues nuclear weapons, abuses its own people, and flouts its longstanding obligations and commitments.""The envoy also said that the North's bad behavior has earned no benefits from the U.S. ""Instead, we have tightened sanctions and consistently underscored to the DPRK that the path to a brighter future for North Korea begins with authentic and credible negotiations that produce concrete denuclearization steps,"" Kim said.The envoy said the U.S. stands ready to defend its interest and its allies from the North Korean threat and have made it a priority to strengthen and modernize the alliances with South Korea and Japan. Last week's summit between President Park Geun-hye and President Barack Obama strengthened the alliance, he said.Kim said the U.S. has also sustained pressure on the North to ""increase the costs"" of its destructive policy choices. He cited an executive order that Obama issued in January to impose fresh sanctions on Pyongyang in the wake of the regime's hacking of Sony Pictures.He stressed that sanctions enforcement has improved over the past two to three years, causing some pain in the North.

During the North’s military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party, the North’s Korean Central Television reported that the strategic rockets displayed at the parade were equipped with “diversified, miniaturized” nuclear warheads that have “super-precision” strike capabilities.At the parade, the North unveiled the upgraded ICBM, called “KN-08,” which is presumed to be able to travel some 12,000 km -- far enough to strike the U.S. mainland -- and other formidable weapons systems.Lawmakers who were present at the audit of the NIS said that the agency evaluated the capabilities of the North’s weapons systems at the parade as “not excellent.”As for the reason why the North did not push ahead with its long-range rocket test around the anniversary day, the NIS said that the Pyongyang was not yet prepared for a missile launch, and that its ally Beijing had categorically opposed the destabilizing act.Although it hinted repeatedly that it would launch a “satellite” around the Oct. 10 anniversary day, the North did not press ahead with it. Pyongyang has also hinted at the possibility of another nuclear test, stressing the need to strengthen “nuclear deterrence” against the U.S.During the audit, the NIS also said that an increasing number of North Korean officials posted overseas have defected to the South. As of October, 20 North Korean officials defected to the South while 18 took asylum here last year.Among those officials are high-level North Korean elites, the NIS said.As for the health condition of Kim Kyong-hui, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s only aunt, the NIS said that her health is not bad, and she is currently being treated in Pyongyang. Kim has not been shown in the North’s state media, spawning speculation that she is bedridden with diseases ranging from heart-related problems to dementia and cancer.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","another nuclear test stressing the ,pyongyang is preparing for nuclear ,rocket test around the anniversary ,korea spy agency said tuesday ,another nuclear test stressing","['North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Pyongyang', 'NIS', 'Workers ’ Party', 'the North ’s Korean Central Television', 'icbm', 'U.S.', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'NIS', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'NIS', 'Kim Kyong - hui', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'NIS', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'North ’s', 'Song Sang - ho']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46550685  0.844706

The April 2015 U.S. Treasury report on exchange rate policies suggests South Korea may have intervened in foreign exchange markets to limit the appreciation of the won in early 2015,"" it said.The report said that President Park's attendance at last month's Chinese military parade caused some observers to express concerns that Seoul is drifting into Beijing's orbit, but other observers pointed out the attendance was aimed at consolidating China's support for Korean unification and strategic coordination with Seoul and Washington at the expense of Pyongyang.

The North is said to possess some 820 warplanes, though their planes are mostly based on old platforms. One of the most urgent issues facing the Air Force is the aging of its fleet of F-4s and F-5s deployed four decades ago.“The shortage of warplanes means that there could be a delay in executing a wartime mission, which could result in huge damages for our nation should any conflict break out here and be protracted,” a security expert told The Korea Herald, declining to be named.“Now, there have been moves to delay the decommissioning of the F-4s and F-5s. But think about how Air Force personnel would feel while operating the old platforms that should be phased out, while other nations are flying top-end warplanes.”The Air Force plans to decommission some 40 F-4s by the end of 2019. It will also decommission some 120 F-5s by 2019 and another 60 F-5s by 2025.The government currently plans to introduce 60 FA-50 light attack planes and 40 F-35s. But in the mid-2020s, the total number of the South’s warplanes is expected to be around 310, should it decline to purchase additional fighters. With technical challenges, observers expressed doubts over whether the South can carry out the KF-X program as planned. The KF-X program, which includes both the development and production of the home-built warplane, is expected to cost nearly 20 trillion won ($17.7 billion). Under the project, Seoul seeks to deploy 120 fighters after 2023 to replace its aging fleets of F-4s and F-5s.By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","potential delay in seoul ambitious ,delay in seoul ambitious project ,delay in seoul ambitious ,aging fighter fleet last week ,foreshadowing potential delay in seoul","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the South ’s Air Force', 'KF - X', 'north korean', 'Air Force', 'Korea Institute for Defense Analyses', 'KF-16', 'the Air Force', 'the Air Force', 'f-5s', 'the Korea Herald', 'f-5s', 'Air Force', 'Air Force', 'KF', 'Seoul', 'f-5s']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.58034408  0.05650331

General Assembly adopted a similar resolution that called for the U.N. Security Council to refer the North's human rights abuses to the ICC.

General Fan Changlong's remarks came as expectations grow that the U.S. might directly challenge Chinese claims in the South China Sea by sailing a Navy ship inside the 12-nautical mile (21-kilometer) territorial limit surrounding one of the man-made islands. Concerns have been growing over the rapid appearance of islands created by piling sand atop reefs and atolls controlled by China, which is now adding harbors, air strips and large buildings. The U.S. and others have called on Beijing to halt those projects, saying they are destabilizing an increasingly militarized region. Fan said concerns that the island construction could affect freedom of navigation were unfounded. ``In fact, those construction projects are mainly carried out for civil purposes,'' Fan told the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing. ``As we have promised, the projects will not affect freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Instead, they will enable us to provide better public services to aid navigation and production in the South China Sea.''  China's assurances have failed to gain much traction abroad, and speaking shortly after Fan, Admiral Gary Roughead, the former U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, said the rapid expansion of the islands and a lack of clarity from Beijing ``heightens suspicions and presents the potential for miscalculations.'' While Beijing's assurances are welcomed, confidence measures and increased transparency are needed to assuage China's neighbors of its peaceful intent, Roughead said. Fan cited the recent launch of operations by two new lighthouses on Chinese island holdings as evidence of good intentions and said Beijing was committed to resolving disputes peacefully.  ``We will never recklessly resort to the use of force, even on issues bearing upon sovereignty, and have done our utmost to avoid unexpected conflicts, said the general, a vice chairman of the powerful commission controlling the military that is headed by President Xi Jinping. Fan also said China would accelerate the establishment of an 8,000-member stand-by force for U.N. peacekeeping missions promised by Xi at the U.N. last month, as well as a commitment to train 2,000 foreign peacekeepers over the next five years. China will also pursue expanded military cooperation with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian States, whose defense ministers it hosted at a forum in Beijing on Friday. That includes exploring the possibility of establishing hotlines and exchanging liaison officers between their militaries, Fan said. The ASEAN meeting and Xiangshan Forum are part of an effort by China's military to burnish its reputation in a region wary of Beijing's territorial ambitions. Four of the ASEAN countries have claims to seas and islands in the South China Sea that clash with Beijing's own.Unnamed Pentagon officials said last week that the U.S. Navy may soon receive approval to sail a ship inside the 12-nautical mile (21-kilometer) territorial limit surrounding China's man-made islands, reported the Navy Times, which is closely affiliated with the U.S. Navy.ASEAN member Philippines on Wednesday gave strong backing for such a move. Sailing within the boundary would mark the first time the U.S. has directly challenged China's territorial claims since 2012 and reinforce Washington's assertion that land reclamation does not add sovereign territory. China has also sparred with Vietnam, another ASEAN member, over ownership of the Paracel island group, leading to a confrontation last year when Beijing moved a massive oil drilling platform into contested waters. On Thursday, Vietnam accused China of sinking one of its fishing boats near the disputed islands. The incident was apparently motivated by a desire to steal the ship's catch of fish and put it out of commission. There was no evidence that any Chinese government ships were involved, although Beijing's aggressive actions are believed to embolden Chinese fishermen in the area. China's military, especially its navy, is gathering formidable capabilities, fueled by large annual increases in the military budget, which is now the world's largest behind the U.S. China is adding new ships and submarines at a rapid pace, and its first aircraft carrier will soon become operational. Meanwhile, a massive military parade in Beijing last month showcased new missiles permitting China to hit targets _ including U.S. Navy ships and bases _ throughout the region. Along with claiming almost all of the South China Sea's island groups and crucial sea lanes, China is dueling with Japan over ownership of an uninhabited chain of islands north of Taiwan, and in late 2013 declared an air defense zone that would theoretically give it control of aviation over much of the East China Sea. Many analysts believe China is now considering declaring a similar zone over the South China Sea.","china is adding new ships ,two new lighthouses on chinese ,massive military parade in beijing ,showcased new missiles permitting china ,to embolden chinese fishermen","['AP', 'chinese', 'China', 'Beijing', ""Fan Changlong 's"", 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'Navy', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'the Xiangshan Forum', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Gary Roughead', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Roughead', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China', 'U.N.', 'Xi', 'U.N.', 'China', 'the Association of Southeast Asian States', 'Beijing', 'Fan', 'ASEAN', 'Xiangshan Forum', 'China', 'Beijing', 'ASEAN', 'Beijing', 'Pentagon', 'the U.S. Navy', 'China', 'the Navy Times', 'the U.S. Navy', 'ASEAN', 'Philippines', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Washington', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'ASEAN', 'Beijing', 'Vietnam', 'China', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'China', 'the U.S.', 'China', 'Beijing', 'China', 'U.S. Navy', 'China', 'Japan', 'Taiwan', 'China']",0,"[ 0.         16.          0.         ... -0.62386012  0.59716511

Joint efforts, alongside China, to urge North Korea to return to long-stalled six-party talks will be taken, the leaders said in the statement.YonhapThe two sides also agreed to deal with North Korean nuclear problem with ”utmost urgency“ and “determination,” reflecting Seoul‘s push to turn Washington’s attention toward Pyongyang.They also warned Pyongyang, saying it would face consequences as well as sanctions if it carries out missile or nuclear tests, while also opening doors for dialogue and assistance on the condition of it dropping its nuclear ambitions.At a joint press conference that followed, Obama made it clear that the U.S. will engage in talks with North Korea only if it shows seriousness about denuclearization.""As my administration has shown with Iran and with Cuba, we are also prepared to engage nations with which we have had troubled histories, but Pyongyang needs to understand it will not achieve the economic development it seeks so long as it clings to nuclear weapons,"" he said.""Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs have achieved nothing except to deepen North Korea's isolation.""The two also acknowledged Park’s Dresden address that envisaged a peacefully unified Korean peninsula by saying, “We will intensify high-level strategic consultations to create a favorable environment for the peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula.”Standing alongside with Obama, Park said that North Korea and its leader needed to display ""genuine willingness"" to give up its nuclear program.""North Korea has to come to its own conclusion that it is genuinely willing to give up nuclear capabilities and become a full-fledged member of international society,"" she added.The two leaders adopted the new set of joint statements separately on North Korea for the first time, the presidential office said. A joint fact sheet was also given, redirecting the scope of bilateral cooperation into new fields of interests, such as space, welfare and cyber security.""Today, I want to reaffirm that the commitment of the United States to the defense and security of the Republican of Korea will never waver,” Obama said.""Our alliance remains a linchpin of peace and security not just on the Korean peninsula, but across the region, and so South Korea plays a central role in America's rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, and we continued that work today.""The news conference was held after their summit in Obama’s office, the Oval Office, and official lunch in the Cabinet Room.Through the agreement reached with Obama, Park is expected to gain fresh momentum to push her North Korean agenda at a time when the two Koreas have revived high-level talks and are readying to hold a reunion of separated families next week. China addressing its concerns on North Korea’s provocations in last month’s summit with Obama was also seen to instill confidence in South Korea’s drive to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiation table.Also, the summit was seen as a watershed moment for Park and her diplomacy as she strived to reaffirm the U.S. alliance and dispel pervasive speculation that Seoul is inclining toward Beijing.Throughout her trip, Park has been hailing the alliance with the U.S., stressing their “dynamic and strong partnership” has evolved to a higher level and would remain unshaken in the future.Overturning concerns, Obama said he doesn’t see any cracks in Korea-U.S. alliance. Obama said he also wants Seoul to build strong relationship with China, as well as the relationship between Washington and Beijing.During an hour and a half meeting with Obama, Park also demonstrated her efforts to bolster regional cooperation in Northeast Asia by hosting a trilateral summit with Japan and China in November, and a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of the talks, a development that Washington has encouraged.""The trilateral summit that President Park will host this month can be another step forward in building positive relations between South Korea, Japan and China,"" said Obama.Before meeting Obama, Park sat down with Vice President Joe Biden at his residence on Thursday for a luncheon.“The two discussed the importance of strong regional relations and close coordination on common strategic interests,” the White House said after the meeting.It also said Biden praised Park for her efforts to improve inter-Korean ties and reaffirmed unwavering U.S. commitment to deter and defend against North Korean provocations.Park was the first Asian leader invited to the vice president’s residence since the Obama administration was launched in 2009, Cheong Wa Dae said in a briefing, adding that the luncheon was an expression of the special alliance between the two countries.Appealing for her vision of a unified Korea to opinion leaders in the U.S., Park stressed the alliance is crucial for pressing North Korea to drop its nuclear aspirations.“I believe the Korea-U.S. alliance must exert our leadership in inducing North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, open up to the world and undertake internal reforms,” Park said in a speech at Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.“A unified Korea will be a generator of peace. No longer will nuclear weapons and long-ranged missiles target our neighbors.”By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent (christory@heraldcorp.com)","after their summit in obama ,obama on friday adopted joint ,last month summit with obama ,obama before meeting obama park ,barack obama on friday adopted","['WASHINGTON', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Washington', 'China', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Obama', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'Cuba', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'Park', 'Dresden', 'korean', 'korean', 'Obama', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'Republican', 'Korea', 'Obama', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'America', 'Obama ’s', 'the Oval Office', 'Obama', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Obama', 'South Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Obama', 'Japan', 'China', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Washington', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Obama', 'Obama', 'Joe Biden', 'the White House', 'Biden', 'Park', 'inter - korean', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'asian', 'Obama', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Washington', 'Center for Strategic and', 'Korea', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Korea Herald']",11,"[ 2.          5.          0.         ... -0.44903988  0.44253278

John Richardson told a group of reporters in Seoul. ""So in this scenario we would want to enhance our cooperation with South Korea to make sure our posture is well to counter such threats.""    Richardson is in Seoul as part of a four-nation trip, the first overseas outing since he took office a month earlier.    Seoul is the second leg of the trip, following Japan. He will fly to Bahrain on Saturday and then move to Italy before returning home.   North Korea's expected SLBM test could be ""unpredictable and destabilizing,"" and the U.S. is ready to respond to the action, the admiral said, declining yet to discuss the timing and other related information of the test.   He also stressed if North Korea launches any kinds of provocations ""the response would be proportional.""    The admiral suggested that joint naval exercises between South Korea and Japan would greatly help the trilateral military cooperation also involving the U.S. in deterring North Korean threats.   ""If we are trying to provide a situation that deters North Korea from provocative types of behaviors, that type of trilateral cooperation provides more responsive options and better deterrence posture."" he said.    ""There are advantages to that type of cooperation,"" he added, calling for more military collaboration between the two Asian countries entangled in history-related diplomatic tensions.   Richardson also indirectly called for South Korea's participation in U.S. patrolling activities in the tension-ridden South China Sea.   ""The U.S. and South Korea are global nations, we have global interests ... we should act in support of the rules that govern global trade, global prosperity and global maritime traffic,"" the admiral noted, adding that no one should be surprised that global nations with global trade would be interested in preserving and supporting the international law that allows them as much access as possible.  (Yonhap)","successful slbm test in may ,north korea expected slbm test ,navy chief said friday stressing ,home north korea expected slbm ,test of submarine launched ballistic","['South Korea', 'U.S.', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'slbm', 'U.S.', 'John Richardson', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Richardson', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Bahrain', 'Italy', ""North Korea 's"", 'SLBM', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'asian', 'Richardson', ""South Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea']",18,"[ 5.          0.          0.         ... -0.7553497   0.82820219

It was dismissing an appeal raised by a North Korean activist.  Lee Min-bok, a high-profile leaflet activist, has filed a complaint with South Korea, claiming that the government should compensate for what he called ""emotional stress"" stemming from its prevention of his leaflet launch.   The Unification Ministry said that the government's stance is in line with the court's decision.  ""The ruling showed that activists' move to send anti-North Korean leaflets is an expression of the freedom of speech, but the government can curb it if the move threatens the safety of nationals,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.  He said that the government plans to deal with the issue by taking into account both guaranteeing basic rights and protecting the safety of residents in a balanced manner.  North Korea is sensitive to Seoul activists' move to send anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets on concerns that North Koreans can get to know the truth of its repressive regime. The leaflet campaign is one of the main sources of tension between the two Koreas.  In October last year, the North fired machine guns at balloons launched by activists.

It has also repeatedly vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear programs as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy against it.  ""The South Korea-U.S. alliance should exercise leadership to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear program and pursue reform and openness,"" Park said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a  think tank in Washington.   Park accused North Korea of sticking to the path of isolation while advancing its nuclear capability, citing a recent nuclear deal reached between the United States, five other world powers and Iran.  South Korea has called on North Korea to emulate Vietnam and Myanmar, which opted for reform and openness. ""The situation on the Korean Peninsula is at a crossroads due to the possibility of North Korea's provocations,"" Park said.  There is lingering speculation that North Korea may launch a long-range rocket in the coming months to put what it claims to be a satellite into orbit.  Seoul and Washington view a satellite launch as a cover for testing the North's ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.  A new rocket launch could prompt the U.N. to further tighten sanctions on North Korea, which has long been under an array of U.S. and international sanctions for its missile and nuclear tests.  Park also said she plans to host leaders of China and Japan in two weeks for a trilateral summit, noting it could serve as an occasion to improve relations between South Korea and Japan. She didn't provide a specific date for the summit.  A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to tensions mainly over Japan's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.  ""I hope that South Korea and Japan can remove obstacles to their relations and hold in-depth discussions on future-oriented development,"" Park said.  South Korea and Japan are close economic partners and key allies of the U.S., though they have long been at odds over their shared history, including the Japanese military's sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.  South Korea has repeatedly pressed Japan to resolve the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan's World War II soldiers -- one of the knottiest issues between the two neighbors.  The issue of sex slaves has gained urgency as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.

Such a structure is erected to conduct tests of the stabilization and fire-control systems and for ejection, or ""pop up,"" tests of the launch tube, he said.  ""These developments may account for a CNN report on October 9 -- the eve of the 70th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea -- that US officials believed the DPRK (North Korea) might conduct an SLBM test soon,"" the expert said.  Satellite imagery also showed that the ongoing modernization program at the construction halls and machine shops underway at the shipyard since June 2014 appears to be nearing completion, Bermudez said, adding that the shipyard is the primary site for building submarines in the North and the construction suggests the country is about to embark on a new program.  ""Given what appears to be a strong commitment to its submarine program, indicated by the pace of development of its SLBM and associated submarine and the nearly complete modernization effort at Sinpo South Shipyard, the DPRK is likely planning to commence the production of new submarines in the next 12-24 months,"" he said.  In May, North Korea claimed it successfully carried out an SLBM test underwater, renewing tensions on the Korean Peninsula amid concern that the North's SLBM capability, if fully developed, would pose a serious threat because its mobile nature would make it very difficult to detect preparations for a launch.  But experts said it was believed to be not a full-scale test, but an ""ejection"" test conducted in an early stage of developing SLBM capabilities.

South Korea regained peacetime control of its forces in 1994.  Park later gave a pep talk to dozens of U.S. and South Korean soldiers on the rope line near Carter's conference room, a rare move by a foreign leader.  ""You are the heart of South Korea-U.S. alliance,"" Park told the soldiers. ""Korea thanks you, we go together.""  She called the South Korea-U.S. alliance ""the strongest alliance"" in the world and said the two sides will become global partners upholding their common values and ideal.  Also Thursday, Park held a lunch meeting with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden at his official residence and the two reviewed recent progress within the alliance, bilaterally, regionally, and globally.  It is the first time that Biden has invited an Asian leader to his residence at the Naval Observatory since U.S. President Barack Obama took office, a move that illustrated the friendship between the two allies.  ""The two discussed the importance of strong regional relations and close coordination on common strategic interests,"" the White House said after the meeting.

YonhapShe is set to hold a summit with her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama on Friday to discuss ways to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambition and to bolster the alliance to a higher level.On the eve of the much-anticipated summit, South Korea’s commander-in-chief received a full military honors parade hosted by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. She was given a 21-gun salute on the parade field in front of the Pentagon, before she inspected a guard of honor. Park was the second South Korean president to visit the Pentagon but was the first to receive such a large-scale ceremony, Cheong Wa Dae said.At a closed bilateral meeting that followed, Park and Carter exchanged their views on security of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and the delayed transfer of wartime operational control. Bilateral cooperation on cybersecurity and space sector were also discussed.“I hope that South Korea and the U.S. will expand cooperation in a comprehensive and strategic” manner over the issue, Park said in a meeting with Carter.Carter told Park the U.S. is ready to use all possible capabilities to maintain a war deterrent on the Korean peninsula and that he expects Seoul and Washington to closely cooperate in dealing with North Korea's provocations in the future.South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se accompanied Park with Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert, Commander of U.S. forces Curtis Scaparrotti attending. After the meeting, they also met with U.S. and Korean service members to encourage and thank them for their service. ""You are the heart of South Korea-U.S. alliance,"" Park told the soldiers. ""Korea thanks you, we go together.""Later in the afternoon, the South Korean leader was invited to Naval Observatory, the residence of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden for an official lunch.

North Korea’s nuclear weapon and its provocative actions were also on the agenda. ""The two discussed the importance of strong regional relations and close coordination on common strategic interests,"" the White House said after the meeting. It also said Biden praised Park for her efforts to improve inter-Korean ties and reaffirmed unwavering U.S. commitment to deter and defend against North Korean provocations. Park was the first Asian leader invited to the vice president’s residence since the Obama administration was launched in 2009, Cheong Wa Dae said in a briefing, adding that the lunch was an expression of the special alliance between the two countries.Since arriving in Washington on Tuesday, Park has been seeking a fresh momentum in the alliance to wipe off growing fears about Seoul’s cozy relationship with Beijing after she attended a Chinese military parade shunned by most of Western leaders.At a friendship dinner on Wednesday evening, Park stressed that South Korea is a reliable partner of the United States, calling the alliance a core of Washington’s rebalancing strategy toward the Asia-Pacific region.“South Korea and the U.S. are strongly bound to each other by common values and ideals of freedom, democracy and human rights,” Park said at a South Korea-U.S. friendship gathering in Washington.“The alliance has been evolving and is dynamic, and together we are moving toward a brighter future.”Secretary of State John Kerry chimed in saying that the bilateral partnership focuses on shared values in a wide range of fields.“We also recognize that ours has to be a dynamic partnership that focuses, as our citizens do, on issues of the future and particularly issues like clean energy, the need to address the challenge of climate change, and ensuring that we have smart rules in place to guarantee the preservation of open space and also a reliable and secure Internet,” he said in a speech at the gathering.Kerry also thanked Park for showing her commitment to the future, referring to her visit to NASA’s Goddard Space Center. Cheong Wa Dae said Park hopes to expand cooperation with the U.S. in space industry, particularly on South Korea’s plan to develop a homegrown space rocket by 2020.In a separate meeting Park also called for close cooperation in research and development and engineering, stressing that Seoul is seeking innovation in manufacturing.“The two countries can build up the technology and experiences that can lead to manufacturing innovation if they combine technology and excellent manpower,” Park said at a forum held to promote a bilateral partnership in the high-tech industry.Park also called for strengthened cooperation with the U.S. in space, new energy as well as health care and other high-tech areas.“I hope that South Korea will actively participate in space development” by signing a deal with the U.S. on space cooperation, Park said.Consultations are underway between the two sides over a space cooperation agreement, according to the presidential office.By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent (christory@heraldcorp.com)","south korean president to visit ,the pentagon on thursday morning ,obama on friday to discuss ,seoul inclining toward beijing president ,washington south korean president park","['WASHINGTON', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Pentagon', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'Defense Ashton Carter', 'Arlington', 'Virginia', 'YonhapShe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter', 'Pentagon', 'south korean', 'Pentagon', 'Park', 'Carter', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'Carter', 'Carter', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Washington', ""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Joseph Dunford', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Curtis Scaparrotti', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Joe Biden', 'North Korea ’s', 'the White House', 'Biden', 'inter - korean', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'asian', 'Obama', 'Washington', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Kerry', 'NASA', 'Goddard Space Center', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Korea Herald']",11,"[ 5.          0.          1.         ... -0.55817705  1.24059832

(KFS)The five-day 6th International Wildland Fire Conference will end Friday, with governments, international organizations and experts joining hands in sharing and spreading knowledge of fire. On the opening day of Oct. 12, global administrators, policymakers, scholars and students gathered at Alpensia Resort, Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province, for the event with the theme “Fire of the Past, Fire in Future.”More than 170 papers were presented throughout the conference, followed by an award ceremony. On the second day, a plenary session on the legacy of fire and five sessions were scheduled on community and wildland fire, toward a cohesive global fire management strategy, application of technology to wildland fire management and protecting global natural and cultural heritage from fire. Eleven keynote speakers, including Dr. Johann Georg Goldammer, director of the Global Fire Monitoring Center, Pieter van Lierop from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and Joseph Kreidi from the UNESCO Regional Office, delivered presentations on their area of expertise.Tom Harbour from the U.S. Forest Service spoke on the issue of cohesive global fire management strategy and ways to enhance community and ecosystem resilience against large wildland fires. Ko Ki-yeon from the Korea Forest Service introduced Korea’s unique geographical and social aspects and forest fire policies established based on them. For each plenary session, participants were welcomed to freely join the discussion with the speakers, to voice fresh ideas and experiences with the experts. In parallel with plenary meetings, seven subsessions were held on issues including knowledge from country experience, wildland fire and ecosystem and advanced technologies for wildland fire management. Youn Ho-joong, chairman of the scientific committee of the 6th IWFC, stated that these sessions “have brought experiences and lessons learned from the past to establishing new wildland fire management policies for the future.”On the third day, the IWFC presented one of the event’s highlights -- a helicopter firefighting drill performed by 300 on-site experts on 15 helicopters.The drill was demonstrated by a joint dream team of the KFS aviation unit, the Defense Ministry, police, the Public Safety Ministry firefighting unit and the municipality of Pyeongchang, adding to the splendor of the global conference. On the fourth day, the IWFC held a thesis competition for promising undergraduate and graduate students around the world, in partnership with the International Processes Commission of the International Forest Student Association, international organizations and universities at home and abroad.As part of the newly launched IWFC Youth Program, the competition selected 18 outstanding theses on wildland fire, disaster and risk management, cultural and natural heritage protection, climate and meteorology and other related subjects. Some of the topics covered in the theses included the diagnosis of wildland fire risks in the Korean ancient city of Gyeongju by using the Monte Carlo simulation method, the wildland fire management program in Portugal, the current conditions and corrective measures of the Vietnamese wildland fire, the prediction method of wildland fire in India’s largest habitat of tigers, the influence of wildland fire on the Far East Asian atmosphere and fire-weather index as a preventive alert system in Turkey. Four of the 18 participating teams were awarded in the competition. “Through a global thesis competition like this, we hope that Korean students can take the opportunity to build global capacities and share ideas with peers from around the globe,” said Choi Young-tae, director of the IWFC organizing unit of the Korea Forest Service. On the last day of Oct. 16, the IWFC was set to arrange an arena for sharing knowledge on the protection of world culture heritage related to fire.      By Chung Joo-won (joowonc@heraldcorp.com)","fire conference will end friday ,sixth iwfc in pyeongchang gangwon ,fire eleven keynote speakers ,international wildland fire conference will ,gangwon province on wednesday kfs","['KFS', 'Shin Won - sop', 'IWFC', 'Pyeongchang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Pyeongchang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Johann Georg Goldammer', 'the Global Fire Monitoring Center', 'Pieter van Lierop', 'the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations', 'Joseph Kreidi', 'the UNESCO Regional Office', 'Tom Harbour', 'the U.S. Forest Service', 'Ko Ki - yeon', 'the Korea Forest Service', 'Korea', 'Youn Ho - joong', 'IWFC', 'KFS', 'the Defense Ministry', 'the Public Safety Ministry', 'Pyeongchang', 'IWFC', 'the International Processes Commission', 'the International Forest Student Association', 'IWFC Youth Program', 'korean', 'Gyeongju', 'Monte Carlo', 'Portugal', 'vietnamese', 'India', 'asian', 'Turkey', 'korean', 'Choi Young - tae', 'IWFC', 'the Korea Forest Service', 'IWFC', 'Chung Joo - won']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08868073  0.51477945

However, religious freedom does not exist in practice,"" the department said in the 2014 International Religious Freedom Report.  The report cited the U.N. Commission of Inquiry's report on the North's human rights situation as saying that there was an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of religion and the North's leadership should be brought to the International Criminal Court for human rights abuses.  The latest religious freedom report said that the North's policy towards religion has been to maintain ""an appearance of tolerance for international audiences, while suppressing internally all non-state-sanctioned religious activities.""  ""The government continued to deal harshly with those who engaged in almost any religious practices through executions, torture, beatings, and arrests,"" it said. ""An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners, some imprisoned for religious reasons, were believed to be held in the political prison camp system.""  The report also said that defector accounts indicated religious practitioners often concealed their activities from neighbors, coworkers, and other members of society for fear their activities would be reported to the authorities. The State Department has designated North Korea as a ""country of particular concern"" (CPC) since 2001 under the International Religious Freedom Act for particularly severe violations of religious freedom. The North was last redesignated as a CPC in July, the report said.  ""(North) Korea remains a country of particular concern for us. It is one of the worst violators of human rights in the entire world,"" said David Saperstein, ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, during a press briefing.  ""We don't have direct relations, so we continue through international partners and by mobilizing these international coalitions to put continuing pressure for North Korea to ease its restrictions on religious freedom and to let every one of those prisoners of conscience -- and there are far, far too many, and they often face brutal conditions in the prisons -- to go,"" he said.  On South Korea, the report pointed out the issue of ""conscientious objectors.""  ""The government continued to imprison approximately 600 conscientious objectors for refusing to participate in mandatory military service,"" the report said, adding that the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision imprisoning a conscientious objector for 18 months.

She also expressed her hopes to raise the interest of the global community in the unification of the two Koreas, referring to the German experience in ending decades of division.”If we look back to the German way of achieving unification, there was a process of building trust through exchanges and cooperation. We could see that such process was necessary, as well as cooperation and support by the international society,“ she said.Introducing Germany’s past efforts in easing tension through the pursuit of detente policies, President Joachim Gauck indicated the need to keep the dialogue channel with North Korea.“(The policies) were a part of processes to urge (East Germany) to open its doors and to keep dialogue channels open. And we led dialogues by keeping this cooperative relationship,” he said in German. “I believe this suggests something for the Korean Peninsula and for the regional security in Northeast Asia.”Earlier in the day, the two also agreed to upgrade the level of bilateral cooperation for the technical development of key industries, such as by converging Korea’s state-of-the-art IT technology with Germany’s strength in automobile and equipment engineering. The German president arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a four-day visit and for a summit with Park. Gauck was visiting Korea for the first time at the invitation of Park following her visit to Germany in March last year.Upon the summit, the Korea Electronics Technology Institute signed a memorandum of understanding with German carmaker BMW to promote exchanges on automotive IT technology, the presidential office said. Under the agreement, the two sides would start exchanging technologies to apply solar energy and information technology in automobiles.The leaders also acknowledged the ongoing efforts by the two countries to achieve industrial innovation by applying IT to traditional manufacturing systems. They agreed to work together to set up universal standards to certify operational and hardware systems for smart manufacturing. Both countries share goals of achieving technological and systematic transition from traditional manufacturing structure, said Cheong Wa Dae. The agreement will allow the two sides to strengthen strategic alliance on integrating Korea’s information communications technology with Germany’s advancement in mechanical control system, it added.Park and Gauck also agreed to make joint efforts to expand bilateral trade and investment.Trading volume between South Korea and Germany reached $28.9 billion last year, a 36.9 percent increase from 2009. Korea’s trade deficit with Germany, however, surged 2.9 times in the same period.The agreement on trade and investment was reached to solve the growing trade imbalance with Germany, the presidential office said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","german president arrived in seoul ,korea nuclear ambitions and improve ,denuclearizing north korea and agreed ,after summit with her german ,curb north korea nuclear ambitions","['South Korea', 'Germany', 'north Korea‘s', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun', 'german', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'Koreas', 'german', 'german', 'introduce Germany ’s', 'Joachim Gauck', 'North Korea', 'East Germany', 'German', 'Korea', 'Germany', 'german', 'Seoul', 'Gauck', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Germany', 'the Korea Electronics Technology Institute', 'german', 'BMW', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Korea', 'Germany', 'Gauck', 'South Korea', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.97677112  0.47218516

""Now, I have to be ready from a position of strength to deal with North Korea, and we are ready to deal ... any time that Kim Jong-un decides to act.""  Harris said U.S. engagement with treaty allies South Korea and Japan is the foundation for peace and security in the region. The three countries not only share common values and common concerns, but they also face a common threat in North Korea, he said.  The commander said that threats from the North are also a reason why he welcomes Japan's decision to play a greater role in regional security. He said he will do all he can to look for ways for South Korea, Japan and the U.S. to collaborate.  Harris has made similar remarks about North Korea.  Ahead of his inauguration, he called Pyongyang the ""greatest threat we face"" and said concerns about the communist nation keep him awake at night.

Citing an unidentified source, ISIS said Pyongyang is believed to have reported to the U.S. at the time that it extracted a total of 37-38 kilograms of plutonium.In addition, the North is believed to have extracted about eight kilograms of plutonium from spent fuel it was holding until it froze its nuclear facilities under a six-party deal in 2007. Of the total, the North is estimated to have used up to 12 kilograms of plutonium in its three nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, leaving the total stockpile at the end of last year at between 30-34 kilograms, the institute said.In 2010, the North also revealed that it was running a uranium enrichment facility, adding to international concerns about its nuclear capabilities. Uranium, if highly enriched, can be used to make weapons, providing Pyongyang with a second way of building atomic bombs, in addition to its existing plutonium-based program.The North is believed to have produced about 100 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium from the facility. But in case the North has another secret uranium enrichment facility, the total amount of weapons-grade uranium would be about 240 kilograms, ISIS said.In addition to the three nuclear tests, the North has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998.

At his inauguration ceremony, the newly minted chairman also vowed to establish “omnidirectional readiness,” saying the communist neighbor will continue to stage provocations at an unanticipated place and time. “Based on solid military readiness posture, we will deter the enemy’s provocation, and if it once again seeks to jeopardize our territory and people, we will make them bitterly regret it by making it clear that it has a lot more to lose than gain,” he said in an address at the Defense Ministry in Seoul.  New Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Lee Sun-jin (far left) and his predecessor Adm. Choi Yun-hee review an honor guard during Lee`s inauguration ceremony in Seoul on Wendesday. (Yonhap)Pyongyang’s land mine attack and an exchange of fire between across the border in August was a “test” of Seoul’s readiness and resolve, Lee said, lauding the military’s firm response. With the North’s military threats and the regional security landscape evolving, his organization will upgrade its strategies and joint operational concepts, while boosting theater operation capabilities and preparations for a future transfer of operational control from the U.S., he added. “The North is raising military tension yet again through threats of an atomic test and missile launch,” the four-star general said.“We must actively deter the enemy’s provocation, and in case of any provocation, we must win.” The former head of the Army’s 2nd Operations Command is the first-ever Army Academy graduate to become the JCS chairman, a position traditionally taken up by the alumnus of the elite Military Academy. He succeeded Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, whose two-year stint has come to an end.

Naomi Dakasu speaks in an interview with The Korea Herald (Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald)“Despite the decision to pass the laws that are against public opinion and democratic procedure, the (pacifist) Constitution remains unchanged,” Naomi Dakasu said, lamenting that the recent legislation is a flagrant violation of the Japanese Constitution’s Article 9 that outlaws war as a means to settle international disputes.From being an ordinary citizen to leading one of the most ambitious campaigns for peace in Japan, the mother of two said she grew up hearing about the brutality of World War II from her grandmother. When she studied overseas in her 20s, she realized she should do something to join the antiwar movement after meeting with classmates coming from war-torn countries. What prompted her to take action was Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s return to power in 2012 and his renewed efforts to change the article that bars use of military force for Japan except for self-defense. Having seen her close friends‘ aloofness towards Abe’s push to amend the pacifist constitution, she decided to form a campaign that would relay to the public how valuable Article 9 is and remind them of the tragic nature of war. “As a mother, I don’t want to make my kids live in a country where war can happen. Whenever I think about the agony that my kids would suffer if a war breaks out, I cannot help but shed tears. Waging war is the last thing that human beings should ever do,” she said. “Telling each and every one of the Japanese citizens that they are nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize will make them feel more responsible about their role in protecting Article 9. This awakening will lead to a change in the nation and ultimately its leader,” she said of the campaign.  She initially pushed to get Article 9 itself nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. But the Nobel Prize Committee said that the prize could only be awarded to the people and organizations. She and her colleagues changed the nomination to be about the Japanese people who want to protect the Article 9. There have always been concerns about the efficacy of the movement, given the fact that Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party and its ally Komeito controls Japan’s parliament, with skeptics questioning whether the campaign could drum up enough public support.But she remained confident, highlighting that public opinion has shifted in favor of protecting Article 9 over the decades against Abe’s accelerated push to amend the constitution. “According to a poll by Kyodo News Agency in July, only 32 percent supported the revision while about 60 percent opposed the move. It demonstrates changes in public opinion because, in 1994 polls, 55 percent supported the move while 34 percent opposed,” she said. “Securing support is the key to realizing our objective. Thankfully, some lawmakers are starting to endorse the movement and share our cause that Article 9 should be protected. Media outlets are also throwing support to the movement,” she said. She also dismissed concerns that the decisions to include average Japanese people as a nominee would end up awarding right-wing politicians, such as Abe, who push to change the Article 9. She said launching the campaign in itself is meaningful by being able to educate the public, rather than worrying about the actual win.“I think the move will give us an opportunity to change the mindset towards peace. I hope people treat peace not as something that could be brought by someone else, but rather a value that we should build by ourselves,” she said. “What we shouldn’t do is do nothing because we are worried about who would win. If the Nobel Prize Committee deems it inappropriate awarding Japanese as a whole, then we can move to support other types of nominee, such as other advocacy groups for the Article 9,” she said.In August, tens of thousands of protestors gathered outside Japan’s parliament to call for the lawmakers to scrap the bill that expands the use of military force. Some even demanded Abe resign. She also joined the movement for incorporating into the U.N. charter the right to peace -- a more proactive form of the right to living in peaceful conditions -- by imposing a ban on the use of military force and ensuring the right of people to deny military service. Critics said that seeking the right to peace in Northeast Asia could be “premature” as the security landscape in the region is still uncertain: a military rivalry between Japan and China and constant hostility between the two Koreas who are still technically at war.  Stressing the unique characteristics of the constitution -- she claims Article 9 makes Japan’s the “only” constitution in the world that stipulates the right to peace -- she argued that turning the right to peace into a universal right would lead to peace and security in Northeast Asia and the international community. “If the U.N. declares the right to peace as a fundamental and universal right, those who do not have their equivalent to Article 9 can use the U.N. declaration as a way to achieve peace both at home and abroad,” she said.“One thing great about Article 9 is its acknowledgement of not only Japanese but also other peoples’ right to peace. Based upon this, we will lay the groundwork for a peace community where nations solve their problems through dialogue and start to engage in arms-reduction,” she saidImpressed by her efforts to protect the pacifist constitution, a Korean civic group chose Dakasu and the “Article 9 Association,” a group of Japanese advocates for the pacifist constitution, as conominees for the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize, whose winner is expected to be announced in two months. In January 2015, 142 Korean lawmakers, including those from both the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance, endorsed the nomination of Dakasu and the “Article 9 Association,” whose members include Kenzaburo Oe, a Nobel laureate in Literature.“Not only did I realize how many Koreans worry about Japan’s attempt to arm themselves by revising the constitution, I was impressed by Koreans’ support for those who opposed the war and work hard to build a peaceful community in the region,” she said.

""It usually takes two to four weeks for a rocket to be launched after it is moved into a launching site.His remarks indicate that the North is unlikely to go ahead with a rocket launch around the anniversary in the face of the global community's strong warning against the North.The North has recently ratcheted up its missile and nuclear threats, citing its sovereign right to launch ""a series of satellites for peaceful purposes."" Outside experts view the North's move as a cover for ballistic missile tests.The government said that North Korea apparently plans to stage a massive military parade in Pyongyang by mobilizing a large number of people and displaying various types of weapons.""There is a possibility that North Korea could display new weapons that the North has not made public,"" the official said, without elaborating.He said that the North may show off submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which the North claimed it successfully fired in May or a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile.What is drawing attention is whether North Korea will display its Taepodong-2 long-range missiles or its new road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, known as the KN-08, during the upcoming parade, experts said.The North's Taepodong-2 missile is believed to be capable of reaching as far as Alaska if configured as an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear payload.North Korea showed off a life-size mockup of what appears to be the KN-08 during a military parade in April 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the North's late founder, Kim Il-sung.The official said that North Korea appears to be preparing for various programs that can be ""visually colorful"" such as mass games, marches with torches and an air show.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un earlier instructed his people to thoroughly prepare for the 70th anniversary.South Korea said that the North's leader has focused on accomplishments in construction projects, but floods in the city of Rason on the North's northeast tip might have hampered the related work.The ministry also said North Korea has sent an invitation to about 20 countries, including Cuba and Southeast Asian nations, but it has not been confirmed which countries will send a delegation to the North's event.""Around 20 to 30 foreign media companies from about 10 countries are known to have applied for visits to North Korea to cover the anniversary celebration,"" he said.

Morgulov is also Russia's top envoy to the six-party talks which have been dormant since 2008.The recognition would be incompatible with Russia as one of the founding countries of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said, referring to the treaty the country forged with the U.S. in the late 1960's to ban growth of new nuclear powers. While Russia is putting forth various suggestions for the resumption of the six-way denuclearization talks, Morgulov said that ""it's too early to say when it will be resumed.""As the envoy from a largely North Korean-leaning member of the six-party forum, Morgulov came to the defense of the North's motive behind its nuclear weapons development.""The fundamental cause of the emergence of the North Korean issue should be understood properly,"" he said, adding that North Korea had to virtually face hostile military alliances linking the U.S. to South Korea and Japan all alone.""At the foundation of North Korea's choice of nuclear weapons were concerns over their own national security."" Against that backdrop, the North Korean nuclear issue can be settled only in a way that resolves political and military tensions throughout the region and the national security of Northeast Asian countries including North Korea is surely guaranteed, he highlighted.Touching on the 25-year diplomatic ties between Seoul and Moscow, the deputy foreign minister lauded the bilateral relations as ""a historic change"" that has cemented mutual cooperation in various fields.""""For the past 25 years, the landscape of the South Korea-Russia relations has fundamentally changed, with Korea becoming one of Russia's most preferential collaboration partners in the Asia Pacific region.""Morgulov also presented a rosy prospect for three-nation economic cooperation involving the two Koreas and Russia, including a logistics project linking the Russian border city of Khasan to the North Korean port of Rajin. In a pilot run of the project, South Korea brought in Russian coal via the Russia-North Korean route earlier this year. ""Success of this project will serve as a booster for other three-way cooperation projects,"" he said, ""although the complex political and military situation on the Korean Peninsula, which sometimes turns into a military crisis, is the biggest stumbling block to the realization of the cooperation."" But the three-nation collaboration looks ""prospective enough,"" he said, adding that North Korea has clearly shown interest in it.

In her Armed Forces Day address, she also stressed her resolve to help rebuild the North’s impaired economy if it chooses talks over a military standoff. “North Korea must cease immediately its development of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles that has jeopardized the fate of our people and set hurdles for world peace,” Park said at a ceremony marking the 67th anniversary of the founding of South Kora’s military in its headquarters in Gyeryongdae, South Chungcheong Province.“As long as North Korea adheres to nuclear weapons, its isolation will only deepen, and no path will be open for economic development. ... If it comes out for dialogue instead of confrontation, the Republic of Korea and the international community will provide active support for its economic reconstruction.” Her renewed warnings came about a week ahead of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Pyongyang’s ruling Workers’ Party, around which the Kim Jong-un regime is widely anticipated to test a long-range rocket or atomic device or stage other major provocation. Tension is showing no signs of abating, especially as the two Koreas are gearing up for a reunion of families displaced by the 1950-53 Korean War starting Oct. 20 in line with a high-level agreement in late August. The communist country threatened to call off the plan after Park warned against another provocation and criticized its nuclear ambitions. As some 700 military executives and rank-and-file servicemen attended, the president cheered on their work, including their stringent response to the North’s land mine and artillery attacks in August. “The security environment is extremely grave surrounding the peninsula. The intelligible patriotism of you soldiers and the people’s united sense of security are the most pivotal foundation of our defense power and the best weapon,” Park said. In a separate message, Defense Minister Han Min-koo praised the military’s contribution to the peace of not only the peninsula, but also the globe, such as through increasing peacekeeping operations and reconstruction activities. “We have built true peace and prosperity on the peninsula based on airtight military readiness and deterrence against the North,” he said. “Now we are elevating the national prestige and contributing to world peace, with 1,039 of our soldiers taking part in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction support in 13 countries around the world.”(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korea to renounce its nuclear ,standoff north korea must cease ,north korea to renounce its ,north korea must cease immediately ,renounce its nuclear and missile","['Shin Hyon - hee', 'Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'South Kora ’s', 'Gyeryongdae , South Chungcheong Province', 'North Korea', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'North ’s', 'Park', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'world.”(heeshin@heraldcorp.com']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.46140915  0.26577082

Calls have been mounting for Seoul to bolster its strike capabilities to bridge the “missile gap” with its northern neighbor. The North has hinted that it would carry out a satellite launch around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party. The launch, if it goes ahead, is expected to further enhance its ballistic missile technology.The North’s latest “satellite” launch in December 2012 was regarded as a success. Analysts say that the long-range rocket carrying what the North called a research satellite is believed to have a range of 10,000 km -- far enough to strike the U.S. mainland. Seoul’s push for longer-range missiles gathered momentum in October 2012 when Seoul and Washington agreed on revising a bilateral guideline to allow the former to develop more powerful ballistic missiles with a range of up to 800 km, up from the previous 300 km.Seoul pushed for the revision of the guideline -- first forged in 1979 and amended in 2001 -- as it did not reflect the changing security environment where neighboring states including the North have increasingly formidable missile capabilities. The 2012 revision came after grueling negotiations with Washington which was apparently reluctant over the revision as it could undermine America’s global initiatives of nonproliferation and arms control, and could provoke China, Russia and Japan, not to mention the North. After the revision, the South successfully launched the Hyunmoo-2B missile with a range of more than 500 km in July this year.Those missiles -- including the 800 km-range missile to be deployed by 2017 -- would be an integral part of the so-called Kill Chain preemptive strike program that Seoul has been pushing to establish to better handle Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile threats.The missile gap between the two Koreas is known to be big as Pyongyang has been pushing for longer-range strike capabilities to ensure its regime survival and raise stakes in negotiations with the U.S.The North now has a relatively large assortment of ballistic missiles that can threaten South Korea, Japan, the U.S. and other potential adversaries.The North successfully test-fired and deployed a Rodong ballistic missile with a range of 1,300 km in 1993. It has also deployed the Musudan missile with a range of 3,000-4,000 km since 2007. The Musudan, in theory, can strike Guam, a key U.S. strategic base in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2009, the North carried out a test of the Taepodong-2 missile, which is presumed to have a range of more than 6,700 km, enough to hit parts of Alaska. It also conducted rocket tests in April 2012 and December that year, all of which helped further enhance its overall long-range missile capabilities.

(Yonhap)She also renewed South Korea's long-standing policy that Seoul will assist North Korea's economic development if Pyongyang comes forward for dialogue, not confrontation.Two days ago, North Korea slammed Park and warned that it could call off the planned reunions of separated families over her recent speech to the U.N. General Assembly.In an address to the U.N. on Monday, Park called on North Korea to embrace reform and openness rather than launching a long-range rocket.

General Assembly.""With that in mind, we are now focused on making the Korea-China-Japan summit a success,"" Yun said. ""We will review the issue of a bilateral summit at the next stage while conducting follow-up consultations between working-level officials at the director-general level.""Yun said the two sides talked a lot about preparations for the trilateral summit.South Korea and Japan have not held a bilateral summit since 2012 as their relations have been frayed badly over history and territorial issues, including Tokyo's attempt to whitewash the country's wartime crimes, including its sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.But the ties have shown signs of improvement after Abe pledged in a war anniversary statement last month to honor the country's past apologies for wartime atrocities, and Park reacted positively to it.Earlier this month, Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold a trilateral cooperation summit with Abe in Seoul in October or November. The agreement has raised hope that Park and Abe could hold their first formal bilateral summit on its sidelines.In Wednesday's talks, the two sides also held in-depth discussions on how to move relations between the two countries forward, Yun said, adding that he explained to Kishida how important it is to resolve the sexual slavery issue at an early date.""I spoke a lot about the point that this is an extremely important element in improving relations between the two countries,"" he said.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.In Seoul, the Foreign Ministry also described it as a ""core history"" issue.""Minister Yun emphasized the need for resolving the comfort women issue at an early date to bring about the virtuous cycle of developing South Korea-Japan relations,"" it said in a statement on the results of the Yun-Kishida talks. It was their fourth bilateral meeting this year.Yun also urged Japan to keep its promise related to the listing of its 23 early industrial sites as UNESCO world heritage. Some of the facilities used Koreans as forced labor, while Korea was under Japan's brutal colonial rule from 1910-45.Japan vowed to set up information centers near the relevant locations to publicize the history.On Japan's new defense policy aimed at expanding the role and scope of the country's troops, Yun expressed hope for ""close consultations"" between the neighboring countries.Kishida replied that his government will continue to push for the initiative in a ""transparent manner,"" according to the ministry.

General Assembly that increased pressure on it to abandon its nuclear ambitions and take a path toward economic development and regional peace.“It is deeply regrettable that North Korea unilaterally distorted and criticized the president’s U.N. speech, and said that the efforts to hold family reunions were precarious,” Jeong Joon-hee, the spokesperson of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, said during a regular press briefing.“We urge the North to immediately halt its unilateral claims, criticism and threats, and to conscientiously execute the Aug. 25 agreement,” he added, referring to the breakthrough deal that brought the two Koreas from the brink of an armed confrontation.Part of the deal was to hold the family reunions, which are slated to take place from Oct. 20-26 at Mount Geumgangsan on the North’s east coast.Over the past week, the North has indicated the possibility of the efforts to hold the reunions falling apart, as it responded angrily to South Korea’s moves to enact a North Korea human rights act and its civic groups’ cross-border dissemination of anti-Pyongyang leaflets.Pyongyang’s anger was vented again this week after Park mentioned the national reunification as an effective solution to address a series of North Korean problems including its nuclear development, human rights abuses and persistent provocations.The reclusive regime has so far dismissed Seoul’s efforts to lay the foundation for reunification as an ill-intended political attempt at inducing its collapse and absorbing the North into the South’s democratic system. “Park laid bare her ambitions to realize the national reunification by absorbing the North into the South with the backing of foreign forces,” the spokesperson of the North’s Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland said in a statement on Tuesday.“(The efforts for) reunions of separated families are precarious.”Undeterred by Pyongyang’s rhetoric, Cheong Wa Dae vowed to step up efforts to secure international support for its unification policy and endeavors to stop the North’s provocations and nuclear development.“(At the U.N. General Assembly) Park has enunciated her will to sever the vicious cycle of North Korea’s provocations and then rewards,” Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, told reporters while explaining the outcome of Park’s attendance at the U.N. Assembly. “To this end, we will respond sternly to provocations, based on our principles, while leaving open the door for dialogue.”Amid the growing inter-Korean tensions, the efforts to set up cross-border talks -- as part of the Aug. 25 agreement -- have made little progress. Seoul officials think that the talks were unlikely to happen before Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, although the two sides have agreed to hold the talks at an early date to improve inter-Korean relations.The North has been busy preparing for the anniversary celebrations, while the South has remained cautious about its proposal for the talks amid the growing concerns that the North would set off provocations such as a long-range rocket launch and a nuclear test around Oct. 10. To prevent the North’s provocations, Seoul has been stepping up its diplomacy through bilateral and multilateral high-level talks. After the trilateral meeting among the foreign ministers of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan in New York on Tuesday, the top diplomats warned that the North would face stronger international sanctions should it launch additional provocations. Seoul officials said that South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida agreed to make a “strong” response should the North engage in provocative acts.Yun and Kishida were to hold a separate bilateral meeting on Wednesday to further discuss their joint efforts to deter the North’s provocations, and other bilateral issues.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","regrettable that north korea unilaterally ,tuesday as it criticized president ,anti pyongyang leaflets pyongyang anger ,wednesday blasted pyongyang for its ,angrily to south korea moves","['Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Park Geun', 'the U.N.

We estimate that a North Korean collapse would require an additional 150,000 U.S. troops over and above the forces already stationed and presumed to be available in the Asia-Pacific region,"" it said.Currently, about 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter threats from North Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.The U.S. Army plans to cut troop levels from the current 490,000 to 420,000 by 2019 due to budge constraints known as ""sequestration,"" but the think tank said that the Army's troop levels should rather increase to at least 545,000 to cope with such contingencies.The institute also said that South Korea and the U.S. have been focused on coping with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile threats, but they should pay greater attention to the North's artillery capabilities and come up with countermeasures.North Korea has more than 13,000 artillery pieces and multiple rocket launchers, about 8,000 of which are garrisoned within 100 miles of South Korea in protected underground facilities, RAND said. In addition to the prospect of nuclear weapons, North Korean artillery can fire a variety of chemical weapons, it said.""North Korea may launch many shorter-range missiles against South Korea or Japan, potentially saturating their ballistic missile defenses. Worse, the U.S. strategy does not directly address the artillery threat to Seoul, including the potential use of North Korean artillery to employ WMD,"" the report said.That is to say, North Korea might use artillery to deliver nuclear weapons.""Opinions differ about how close the North Koreans are to building a miniaturized weapon capable of fitting within their long-range missiles, but their recently revealed ability to separate uranium could give them the ability to build gun-assembled fission weapons similar to the W-33 the U.S. Army deployed in 1956,"" the think tank said.""This weapon was small enough to be fired from an 8-inch artillery tube, yet produced yields of up to 10 kilotons. If North Korea produced such a weapon, Seoul could be in range of nuclear weapons fired from existing, hardened, artillery sites,"" it said.

223,223,Korea pledges to dispatch more military engineers,"South Korean President Park Geun-hye pledged Monday to dispatch additional military engineers to conflict zones at the U.N. leaders’ summit on peacekeeping, joining other countries’ promises to boost their contributions for missions under growing strain.“They will be assisting reconstruction and humanitarian activities in conflict zones,” Park said at the event attended by some 50 heads of state and cochaired by ...","South Korean President Park Geun-hye pledged Monday to dispatch additional military engineers to conflict zones at the U.N. leaders’ summit on peacekeeping, joining other countries’ promises to boost their contributions for missions under growing strain.“They will be assisting reconstruction and humanitarian activities in conflict zones,” Park said at the event attended by some 50 heads of state and cochaired by U.S. President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.“Korean peacekeepers have long been guided by the belief that genuine peace stems from the minds of people; hence, their distinctive focus on cementing bonds with local communities, whether in Lebanon, Haiti, South Sudan or elsewhere. This is an approach that’s been widely well-received,” Park added.There are currently about 630 Korean soldiers stationed in such conflict zones.Park said that Korea would strengthen partnerships with regional organizations as well, through such plans as providing deployable level-two hospital equipment through the African Union to enhance peacekeeping capacity in Africa.Korea will also steadily scale up the financial contributions to support the U.N.’s conflict prevention and peacebuilding activities, Park said at the meeting, which was also attended by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“This would be fitting, given Korea’s presidency of ECOSOC and its presence in the Peace Building Commission.”Upon the summit, President Obama’s administration announced that more than 50 countries had pledged to contribute more than 40,000 new troops and police to serve in some of the world’s most volatile areas.Obama’s presence at Monday’s meeting, shortly before his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, was the latest sign of high-level U.S. interest in the issue. Obama told leaders that peace operations were “experiencing unprecedented strain” and were being deployed in “more difficult and deadlier conflicts.”“We know that peace operations are not the solution to every problem,” Obama told the summit held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.“But they do remain one of the world’s most important tools to address armed conflict,” he said.Putin was the only leader of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which approves peacekeeping missions, who was absent.For months, officials such as the U.S. military’s top officer and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power have pressed countries, especially European nations, to contribute more. European countries contributed more than 40 percent of U.N. peacekeepers two decades ago but now provide less than 7 percent.The high-level meeting was aimed at strengthening and modernizing peacekeeping operations, whose nearly 125,000 personnel increasingly face threats from extremist groups while being severely stretched in personnel and equipment. Deployments to crises can take several months. And a series of sexual abuse allegations against peacekeepers has brought new concerns about a long-standing problem that Obama called “an affront to human decency.”The U.N. has no standing army, meaning that it is up to the U.N.’s 193 member states to supply people and equipment.Monday’s pledges of new troops and police significantly exceed the 10,000 goal that U.S. officials had mentioned. In addition, the dozens of leaders from India, Britain and China and elsewhere said they would contribute the kinds of more sophisticated equipment the U.N.’s 16 peacekeeping missions say they need: Special forces, intelligence units, engineering skills, airlift capacity, field hospitals and even unarmed drones.Overall, countries pledged more than 40 helicopters, 15 engineering companies and 10 field hospitals, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, announced at the end of the meeting. Obama said the U.S., which contributes less than 100 troops and police, will contribute $2 million for training of African forces for peacekeeping and $2 million for training on countering improvised explosive devices, among other support. The United States and European countries have pulled back from peacekeeping operations over the past decades after disastrous losses of soldiers as happened in Somalia.Chinese President Xi Jinping made perhaps the largest commitment, saying his country would establish a permanent 8,000-strong rapid deployment force to respond to crises anywhere in the world and to provide $100 million to fund a similar force under the African Union. In addition, Xi said China would furnish more helicopters and other equipment and provide funding, training and equipment for 10 mine-clearing operations.  Other announcements included Britain committing 250 to 300 troops to the U.N. mission in South Sudan, drones and a signal communications unit from Pakistan, an infantry battalion and a helicopter from Italy and engineering support or personnel from South Korea, Japan and Sri Lanka.Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan and Rwanda are currently the top five nations in terms of troop contributions to peace missions.By Cho Chung-un and news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","obama presence at monday meeting ,monday pledges of new troops ,solution to every problem obama ,south korean president park geun ,10 field hospitals the ambassador","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'U.N.', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Lebanon', 'Haiti', 'South Sudan', 'korean', 'Park', 'Korea', 'the African Union', 'Korea', 'U.N.', 'Park', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Korea', 'ecosoc', 'the Peace Building Commission', 'Obama', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'U.N.', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Obama', 'the U.N.

She called on the international community to address the North Korean human rights issue, citing the report of the Commission of Inquiry on human rights in North Korea published in the same year.It remains to be seen how North Korea would respond to Park’s attempt to highlight its human rights situation on the international stage ― an issue that Pyongyang has been as sensitive about as it is to global condemnation of its nuclear development.The South Korean leader also asked the international community to turn its attention to North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, highlighting a successful deal reached over Iran’s nuclear program in July,Using the word “peace” 30 times in her 23-minute speech, Park said North Korea was the last hurdle for the global society to open a nuclear-free world. Park was the seventh keynote speaker at the annual assembly, after Russian President Vladmir Putin. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong, head of Pyongyang’s delegates to U.N., was absent when Park delivered her speech, according to reports.“Resolving the North Korean nuclear issue should be accorded the highest priority if we are to uphold the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and live up to the aspirations of humanity for a world without nuclear weapons,” Park said.Park also criticized North Korea for threatening provocative actions that would violate Security Council resolutions and that could thwart the planned reunion of separated families.“This will not only do harm to the hard-won mood for inter-Korean dialogue, but also undermine the efforts of the members of the six-party talks to reopen denuclearization talks.”We must no longer use political and military reasons as excuses for turning a blind eye to humanitarian issues, in particular the reunion of the separated families.”The remarks came amid a mix of hope and concern growing on the Korean Peninsula after a breakthrough inter-Korean dialogue in late August, when the two sides agreed to defuse military tensions and hold reunions of separated families from the 1950-53 Korean War.Despite the reconciliatory mood that followed the talks, North Korea said earlier this month that it would launch a rocket to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party. Seoul and Washington speculate that Pyongyang’s plan is an attempt to test its ballistic missile technology. If North Korea goes ahead with a launch, the regime is likely to be slapped with further sanctions by the U.N. as well as international condemnation from Washington and even from Beijing, its traditional ally. Chinese President Xi Jinping in a summit with U.S. President Barack Obama last week that he opposes any action that violates U.N. Security Council resolutions in an apparent warning against North Korea.The South Korean leader also presented her vision of unified Koreas, stressing that it would bring peace and international prosperity.“A peacefully unified Korea will be a thriving democratic nation free of nuclear weapons and upholding of human rights.“What is more, a unified Korean Peninsula, both as a symbol of peace in our global village and a new engine of growth ― will contribute greatly to peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and beyond.”Ending her four-day trip to the U.N., the president attended an event to promote Korean culture in the heart of New York City and also to thanked local supporters who have been active in spreading Korean culture.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","korea nuclear disarmament highlighting successful ,october south korean president park ,tuesday urged pyongyang to cease ,president vladmir putin north korean ,her 23 minute speech park","['North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations General Assembly', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'syrian', 'Park', 'U.N.', 'Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'the Commission of Inquiry', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Iran', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'russian', 'Vladmir Putin', 'north korean', 'Ri Su - yong', 'Pyongyang', 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Security Council', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'the Workers ’ Party', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'U.N.', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'U.N.

Sustainable Development Summit on Sunday. (Yonhap)Park said she expects the U.N. member states to produce a new legally binding deal at the Paris conference to cut the heat-trapping gases.She made her comments at an informal working lunch hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for several countries, including China and France.The informal working lunch was meant to build momentum in leading up to the Paris conference. Scientists say greenhouse gases are to blame for global warming.Park also said that South Korea would strengthen the Korean Peninsula‘s capability to deal with climate change as part of efforts to build mutual confidence with North Korea.She called for the U.N.’s support for her plan, though it remains unclear whether North Korea will cooperate with South Korea in combating climate change.Earlier Sunday, Park stressed the importance of education in building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions to achieve sustainable development.Park said South Korea drastically expanded investment in education as it was pushing for industrialization in the 1970s, which in turn created decent jobs and resulted in inclusive growth.South Korea‘s education fervor helped transform the country into Asia’s fourth-largest economy from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War.Park made her comments at the session on sustainable development. The session was co-presided by Park and her Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea‘s presidential office, said the move demonstrated South Korea’s leadership in discussing the major agenda of the international community.On Friday, member states of the U.N. adopted a new sustainable development agenda and set 2030 as the target year for achieving the goals that call for, among other things, ending poverty, protecting the planet and providing high-quality education.Park also stressed the importance of the government‘s leadership in setting up an effective and reliable system, citing South Korea’s government-led economic development in the 1960s.“South Korea has had the experience of achieving industrialization and democracy by getting out of absolute poverty in a generation,” Park said at the session on sustainable development. She also said South Korea‘s experience “can become a useful asset as we are pursuing development goals.”Park also cited the “Saemaeul Movement,” or new community movement, as an example of building institutions for development.The initiative -- launched by Park’s father, then-President Park Chung-hee, in the 1970s -- is credited with helping modernize the then-rural South Korean economy.Also on Sunday, Park held summit talks with her Pakistani counterpart and proposed that the two sides hold high-level policy consultations later this year to discuss such issues as efforts to rebuild Afghanistan.Park also held two separate summit talks with her counterparts from Denmark and Nigeria on the sidelines.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) and U.S. President Barack Obama walk at the North Lawn of the White House in Washington on Thursday. (Yonhap/AP)But then Xi went a step further and said, ""We oppose any actions that might cause tension in the Korean Peninsula or violate U.S. Security Council resolution."" Xi did not mention North Korea by name, but the remark was a clear warning to Pyongyang not to go ahead with its threatened nuclear or missile tests that are banned under a series of U.N. Security Council resolutions.It was highly unusual for a Chinese leader to publicly issue such a warning, given that Beijing has been reluctant to criticize North Korea and has usually urged all sides to exercise calm and restraint and resolve disputes through dialogue.What was also unusual in Xi's remarks was the absence of a call for an early resumption of the long-stalled six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program -- an appeal that has long been seen as efforts to back North Korea's call for unconditional resumption of nuclear negotiations.Such changes raise hope that Beijing's thinking on North Korea may change.China is North Korea's last remaining major ally and a key provider of food and fuel. But it has been reluctant to use its influence for fear that pushing the regime too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border and ultimately the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation next door.That's why China has never gone as far as to cause real harm to the North even when it increased pressure and imposed sanctions on the neighbor, especially when Pyongyang defies international appeals and carries out nuclear tests and other provocative acts.It was unclear what prompted Xi to break from practices and issue a warning to the North or if it represented a real change in China's strategic calculus with regard to the North.But the changes came as China's relations with the North have markedly soured while its ties with South Korea have significantly strengthened in recent years.The Beijing-Pyongyang relations took a nosedive after North Korea defiantly carried out its third nuclear test in early 2013, a few months after Xi took office. Analysts have said that Xi is believed to have taken the test as an affront to him.Xi's displeasure with the North has been apparent.Breaking from decades of tradition, Xi visited South Korea in 2014, becoming the first Chinese president to visit the South ahead of the North. Xi has not yet visited the North or met with its young leader, Kim Jong-un, although he held a series of summit meetings with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.On the other hand, China's relations with the South have been significantly upgraded under Xi and Park. So much so that even concerns have arisen in the United States that Seoul may be tilting too much toward Beijing.Early this month, Park attended China's massive military parade marking the end of World War II.Her attendance not only symbolized the sea change in relations between South Korea and China, which fought on opposing sides in the 1950-53 Korean War, but it also underscored the deep strains in the traditional alliance between Pyongyang and Beijing.Park's decision to attend the parade raised eyebrows among many U.S. experts and analysts as the event was seen as China's muscle flexing and was shunned by all Western leaders. But South Korea said it believes her attendance would be helpful in winning Chinese cooperation in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.Xi's unusual warning to the North on Friday could be an outcome from Park's attendance at the parade and more broadly, the ever-strengthening relations between Seoul and Beijing.

But the government rejected their bid at that time, citing its political nature.   If the ministry approves their move this time, representatives from the labor union groups will meet with their North Korean counterparts in Kaesong on Wednesday to set details for football games to be held in Pyongyang late next month.    Workers of the two Koreas previously had friendly matches in 1999 and 2007.

Though Pyongyang has hinted at carrying out nuclear and missile tests to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the inception of its ruling Workers’ Party on Oct. 10, no clear signs of any imminent liftoff have been detected across the border, Seoul officials said Thursday. The communist state appears to have nearly completed extending a launch pad by around 10 meters to some 60 meters at its missile site in the west coastal town of Dongchang. Satellite imagery showed fence screens installed to conceal its work in the final stages remain there. “We’re closely following North Korea’s missile launch-related activities in coordination with the U.S., and will disclose to the public if we spot any signs of any impending firing,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. A Unification Ministry official also told reporters that there was no trace of a looming launch. Last week, the North threatened to put in orbit a satellite in celebration of the party anniversary, while reaffirming its commitment to beef up its “nuclear deterrence” to counter what it calls a hostile U.S. policy. Uriminjokkiri, a state-run propaganda outlet, also repeated the argument, saying “no one can take issue with its sovereign right” to launch a satellite and strengthen its nuclear capabilities. An F/A-18E/F Super Hornet combat aircraft takes off the USS George Washington aircraft carrier during a South Korea-U.S. joint exercise in the West Sea on June 24, 2012. (Yonhap)The ongoing string of threats have prompted not only South Korea and the U.S. but also China and other countries to urge the Kim Jong-un regime to refrain, warning of further sanctions and other disciplinary steps. While seeking closer coordination with Seoul and Beijing at upcoming bilateral summits, Washington is set to dispatch Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan to Busan for a naval review slated for Oct. 18-23 in a show of its military might and veiled warnings against Pyongyang. Put in service in 2003, the 97,000 ton vessel is capable of carrying about 90 jets including F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters, EA-18G Growler electric warfare planes and E-2C Hawkeye early warning aircraft.

It is the provocation that would shift the reconciliatory trend into a confrontational one,” it said in a statement.The South’s ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy have been discussing the enactment of the North Korea Human Rights Act, which has long been pending at the National Assembly amid partisan differences.Stressing the importance of the need to address Pyongyang’s woeful human rights records, Seoul’s Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo recently said the differences over the act between the rival parties have been narrowed.The South’s left-wing politicians have long argued that the human rights act would provoke the North, damage the already strained bilateral relations and deepen ideological division within the South. But conservatives have claimed that the act should be quickly enacted to pressure the North to uphold the universal value of human rights. Pyongyang has responded sensitively to the external criticism of its human rights as the issue could pose a threat to its dictatorial ruling system, observers say.In the past, the North has unilaterally canceled bilateral plans to hold reunions of separated families amid cross-border tensions. The two sides planned to hold the reunions in September 2013, but the North unilaterally canceled it amid the friction over the issue of resuming the stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan. The latest reunions were held in February 2014 after grueling high-level talks.The North has also taken issue with a campaign by South Korean civic groups to float balloons carrying leaflets criticizing North Korea’s autocratic leadership. On Tuesday, some 30 members of a civic group launched 59 balloons carrying 900,000 leaflets in the South Korean border city of Paju, north of Seoul.In response, Uriminjokkiri, a propaganda website run by the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, said in a commentary that the leaflets are increasing cross-border animosities that could undermine the efforts to hold the family reunions.The North has continued to demand that the South stop the civic groups from sending the leaflets. But the South has argued that it cannot block civil activities in line with the Constitution that ensures citizens’ freedom of expression.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","anti pyongyang leaflets triggering concerns ,pyongyang leaflets triggering concerns over ,carrying leaflets criticizing north korea ,north korea leaflets could dampen ,send anti pyongyang leaflets triggering","['inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'anti - north Korea', 'the North ’s Red Cross', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the North Korea Human Rights Act', 'the National Assembly', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul ’s Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Paju', 'Seoul', 'Uriminjokkiri', 'the North ’s Committee', 'Fatherland', 'Song Sang - ho']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68712008  0.46677724

The brigade-level organization will be installed within the Army’s Special Warfare Command, with its primary mission being to “strike the enemy’s core strategic targets,” the command stated in a report submitted to the National Assembly’s defense committee for a parliamentary audit. “(The plan) is intended for operations in North Korea,” Commander Lt. Gen. Chang Kyung-suk said during the audit at the Army headquarters in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province. “Work is underway to transform one of the six brigades forming the special forces into a unit that will run independent operations.” While operable in the North on its own, the envisioned brigade may engage in joint actions with the U.S. such as for combat service support that requires infiltration tools, Chang noted.  North Korean missiles on trucks are displayed during a military parade to mark the 65th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party in Pyongyang on Oct. 10, 2010. (AP-Yonhap)The command also said in the report that it was pushing to set up a special aviation unit to boost independent infiltration capabilities by upgrading its aircraft and deploying high altitude infiltration equipment. To better fend off the communist neighbor’s drone threats, the Army’s Capital Defense Command has established a new squad and beefed up related personnel, it said in a separate document. A rising number of North Korean drones have encroached on South Korean airspace in recent years. A year ago, the wreckage of a small unmanned aerial vehicle was collected by a fisherman near a border island in the West Sea. It was similar to drones found months earlier near Baengnyeongdo Island; Paju, Gyeonggi Province; and Samcheok, Gangwon Province. The discovery has triggered concerns over what critics call porous air defense, especially after some of the drones were found to have taken as many as 200 pictures while flying over Cheong Wa Dae and other parts of Seoul, though the Defense Ministry said they were not sent back to the communist state.“We’ve improved the capital air defense operation system, while securing more air-raid weapons on standby for combat missions,” the command said.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","destroying north korea nuclear weapons ,tasked with destroying north korea ,with destroying north korea nuclear ,army tasked with destroying north ,destroying north korea nuclear","['South Korea', 'Army', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Army ’s Special Warfare Command', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'North Korea', 'Chang Kyung - suk', 'Army', 'Gyeryongdae', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'U.S.', 'Chang', 'north korean', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Pyongyang', 'AP', 'the Army ’s Capital Defense Command', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Samcheok', 'Gangwon Province', 'Cheong', 'Seoul', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.34435448  0.21929328

The two leaders are expected to put up a united front against the North’s nuclear development, according to U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice.The summit is expected to be yet another case that underscores Beijing’s policy challenge regarding the unpredictable regime, experts noted.“In a broad context, China basically seeks regional stability. To this end, China feels the need to embrace the North to a certain degree, but there is no shift at all in Pyongyang’s stance about its nuclear program, which apparently gives China a headache,” Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification.“So, China can hardly fend off the U.S. calls to further pressure the North. It cannot move in support of the North, either.”As the close ties between Seoul and Beijing have been highlighted in recent years, speculation has grown that both Beijing and Pyongyang will make moves to restore bilateral relations. But there has yet to be any clear sign of the two neighbors seeking to mend their rifts.President Park Geun-hye and Xi have met for summit talks six times, underscoring the evolving strategic partnership between the two nations, which has triggered concerns about a possible chasm in the South Korea-U.S. alliance.But there has not been a summit between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, an indication that the bilateral political trust has been eroding due to the North’s destabilizing behavior. Despite China’s opposition, the North has engaged in a series of provocative acts, including the third nuclear test in February 2013.Chun In-young, professor emeritus at Seoul National University, stressed the need for Pyongyang to move first to restore ties with Beijing, saying that Pyongyang’s adherence to its nuclear adventurism demonstrates its failure to adapt to the new regional security environment where China has emerged as a great power.“Those days when China served as a guardian for the North are gone. China, now a critical factor in the international order, would no longer take the side of the North, as evidenced by the recent move to join the U.S. in the efforts to oppose the North’s nuclear program,” he said.“During the Cold War, particularly when China and the Soviet Union were in a conflict, the North held some leverage. But those days are gone. Pyongyang insisting on its nuclear ambitions is failing to adapt to the new security environment.”By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","north destabilizing behavior despite china ,pyongyang nuclear ambitions and provocative ,its nuclear ambitions is failing ,destabilizing behavior despite china opposition ,to curb pyongyang nuclear ambitions","['China', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'North ’s', 'U.S. National Security', 'Susan Rice', 'Beijing', 'China', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Park Geun', 'Xi', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Xi', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'China', 'Seoul National University', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'China', 'the Soviet Union', 'pyongyang']",0,"[ 1.         11.          0.         ... -0.61797434  0.40638724

The two-day Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue was led by Seoul’s Deputy Defense Minister Yoo Jeh-seung, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretaries of Defense Abraham Denmark and Elaine Bunn, each in charge of East Asia policy and nuclear and missile defense. Other participants included Shin Chae-hyun, director general for North American affairs at the Foreign Ministry here, and Sung Kim, special representative for North Korea policy at the U.S. State Department. With Pyongyang’s mounting nuclear and missile threats topping the agenda, the sides also discussed a delayed transfer of wartime operational control, operation of the Deterrence Strategy Committee launched early this year, and development of the “4D proactive defense” concept consisting of detect, defense, disrupt and destroy.

(Yonhap)“The meeting is aimed at consolidating our joint readiness. Enhancing the joint deterrence and defense capabilities is paramount at a time when North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats are building up,” Yoo said at the kickoff of the meeting. “We should complete a condition-based OPCON handover planthrough this meeting and upcoming Security Consultative Meeting, a new strategic document that will make a blueprint conveying not only command relationships during joint operations but also mid- and long-term understanding for the South Korea-U.S. joint defense system.” In response, Denmark emphasized the significance of the allies’ close coordination in the wake of North Korea’s land mine provocation last month, while extending condolences to the two South Korean soldiers whose legs suffered damages in the blasts. The provocation also served as a reminder of the volatility of the peninsula, where tension could escalate in a flash, he added, given the then situation that the sides were taken to the brink of an armed clash following the incident. The talks came amid spiraling speculation that the Kim Jong-un regime may stage a major provocation involving a long-range missile or atomic device in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party on Oct. 10. A recent series of threats from the communist country prompted Seoul, Washington, Beijing and key neighbors to step up diplomacy and relay warnings of additional, stronger sanctions and other punitive steps. On the sidelines of his visit, Sung Kim also met with Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo on Wednesday. He is scheduled for talks Thursday with Hwang Joon-kook, special representative for Korean peninsular peace and security affairs and Seoul’s chief nuclear negotiator, following their meeting last week in Washington.

Pyongyang also said its bomb-making nuclear facilities have returned to normal operation and it could conduct a nuclear test if necessary.  On Monday, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said that the U.S. and China are ""united in demanding the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" and won't accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state.  Calling China a ""fulcrum of influence"" for the North, Rice also said this week's summit will be an important opportunity to discuss ""how we can sharpen Pyongyang's choices between having nuclear weapons and developing economically.""  On Tuesday, the State Department's Asia policy chief, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel, said that Obama and Xi have ""an abiding interest in the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" and this week's summit will be an opportunity for them to publicly reaffirm that ""unshakable commitment.""  ""The confluence of strategic interests between China and the United States ... are such that we are even more steadfast in our insistence that North Korea halt, roll back and ultimately relinquish its nuclear stockpile and its ballistic missile program,"" Russel said during a Foreign Press Center briefing.  At the same time, the countries are also ""equally firm in our commitment to extend the helping hand to North Korea,"" the official said of the benefits Pyongyang could gain in exchange for giving up its nuclear program, such as diplomatic recognition, economic assistance and the conversion of the Korean War armistice into a peace treaty.  U.S. National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink also said that North Korea will be one of the key issues to be discussed at the Obama-Xi summit and that he expects the two leaders to spend ""substantial time"" discussing the matter.

Lee Choon-suk of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy raised the issue of unwanted Japanese forces during a parliamentary audit, asking Han if the country could turn down the U.S. military's request for the entry of Japanese forces in the event of a North Korea-waged war. South Korea ""can"" do so, Han said in response. ""The wartime operational control  is something that is executed under the leadership of both South Korean and U.S. presidents, therefore if our president does not allow it, (the entry) is not permitted,"" the defense minister noted. Under the current bilateral alliance, the U.S. military assumes the OPCON of South Korean forces in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula, with both sides agreeing last year to delay the planned return of wartime OPCON to Seoul until South Korea is capable of countering North Korean threats. Japan should gain prior request or consent from South Korea before the country exercises its right to collective self defense on issues related to the peninsula, Han said, reiterating the official South Korean stance on the issue.

Security Council resolutions banning the North from any ballistic activity.  Pyongyang has long been accused of using long-range rocket launches as a pretext for test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.  South Korea and the U.S. suspect that for now, the North is more likely to conduct a long-range rocket launch than a nuclear test, and has urged Pyongyang not to go ahead with a launch or face stronger U.N. sanctions.  In the past, the North conducted a rocket test first before using international sanctions and condemnations for the launch as a pretext for going ahead with a nuclear test.

In recent weeks, Seoul has been ramping up diplomatic efforts to avert any test of a long-range missile or atomic device. Washington, Beijing and other countries have also warned of further sanctions should Pyongyang press ahead with a major provocation. Last week, the communist state hinted that it would launch a satellite in celebration of the party anniversary on Oct. 10, while reaffirming its commitment to beef up its “nuclear deterrence” to counter what it calls a hostile U.S. policy. Uriminjokkiri, a state-run propaganda outlet, also reiterated the argument, saying “no one can take issue with its sovereign right” to launch a satellite and strengthen its nuclear deterrence.Marking the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 19 joint statement of the six-party talks on Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted the significance of following through on U.N. sanctions, warning against a further provocation.“All parties on this issue are members of the United Nations. We have a shared responsibility to uphold peace and security on the peninsula and implement U.N. Security Council resolutions,” he told a forum at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.“Any intention or attempt to disrupt peace of the Korean Peninsula and security in Northeast Asia is unjustified and undesirable. … We must not take new actions that could lead to tensions on the peninsula.” The file photo shows North Korea`s launch of a long-range rocket in 2012. (Yonhap)Sung Kim, U.S. special representative for North Korea policy and chief nuclear negotiator, said that of Washington’s three-pronged approach consisting of deterrence, diplomacy and pressure, it is looking into ways to tighten enforcement of existing sanctions and what it can do in case of another provocation. In a media interview, he also called for efforts to restart the six-nation talks, expressing frustration with Pyongyang’s lack of interest in denuclearization. “It’s important that we continue our efforts on all three tracks because I think it’s clear that just one track isn’t going to solve the problem,” the former ambassador to South Korea told Yonhap News. “I think what’s important is for us to be able to sit down with them and hear directly from them that they are committed to denuclearization and that if and when the six-party talks resume, they will work with us in meaningful and credible negotiations toward verifiable denuclearization.”In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency adopted a resolution on Friday urging Pyongyang to refrain from conducting another underground explosion, saying its ongoing nuclear activities are a breach of U.N. resolutions and of “serious concern.”The North’s anniversary is set to come at a delicate time given President Park Geun-hye’s summit with her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama scheduled for Oct. 16 in Washington, where Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se has said the two leaders will reach a “crucial agreement” on the North Korean issue. Ahead of the meeting, Obama will hold separate talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week, while Park is expected to deliver a message on North Korea and other regional and global issues at a U.N.

Concerns about Japan seeking greater military power have deepened as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has taken a dubious stance on history and national security issues.South Korea has said Japan must win explicit consent from Seoul if it wants to be involved in coping with contingencies on the peninsula. In the revised defense cooperation guidelines, the U.S. and Japan said they will act “in accordance with international law, including full respect for sovereignty.”In the statement, the ministry reiterated that Japan’s use of the right to collective self-defense over issues related to the“security of the Korean Peninsula and the national interests” of South Korea will require Seoul‘s request or consent.

Security Council sanctions further deepening its isolation if the regime forges ahead with a banned long-range rocket launch, South Korea's chief nuclear envoy said Wednesday.Special representative Hwang Joon-kook made the remark after talks with his U.S. counterpart, Amb. Sung Kim, in Washington, stressing that a satellite launch by the North, unlike those by other nations, constitutes a clear violation of U.N. resolutions.""The right to peaceful use of space, which is possessed by ordinary nations, is clearly restricted in the case of North Korea under Security Council resolutions. In other words, North Korea's satellite launch is considered a test aimed at advancing its nuclear weapon delivery capabilities,"" Hwang told reporters.""Should North Korea push ahead with the so-called satellite launch, it will bring about additional measures by the Security Council and would be putting itself in deeper isolation,"" he said.On Monday, the North strongly hinted at the possibility of launching a long-range rocket around the Oct. 10 anniversary of the ruling Worker' Party, saying its scientists are working hard to mark the anniversary with greater achievements than the country's successful 2012 satellite launch.Arguing it has the right to the peaceful use of space, it also vowed to keep launching satellites.The missile threat was followed a day later by a nuclear threat. The North said Tuesday that its bomb-making nuclear facilities at the Yongbyon complex have returned to normal operation and are ready to respond to U.S. ""hostile policy"" toward it with ""nuclear thunder,"" a term apparently referring to a nuclear test.Hwang said South Korea and the U.S. share ""deep concern"" about the possibility of the North's rocket launch, saying the communist nation ""has openly stated that it will possess missile capabilities to strike as far as the mainland U.S.""""Not only six-party countries, including South Korea and the U.S., but also the U.N. Security Council take this dangerous move by North Korea as a serious act of threatening peace,"" the envoy said. ""North Korea should remember that it is the only country subject to U.N. Security Council resolutions due to its development of weapons of mass destruction.""Hwang also urged the North to return to the negotiating table, saying Seoul and Washington are ready to hold ""exploratory talks""with Pyongyang without any conditions to test the North's commitment to denuclearization before formally restarting the six-party talks.North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have warned earlier this year that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.

Paul Zukunft said his organization has a “significant force package” including vessels and personnel as part of Washington’s broader plan designed to deal with an armed conflict involving the two Koreas.Paul Zukunft“When you deal with the leader of North Korea that does not interact with other world leaders and that operates in seclusion, a least provocation could result in overreaction and use of military force. ... It is one area of concern that keeps all of us awake at night,” he said during an interview with The Korea Herald on the sidelines of a seminar on maritime security in Seoul. “I can’t elaborate, but I will state that the Coast Guard has a significant force package ― ships, coast guardsmen that are part of this campaign plan that will augment the overall force for a campaign with North Korea.” As South Korea’s Navy and Coast Guard are seeking to boost joint efforts and interoperability, the commandant suggested that they should begin with a simple task, such as a search-and-rescue mission, and then advance to larger-scale projects.The move came in the wake of a ferry disaster last year that left more than 300 people dead or missing, prompting an overhaul of the South Korean Coast Guard and its ensuing incorporation into the newly launched Ministry of Public Safety and Security. But the initiative faces an uphill battle amid fierce interservice rivalries, such as over budget allocation, weapons acquisition and law enforcement authority. The U.S., for its part, adopted a tri-service strategy under the concept of the “national fleet,” which enables the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to carry out joint operations at sea. “In search-and-rescue offshore, it could be the first ship that arrives. Maybe it’s a Korean Navy vessel, or maybe it’s the Coast Guard that may require Navy support if it’s, say, a mass rescue event, the ferry sinking, for example,” Zukunft said. “So it doesn’t require just one service, but how other services bring their resources to bear. Maybe start with something as fundamental as search and rescue, and build from there.” The admiral was visiting Seoul to take part in the North Pacific Coast Guard Forum, a biennial, six-nation gathering aimed at fostering multinational cooperation on maritime security. The other participants are the U.S., China, Japan, Russia and Canada. He stressed the significance of international cooperation in devising mass rescue scenarios and better crisis management strategies given the rapid technological development and growing use of social media. “Anytime when there’s a loss of life, that service will be portrayed as a failure. But sometimes it’s just not possible to save all lives,” Zukun ft said. “So we’re looking at building exercises ― it’s just not how do you respond tactically, but how do you respond using social media, how do you reach out to the families of those victims while you’re managing this response to keep all of those other priorities at the forefront of your mind as well.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","the admiral was visiting seoul ,the leader of north korea ,admiral was visiting seoul to ,admiral was visiting seoul ,chief said wednesday expressing concerns","['North Korea', 'the U.S. Coast Guard', 'Paul Zukunft', 'Washington', 'Koreas', 'North Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'the Coast Guard', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Navy and Coast Guard', 'Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'Coast Guard', 'Marine Corps', 'Korean Navy', 'the Coast Guard', 'Navy', 'Zukunft', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Canada']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.68249679  0.9596833

(Yonhap)Analysts presume that the North has come a long way in developing nuclear warheads and their delivery means such as long-range rockets, through three nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and a series of rocket tests, disguised as satellite launches.On Monday, Pyongyang hinted at the possibility of another rocket launch on Oct. 10 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party. The potential launch would further escalate the North’s missile threats, a reason Seoul has been stepping up its diplomacy to forestall it.Since its 1998 test of the Taepodong-1 missile, the North has carried out five long-range rocket tests. Experts say the latest test in 2012 showed that its missile can travel some 10,000 kilometers -- far enough to reach the U.S. mainland.Apart from the land-based platform, the North has been pushing to develop the underwater nuclear-capable missile system. In May, it claimed to have carried out an ejection test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.The reclusive state has also been seen steadily seeking to accumulate weapons-grade fissile materials through its plutonium-based nuclear program and uranium enrichment activities to build nuclear warheads.On Tuesday, the North’s Atomic Energy Institute chief claimed that the North restarted all nuclear facilities, including its five-megawatt reactor and uranium enrichment factory at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex.Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said at a general meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency Tuesday that the North has been steadily running the nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon facility and expanding the facilities for uranium enrichment.The main five-megawatt reactor is the North’s core facility to produce weapons-grade plutonium. The reactor, should it be fully operational, can produce 6 kilograms of plutonium, the amount to build one nuclear warhead, analysts say.The North is believed to have accumulated some 40 kilograms of plutonium after it reprocessed spent fuel rods at least three times, in 2003, 2005 and 2009, according to Seoul officials.Amid its efforts to produce plutonium-based bombs, the North has also been striving to advance its uranium enrichment program, reportedly since the mid-1980s. The regime has claimed to have some 2,000 operational centrifuges capable of producing some 40 kilograms of highly enriched uranium each year. To produce one HEU bomb, more than 15 kilograms of HEU is required.Should the North carry out another nuclear test, it could test a “boosted fission weapon,” called a “1.5-generation” nuclear bomb, experts say. The development of this weapon is known to be a preliminary step toward the production of a hydrogen bomb, regarded as a “second-generation” nuclear weapon.Amid the growing speculation over the North’s fourth nuclear test, the U.S.-based Institute for Science and International Security said that a new facility under construction at the Yongbyon complex appears to be designed to separate isotopes from spent fuel that can be used to produce powerful nuclear weapons.The North has pushed for its nuclear program in line with its so-called Byungjin policy of simultaneously developing its economy and nuclear arms. The North has already described itself as a nuclear power state in its constitution, a status that the U.S. and South Korea say would never be accepted.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","build nuclear warheads on tuesday ,three nuclear tests in 2006 ,nuclear warheads on tuesday ,rockets through three nuclear tests ,highly enriched uranium each year","['North Korea ’s', 'U.S. Satellite', 'Yongbyon', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Workers ’ Party', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'the North ’s Atomic Energy Institute', 'Yongbyon', 'Seoul', 'Cho Tae - yul', 'the International Atomic Energy Agency', 'Yongbyon', 'Seoul', 'HEU', 'HEU', 'North', 'North ’s', 'the u.s.-based Institute for Science and International Security', 'Yongbyon', 'Byungjin', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35673416  0.9398998

The 37,000-ton warship can accommodate a crew of 300 and is equipped with 5-inch guns, guided ship-to-ship missiles as well as long-range anti-submarine torpedos. With the entry of the first warship Wednesday, the Navy plans to send 21 kinds of Navy vessels to the port by mid-October as part of the testing. The vessels will engage in trials of port entry, departure and mooring to test the safety of the port, which is set to be completed by the end of this year. The Navy is building the naval base, which is capable of accommodating 20 combat ships and two cruise vessels, on the southern tip of Jeju Island, a strategically and economically important sea point leading to the Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea.

It said it is ready to use nuclear weapons ""at any time' against the U.S. and other ""hostile"" nations.Pyongyang also strongly indicated a plan to launch another long-range rocket around the Oct. 10 founding anniversary of its communist party.The North's fourth nuclear test may follow, given the pattern of its strategic provocations.""We can say that (the world) has entered the third North Korean nuclear crisis,"" said Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Seoul National University Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.He cited the North's self-declaration in its constitution as a nuclear power and leader Kim Jong-un's stated policy of developing its nuclear program and economy simultaneously.""The task of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue has become even more difficult,"" compared with the first crisis in the early 1990s and the second one in the 2000s, Chang pointed out. The North has continued to upgrade its nuclear capability amid a drawn-out stalemate in the six-party talks. South Korea's defense ministry formally estimates that the secretive North has more than 40 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium, enough to produce at least seven nuclear bombs. Concerns are growing about the level of the North's technology in miniaturizing nuclear weapons to mount on missiles.The Sept. 19 document issued at the conclusion of the fourth round of six-party talks in Beijing initially raised hopes of significant progress in denuclearizing the North and bringing lasting peace to the peninsula.In the deal, Pyongyang ""committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards.""The regional powers agreed to provide the North with massive energy aid in return. Washington and Japan promised to take steps to normalize ties with Pyongyang.The North submitted a declaration of its nuclear stockpile and blew up a cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear complex in a symbolic gesture. But the North and the U.S. walked out of the nuclear talks in December 2008, failing to reach a compromise on verification. The Sept. 19 Joint Statement is now treated as a mere scrap of paper. ""The biggest problem is that North Korea has no will for denuclearization,"" said Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean national security adviser. ""The North will never abandon its nuclear weapons before (its dialogue partners) make the case that there will be more gains from giving them up than keeping them.""He stressed the need for the U.S. to be more active in dealing with the North Korea issue as it has done in the Iranian nuclear crisis.A silver lining is that Beijing appears to be getting tough on Pyongyang. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed in their summit in early September to push for the resumption of the ""meaningful"" six-party talks. It remains uncertain, however, whether the North will return to dialogue with the Barack Obama administration with just about 16 months left in power.""As a U.S. policy priority, the denuclearization of North Korea is a policy corpse -- it is dead,"" said Larry Niksch, a U.S. expert who has long followed North Korea affairs.Kim Sung-han, professor at Korea University in Seoul, called for the freezing of the North's nuclear activity first.""And then, the two Koreas, the U.S. and China need to hold four-way peace talks to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty,"" he said.

Though the reactor is not an ideal producer of isotopes, it can be used in that way, it added.The North's focus could be to produce tritium, an isotope that can be used in making more sophisticated nuclear weapons, it said.""North Korea has stated repeatedly its intention to improve the quality of its nuclear weapons, and tritium would enable nuclear weapons designs that could have a greater explosive yield than weapons made from only plutonium or weapons-grade uranium,"" the institute said.""Whether North Korea can make nuclear weapons using tritium is unknown although we believe that it remains a technical problem North Korea still needs to solve. Solving this problem would likely require more underground nuclear tests,"" it said.Earlier Tuesday, the North said that all nuclear facilities at the complex, including the uranium enrichment plant and the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor, have started normal operation. It also said it is trying to improve the ""levels of nuclear weapons with various missions in quality and quantity.""But the institute said the reactor was operating intermittently as of August.""The satellite imagery taken Aug. 22 does not show a steady stream of water being discharged from the reactor's discharge pipeline, which is considered the main sign of full-reactor operation,"" it said.As for the North's claim about the uranium enrichment plant, the institute said that the available information does not confirm the plant's operation, but nothing contradicts the North's statement the plant is operational.

Pyongyang is under heavy sanctions by the United Nations Security Council for its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.The North has been pursuing a dual policy of developing nuclear weapons as well as boosting its ailing economy.

At that time, the reunions were pushed back to early 2014.""I think that the North's announcement has set the stage for the two Koreas to hold high-level talks at an early date,"" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. ""South and North Korea should hold such talks as soon as possible to prevent the North from making provocations.""The two Koreas reached a landmark agreement on Aug. 25 to defuse military tension and resume the family reunions.

It also stressed that any launch would be a “grave provocation and military threat.”Apparently to counter the international criticism, Pyongyang repeated its hitherto position that it has a “sovereign right for peaceful space development,” and that it would launch a “satellite,” not a warhead.“The world will clearly see a series of satellites of (North) Korea soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea,” the unnamed chief of Pyongyang’s National Aerospace Development Administration, said in an interview with the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.“Space development for peaceful purposes is a sovereign state’s legitimate right recognized by international law and the Party and the people of the DPRK (North Korea) are fully determined to exercise this right no matter what others may say about it.”The administration’s chief also said that the North is in the final stage of developing a new earth observation satellite for weather forecasts to “actively” contribute to the nation’s economic development, and that it has made “great strides” in its research to develop geostationary satellites. Expert analyses of satellite imagery have raised the possibility that the North could launch a rocket, as it has been carrying out construction work to improve facilities at the Dongchang-ri launch site in North Pyongan Province.Seoul’s Defense Ministry said it has yet to detect any unusual North Korean movements that indicate clear preparations for a rocket launch in the near future. “(The launch of a long-range rocket) will be a military threat and a clear violation of the UNSC resolutions that ban any activities using ballistic missile capability,” said ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok during a press briefing.“We are currently maintaining close cooperation with the U.S. to jointly detect any North Korean activities with regard to its possible long-range rocket launch.”Seoul’s Foreign Ministry warned that should the North launch a rocket, it would deal with the issue at the UNSC in a “prompt and effective” manner.The North’s mention of a potential rocket launch came as the two Koreas were preparing for the reunions of separated families from Oct. 20-26 at Mount Geumgangsan for the first time since February 2014.On Tuesday, the two sides exchanged their lists of family members, a process to confirm the final lists of those who will attend the family reunions at the east coast mountain resort.Observers say that should the inter-Korean relations deteriorate due to a rocket launch around Oct. 10, the reunions could be delayed or canceled. The reunions, planned for Sept. 2013, were delayed just several days before the reunions, amid cross-border tensions.It is also expected to test Seoul’s judgement call as it had pledged to halt propaganda broadcasts, strongly opposed by the North, unless any “abnormal situation” occurs in their landmark Aug. 25 agreement that quelled cross-border military tension this summer.Experts say that the communist regime might feel the increasing “technological need” to conduct a rocket test to further advance its missile technology, given that it has not carried out any long-range rocket test since December 2012.“The most crucial reason for the North to want to conduct a rocket test is its technological motive. As the North seeks to become a strong nation in terms of its rocket and nuclear weapons capabilities, additional tests are, obviously, necessary,” said Kim Tae-woo, North Korea expert at Dongguk University.“We can also think about the domestic political purposes. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un needs to further tighten his grip on power … in other words, to consolidate his leadership authority and strengthen discipline among his people.”Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the think tank Sejong Institute, called on Seoul to make more active efforts to dissuade Pyongyang from a rocket launch that could escalate cross-border tensions and lead to stronger international sanctions that would cause the isolated regime to consider a fourth nuclear test.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","rocket will be military threat ,fourth nuclear test by song ,dissuade pyongyang from rocket launch ,long range rocket launch seoul ,range rocket test since december","['North Korea', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Washington', 'U.N.

Kim Dong-man, head of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, exits the meeting room after the executive committe approved the labor reform plans on Monday in Seoul. YonhapThe Federation of Korea Trade Unions approved the deal 30 to 15, with three abstentions, at a central executive committee meeting Monday. The session was suspended earlier in the day, as staunch opponents of the deal held a rally against the agreement.The union’s approval is a boost to the Park Geun-hye administration’s reform efforts, as the ruling party is set to submit the reform bill to the National Assembly on Wednesday in a bid to pass it through the parliament within the upcoming regular session. The trilateral committee on labor, business and government reached a compromise Sunday after monthslong negotiations. But the panel left most of the major contentious decisions to the National Assembly, hinting that the reform plans still had a tough road ahead.Though the government, the ruling Saenuri Party and businesses hailed the agreement as a breakthrough, some radical unionists opposed the plan. Some 100 union members rallied in protest at the umbrella union’s “compromise” with the government, holding up placards that read “We can never approve the agreement that enslaves 20 million laborers.” The meeting was thrown into further disarray when Kim Man-je, head of its metal union, poured paint thinner onto his body and the floor at around 3:30 p.m. to express resistance. Another unionist near him reportedly stopped him from setting himself on fire with a fire extinguisher. As of 6 p.m., the union meeting resumed.The labor and business blocs had locked horns over the employers’ call for reduced protection of workers. According to the plan, the government will set up administrative guidelines designed to ease restrictions for employers to dismiss underperforming workers and change company rules without union approval.In an apparent attempt to contain the labor circle’s concerns, the committee stipulated in the draft plan that the government should sufficiently consult with the labor and business blocs when employing measures to reform the labor market.Until such guidelines are established, employers will refer to past court rulings to decide under what conditions employees can be dismissed and rules changed.The plan would lay the groundwork for employers to push to change the employment contracts or salary system without union approval, giving a boost to expanding the government-backed wage peak system in the private sector.The government pledged to offer financial and policy support to the companies adopting the system in the proposal, with the committee vowing efforts to use the money saved from the wage peak system to create jobs for the young. Under the wage peak system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers reach a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending the retirement age. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for the revamp in the overall wage system. The government and the ruling Saenuri Party will likely forge ahead with attempts at market reforms. They held a consultative meeting to map out plans for legislation earlier in the day.Lee Jang-woo, the spokesman for the ruling party, called the agreement “belated but extremely fortuitous.” Lee urged “active” participation from the opposition party. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, expressed regret, saying that there is still a long road ahead for the agreement. Led by the tripartite commission head Kim Dae-hwan, the top negotiators from each side -- the FKTU head Kim, Korea Employer’s Federation head Park Byoung-won and the Labor Minister Lee Ki-kwon -- have tried to draw a compromise on the reform plan since the labor union returned to the three-way dialogue in late August. The negotiations faced a number of hurdles, with the trade union fiercely opposing the government’s plan to ease restrictions on dismissing underperforming workers and give companies more discretion to change their rules without union approval.The talks among management, labor and government came in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms, a top priority on her policy agendas in the second half of this year. The government has vowed to implement the reforms within this year, even without workers’ approval, to inject flexibility in what it has called “rigid” labor market.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visits a construction site for a power plant, the Rodong Sinmun reported on Monday. (Yonhap)Observers say that the North’s increasingly harsh criticism of Park’s efforts for reunification could hurt the emerging mood for cross-border dialogue and further raise uncertainties for her “peninsular trust-building” policy.The communist regime’s denunciation grew more acrimonious after Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping held summit talks in Beijing on Sept. 2, where she reiterated that early reunification of the peninsula would contribute to regional peace and prosperity.Last Saturday, Pyongyang described Park’s request for Beijing’s support for her reunification initiative as “disgusting begging” for getting “foreign forces’ consent” for what it called Seoul’s plot to unify the two Koreas’ political systems.“The South would end up damaging the emerging mood for stability and improvement in cross-border relations as the South intensifies its diplomacy to depend on foreign forces to realize its delusion for reunification,” the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s Workers’ party, said in a commentary titled “Seoul’s unification diplomacy that foments distrust and confrontation.”Seoul officials said that as Pyongyang has remained reluctant to discuss its denuclearization and participate in the efforts to lay the groundwork for reunification, applying more pressure on the regime was inevitable.Yet, analysts say that Seoul should pay more attention to guiding the unification discourse in a direction that promotes the peaceful coexistence of the two Koreas, rather than indicating that the North would be absorbed into the South’s democratic system.“Pyongyang appears to believe, as it did in the past, that Seoul’s policy aims to encourage a regime collapse and pursue the unification of the peninsula by absorbing the North into South Korea’s governing system,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification.“For genuine bilateral dialogue to occur, one should recognize the other side. Who would be willing to build trust with the one seemingly pursuing the demise of the other side? Creating the image that the South regards the North as a genuine partner for dialogue and cooperation is important for now.”Park Hyeong-jung, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, noted that the North’s toughened rhetoric against Park’s reunification drive reflects its increasing discontentment over its diplomatic isolation. “President Park’s diplomacy for reunification could also be seen by the North as a strategy to further isolate the communist regime and to pressure it to give up its nuclear ambitions,” said researcher Park. “When its relations with China seem to remain shaky, Park’s discussions with Xi over reunification might well strike a sour note in the North.” Seoul’s stepped-up diplomacy to encourage Pyongyang to return to the denuclearization talks is likely to aggravate friction with Pyongyang, observers said, noting that despite the friction, the North might take more caution as it needs to improve ties with Seoul to ease its isolation.Seoul’s top nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kuk is now in the U.S. to hold talks this week with the top envoys of the member nations of the U.N. Security Council and his U.S. counterpart Sung Kim to discuss multilateral efforts to pressure the North to give up its nuclear program.Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul will deliver a plenary speech Tuesday at the ongoing general meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria. During the speech, he is to call for international cooperation and support for the South’s efforts to denuclearize the North.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","toughened rhetoric against park reunification ,rhetoric against president park geun ,north toughened rhetoric against park ,deepening isolation north korean leader ,president park diplomacy for reunification","['North Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'Park ’s', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'the North ’s Workers ’', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'South Korea ’s', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification', 'Hyeong - jung', 'the Korea Institute for National Unification', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'China', 'Park ’s', 'Xi', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Joon - kuk', 'U.S.', 'the U.N.

But he noted the saying ``Trust, but verify'' and added, ``Why don't you give us this assurance?''    The CTBT organization has 196 member states _ 183 that have signed the treaty and 164 that have ratified it. But the treaty has not entered into force because it still needs ratification by eight countries involved in originally negotiating it: Iran, Israel, Egypt, India, Pakistan, North Korea, the United States and China.    If Iran ratifies the treaty, Zerbo said, it would create the conditions in the Middle East for easier ratifications, potentially by Egypt, and would be an essential element for the ultimate goal of creating a nuclear weapon-free zone in the region.    While waiting for the CTBT to enter into force, the organization has spent more than $1 billion on an international monitoring system that can detect a nuclear test by Iran or any other country, Zerbo said. It detected all three tests by North Korea.    The system uses four technologies _ 170 seismic stations to pick up shock waves from any underground explosion, ``hydro-acoustic'' monitoring to pick up anything that happens underwater, 48 ``infrasound'' stations to detect low-frequency waves in the atmosphere that can travel long distances, and 80 ``radionucleide'' stations to sample the air for radiation, which Zerbo called ``the smoking gun.''    The highly sophisticated monitoring systems can also detect earthquakes, tsunamis, air contamination, the movement of whales and the trajectory of space launches, as well as meteors including the ones in Russia in February 2013 and over Thailand on Sept. 7, he said.

Security Council member states.From New York, the chief envoy to the stalled six-party talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program will travel to Washington, where he is due to meet his U.S. counterpart, Ambassador Sung Kim, on Wednesday.   Efforts to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table have gained momentum since President Park Geun-hye and her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, issued a joint call last week for the swift resumption of ""meaningful"" six-way talks. The two leaders also warned North Korea against further provocations that could raise tensions in the region.Before its suspension in late 2008, the forum aimed to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for economic and political concessions. The other members are Russia and Japan.Speaking during a parliamentary audit of the Foreign Ministry Thursday, Hwang dismissed views that Washington has been reluctant about restarting negotiations.""The U.S., like us, is making various efforts for the resumption of the six-party talks ... and has said on numerous occasions that it is willing to hold talks with the North,"" he said. ""However, North Korea is currently refusing any sort of dialogue on the nuclear issue, not only with the U.S., but also China, which was once considered its closest partner.""Earlier this week, Xiao Qian, China's deputy envoy to the forum, visited South Korea for talks with his counterpart, Kim Gunn.North Korea's nuclear program is expected to be high on the regional agenda in the coming weeks.

Diplomatic missions in Japan have also carried out a variety of public diplomacy efforts,” he said during a parliamentary audit.“Along with our public diplomacy toward the U.S., we also think of public diplomacy toward Japan’s neighboring countries. In this respect, the public diplomacy division to be instituted within the ministry will have a big role to play.”Japanese conservatives’ revisionist views of history that apparently gloss over the country’s wartime atrocities, and Tokyo’s pursuit of a greater military role have caused security concerns among some in Korea, and continue to worsen public resentment toward Japan, Korea’s onetime colonizer.On a separate issue, the Foreign Ministry was criticized for giving more than 100 billion won ($83.75 million) of official development assistance to Colombia, Peru and Azerbaijan whose per-capita gross national income is nearly $8,000 each.Rep. Kim Sung-gon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said that the ministry should be more prudent in its execution of the ODA, and that the taxpayers’ money for the ODA should be spent on combating poverty and promoting sustainable development for underdeveloped nations.“ODA should basically be given to the poorest or most vulnerable nations including conflict-laden states given the basic humanitarian nature of the assistance,” he said in a statement. “The support for the middle-income nations should be given in the form of technological assistance.”Also during the parliamentary audit on the ministry, Rep. Lee Joo-young of the ruling Saenuri Party said that ministry employees delivered unpermitted lectures outside on 541 occasions for some four years, and that such lectures violated rules and regulations governing the civil servants’ code of conduct.Lee said state auditors found that ministry officials gave lectures on 267 occasions without permission between 2011 and 2014.

Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who leads its project on security and terrorism, singled out “loose nukes” as the “first and foremost” crisis that may break out following a sudden collapse of the Kim Jong-un regime, referring to poorly guarded atomic devices, fissile materials or related know-how feared to fall into the wrong hands. The term was initially coined after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompted concerns that its stockpile of thousands of nuclear warheads and uranium and plutonium may tempt terrorists, criminals or other illicit organizations, though its successor managed to block their sale. “But if there’s any North Korean regime collapse, then the individuals who might get possession of those nuclear weapons or nuclear material would have far less reason not to sell them, not to use them for very short-term purposes,” Pape said in an interview with The Korea Herald on the sidelines of the Seoul Defense Dialogue hosted by the Defense Ministry here. “In a general anarchy against all, it’s much more uncertain and much more dangerous what will happen to the nuclear materials and any nuclear weapons that were fashioned.” Robert Pape, a professor and director of the University of Chicago’s project on security and terrorism. (Defense Ministry)Given their respective high stakes and interests in the North Korean arsenal, Seoul, Washington and Beijing can best deal with it through a cooperative framework, the international security expert said, adding that without them tightly working with each other, there may be a “real mess” in the future. “Whether it is an institution, if you would, or a set of arrangements about how these three countries are really going to act in unstable circumstances, I think that set of arrangements could be highly secret; there’s no reason why they have to become public,” he said. “But there’s really no sign at the moment that there has been anything like this serious kind of military-to-military talks that would be needed to deal with that.”A trilateral mechanism, on the summit level if possible, could also help them better manage a potential contingency resulting from Pyongyang’s downfall than their existing ritual of consecutive bilateral talks, Pape said.Though skyrocketing tensions pushed the two Koreas to the verge of an armed clash last month, a real catastrophe is likely to bring a “true shock of unforeseen consequences” akin to a collapse of the stock market yet in more diverse facets of society, he noted. “(With) the most complex issues involved, the three most interested parties don’t talk to each other. Not in enough detail, they’re talking in pairs, but not talking altogether,” the professor said.“In a crisis to take a life of their own, there are much bigger either economic shockwaves, military shockwaves or political shockwaves that even after a couple of weeks we can’t stop. That’s a more worrisome way in which things could really get out of control with the North Korean collapse.” Acknowledging President Park Geun-hye’s recent trip to Beijing and her increasingly close partnership with her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, however, Pape pinned high hopes on his upcoming journey and summit with U.S. President Barack Obama. The meeting will set the stage for their dialogue on the North Korea issue, which he believes is “at the center of future strategic cooperation” between the three nations. “Given the conflict in the South China Sea and building of islands, I think that if Presidents Obama and Xi could actually have a similar dialogue (to that which) Presidents Xi and Park had on North Korea, this will be a good thing,” he said. “It could possibly set up three-way discussions down the road, because there is an opportunity of a potential military chaos to be managed in a real way as opposed to just talking about it.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korean nuclear weapons to terrorist ,north korean collapse acknowledging president ,plutonium may tempt terrorists criminals ,nuclear weapons to terrorist ,any north korean regime collapse","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'Robert Pape', 'the University of Chicago', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Soviet Union', 'north korean', 'Pape', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Robert Pape', 'the University of Chicago ’s', 'defense', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Pape', 'Koreas', 'north korean', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Pape', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'North Korea', 'Xi', 'Presidents Xi', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",16,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.51623815  0.32583925

As the Seoul Defense Dialogue kicked off, the participants explored possible scenarios of the unification, from a “soft landing” based on a mutual consent, to a “hard landing” involving an abrupt fall of the Kim Jong-un regime or possibly another armed conflict. They also discussed the role of the U.S., China and other key players in establishing durable peace, and potential shifts in the regional security architecture that will follow the unification. “The unification process may be coming up suddenly, without any notification and expectation,” said former Japanese Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto who now teaches at Takushoku University in Tokyo. “But whatever the scenario will be coming up, we have to respect and put priority on (the idea) that the future prospect and picture of a new unified Korea should be made by decision by both Korean people exclusively. We should not interfere, cannot do so.”  Participants listen to Vice Defense Minister Baek Seung-joo‘s opening remarks at the Seoul Defense Dialogue in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Under the theme, “70 years of the Post-WWII Era and the Division of Korea,” the vice-ministerial conference is also scheduled to examine pressing security challenges, such as cybersecurity, maritime conflicts, health, terrorism and nuclear proliferation. Hosted by Seoul’s Defense Ministry, the annual event is its fourth edition and ends Friday. Other attendees include Vice Defense Minister Baek Seung-joo, Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong, Martin Libicki, a professor at the RAND Graduate School in the U.S., and Robert Pape, a security and terrorism expert at the University of Chicago. David Helvey, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia and visiting scholar at the National Defense University’s Institute for National Strategic Studies in Washington, said last week’s spike in cross-border tension, including an exchange of fire, again underscored the deep-rooted source of instability spanning 70 years of division. While any unification process has to be built on the wishes and consent of the two Koreas, the U.S., as a “good friend and ally” of the South, will need to work on reshaping external security conditions following their merger, in line with perceived shifts in the balance of the power, he noted. “(Efforts) to have an inclusive multilateral security architecture has been limited in Northeast Asia,” Helvey said. “It requires the willingness of all parties to make a binding commitment on hard security issues, not just to deal with the soft stuff. In the absence of such commitments, this type of structures cannot effectively serve the constraints on major powers.” Edmond Mulet, assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations at the U.N., called for greater regional dialogue and collaboration to better tackle security challenges, whether conventional and emerging, including the North Korean nuclear issue. “The division of the Korean Peninsula is a cause for contemplation of the enduring challenges to peace and security. Today, this division continues to cause concern and uncertainty for international peace and security and for a region ― East Asia ― which has been in the past decades economically most vibrant,” he said in his keynote speech. “It is my conviction that regional integration is one of the most effective ways to respond to current peace and security challenges. I am convinced that this is one of the avenues to explore for East Asia.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","dialogue in seoul on thursday ,250 top defense policymakers ,30 countries on thursday stressed ,friday other attendees include vice ,in seoul on thursday yonhap","['Koreas', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.', 'China', 'japanese', 'Satoshi Morimoto', 'Takushoku University', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Defense', 'Baek Seung - joo‘s', 'Seoul', 'the Post - WWII era', 'the Division of Korea', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Baek Seung - joo', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'Martin Libicki', 'the RAND Graduate School', 'U.S.', 'Robert Pape', 'the University of Chicago', 'David Helvey', 'U.S.', 'the National Defense University ’s Institute for National Strategic Studies', 'Washington', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'Edmond Mulet', 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.27188626  0.54594201

""Eliminating nuclear weapons is a top priority for the United Nations. No other weapon has the potential to inflict such wanton destruction on our world.""Mulet stressed that, ""An effective response to today's threat is only collective action, coordinated across regions and globally,"" calling for global partnership in keeping peace worldwide.Since its establishment 70 years ago, the U.N. has carried out 71 peacekeeping operations on four continents, 16 of them still active, the assistant secretary-general said.A total of 120 countries have sent 105,000 uniformed personnel and other equipment to the U.N. missions.

(Yonhap)“The increase in defense spending for next year is 4 percent, higher than the 3 percent increase of total government spending for next year.” The defense budget proposal focused on strengthening deterrence against the North, which has ratcheted up military tensions by conducting an ejection test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile in May 2014 and a set of provocations along the border last month.The government set aside 11.68 trillion won for its budget to improve overall defense capabilities, an increase of 6.1 percent from a year ago. In particular, it earmarked more than 3 trillion won to strengthen frontline defense around the Demilitarized Zone, marking an increase of 40.6 percent from the previous year. The money is to be spent on bolstering artillery detection radars, drone-based surveillance capabilities and striking assets such as K-9 self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers.The government hopes to spend 1.67 trillion won, an increase of 5.4 percent from a year ago, on antisubmarine capabilities. Last month, the North, in a “quasi-state of war,” mobilized a massive fleet of submarines, showing off its underwater warfare capabilities.Also noteworthy in the budget plan is a spike in the expenditure for constructing the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Kill Chain preemptive strike architecture that will form the basis of Seoul’s capabilities to counter Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear threats.For the KAMD and Kill Chain programs, Seoul set aside 1.5 trillion won, an increase of 64.5 percent from the previous year. “We increased the budget to speed up the construction of the Kill Chain and KAMD to respond to North Korea’s asymmetric military threats and to bolster our defense of frontline outposts through enhancing key assets such as mid-range guided weapons,” Baek said.To continue the efforts to lay the groundwork for peaceful unification, Seoul pledged to focus on the restoration of the Gyeongwon railroad which in the past ran from Seoul to North Korea’s eastern city of Wonsan, and on the construction of the infrastructure for inter-Korean economic cooperation and exchanges.For the railroad project, Seoul set aside 150.8 billion won. It also earmarked 32.4 billion won for the construction of a DMZ peace park and 66.6 billion won for enhancing the infrastructure for the inter-Korean industrial park in the North Korean border city of Gaeseong.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","year defense budget an increase ,95 trillion won 32 billion ,budget plan on wednesday yonhap ,for next year defense budget ,north korea recent provocations and","['Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Baek Seung - joo', 'the National Assembly', 'Baek Seung - joo', 'k-9', 'the Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'KAMD', 'Seoul', 'KAMD', 'North Korea ’s', 'Baek', 'Seoul', 'Gyeongwon', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Wonsan', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'DMZ', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Gaeseong', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61949497  0.42874813

Tensions had escalated sharply since then before the countries reached a last-ditch agreement on Aug. 25 to pull back their combat postures and pursue dialogue.""I think we relearned and reaffirmed that our efforts to strengthen this alliance are important, readiness is important and we demonstrated that,"" Lt. Gen. Bernard Champoux, the commanding general of the Eighth U.S. Army, said in a lecture at a local meeting of ROTC veterans. As tensions spiraled last month, South Korea and the U.S. leveled up their WATCHCON threat alert system to guard against a growing threat of attacks by North Korea, with the U.S. vowing to send its powerful B-52 Stratofortress bombers.""I think North Korea has also learned something and I think the two-plus-two talks were so successful,"" he said, referring to the inter-Korean talks attended by two high-level officials each from the countries. The unpredictable nature and the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction by North Korea present ""a real threat"" throughout the Asian region, Champoux said, vowing to beef up the South Korea-U.S. alliance as a deterrent against North Korea's potential provocations. ""The North Korean government continues to steer the reclusive nation down the self-destructive path to the development of weapons of mass destruction,"" Champoux said.

The North could also be replacing contaminated equipment from the 5 MWe Reactor and moving it to the reprocessing complex for storage or decontamination, it said.The graphite-moderated reactor has been the source of weapons-grade plutonium for the communist nation. The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods which, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make one bomb a year.The reactor has provided Pyongyang with weapons-grade plutonium that the regime used in its three nuclear tests conducted in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

That's why the North bristled strongly at South Korea's resumption last month of loudspeaker broadcasts along the border and even fired artillery shells into the South.Under a landmark peace agreement, however, the South later suspended the border broadcasts in exchange for the North expressing regret over injuries South Korean soldiers sustained from an explosion of land mines planted in the demilitarized zone by the North.Royce called for changes in the North.""It is our hope that North Korea will have a change in attitude.

Moon Jae-in on Tuesday met with representatives of the country’s large businesses, praising their commitment to inter-Korean exchanges in a rare visit seemingly aimed at underscoring his security initiatives and assuaging the business community.In his first-ever visit to the Federation of Korea Industry, South Korea’s biggest business lobby group, the chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy expressed his endorsement to the FKI’s recent initiative to foster economic exchanges between the two Koreas and hailed it as a way to thaw icy relations. “I’d like to applaud the group’s efforts to improve inter-Korea relations through economic cooperation,” said Moon. “If the government takes the lead to pave the way for economic cooperation, it will give us an opportunity to expand our economy and find a new opportunity for growth.”NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in (left) shakes hands with Federation of Korea Industry chairman Huh Chang-soo. YonhapObservers said the meeting was a rare occasion where the interests of both the NPAD and the FKI converge. The progressive NPAD has been clashing with business leaders over its attempt to increase corporate taxes and opposition to various reform measures of the labor market. Last month, Moon announced an initiative titled “New economic map on the Korean peninsula,” in an apparent step to secure an upper hand in the security agenda popular during elections. The parliamentary elections are set for next April. The roadmap outlines plans to form a single economic entity of the two Koreas that leads to regional economic cooperation in Northeast Asia.FKI, for its part, has also shown interest in the inter-Korean economic cooperation. Last July, the FKI laid out its own initiative to strengthen economic ties with the North and use it as a way to jump-start the sluggish economy that is frequently dented by cross-border military tensions. “We need to create a situation where both the South and the North reap benefits,” FKI chairman Huh Chang-soo said. “Once we deepen economic ties (with the North), the impact from political and military tensions could be lessened,” Huh said. The NPAD has been pushing to reform Korea’s family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, whose governance and business practices have been blamed for the nation’s stagnant economy.Even during the meeting with the FKI, the NPAD’s staunch floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul did not shy away from stressing the need for reform.“Marginal businesses (companies with an interest coverage ratio below 100 percent for three consecutive years) are becoming the source of a ‘Korea Discount,’” Lee said, adding that past practices of a workout or injecting public money will fall short of recovering them.Experts described Moon’s attendance as an approach to win over independent voters whose political allegiance might vary depending on different political agendas, such as economic and security issues. “I believe that Moon’s approach is to attract those voters who are in the middle,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. “As a leader of the main opposition party, Moon needs to learn how to go beyond ideological party lines,” Yoon said.

At the same time, it indicated a desire to avoid acrimony with the unpredictable regime led by Kim Jong-un. China has sidestepped a question on whether Chinese President Xi Jinping held a one-on-one meeting with a senior North Korean official who attended last week's military parade marking the end of World War II.Choe Ryong-hae, secretary of the Central Committee of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, attended the Chinese military parade Thursday, along with about 30 heads of state, including South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Park held a high-profile summit with Xi ahead of the military parade. The Chinese newspaper said North Korea's choice of Choe to attend the military parade came as no surprise. ""At present, the China-North Korea relations are more subtle and delicate, but this should stay controllable,"" the editorial read. ""On the one hand, leaders of China and North Korea have not met. It is an obvious fact,"" it said, but ""friendly relations"" between North Korea and China would make them look for ""the right opportunity."" ""Differences over the nuclear issue have not been avoided, but the understanding of importance of 'China-North Korea friendly relations is not shakeable,"" it said. North Korea is China's only treaty ally, but their political ties remain strained over the North's nuclear ambitions. Kim, the North's young leader, has yet to visit China since taking power in late 2011, following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il.Despite strained political ties, China is North Korea's economic lifeline and diplomatic backer at the United Nations. South Korea and the U.S. have called for China to exert more pressure to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, but Beijing's stance over its ideological ally, Pyongyang, has often been self-contradictory. Many analysts believe that the Chinese Communist Party leadership won't put enough pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions because a sudden collapse of the North's regime could threaten China's own security interests.

The envisioned event, if held, will become the first reunion since February 2014.Long-strained inter-Korean ties have taken a dramatic twist in recent weeks as South and North Korea reached the deal following heightened tension over the North's landmine blasts near the inter-Korean border in early August.There are more than 66,000 South Korean family members separated by the Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving South and North Korea technically at war.The issue of the separated families is one of the most pressing humanitarian matters as most surviving family members are in their 70s and 80s. About half of the around 129,700 applicants for the family reunions have passed away.Since the first historic inter-Korean summit in 2000, the two Koreas have held 19 rounds of face-to-face family reunion events.Seven rounds of video-based reunions also have been held.Only some 18,800 family members from both sides have enjoyed having face-to-face reunions so far.The agenda for the talks mainly focuses on the details of the upcoming reunions, but the South is seeking to discuss other related issues such as holding the family reunions on a regular basis and the confirmation of the fate of all surviving separated families on both sides.President Park Geun-hye said in August that South Korea will send North Korea a list of about 66,000 separated family members to be considered for possible reunions. The North has been silent about Seoul's plan.Experts said inter-Korean ties are likely improving, but there are still dampeners, such as the possibility of a long-range missile launch by North Korea next month.Despite the easing military tension on the Korean Peninsula, there is still a chance that North Korea could make an additional provocation ahead of Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party.

The communist country has a track record of staging provocations against South Korea.The North -- which conducted three nuclear tests -- has repeatedly vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear programs as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington’s hostile policy against it.South Korea “would cooperate with China for a peaceful unification,” Park said. “Various discussions could begin as soon as possible on how to achieve a peaceful unification.” She did not provide a specific time frame.Park made the comments two days after she met with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing and they warned North Korea against conducting a missile or nuclear test.The warning came amid speculation that North Korea may stage a provocation in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of its Workers’ Party.Park has made pitches for unification in recent years, calling it a “bonanza” for South Korea as well as a blessing for neighboring countries.Still, North Korea has long suspected that Seoul could be plotting to absorb Pyongyang, a claim denied by South Korea.The rival Koreas remain technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Until now, the guidelines had stated that transferring as many as five embryos per IVF cycle was encouraged to maximize a patient’s chances of becoming pregnant. However, both overseas and local studies have shown that transferring multiple embryos is associated with a higher risk for low birth weight and premature births. “Preterm delivery and high risk pregnancies can become additional financial burdens to the patients,” said the Health Ministry in a statement explaining its reason for the revision.  (123RF)The number of Koreans who sought medical help for infertility has increased significantly in recent years, from 178,000 in 2007 to 215,000 last year. With more Koreans opting to have children later in life, the number of pregnancies after age 35 is also increasing here, which is considered one of the biggest contributing factors to the rising number of preterm births in the country. The number of premature births has increased dramatically since 2000, from 3.8 percent to 6.5 percent in 2013. In 2013, Korean babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy and which died from premature birth complications accounted for 59.6 percent of the infant mortality rate in the country.Also according to government statistics, 42.2 percent of all Korean mothers who became pregnant after undergoing IVF procedures gave birth to two or more children at a time, while only 2.2 percent of those who conceived naturally experienced the same. The number of multiple births in Korea resulting from IVF procedures is significantly higher than in other countries, including the U.S. at 30.5 percent, Canada at 23.8 percent and Germany at 21.7 percent. While Korea’s latest revision states that all medical experts should not transfer more than three embryos at a time, some overseas countries, such as Sweden and New Zealand, do not encourage the transfer of more than two embryos for a single IVF procedure. A study by University of Bristol, which analyzed 124,148 IVF cycles, found that transferring three embryos in fact resulted in a lower birth rate than transferring two in younger women and made no difference in outcomes for older women. In the U.S., 60 percent of IVF-related twin deliveries were preterm, compared to 11 percent of single deliveries from single-fetus pregnancies, according to the country’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","vitro fertilization discouraging medical professionals ,multiple births in korea resulting ,2013 korean babies born before ,premature birth complications accounted for ,korean mothers who became pregnant","['South Korea ’s', 'Health Ministry', 'IVF', 'the Health Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'korean', 'IVF', 'Korea', 'IVF', 'U.S.', 'Canada', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Sweden', 'New Zealand', 'IVF', 'University of Bristol', 'IVF', 'U.S.', 'IVF', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Claire Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43341357  0.61952263

The negotiations at the truce village of Panmunjom lasted for more than 40 hours and led to a breakthrough deal in inter-Korean ties.  After trading artillery shells over the DMZ on Aug. 20, the North put its military on war footing and threatened an all-out war with the South, sharply increasing inter-Korean tensions.  The Aug. 25 deal brought the two sides back to peace-time mode, having elicited an expression of ""regret"" from North Korea on the blast of land mines which maimed two South Korean soldiers in early August and was blamed on the communist country.  The drone flight was presumed to be aimed at monitoring the posture of the South Korean military along the border as the two countries maintained top-level military alert.  At that time, the South Korean military detected the appearance of the drone through its low altitude surveillance radar and an Air Force surveillance system, but failed to intercept it, according to the sources.   The military issued its antiaircraft alert, 'Hedgehog' and sent an AH-1S Cobra attack helicopter and an Air force fighter jet to track down the drone, yet without success, the sources noted. The North Korean drone presumably returned home safely.  ""Even in the DMZ area, any North Korean soldier or vehicles that crossed the military demarcation line are immediately subject to warning shots or artillery fire,"" one of the sources said, stressing that Seoul would be more prepared to deal with infiltration of North Korean drones.  Confirming the uninterrupted flight, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said traces of an unknown vehicle were detected by radar on several occasions from Aug. 22-24, but the military's capacity to hit it was ""limited"" because the radar detected and lost it repeatedly.

The South should not forget this even a moment,"" he said.   The North expressed ""regret"" over the land mine explosion that left two South Korean soldiers seriously injured. South Korea has said that the North's regret is the equivalent of an apology by international standards.  But the North made it clear that its expression of ""regret"" does not equal an ""apology"" for the incident, saying that the South is interpreting the meaning of the word to its own advantage.  The North said that ""regret"" is no more than an expression saying ""I am sorry for the case.""  ""Nothing will be more shameless than trumpeting about the implementation of the agreement while staging saber-rattling,"" the spokesman said.  North Korea warned that at a critical time when the landmark deal should be cherished, South Korea has continued to make comments that could hamper inter-Korean ties.  ""Given that the two Koreas barely warned off a possible war, South Korea should neither wrongfully interpret the agreement nor pose a threat to peace,"" the spokesman said.  The Ministry of Unification did not rebut the North's claim while stressing that the two sides should pump up efforts to honor the agreement.  ""Now is not the time to argue for and against, but it is the time that the two Koreas should jointly make sincere efforts to implement the agreement,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.  Experts said that the timing of the North's warning message coincided with President Park Geun-hye's visit to China.   Park arrived in Beijing earlier in the day for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of a high-profile ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of China's victory over Japan in World War II.  It would be the sixth such meeting between the two leaders while Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have not met so far.  ""The North's warning seemed to mean that Park should refrain from making any comments on unification and Seoul should not set the stumbling block to the joint deal,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.  Analysts also said that the North's message is likely to have a limited impact on inter-Korean ties, adding that Pyongyang would not go so far as to break the deal.  ""It does not seem that North Korea would move to break the agreement. The North's message is seen as calling on Seoul to take actions to deter its activists' launch of anti-Pyongyang leaflet campaign,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies under Seoul National University.

The Red Cross suggested through a border telephone channel for the two sides to meet at the House of Peace in the southern part of the truce village of Panmunjeom. “In the message, we offered to meet at Panmunjeom in line with the high-level agreement to discuss issues regarding separated families including the Chuseok reunions,” ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said at a news briefing. Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee speaks during a press briefing on Friday. YonhapThe South’s Red Cross has already set out to confirm the whereabouts of more than 66,000 separated family members. According to the Unification Ministry, only 66,292 of the 129,698 South Koreans registered since 1988 remain alive as of July 31, meaning that more than 2,000 have died each year. The two Koreas have held 19 rounds of face-to-face family reunion events so far, with about 2,200 South Koreans, mostly in their 70s, 80s and 90s, reuniting with their relatives in the North.Jeong also took note of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s appreciation of the recent dialogue that pulled the two Koreas back from the brink of an armed clash. “We’re anticipating and urging the North to follow through on the agreement it sealed,” he added. During a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Military Commission, the young ruler touted the agreement as a “pivotal chance to resolve acute military tension and turn around cross-border relations that had faced a ruin into the path of reconciliation and trust,” state media reported Friday. “We’ve shoved dark clouds of war cast over the heads of our people and safeguarded peace and stability in the peninsula by taking the lead in high-level inter-Korean talks and tackling a tinderbox of armed conflict,” the Korean Central Television report said. “We should cherish the agreement, which turned evils into blessings, and cultivate it.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","press briefing on friday yonhapthe ,korean war following recent cross ,round of reunions for families ,korea red cross on friday ,briefing on friday yonhapthe south","['South Korea ’s', 'Red Cross', 'north korean', 'the Unification Ministry', 'the Red Cross', 'the House of Peace', 'Panmunjeom', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'Unification Ministry', 'Jeong Joon - hee', 'YonhapThe South ’s Red Cross', 'the Unification Ministry', 'South Koreans', 'Koreas', 'South Koreans', 'Jeong', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Koreas', 'Workers ’ Party ’s Central Military Commission', 'inter - korean', 'Korean Central Television', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03939177  0.52468669

Under the 2005 agreement, a result of the six-party nuclear talks, the North agreed to abandon its nuclear program in return for political and economic incentives from the South, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia.But the document is now treated as a mere scrap of paper, with the talks deadlocked for nearly seven years. Hwang warned the North not to throw cold water on the nascent dialogue mood amid reports that the unpredictable country may fire a long-range rocket or conduct another nuclear test around October.The envoy said Beijing would not blindly patronize Pyongyang any more.""Since President Xi Jinping took power, in particular, China-North Korea ties have been changing in quality because of the nuclear issue.""The latest inter-Korean military crisis has highlighted not only the strength of the South Korea-U.S. alliance but also a shift in North Korea-China relations, he added.China used to blame both Koreas for tensions on the peninsula, including when the North launched a series of deadly attacks on the South in 2010.China took a bit different stance this time, Hwang said, apparently putting more pressure on the North.

The U.S. Pacific Command in charge of security on the Korean Peninsula told The Korea Herald that the South Korea-U.S. operations plan “has and will continue to evolve” to better handle regional security challenges.“The U.S. Pacific Command regularly reviews and updates operations plans to ensure our joint forces are ready to respond to regional threats and crises,” PACOM said via email.“The joint ROK (Republic of Korea)-U.S. operations plan has and will continue to evolve to enhance readiness and strengthen the ROK-U.S. Alliance’s ability to defend the Republic of Korea and maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula.” Apart from the new plan’s likely emphasis on removing the North’s nuclear arms and other WMDs, it is thought to reflect ongoing changes in the U.S. military structure, troop capacity and strategy. One of the key points, which military experts here pay attention to, is whether the new plan sets the level of U.S. troops to be augmented for a peninsular contingency at the same level under OPLAN 5027.OPLAN 5027 is known to stipulate that the U.S. is to deploy 690,000 troops, and mobilize 160 military vessels and 2,500 aircraft within 90 days of the outbreak of war on the peninsula. Most of the troops are to come from Okinawa, Guam and the U.S. Pacific Command headquartered in Hawaii. Some observers have argued that the massive U.S. troop mobilization under OPLAN 5027 may be unrealistic given that Washington, struggling with budget constraints, has been reducing its ground forces.But Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University, raised the possibility that the allies might have kept the U.S. troop deployment level at the same level as OPLAN 5027 in a “symbolic” move to deter North Korea’s aggression.“Above all, what matters is the psychological warfare against North Korea. Leaving the large figure in the new war plan might have the effect of deterring North Korea’s aggression,” he said. After focusing mostly on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations for more than a decade, the U.S. military has been seen shifting its focus to aerial and naval operations in an apparent move to counter growing China threats.With the force realignment and a shift in military doctrines, the U.S. has sought to reduce its ground forces and employ high-tech operational tools such as long-range precision-strike systems and drones. This might have influenced the formulation of OPLAN 5015, experts said. Touching on the cuts in U.S. troops, Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at RAND Corp., noted the need for South Korea to step up efforts to maintain its troop level that could decrease due to ongoing demographic changes.“All U.S. military forces have been reducing in size. The smaller U.S. Army and Air Force, in particular, have fewer personnel to send to any contingency,” he said. “But in fairness, the ROK Army has been reducing about as rapidly as the U.S. Army, and will accelerate its reduction in personnel over the next 10 years.” Seoul and Washington were working to formulate OPLAN 5015 in line with their preparations for the transfer of wartime operational control, which was slated for December 2015. Due to North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats, the transfer has been delayed and is expected to take place in the 2020s.

The remarks came as speculations grew that the two Koreas would open discussion on contentious issues including the inter-Korean summit and the lifting of Seoul’s economic sanctions against Pyongyang. Amid lingering doubts on North Korea‘s attitude, a senior North Korean official made a reconciliatory remark that Pyongyang would make efforts to improve the inter-Korean ties based on a breakthrough deal reached Tuesday.“Based on the spirit of the urgent high-level contact between the North and South, we will work actively to improve North-South relations, in line with the aim and wish of our people,” said Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department through the North’s Korean Central Broadcasting Station.  An anchorwoman with the North`s Korean Central Broadcasting Station delivers remarks by Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department, on inter-Korean ties on Thursday. (Yonhap)The two Koreas reached a dramatic deal with the North expressing “regret” over the Aug. 4 land mine attack that injured two South Korean soldiers and the South agreeing to stop the propaganda broadcasts that had been restarted in retaliation. The two sides also agreed to hold another round of talks in Seoul or Pyongyang in the near future. Kim was one of the two North Korean officials that took part in the high-level talks.Cautioning against blind optimism, another presidential official said on condition of anonymity that the first test for North Korea’s sincerity would be the arrangement of the reunions of separated families next month.“For the time being, we have to solve the issue of the reunions of separated families first,” the official was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency.“There are not just a couple of issues that need to be solved to improve the relations, and we need to tackle them one by one,” the official said, adding that it is premature to talk about lifting the May 24 sanctions.The comment came a day after the Unification Ministry said it was open to discussing the sanctions that the North has been seeking to be lifted. The ministry later explained that Seoul’s position remains unchanged, stressing that Pyongyang should take responsible measures first.On May 24, 2010, the South Korean government banned all inter-Korean cooperation, except for those within the joint industrial complex in the border town of Gaeseong. The measures were taken in retaliation for Pyongyang’s sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March of that year.Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae convened a National Security Council session to discuss follow-up measures on the agreements. The meeting, presided over by Park’s top security officer Kim Kwan-jin, was the first session held after the marathon talks. The two Koreas agreed to defuse military tensions and take a series of measures, including increased civilian exchanges between the sides.The members of the presidential security council intensively discussed the planned reunions of separated families on when the meeting should be taken and how, Park’s spokesman said. The two Koreas are set to hold Red Cross talks early next month to stage the reunions around the Chuseok holidays beginning Sept. 27.However, it remains unclear whether or not North Korea will keep its word, observers say, listing previous cases of the reclusive regime canceling events in unilateral decisions.Pyongyang had agreed to hold a reunion event for six days starting Sept. 25, 2013, accepting Park’s proposal delivered during a speech on the Aug. 15 Liberation Day holiday. But the North canceled the event in a last-minute decision on Sept. 21.Speculation is also growing that the reclusive state might take another provocative action around Oct. 10 to mark the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","north korea over recent agreements ,korean ties on thursday yonhap ,korea over recent agreements ,korea over recent agreements on ,korean official made reconciliatory remark","['korean', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'North and South', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'the North ’s United Front Department', 'the North ’s Korean Central Broadcasting Station', 'the north`s Korean Central Broadcasting Station', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'the North ’s United Front Department', 'inter - korean', 'Koreas', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'Gaeseong', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'National Security Council', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Koreas', 'Park ’s', 'Koreas', 'Red Cross', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Park ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58368599  0.82969701

South Korea's military also took flak for not being able to keep track of North Korea's submarine fleet, which sailed out to sea as the tensions reached their peak.The finance minister said that while Seoul will allocate more funds to building up the military's capabilities, it wants to push forward projects that can expand ties with the North. ""Efforts will be made to build the DMZ peace park and re-link the Gyeongwon rail line connecting Seoul with the North Korean port of Wonsan,"" he said. The peace park plan is a pet project of President Park Geun-hye, who proposed its creation as a means to ease tensions between the two sides that are still technically at war. The Korean War (1950-53) ended in an armistice with no official peace treaty being signed.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, said the government will do its utmost to maintain a balance between revenue and spending, but it will pursue an expansionary fiscal policy stance for 2016 to keep growth momentum alive.In light of criticism that the government has been overly optimistic about growth forecasts in the past few years, measures will be taken to be more conservative in outlook, so as not to incur revenue shortfalls next year, he said. Higher growth projections have led government planners to anticipate more taxes, but underperformance has led to a drop in state earnings, which forced Seoul to ask lawmakers for an extra budget this year.

(Yonhap)The union officials entrusted Kim Dong-man, head of the FKTU, with the authority to decide when to return to the bargaining table. The three-way talks had stalled, with the FKTU walking out of the negotiations in protest of some contentious issues including deregulation of lay-offs and changes to recruitment rules. “I will not accept any government plans that make lay-offs easier and enable changes to the recruitment guidelines,” Kim said at the meeting, vowing to reflect the labor bloc’s demands in the decision making process at the three-way dialogue. Unionists have maintained that the government‘s proposals for labor market reform would only benefit employers, giving them greater leeway to fire underperforming workers and change company rules in their favor without union approval.Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kwon welcomed the decision. “I expect the three-way talks to operate as soon as possible to draw a grand compromise,” he said in a statement. The FKTU’s decision came at an executive meeting attended by 52 key union officials a week after a similar meeting broke down in the face of fierce resistance from radical union members. Some 100 unionists under the FTKU went as far as to block the meeting from taking place by staging a sit-in, claiming that the return itself could be seen as supporting the government’s plan. The union’s decision to return to dialogue came amid mounting pressure from the Labor Ministry that pledged to push for a market revamp without the union if it continued to boycott the negotiations. The ruling Saenuri Party also recently urged the union to resume the talks, claiming that it was only protecting the interests of the top 10 percent of salaried workers in Korea, while ignoring the other 90 percent, as well as unemployed youths. In preparation for the three-way talks, the government also urged Kim Dae-hwan, head of a tripartite committee of labor, management and government representatives to return to his post. He had offered to resign in April, taking responsibility for the breakdown of the three-way discussions.The government’s beefed-up efforts to resume the talks come in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms to inject flexibility into what she calls a rigid labor market.Park put the labor market at the core of structural reforms in the second half of this year, viewing it as key to boosting the nation’s slowing economy and generating jobs for the young. The trilateral committee will consist of three representatives from the FKTU, three from business circles, three from the labor-related ministries and six labor experts. The FKTU’s return raised fresh hopes for President Park’s reform drive, but the outlook remains bleak due to persistent clashes over the extent of the overhaul between the government and the labor circle. Putting aside contentious issues, the committee will likely focus on discussing agreeable items such as reductions of working hours, alleviating the polarization between regular and irregular workers, the scope of wages used to calculate benefits and adoption of the peak wage system. In order to facilitate the three-way framework, the labor minister, the heads of the FKTU, the employers’ association and the trilateral committee plan to hold meetings to adjust the schedule of the talks, sources said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","stalled trilateral negotiations among labor ,collapsed in early april yonhap ,hopes for president park reform ,key union officials week after ,the long stalled trilateral negotiations","['South Korea ’s', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Kim Dong - man', 'Kim', 'Labor', 'Lee Ki - kwon', 'ftku', 'the Labor Ministry', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Dae - hwan', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3153961   0.48056477

The decision coincides with the North’s ongoing reinstatement of submarines, air cushion vehicles, 76.2-milimeter artillery guns and other firearms and gunners. Seoul, in turn, ceased its anti-Pyongyang loudspeaker broadcasts along the Military Demarcation Line on Tuesday.In particular, nearly half of the 50 underwater vehicles, which were presumed to have had left their bases over the past week and thus made it difficult for the South to locate, appear to have returned, a military source noted. The number of absent vessels was unprecedented, amounting to 70 percent of the communist state’s submarine fleet, officials have said. “As the North is taking demilitarization steps since it revoked the ‘quasi-state of war,’ we are adjusting our readiness in accordance with the changing levels of the North’s threats,” a Joint Chiefs of Staff official told reporters, asking anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. “Various movements are taking place chiefly in the frontline areas.” With the South Korea-U.S. joint annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise underway, however, the North will likely maintain a slightly higher alert than usual at least until its conclusion on Friday, the official noted. The allies were also expected to downgrade their current Watch Condition level 2 shortly, based on the North’s activities. “The North typically adopts increased readiness during the UFG compared with normal time as does the South reciprocally, so we need to wait and see until it’s finished,” he added. In line with the easing tension, North Korean guards patrolling the Joint Security Area within the border village of Panmunjeom have begun carrying handguns again instead of rifles, sources said. The latest signs of de-escalation followed an agreement resulted from grueling negotiations from Saturday to early Tuesday, which pulled back the sides from the brink of armed clash. Since the two Koreas exchanged fire last week amid heightened rows over a recent land mine attack in the Demilitarized Zone by the North and ensuing loudspeaker broadcasts by the South, the Kim Jong-un regime had declared the semi-war state and ratcheted up military threats. In a report submitted to the National Assembly on Wednesday, Seoul’s Defense Ministry pledged to take on more offensive DMZ operations and fine-tune operational readiness to better fend off Pyongyang’s surprise provocations, while making preparations for potential inter-Korean military talks and providing military support for future government-level exchanges.(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","north ongoing reinstatement of submarines ,military demarcation line on tuesday ,koreas exchanged fire last week ,assembly on wednesday seoul defense ,national assembly on wednesday seoul","['Shin Hyon - heeSouth Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'anti - pyongyang', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Watch Condition', 'North ’s', 'UFG', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'DMZ', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'exchanges.(heeshin@heraldcorp.com']",16,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.54629683  0.11877816

The equipment became idle as of noon Tuesday in line with the two Koreas’ agreement earlier in the day. Pyongyang, for its part, expressed regret over a land mine explosion on Aug. 4 that nearly maimed the legs of two South Korean soldiers.The South Korean military had resumed the broadcasts on Aug. 10 in retaliation against the mine provocation. The North instantly responded with fury, firing artillery shells last week near a loudspeaker erected in a western border town, declaring a “quasi-state of war” and forward-stationing offensive assets and troops in full combat readiness.(Yonhap)The apparatus, an apparent source of great sensitivity to the North, had been disassembled and reinstalled according to the relations between the two Koreas since it was introduced in 1962.Before the latest installment, the loudspeakers were pulled out in 2004 as a result of cross-border military dialogue, but were reinstalled in 2010 at 11 spots along the Military Demarcation Line after the communist regime’s deadly sinking of the South’s Cheonan corvette. They were not used at the time. Through them, the South resumed broadcasts of the “Voice of Freedom” show, a rare source of outside news and music for North Korean frontline troops and residents of border regions caged up in the reclusive society. The programs, both before and after the 11-year hiatus, included news of the executions of North Korea’s elite military executives and other power struggles within the top echelons, information about the lives of the South Korean middle class, regional and global issues including human rights and lighter content, such as weather forecasts and music. The program would resonate across the border for three to four hours a day on an irregular basis. Many defectors who resettled in the South have testified that they had first come to know about the South and the outside world through the broadcasts, which can travel as far as 10 kilometers. This means that those walking down the streets of the North Korean border city of Gaeseong may hear the sounds seeping out of the speakers run by the 1st Infantry Division headquartered in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. On Monday afternoon, the broadcast aired nonstop with detailed news of the North’s mine attack and the two Koreas’ exchange of fire, as well as criticism of Kim as a “childish, insecure despot.” “The North Korean army ran away after clandestinely launching a torpedo and plating mines because it knew that it will certainly lose in a head-to-head showdown. It’s sticking to shameful means,” a newscaster said, urging the listeners to “wake up and not to waste their beautiful youth as a slave of the dictatorship.” The program carried four main themes, each aimed at promoting freedom and democracy, illustrating South Korea’s political and economic ascent, recovering national unity and revealing the reality of the regime, according to Seoul’s Defense Ministry. Among the songs most recently played were “Heart” by IU, “Genie” by Girls’ Generation, “Bang Bang Bang” by Big Bang and “Between You and I” by Noh Sa-yeon, officials said. “The content and scripts change every day, though the main topics stay the same,” a ministry official said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “We try to portray as realistically as possible the South Korean middle class and give the North Koreans hopes for peace and prosperity, while dealing with familiar issues such as friends and hometown and introducing our culture and popular K-pop.” (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","year hiatus south korea loudspeaker ,regret over land mine explosion ,firing artillery shells last week ,land mine explosion on aug ,11 year hiatus south korea","['South Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'the "" Voice of Freedom', 'north korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Gaeseong', 'the 1st Infantry Division', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'North ’s', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Genie', 'Bang Bang Bang', 'Big Bang', 'Noh Sa - yeon', 'south korean', 'the North Koreans']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70456547  0.42597294

A peaceful North Korean village in Gaepung, North Hwanghae Province, is seen from South Korea’s frontline area on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Following the four-day talks that stretched into Tuesday morning, Pyongyang offered a rare expression of “regret” in a joint press statement over the injuries inflicted this month on two South Korean troops by the “detonation” of land mines in the Demilitarized Zone.But the statement did not specify what Seoul has repeatedly called a “provocation,” thereby failing to clearly hold Pyongyang responsible for the Aug. 4 attack that led the South to resume propaganda broadcasts on Aug. 10 for the first time in 11 years.  A senior Seoul official said that it was meaningful for Pyongyang to express regret, particularly when the North has been flatly denying responsibility for the attacks. Also noteworthy was that the North engaged in dialogue despite the ongoing South Korea-U.S. military drills, which it berated as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.“If you look at the past statements, it is very rare for the North to specify itself as the very party to express regret. So this, we think, is meaningful,” a senior Seoul official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity.But analysts pointed out that the carefully worded phrase depicts the North as expressing regret as a third party would, and not as a perpetrator.“We could sense some feeling of atonement from North Korea, but the statement also sounded like a third party trying to console the injured soldiers of another country,” said Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification.“What’s worse, the statement has no mention of any recent provocative acts done by the North Korean side,” he added, referring to a set of incidents including the artillery attacks in the tense inter-Korean border last Thursday.Despite multiple provocations by North Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, the reclusive state has expressed regrets or apologies on only a few occasions, without unequivocally recognizing its culpability.In May 1972, the North offered an apology after its spies infiltrated Cheong Wa Dae in January 1968. But it shifted the blame to “extreme leftist elements” in the North. In August 1976, the North expressed regret to the then U.S.-led U.N. Command chief over the so-called ax murder incident in which North Korean soldiers killed two U.S. soldiers who were trimming a tree in the DMZ.In another spy infiltration case in September 1996, the North expressed regret, saying it would try not to allow a reoccurrence. Most recently, the North expressed regret over the 2002 naval skirmish in the West Sea.But the North continues to deny its responsibility for the torpedo attack on the Cheonan warship in March 2010 that killed 46 sailors. For the shelling of Yeonpyeongdo Island in November the same year, which killed four South Koreans, it argues the South triggered the attack by conducting a live-fire drill. To the chagrin of many conservatives here who said Seoul should secure assurances from the North to stop future provocations, the statement failed to include Pyongyang’s pledge to prevent a recurrence of border attacks. The statement, for the time being, declares that the propaganda broadcasts near the Military Demarcation Line will resume in the event of any “abnormal situation.” Officials said such an abnormal situation would be defined by Seoul if it occurs, meaning propaganda broadcasts could be reinstated at any time if the need arises. Considering the history of North Korea using loopholes of inter-Korean deals or multinational pacts to back out of them, how to enforce the agreement is crucial, analysts said.“So far, the two Koreas have always bickered over their past agreements due to their conflicting interpretations of them. Many of the agreements have thus fallen apart or been invalidated,” said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University.“What is crucial for now is not our evaluations on the success of this week’s negotiations, but our efforts to devise ways to effectively enforce the agreement that came out of the talks.” Already, there appeared to be different interpretations, albeit minimal.For instance, Pyongyang’s statement said its quasi-state of war would be lifted at the same time Seoul stopped its propaganda broadcasts. But Seoul’s statement did not have such a condition stated for the lifting of the North’s emergency state.Nonetheless, the agreement appears to have laid basic conditions to restart bilateral cooperation, as it states that the two Koreas will hold working-level talks on a regular basis and activate cross-border exchanges in various civilian sectors, the analysts said.But they noted that a host of pending issues, particularly the North’s nuclear program, would continue to pose hurdles to Seoul’s efforts to fundamentally improve the bilateral relationship.“There are still limits to improving the relations at a time when Seoul and Washington have been increasing pressure on the North to give up its nuclear program. We will also wait and see how the working-level talks unfold in the future,” said Chang of the Institute for Peace and Unification.“With the two Koreas moving to start the talks on separated family reunions, we can mistakenly think that the relationship is fundamentally improving. But there is still a series of structural issues that are left unresolved.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday morning pyongyang offered rare ,korean soldiers killed two soldiers ,korea frontline area on tuesday ,of an armed clash tuesday ,53 korean war the reclusive","['Koreas', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Gaepung', 'South Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Cheong', 'U.N.

""Our military also stopped front-line anti-North loudspeaker broadcasts along the border altogether at the same time,"" the official noted. The Tuesday actions, which followed a breakthrough inter-Korean deal to defuse tension, appear to have put an end to weeks of intense military standoff between the two Koreas. In retaliation for North Korea's land-mine blasts on the southern side of the demilitarized zone, which separates the two countries, the South launched loudspeaker broadcasts critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Aug. 10.Offended by the propaganda warfare, the North fired several artillery shells into South Korea on Aug. 20, prompting the South to fire back with dozens of artillery rounds, which sharply heightened military tensions between them.The North had since declared a ""quasi-state of war,"" bringing both countries to the brink of a full-scale confrontation before a landmark inter-Korean agreement was reached earlier in the day to ease the tension.Starting on Tuesday, North Korea is expected to pull back its troops and other military weapons deployed to the frontline, Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said in a briefing, adding that South Korea will also reduce its military alert posture accordingly which had been raised to the highest level amid the tension. South Korea will not dismantle its loudspeakers at the border since it was not part of the latest inter-Korean agreement, Kim said, suggesting the country may keep the option of propaganda warfare against North Korea.South Korea will also carry out its two upcoming joint military exercises with the U.S., including Ulchi Freedom Guardian, as planned despite North Korea's criticism, the spokesman said.

Other military officials indicated that the return of the submarines could be related with Typhoon Goni that is approaching the Korean Peninsula or the vehicles' insufficient underwater navigation capacity.North Korean submarines can stay underwater up to three days before needing to surface to replenish oxygen, exposing themselves to surveillance.The military officials said they will continue their anti-submarine patrol efforts to guard against any possibility of the North Korean submarines crossing over the Northern Limit Line to the southern side.North Korea is known to operate 77 submarines that are 1,800 tons, 325 tons and 130 tons in size. The country is also believed to have recently built a 2,000-ton submarine that can fire ballistic missiles.North Korea's maneuver was detected hours after the two Koreas reached an agreement on ways to defuse heightened military tension on the peninsula in marathon negotiations.North Korea expressed regret over its land mine attack on the South and promised efforts not to repeat provocations in the agreement, while the South decided to halt its propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts critical of North Korea along the border.

The two Koreas also agreed to hold formal talks to improve their relations in Seoul or Pyongyang “at an early date” and working-level discussions in early September to arrange reunions of separated families in time for the upcoming Chuseok holidays. (Yonhap)The six-point agreement marked a breakthrough following 43-hour marathon negotiations at the border village of Panmunjeom between Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, and Hwang Pyong-so, vice chairman of the North’s National Defense Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the (North) Korean People’s Army, and Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department and a secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee. “We focused on extracting an apology for the land mine provocation and other recent incidents by North Korea as their subject, and a promise to prevent a recurrence, which in fact had resulted in protracted negotiations,” Kim Kwan-jin said at a news conference at Cheong Wa Dae. “But the reason why we ceaselessly called for preventive steps was that without them, there will be another provocation threatening public safety and then again a provocation -- we will not be able to break the vicious cycle.” Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae's National Security Office, speaks at a news conference at the presidential palace on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Under the deal, South Korea will halt loudspeaker broadcasts along the Military Demarcation Line starting 12 p.m. Tuesday, “unless any abnormal situation takes place.” The program was restarted early this month after an 11-year freeze in retaliation for the Aug. 4 explosion of three mines suspected to have been planted by North Korean soldiers who illegally crossed the border. The incident inflicted serious injuries on the legs of two South Korean Army staff sergeants. Though the accord did not stipulate preventive measures, the condition ensures that the broadcasts can be resumed at any time if the communist country stages a provocation in the future, Kim said. The agreement is set to defuse cross-border tension that had hit new highs in recent weeks, with the North forward-stationing offensive weapons and the South engaging in a show of force to deter a potential attack. It will also boost hopes for a long-awaited thaw in inter-Korean relations after the sides have failed to capitalize on rare past momentums, and possibly a summit between President Park Geun-hye and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, though Kim Kwan-jin dismissed it as “premature.”As he took the podium, the former defense minister appeared much tired from the grueling negotiations that kicked off Saturday. Yet he was adamant about Park’s longstanding principle to respond sternly to Pyongyang’s provocations while leaving the door open for dialogue and cooperation, a key thread running through her much-trumpeted “trustpolitik” approach. “Having created tension to gain concessions so far, North Korea must have realized that this will never work with our administration,” Kim added.

(Yonhap)The North Korean delegation reportedly continued to deny its responsibility over the Aug. 4 land mine blast on the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone, while demanding South Korea halt the propaganda broadcasts along the border.Seoul has been maintaining that North Korea must acknowledge and apologize for the blast that seriously injured two South Korean soldiers in order to enter the next step of the negotiation.Reports said that throughout the talks, the delegations took breaks and reported back to their authorities. The North proposed the talks Friday apparently to stall for time after issuing a 48-hour ultimatum the previous day for Seoul to turn off its propaganda loudspeakers, which conservatives here called an “unacceptable, humiliating” demand.Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo represented the South Korean side. Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau, and Kim Yang-gon, a secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party and top official in charge of inter-Korean issues, attended on behalf of the North.The resumption of the dialogue on Sunday afternoon indicated that both sides were willing to defuse tension. The North has been showing sensitive reactions to the South’s propaganda activities along the border aimed at informing North Korean troops and citizens living along the border of the dictatorial nature of the regime. Pyongyang has thus called the propaganda broadcasts a “threat to its (communist) system.” Amid Pyongyang’s denial of responsibility, speculation grew that the two Koreas could form a compromise that would allow the communist regime to express regrets over the land mine incident without specifying its responsibility. Observers say the North might have also demanded during the talks that South Korea and the U.S. stop the ongoing joint military drills, called Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the North has long criticized as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.The agenda was also expected to include Seoul’s demands to exchange the lists of family members separated across the border and hold their reunions. During her Liberation Day speech on Aug. 15, President Park Geun-hye called for the exchange of the lists. Seoul’s Unification Ministry has been seeking to deliver to the North the list of some 60,000 South Korean family members who claim to have their loves ones in the North. Seoul has long viewed the issue as an urgent humanitarian one, but Pyongyang put forward conditions for the family reunions, such as the lifting of the so-called May 24 economic sanctions against it.Meanwhile, Pyongyang’s state media churned out reports to forge the warlike atmosphere on the peninsula, stressing that its troops were ready to fight while repeating their routine criticism of South Korea. Analysts said the reports appeared intended to boost the spirits of the North Korean delegation holding talks with the South.“Eight million adolescents’ hearts are burning with the determination to take revenge (against the South),” a report on the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s Workers’ Party, said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sunday yonhap the north korean ,in downtown seoul sunday yonhap ,after issuing 48 hour ultimatum ,downtown seoul sunday yonhap the ,downtown seoul sunday yonhap","['inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'House of Peace', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'North', 'Seoul', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'south korean', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'north korean', 'General Political Bureau', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'amid Pyongyang ’s', 'Koreas', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Ulchi Freedom Guardian', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'the North ’s Workers ’ Party', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.51099026  0.61100066

One of them is the 35-ton class Gongbang II that can travel at a speed between 74-96 kmph, and the other is the 20-ton class Gongbang III that can travel up to 96 kmph.With the mission to transport special infiltration forces ashore, the air-cushioned vehicle is one of North Korea's three core infiltration assets. The North has also deployed the other two infiltration forces -- submarines and special artillery troops -- near the border as the country followed the quasi-war declaration up with a tougher combat readiness posture.On Friday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared a ""quasi-state of war,"" threatening that the country is prepared to go to ""all-out war"" as inter-Korean military tension has escalated after the two countries exchanged artillery shells over the border a day earlier. As the countries were brought to the brink of a military confrontation, the two Koreas launched rare high-level government talks Saturday to defuse the situation, with no major progress having been reported so far. While the talks continued, the North Korean army has leveled up its combat readiness to match the intensity required under the manual of a semi-war state, one of the sources said.

Though nearly 12 hours has passed since the talks resumed at the border village of Panmunjom, there were no signs the sides are close to agreement.Tensions between the two Koreas began rising after an investigation found that the North secretly planted landmines on the southern side of the border, which exploded and severely injured two South Korean soldiers early this month.The South retaliated by resuming anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts along the border, dealing a blow to one of the sore points for a regime underpinned by the tight control of information. An angered North Korea fired artillery rounds with the South earlier this week, which led to a rare exchange of fire between the two sides.North Korea had threatened to take strong military action unless the South halts the broadcasts and dismantles loudspeaker facilities by Saturday afternoon.

After what they called an “adjournment,” the talks resumed at 3:30 p.m. the same day.The North proposed the talks Friday apparently to stall for time after issuing a 48-hour ultimatum the previous day for Seoul to turn off its propaganda loudspeakers, which conservatives here called an “unacceptable, humiliating” demand.The two sides held “comprehensive discussions on ways to resolve recent incidents and to develop inter-Korean relations for the future,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Min Kyung-wook told reporters after the adjournment.Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo represented the South Korean side, while Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau, and Kim Yang-gon, a secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party and top official in charge of inter-Korean issues, attended the meeting.The resumption of the dialogue on Sunday afternoon indicated that both sides were willing to defuse tension. But they had an intense war of nerves over a set of issues including the Aug. 4 land mine attack that inflicted severe injuries on two South Korean troops and caused the South to resume the propaganda broadcasts.During the talks, the South apparently demanded that the North recognize its responsibility for the land mine provocation, apologize for it, reprimand those who masterminded it and take steps to prevent a recurrence. But Pyongyang has denied responsibility, calling it a “fabrication” -- as it did for the torpedo attack on the South Korean warship Cheonan in 2010 that killed 46 sailors. During the talks, the North Korean side was thought to have demanded that Seoul immediately turn off the loudspeakers that it turned on to resume its propaganda broadcasts on Aug. 10 for the first time in 11 years, in retaliation for the North’s land mine attacks.The North has been sensitive to the South’s propaganda activities along the border aimed at enabling North Korean troops and citizens living along the border to realize the dictatorial nature of the regime. Pyongyang has thus called the propaganda broadcasts a “threat to its (communist) system.” Amid Pyongyang’s denial of its responsibility, speculation grew that the two Koreas could form a compromise that would allow the communist regime to express regrets over the land mine incident without specifying its responsibility.

With negotiations between top Seoul and Pyongyang officials stretching into the second day, the number of North Korean gunners spotted in ready position nearly doubled from Friday, according to military authorities here. The South’s military was also unable to locate about 50 undersea vehicles, or 70 percent of the North’s submarine fleet, which have left their bases. “This is an extremely grave situation,” a senior official at Seoul’s Defense Ministry told reporters, requesting anonymity citing intelligence. “The figure points to the artillerymen who can immediately open fire once they receive an order, not those staying under the tunnels or in their battalions.”Armed South Korean soldiers ride a military vehicle across the Tongil Bridge in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, near the border village of Panmunjeom, where high-level inter-Korean talks were taking place Sunday. (Yonhap)In particular, the movement of North Korean submarines is a critical indicator of provocation that Seoul closely keep tabs on at all times, he noted. The move appears to be designed to seize the upper hand in the protracted negotiations at the border village of Panmunjeom while facilitating an additional provocation in case the talks break down. “It’s around 10 times the usual. We have not seen in decades that many submarines that are simultaneously out of their bases,” the official said. “This is the level where we can expect something really worrying to happen ― we don’t know what kind of operations they are and will be undertaking where.” The discovery came two days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un placed frontline troops in full combat readiness, declaring a “quasi-state of war.” The regime has since forward-stationed 76.2-milimeter artillery guns near the border and fully armed more soldiers, Seoul officials saidThe heavily militarized country is believed to run more than 70 submersibles including 20 1,800-ton Romeo-class, 40 300-ton Sangeo-class and 10 130-ton Yeoneo-class vessels. Albeit old and equipped with outdated weapons, they outnumber the South’s fleet. In May, it tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile from a newly built 2,000-ton ship. The 2010 torpedo attack on the South corvette Cheonan was made from a Yeoneo-class submarine. To head off any unanticipated provocation, the South Korean military is maintaining full readiness and mobilizing more antisubmarine assets such as destroyers, P-3C patrol planes and Lynx antisubmarine helicopters, the official added. The South Korean Navy operates a 13-submarine fleet, consisting of nine units of 1,200-ton 209-class and four of 1,800-ton 214-class. It is pushing to add five 214-class submarines by 2019 and nine 3,000-ton submarines carrying vertical launchers for submarine-to-ground missiles. It launched a submarine force command last February to better counter North Korean threats and carry out underwater operations, training and education, and maintenance. Meanwhile, the loudspeaker broadcasts continued at all 11 spots as scheduled, which had prompted the North to open fire across the Demilitarized Zone and then the South to shoot back on Thursday. South Korea and the U.S. late Friday raised their five-stage Watch Condition by one notch to level 2, which will allow them to boost stealth and reconnaissance activities with their RC-135 “snooper” aircraft, Aegis destroyers with radar surveillance systems and spy satellites. During a phone conversation on Saturday, the chairmen of the two countries’ Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirmed stern punishment against another provocation and agreed to explore ways to deter it. In a display of force, the allies on Saturday flew eight fighter jets ― four South Korean F-15K and four U.S. F-16. They have also been staging two separate joint military exercises since last week, drawing Pyongyang’s protests.Monitoring the development of the inter-Korean dialogue, many evacuated residents of five northernmost islands in the West Sea and border towns in Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces expressed hopes for an early breakthrough. More than 20,000 were initially instructed to take refuge, but some regions in Yanggu and Inje were released from the order, and other people opted to go home as the talks dragged out. Fishing work around the islands in the West Sea was banned for the third straight day, though all passenger boats departing from Incheon remained in service. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn visited a shelter in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday, requesting cooperation from the residents and examining the overall evacuation facilities and relief items given to the people.

(Yonhap)Even during the rare bilateral talks on Sunday, the North continued to heighten tensions by sending some 50 submarines away from their base and doubling its forward-deployed artillery forces that were ready for strike missions.Some analysts said that the recent series of moves by Pyongyang underscored Kim’s unstable, military-oriented management of cross-border ties. But others claimed that the moves might be based on strategically calibrated scenarios to achieve concessions from Seoul and Washington.“Inexperienced and ignorant people tend to be courageous,” said Chun In-young, professor emeritus at Seoul National University, referring to the young North Korean leader who took power in 2011 after only several years of grooming.“He had a very short period of time to accumulate experience in state management before taking the helm of his country. Thus, there are chances that he could make miscalculations or dangerous decisions.”Chun added that Kim’s apparent efforts to highlight his military leadership though state media have also raised concerns that he might not be able to exercise prudence, restraint and caution in his management of external relations. The Aug. 4 land mine provocation shocked South Korea, as the incident coincided with Seoul’s efforts to forge a reconciliatory mood on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the two Koreas’ liberation from Japan’s colonial rule.The land mine inflicted severe injuries on two South Korean soldiers. Pyongyang has denied responsibility -- a denial that has further fanned anti-Pyongyang sentiment in South Korea and led Seoul to harden its stance against the North.Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University, said that Pyongyang was resorting to its signature brinkmanship diplomacy based on meticulous consideration of Seoul’s reactions.“I think the North has once again resorted to brinkmanship tactics -- creating a crisis through limited attacks and trying to bring about a change in the current (deadlock) in its favor,” he said.“The offer of dialogue appears to have come as the military gaps between the two Koreas remain big, particularly when the South Korea-U.S. combined military power poses a burden on it. The provocations might have been conducted based on careful calculations and meticulous planning.”Kim Heung-kyu, international relations professor at Ajou University, said that North Korea’s recent provocations, including the latest rocket attack targeting Seoul’s propaganda speakers, might have been aimed to achieve multiple purposes.“The North might have intended to ease the South’s hard-line stance and restrain its anti-Pyongyang propaganda activities by triggering (ideological) division inside the South,” he said in his social media posting.“A provocation could cause a crisis that could make (South Korean) President Park Geun-hye reconsider her trip to China (in September), thereby impeding the strengthening of the South Korea-China relations.”He also said that after its failures to gain economic assistance from Japan, Russia and the U.S., Pyongyang appeared to have concluded that diplomacy would not help address its economic and other issues.Meanwhile, the South has been struggling to break what it calls a “vicious circle of North Korean provocations” amid increasingly provocative North Korean rhetoric and actions, and escalating security concerns among South Koreans.So far, Seoul has striven to maintain a two-track approach, employing both dialogue and a stern response to North Korean provocations. But Pyongyang’s adherence to its nuclear program and continued border provocations have triggered Seoul’s harsh reaction, which further raised the risks of another North Korean provocation.  By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","defense meeting last thursday yonhap ,emergency defense meeting last thursday ,defense meeting last thursday ,latest rocket attack targeting seoul ,fisted decision making last thursday","['North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Chun In - young', 'Seoul National University', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'anti - pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Koh Yoo - hwan', 'north korean', 'Dongguk University', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Heung - kyu', 'Ajou University', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'north', 'anti - pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",7,"[ 4.          2.          0.         ... -0.40525779  0.63511324

To head off any unanticipated provocation, the South Korean military is maintaining full readiness and mobilizing more antisubmarine assets such as destroyers, P-3C patrol planes and Lynx antisubmarine helicopters, the official added. The South Korean Navy operates a 13-submarine fleet, consisting of nine units of 1,200-ton 209-class and four of 1,800-ton 214-class. It is pushing to add five 214-class submarines by 2019 and nine 3,000-ton submarines carrying vertical launchers for submarine-to-ground missiles. It launched a submarine force command last February to better counter North Korean threats and carry out underwater operations, training and education, and maintenance. Meanwhile, the loudspeaker broadcasts continued at all 11 spots as scheduled, which had prompted the North to open fire across the Demilitarized Zone and then the South to shoot back on Thursday. South Korea and the U.S. late Friday raised their five-stage Watch Condition by one notch to level 2, which will allow them to boost stealth and reconnaissance activities with their RC-135 “snooper” aircraft, Aegis destroyers with radar surveillance systems and spy satellites. During a phone conversation on Saturday, the chairmen of the two countries’ Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirmed stern punishment against another provocation and agreed to explore ways to deter it. In a display of force, the allies on Saturday flew eight fighter jets ― four South Korean F-15K and four U.S. F-16. They have also been staging two separate joint military exercises since last week, drawing Pyongyang’s protests.Monitoring the development of the inter-Korean dialogue, many evacuated residents of five northernmost islands in the West Sea and border towns in Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces expressed hopes for an early breakthrough. More than 20,000 were initially instructed to take refuge, but some regions in Yanggu and Inje were released from the order, and other people opted to go home as the talks dragged out. Fishing work around the islands in the West Sea was banned for the third straight day, though all passenger boats departing from Incheon remained in service. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn visited a shelter in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday, requesting cooperation from the residents and examining the overall evacuation facilities and relief items given to the people.

An angered North Korea fired artillery rounds with the South earlier this week, which led to a rare exchange of fire between the two sides.Details of the talks were not available, but it was widely believed that the South demanded the North apologize for the land mine and shelling provocations, while the North demanded the South halt the propaganda broadcasts.""As for the chances of an agreement, I don't see much chance as long as Seoul insists on an apology for the mine laying. If both sides can find a way around this issue, then it is possible,"" said Ken Gause, a senior analyst on Korea at CNA Corp.(Yonhap)""It's the same reason about South Korea's demand for the apology for the sinking of the Cheonan. North Korea does not admit either one of the provocations. Therefore, to admit and apologize right now will bring condemnation on the regime and on the supreme leader. And therefore, they cannot admit to this,"" he said.Halting the broadcasts is a priority, but the North wants it to be done on its own terms, he said.From the broader perspective, the North's ultimate goal is to break the stalemate in inter-Korean relations, he said.""You cannot view this crisis and North Korea's provocations in isolation,"" he said. ""North Korea's calculus is driven by a desire to find a way to break the stalemate in inter-Korean relations.Pyongyang's return to a brinksmanship strategy is a way to force what the diplomatic charm campaign could not -- to get Seoul to the negotiating table.""Gause also said that the current situation shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un does not want the situation to escalate too far, but he is likely to use aggression to keep Seoul engaged.""I suspect the tension will continue throughout the exercises.Another provocation is possible,"" the expert said. ""Once the (South Korea-U.S.) exercises are over, if the situation has not gotten out of hand, both sides will de-escalate, and North Korea will assess the situation. They will seek engagement. If not successful, expect to see another provocation, such as a missile test."" Evans Revere, senior director at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said the fact that the talks have taken place is important because it offers a chance for the two sides to de-escalate the crisis and prevent the confrontation from worsening.South Korea entered the talks in a strong position because it made clear to the North that it will no longer tolerate Pyongyang's provocations and aggression, Revere said. From this position, the South must have forthrightly conveyed its demand that the North apologize for the land mine attack and shelling, he said.""I have no illusions that the North will actually apologize, but I believe that the North will demonstrate in some way that it will not carry out further attacks,"" he said. ""Although not fully satisfactory, if it does this, it could establish a new paradigm in North-South relations in which Pyongyang recognizes that it, too, would suffer from a future military confrontation.""

During his lecture to Koreans about the bilateral economic cooperation, Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Qiu Guohong reportedly said that the two Koreas should restrain themselves and seek a resolution to their issues through dialogue.“We (China) are against any unilateral provocation, whoever may initiate it,” the ambassador was quoted by local media as saying.In a statement, Russia’s Foreign Ministry also called on both Koreas to exert the “utmost restraint” and refrain from any actions that would aggravate inter-Korean tensions.For Seoul to gain support from the UN Security Council to condemn Pyongyang’s provocations, cooperation with Beijing and Moscow is crucial, given that they are two of the five veto-wielding countries.While whether Russia would fully support South Korea’s future course of action at the UNSC is unknown, cooperation with China is expected to be smoother considering that South Korean President Park Geun-hye plans to visit China to attend the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II ― a decision seen as a move by Park to further strengthen strategic cooperation with the emerging power.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","diplomacy friday to secure international ,korean exchange of fire thursday ,meeting in pyongyang on thursday ,pyongyang rocket attack and warning ,thursday evening ordering his troops","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'the United Nations', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'YonhapEarlier', 'South Korea ’s', 'Hwang Joon - kuk', 'U.S.', 'Sung Kim', 'Kim', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'the UN Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S. State Department', 'Katina Adams', 'China', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Koreans', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'Qiu Guohong', 'Koreas', 'China', 'Russia', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'the UN Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'South Korea ’s', 'UNSC', 'China', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'China', 'Park', 'Song Sang - ho']",7,"[ 2.          4.          0.         ... -0.19658992  0.84233248

The two sides traded fire Thursday after the North launched artillery shells apparently targeting the loudspeakers installed in the border areas. The communist state then threatened military action unless the South halted the broadcasts and pulled out the equipment by 5 p.m. on Saturday. The military here remained unwavering in its stance, though it was maintaining maximum readiness posture and bracing for further provocations from across the border.  President Park Geun-hye, Defense Minister Han Min-koo (left) and National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin visit the headquarters of the Third Army in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, Friday. Cheong Wa Dae“As of now, we are continuing and will continue the broadcast program without any change,” a senior official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. A Defense Ministry official also said there was no shift in the making, calling the issue a “political” one. The JCS sent a letter through a West Sea military communication channel to the General Staff of the (North) Korean People’s Army, which had delivered a message the previous day threatening military action if the deadline was not met. The JCS warned that the North’s land mine attack early this month and the latest artillery fire were “illicit, grave provocations that constitute a direct violation” of the armistice and bilateral nonaggression pacts. “We also urged the North to completely abandon ruthless, rash acts and made clear that we will strongly retaliate in the aspect of self-defense and the North are to bear all the responsibilities resulting from this,” the ministry said in a statement. Following the exchange of fire, Kim presided over an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Military Commission, instructing frontline units to switch to a “wartime state” and fully arm themselves starting from 5 p.m. on Thursday, state media said. The North last made the “quasi-state of war” declaration in November 2010 when it shelled a South Korean border island in the West Sea. “Military commanders were urgently appointed and dispatched for operations to strike the enemy’s means of psychological warfare and quell possible counteraction if it did not stop the propaganda broadcasts,” the official Korean Central Television reported. President Park Geun-hye urged the South Korean military to stay ready to react immediately to any further provocation and blasted Pyongyang for churning out security threats during her visit to a field army command in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. The trip, which came after she shelved her scheduled tour to southern parts of the country, was designed to examine its readiness posture and encourage soldiers, Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Min Kyung-wook said. She was briefed by commanders there on their plans to respond to potential attacks and the current movements by the North Korean military. Presiding over a video conference with operational commanders later in the day, Defense Minister Han Min-koo also called for airtight readiness and effective situation management, saying that after the deadline the North may stage a provocation “in any way.” Though Pyongyang did not give any hints, speculation is growing over its possible moves after the deadline, ranging from a long-range missile to short- and midrange artillery to a cyberattack. South Korean soldiers inspect vehicles at Tongil Bridge in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, before they cross the Imjin River to head for a joint industrial complex near the inter-Korean border Friday, a day after the rival Koreas traded fire across the Demilitarized Zone. YonhapWith no exit strategy in sight on either side, the latest exchange of fire and the increasingly heated rhetoric war rekindled concerns over a potential miscalculation or unintended escalation that may lead to a larger armed clash. China and Russia, traditional patrons of Pyongyang, called for both sides to refrain and tackle the crisis through dialogue. “The current situation is dangerous on pen and the risks of miscalculation are much higher than they were a few days ago,” Daniel Pinkston, deputy project director for Northeast Asia at the International Crisis Group, wrote in his analysis. While stern punishment is key to North Korea’s provocations, South Korea needs to exert abstinence in its responses so as to prevent the battle lines from extending, said Cheong Seong-chang, head of unification strategy research at the Sejong Institute, stressing the need for high-level talks as suggested a day before by chief of the North’s United Front Department in charge of cross-border affairs. “The regime appears to be making “desperate” efforts to block the broadcasts before they scale up as planned, perturb frontline North Korean troops and thus undermine their morale,” Cheong said. “With the North harboring a major sense of crisis and anxiety about the broadcasts, it is likely to press ahead with a military provocation if the South continues to air them. A series of tit-for-tat hard-line responses will inevitably inflict huge damage on both sides.” With the flare-up of tension, the Unification Ministry decided to limit the entry of South Koreans to a joint factory park in the North Korean border city of Gaeseong. Only those in direct charge of business management who could return by the end of the day would be allowed to cross the border until further notice. As of Friday morning, there were 924 South Koreans counted in North Korea including 830 businesspeople at Gaeseong, 10 historians who are part of a joint archeological excavation team, and 83 youth football players and members of the press in Pyongyang for an international tournament.

352,352,Regional powers vie over influence in Eurasia,"Major regional powers are vying to strengthen their geopolitical foothold on the strategically vital Eurasian continent with their distinctive policy initiatives striving to court Asian nations including South Korea.For them, Eurasia, accounting for 71 percent of the world’s population and 60 percent of the global gross domestic product, is critical as their influence over it would, after all, determine their global...","Major regional powers are vying to strengthen their geopolitical foothold on the strategically vital Eurasian continent with their distinctive policy initiatives striving to court Asian nations including South Korea.For them, Eurasia, accounting for 71 percent of the world’s population and 60 percent of the global gross domestic product, is critical as their influence over it would, after all, determine their global status, analysts say.Among other policy initiatives, China’s “One Belt One Road” figures prominently as it is seen by analysts as part of the ascendant power’s efforts to expand its economic and political clout across the continent and beyond.The project, which Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled during his visit to Kazakhstan in September 2013, seeks to connect China with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Middle East, Europe and even Africa through “land and maritime silk roads.” “The One Belt One Road scheme apparently reaffirms China’s intention to secure a hegemonic status in the region through the economic, infrastructure-building project,” said Park Won-gon, an international politics expert at Handong Global University.“China seems to be employing quite a clever strategy to secure its supremacy through the economic initiative, not through what could be a confrontational security initiative that would have caused friction with the U.S. and impeded its quest for primacy.”Focusing on building “connectivity” infrastructures, the Chinese project consists of the “Silk Road Economic Belt” to link China’s neighbors and others through an envisioned network of roads and railways, and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” to connect the littoral states of the Indo-Pacific Oceans through the construction of coastal transport routes such as sea ports.The China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank is to bankroll the infrastructure projects.The One Belt One Road initiative is not a wholly new one. It is rather a comprehensive compilation of multiple projects that China has ambitiously pushed for its regional economic cooperation and integration.In particular, the maritime Silk Road scheme is a continuation of China’s foreign policy drive to link it with Indian Ocean states such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, which Western analysts called a “string of pearls” strategy. To secure an unimpeded, stable supply of energy and resources -- critical for continuing economic growth and thus strengthening public support for the communist leadership, China has sought to develop safer, shorter and more cost-effective maritime and overland trade routes. As part of the efforts, China has strived to develop port facilities in various coastal nodes such as Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota and Colombo in Sri Lanka, Chittagong in Bangladesh, and Sittawe and Kyaukpyu in Myanmar. China’s rivals including the U.S. suspect that these port facilities could be turned into naval outposts in case of a conflict for global hegemony.Amid China’s stepped-up push for expanded influence in Eurasia, Russia is also carrying out its own policy drive, called the “New Eastern Policy,” an initiative to cement ties with Asia-Pacific states, enhance its geopolitical status, diversify its energy export routs and develop its Far East region.In May 2012, the Moscow government unveiled the initiative, which has shifted its foreign policy focus to Asia from Europe. The shift came as Russia has maintained taut security and diplomatic tensions with Europe amid the NATO’s eastward expansion and the Ukraine crisis.Introducing the initiative toward the Asia-Pacific, Moscow also established the Ministry of Development of Russian Far East to push for the key national project to develop the underdeveloped region.""Under the policy initiative, Russia seeks to strengthen ties with both South and North Koreas, China and other Asian partners to attract investments in its Far East region, bolster its geopolitical strength and secure energy export routes, which in the past focused mostly on Europe,” said Chang Duck-joon, a Russia expert at Kookmin University.“In terms of the country’s balanced development, Russia also takes advantage of the initiative to develop the Far East region. Its hosting of the APEC summit in 2012 in Vladivostok, the major city in the Far East, demonstrates Moscow’s will to develop the region through the initiative.”In the intensifying geopolitical contest, the U.S. is also a key player with its multifaceted “rebalancing” policy toward the Asia-Pacific.With its counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in the Middle East winding down, the U.S. is shifting its foreign policy focus to the Asia-Pacific with the apparent goals of keeping the increasingly assertive China in check and maintaining its regional preponderance.The U.S. has been deepening its security cooperation with treaty allies such as South Korea, Japan and Thailand, and regional partners including Vietnam and Indonesia, and striving to bolster its voice in the regional multilateral institutions such as the East Asia Summit. It has also sought to ensure its economic leadership through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an envisioned free trade tool linking the Pacific Rim states. Japan has also launched a brisk diplomacy to strengthen ties with Eurasian states. The Shinzo Abe government has paid particular attention to bolster energy cooperation with Central Asian states including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to diversify its energy sources and apparently bolster its influence against China.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","strategically vital eurasian continent with ,politics expert at handong global ,striving to court asian nations ,china has ambitiously pushed for ,of conflict for global hegemony","['eurasian', 'asian', 'South Korea', 'Eurasia', 'China', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Kazakhstan', 'China', 'China', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'China', 'the Indo - Pacific Oceans', 'China', 'Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'China', 'China', 'Pakistan', 'Sri Lanka', 'Myanmar', 'China', 'China', 'Pakistan', 'Sri Lanka', 'Bangladesh', 'Sittawe', 'Kyaukpyu', 'Myanmar', 'China', 'U.S.', 'amid China ’s', 'Eurasia', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'NATO', 'Ukraine', 'Moscow', 'the Ministry of Development of Russian Far East', 'Russia', 'North Koreas', 'China', 'asian', 'Chang Duck - joon', 'Russia', 'Kookmin University', 'Russia', 'APEC', 'Vladivostok', 'Moscow', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Thailand', 'Vietnam', 'Indonesia', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'Japan', 'eurasian', 'Shinzo Abe', 'central asian', 'Kazakhstan', 'Uzbekistan', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 2.         13.          0.         ... -0.6534754   0.66073328

Military vehicles move toward a training site in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province on Friday. (Yonhap)South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm. Choi Yun-hee and Combined Forces commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti have been sharing military intelligence in real time to ensure their militaries’ joint readiness posture, since Pyongyang’s rocket attack Thursday, Seoul officials said.Currently, South Korea is independently dealing with Pyongyang’s limited attacks. But when the intensity and scope of the communist regime’s provocations increase, the allies are expected to activate their joint plan to better counter North Korean provocations. “In the case of the limited attack by the North, we are to make independent responses from the standpoint of self-defense, and we are, of course, sharing the situational information with the U.S.,” a Seoul defense official told The Korea Herald.“But when the allies share the need for joint operations and their leaders approve it, we will apply the allied counter-provocation plan. We are not yet at that stage.”The contingency plan was signed in March 2013 by the allies’ military chiefs to “immediately and decisively” counter North Korean provocations. Under the plan, the South would lead counter-provocation operations with the U.S. providing support. The allies have not elaborated on operational specifics, but the plan is thought to stipulate concrete steps for various provocation scenarios that could occur within the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas, and the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean sea border.The plan was drawn up when South Korea sought to take strong retaliatory measures against the North, which had launched a series of deadly surprise attacks on the South, while the U.S. apparently urged its ally to exercise restraint to prevent an escalation of a cross-border conflict. Coordination between the allies remains seamless, Seoul officials said, as the contingency plan was employed amid the ongoing South Korea-U.S. military exercise, called “Ulchi Freedom Guardian.” The allies have raised their vigilance levels to increase their joint reconnaissance activities and readiness posture.The allies have also put their major military assets on standby to respond to potential North Korean provocations, including those assets that have been mobilized for ongoing military drills, Seoul officials noted.On Thursday, the North sent a letter to South Korean authorities, threatening to take military action should they not stop frontline propaganda broadcasts within 48 hours. Seoul resumed loudspeaker propaganda activities after Pyongyang launched land mine attacks on Aug. 4, inflicting serious injuries on two South Korean soldiers.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","for ongoing military drills seoul ,pyongyang rocket attack thursday seoul ,ongoing military drills seoul officials ,ongoing military drills seoul ,up their military coordination friday","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Pocheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Korea', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Choi Yun - hee', 'Combined Forces', 'Curtis Scaparrotti', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'Koreas', 'the Northern Limit Line', 'inter - korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 4.          0.          0.         ... -0.41354346  0.48811606

At the same time, the North said that it has the intent to make efforts to open a channel for the improvement of inter-Korean ties.  The Ministry of Unification said North Korea's willingness for talks is questionable as the North sent strong warnings of military action against the South right after it delivered a message containing its intent for dialogue.  ""We cannot help having doubts about North Korea's sincerity over holding dialogue with South Korea,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.  Jeong also blamed the North for denying its provocations, saying that the North's move is like ""covering up the heavens with one's palm.""  North Korea denied its firing of several rounds of artillery shells a day earlier across the heavily fortified inter-Korean border.

South Korea responded by firing dozens of shells and warned it will deal firmly with any future provocations. Both countries have placed their militaries on high alert.  At a hurriedly called meeting, senior officials from the Financial Services Commission, the Financial Supervisory Service, the Korea Center for International Finance and the Korea Exchange stressed that any fallout from Thursday's attack by North Korea will be short-lived mainly because Seoul's fundamentals remain stable.  ""There is no reason for market players to react in an excessive manner to what is unfolding at present,"" they said.  The officials pointed out that recent stock market adjustments are the result of weak global investor confidence and not related to developments taking place in South Korea.  ""There has been net selling by foreign investors in Asian markets, but compared to other countries, there has been less shedding of South Korean shares,"" officials emphasized.   While geo-political risks associated with North Korea only posed limited challenges, uncertainties surrounding China's economy and its stock market crash, as well as the likelihood of the United States marking up its key interest rates, were longer term concerns, they added.     Despite the call, South Korean shares fell nearly 2 percent in early trade on Friday, while the country's risk premium hit a seven month high, market data showed.  According to market tracker Markit, the country's credit default swap remium for the country's foreign exchange stabilization bonds with five year maturity stood at 66.98 basis points, up 3.04 basis points from the day before and the highest since 67.63 basis points tallied for Jan. 20. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  CDS reflects the cost of hedging credit risk on corporate and sovereign debt with a rise implying a deterioration in the credit of government bonds and higher cost of insurance.  In a separate meeting in Seoul, a vice finance minister said the market need not be overly worried about the latest standoff.  ""North Korea's attack, judging by past experience, should have little impact on the country's financial sector,"" Joo Hyung-hwan said. ""The government is ready to respond proactively to all uncertainties.""  The financial officials said that while there was a strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared with the Korean won in the offshore non-deliverable forwards market, this soon stabilized.      The Bank of Korea, which also called a separate meeting on the incident, said the effect on the market was largely limited, citing market indicators such as non-deliverable forward exchange rate and credit default swap premium.  The central bank said it will continue to monitor the market situation and step up communication with market participants in efforts to rein in volatility.  Related government ministries have set up an around-the-clock monitoring system to check developments in the financial and futures markets and deal with any concerns.

The rocket attack came as tensions remained high due to the Aug. 4 land mine attack that injured two South Korean troops. President Park Geun-hye presides over a National Security Council session in an underground crisis management bunker at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday (Yonhap)“Pyongyang appears to have mistakenly thought that if it did not take retaliatory steps toward the South stepping up anti-Pyongyang propaganda efforts, the efforts would further be expanded,” said Ahn Chan-il, the head of the World North Korea Research Center.“The rocket provocation would rather be a chance for Seoul to intensify its propaganda activities to let the voices of freedom to North Korean soldiers and civilians living near the border.”The rocket attack came two days after Seoul sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council to express its regret over the North’s land mine attack, and to urge the communist regime to stop additional provocations, a senior Seoul official said Thursday.The letter, written under the name of Seoul’s Ambassador to the U.N. Oh Joon, was delivered to the UNSC chairman Tuesday, New York time. This month, Nigeria undertakes the rotating UNSC chairmanship. In the letter, Seoul explained the result of its investigation into the land mine detonation in the Demilitarized Zone, calling the UNSC’s attention to the provocation, which it calls a “threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula and a violation of the Armistice Agreement.”“Upon our request, the letter has been read by the member states of the UNSC. The letter is expected to be adopted as an official UNSC document today or tomorrow, and posted on the UNSC-related website as well,” the official told reporters.The land mine incident sharply increased inter-Korean tensions, leading the two Koreas to begin intensive propaganda campaigns against each other through loudspeakers near the heavily fortified border. Seoul’s investigators concluded that the North placed three wooden-box land mines intentionally near the Military Demarcation Line within the DMZ separating the two Koreas. Seoul warned that Pyongyang would “pay dearly” for the incident, while the North denies its responsibility.The letter is not specifically intended to urge the UNSC to issue a statement against the provocation. But it would serve as a part in an accumulation of evidence of Pyongyang’s continued provocations that threaten the peninsular peace and stability, the official noted. “We sent the letter believing that, should the North engage in another provocative act, this letter would show to the international community the repetitive nature of North Korean provocations,” he said. “As the act of sending the letter is quite rare, this shows that we took the case very seriously.” Meanwhile, 38 North, run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said that recent satellite imagery indicates that Pyongyang has conducted an engine test at a satellite launch station on its west coast. This analysis came amid growing speculation that the reclusive state might engage in a provocative act around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party.The research website also said that the North has been installing two new, larger, storage buildings for fuel and an oxidizer at the rocket launch site. But it pointed out that recent satellite imagery still shows “no signs of launch preparations.”“When complete, they will provide more than double the storage capacity of the existing structures, suggesting that the North Koreans are developing a capability to test larger, more capable engines,” the website said.Local media reports said that the North was spotted preparing for short-range missile launches at its launch sites on its east and west coasts. The missiles could be KN-02 ground-to-ground missiles with a range of up to 160 kilometers or Scud missiles with a range of up to 1,000 kilometers.The North has launched short-range missiles in a show of force before or after the South Korea-U.S. military drills, which it has denounced as a “rehearsal for a nuclear war of invasion” against it.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea rocket provocation thursday sharply ,north korea rocket provocation thursday ,korea rocket provocation thursday ,stepping up anti pyongyang propaganda ,rocket provocation thursday sharply","['North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'North Koreans', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'National Security Council', 'Cheong', 'Yonhap)“Pyongyang', 'pyongyang', 'Ahn Chan - il', 'the World North Korea Research Center', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'the U.N.

Seoul’s investigators concluded that the North placed three wooden-box land mines intentionally near the Military Demarcation Line within the DMZ separating the two Koreas. Seoul warned that Pyongyang would “pay dearly” for the incident, while the North denies its responsibility.The letter is not specifically intended to urge the UNSC to issue a statement against the provocation. But it would serve as a part in an accumulation of evidence of Pyongyang’s continued provocations that threaten the peninsular peace and stability, the official noted. “We sent the letter believing that, should the North engage in another provocative act, this letter would show to the international community the repetitive nature of North Korean provocations,” he said. “As the act of sending the letter is quite rare, this shows that we took the case very seriously.” Meanwhile, 38 North, run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said that recent satellite imagery indicates that Pyongyang has conducted an engine test at a satellite launch station on its west coast. This analysis came amid growing speculation that the reclusive state might engage in a provocative act around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party.The research website also said that the North has been installing two new, larger, storage buildings for fuel and an oxidizer at the rocket launch site. But it pointed out that recent satellite imagery still shows “no signs of launch preparations.”“When complete, they will provide more than double the storage capacity of the existing structures, suggesting that the North Koreans are developing a capability to test larger, more capable engines,” the website said.Local media reports said that the North was spotted preparing for short-range missile launches at its launch sites on its east and west coasts.

Xi attended a military parade in Moscow in May marking the end of World War II, while Western leaders shunned the event amid tensions over Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine.China's defense ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said on July 31 that the drills will be held in the Peter the Great Gulf and areas off the coast of the Clerk Cape, as well as in the airspace above and waters of the East Sea.The Peter the Great Gulf is the biggest gulf of the East Sea and is close to the borders of North Korea, China and Russia. China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday that the drills will focus on improving ""anti-submarine combat and air defense and other relevant missions. A joint beach landing of troops is also planned.""The drills will also involve about seven Chinese warships, aircraft and helicopters, as well as some 200 marines, according to a Chinese media report. Russia's military will send 16 ships, two submarines, 12 naval aircraft, nine amphibious vehicles and 200 marines.A state-run newspaper published by China's Communist Party indicated that Beijing and Moscow are intensifying military cooperation at a time when the United States is engaged in a ""pivot"" to Asia. ""Washington and Tokyo are both calculating with their alliance, while another ally of the U.S., South Korea, is hoping to be more neutral in the international arena,"" the Global Times newspaper said in an editorial about the drills. ""The military and political situation in East Asia is still a blur. Some worry that the enhanced U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region has piled pressure on both Beijing and Moscow,""it said.

North Korea has denied responsibility for the attack. (Yonhap)South Korea explained its position in a letter sent to the council's 15 member states on Tuesday, the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.""The letter informed (the council) of the results of our investigation into the North's mine blast, expressed regret over the North's provocation and urged restraint from further provocations,"" the official said.The letter will be published into an official U.N. Security Council document and is expected to be uploaded onto its website Friday.South Korea has condemned the mine attack as a violation of the Armistice Agreement that effectively ended the 1950-53 Korean War. The letter does not, however, mean that the issue of the land mine attack will be automatically placed on the council's agenda, the official said.""For now, we have sent the letter, informed the international community, raised awareness of North Korea's (provocation), and took in consideration the fact that we could use this case later on by leaving it on the record.""North Korea is widely expected to carry out a major provocation, such as a long-range rocket launch, around the 70th founding anniversary of its Workers' Party in October.If that happens, South Korea could cite the recent landmine attack as the basis for drawing stronger punitive action from the international community against Pyongyang, according to diplomatic sources.In May, South Korea sent a similar letter to the council's North Korea Sanctions Committee after the communist nation conducted a submarine-launched ballistic missile test in defiance of U.N. resolutions banning it from using ballistic missile technology.North Korea has yet to respond to the South's latest move, but it remains to be seen whether it will send its own letter to the U.N. as it did after a deadly attack on a South Korean warship in May 2010 that was also blamed on the North.

The new deal still bans Seoul from reprocessing and enrichment, but it opens the way for the Asian ally to begin research into a new technology for spent nuclear fuel recycling, known as pyroprocessing, and to make low-level enriched uranium with U.S. consent.President Barack Obama sent the deal to Congress last month for approval.

And she also seems to agree that the Abe statement contains enough to warrant further open doors, not slam and shut,"" Evans Revere, senior Director at Albright Stonebridge Group, said at a Heritage Foundation discussion.Revere was referring to Park's Liberation Day address in which she positively assessed Abe's statement despite criticism that the nationalist Japanese leader failed again to offer a clear apology for the country's sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.In the address, Park said Abe's statement falls short of expectations, but said it's still worth noting that Abe promised that positions of previous cabinets will remain unshakable. The remarks were seen as an expression of her willingness to improve relations with Japan.""Prime Minister Abe's statement appears to have given Koreans just enough to work with as the two sides explore ways to try to improve ties and settle various pending issues between them.Without question, the Abe statement could have been better and certainly more could have been said to assuage Korean sensitivities,"" Revere said.The expert said that Abe should have made ""a stand-alone reference"" to the suffering of the Korean people, instead of merely including them in a list of the many in the region. The Japanese leader should have also made a specific reference to the sexual slavery issue, he said.Revere said he believes it was also a mistake by Abe to talk about the apology burden of future generations.""For Japan to be relieved of the need for future apologies, it's important that today's expressions of remorse and regret are seen as genuine, credible and sincere. To do so, Tokyo is going to have to make further efforts to reconcile with its Korean neighbor,"" he said.Revere said it is too early to tell whether Seoul and Tokyo will be able to make progress on thorny issues.""But what seems clear at this point is that in the aftermath of the Abe statement and thanks to what I believe is President Park's very wise and very prudent and very statesman-like reaction to it, the two sides seem prepared to try,"" he said.Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, also praised Park's address as ""measured and thoughtful,"" saying it left room to work with Abe if the two governments decide that is what they want to do, just as the Abe statement left room to work.The two leaders at least ""did not present an additional hurdle,"" she said.Smith also expressed hope for the realization of a trilateral summit between Park, Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of China's war anniversary event set for next month.""I hope that this fall will be an occasion for the three leaders to meet and I hope that Seoul and Tokyo will find a way to make that meeting a positive opportunity for the relationship,"" she said.

China usually sends its premier to the talks.South Korea, however, remains cautious about a separate summit between Park and Abe amid strained bilateral ties.""There is no change in our position regarding a South Korea-Japan summit. Basically, we are open to it,"" Noh said. ""But there should be talks for the two countries to build sustainable trust, not talks for the sake of talks. For that, conditions should be created for such talks.""In his World War II anniversary speech last week, the Japanese prime minister evaded giving his own apology for the nation's militaristic past, including the brutal colonization of Korea from 1910-45. He instead vowed to uphold past formal apologies by his predecessors.Delivering her Liberation Day speech a day later, the South Korean president said Abe's statement left much to be desired and called for ""sincere actions,"" not rhetoric, to address the history issue.

Choi Yoon-hee, chairman of the JCS, told the commander of a military unit on the eastern border, according to the JCS.Choi visited the front-line unit earlier in the day to inspect its combat readiness posture in the wake of North Korea's recent land mine detonation on the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone.Choi inspected an observation post only 1.3 kilometers away from a North Korean front-line guard post, and checked on a recently-launched loudspeaker propaganda operation in the area, the JCS said. He also examined the military unit's vigilance and other operations in the DMZ, according to the JCS.""The reason why North Korea is reacting sensitively to psychological warfare is our psychological operations pose fears bigger than those posed by any other high-tech weapons,"" Choi said, referring to the propaganda campaign that South Korea launched last week.For the first time in 11 years, South Korea fully resumed its cross-border propaganda campaign, a sort of psychological warfare, in retaliation for the North's mine provocation.Two South Korean staff sergeants were maimed as three land mines believed to have been buried by the North exploded in the southern half of the DMZ on Aug. 4. The North, in return, has also revived its propaganda broadcasting at the border, for the first time since an inter-Korean agreement suspended it in 2004.A large-scale joint military exercise launched Monday between South Korea and the United States, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, is also fueling military tension on the peninsula with the North threatening counteractions to what it denounces as a rehearsal for invasion. Also on Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Lee Sang-hoon, the chief commander of the Marine Corps, completed his two-day combat posture inspection of the country's five front-line islands in the Yellow Sea, including Yeonpyeong Island, where North Korea launched deadly shelling attacks in 2010.

They are not game-changers.  The past 10 years of exercises demonstrated a rough correlation with the status of bilateral relationship prior to the exercises,"" Cha said.""If U.S.-DPRK relations were coded positively prior to the exercises, it remained positive after the exercise, despite North Korean rhetoric on the contrary. On the other hand, if the relationship was coded negatively prior to the exercises, the exercises tended to reinforce the negative relations in terms of both rhetoric and possible provocations,"" he said.The North can also ""insulate"" positive inter-Korean relations from its belligerence against the U.S. during the exercise period, Cha said, adding that inter-Korean ties in 2005 and 2006 remained good despite belligerence against the military exercises.  Cha, however, noted that small-scale North Korean provocations during and after the exercise period became more common after 2009.""Pyongyang's official rhetoric remains a good indicator of possible small-scale provocative actions during the exercise period. Washington and Seoul would do well to listen carefully to Pyongyang's rhetoric in the coming days for potential actions,"" he said.South Korea and the U.S. have long argued that their annual drills are purely defensive in nature. On Monday, State Department spokesman John Kirby reiterated this point.""These exercises have been long planned and they are exercises that we routinely do with our allies in South Korea and you're right, they have started. They're proceeding normally and apace and we look forward to completing the exercise with them as we always do,"" Kirby said. ""This is about improving alliance capabilities and meeting our security commitments there in the region and on the Korean Peninsula and nothing more than that,"" he said.The latest exercise UFC is the world's largest computerized military drill aimed at defending the South from a North Korean attack, involving nearly 80,000 South Korean and U.S. troops.

They lived under the constant threat of oppressive, militant rulers who were desperate to remain in power in the name of economic development and fighting communism. It was perhaps the state’s strong power that transformed South Korea into a powerful economy for the years to come, but it was the people who established the value of free democracy through decades of struggles and sacrifices.Through this dramatic history of citizens’ unrelenting quest for freedom, the procedural democracy that guarantees the people’s equal right to pick their own leaders was fully established.According to the annual democracy index released by the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2014, South Korea is now considered a “full democracy,” along with only 24 other countries out of 167 nations. Student protestors, who rallied against the authoritarian government in central Seoul, are run after the police on June 18, 1987. (The Korea Herald)However, the nation today has come to face a series of new challenges, with progressive critics and scholars voicing concerns that the country’s democracy is in retreat, as the country travels from the whirlwind era of democratic movements, through the progressive governments, and on to conservative leadership.Questions are growing over the qualitative aspects of the nation’s democracy on how well the power delegated by the people is being exercised. Debate has also been going on for years over how to revise the Constitution to distribute Korea’s imperialistic presidential power and expand people’s participation in policy development.The discussion began to accelerate upon the launch of the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration in 2008, over whether the government’s seemingly increasing social and political intervention was a regressing democracy or pursuit of order and defense against constant North Korean threats. Meanwhile, the country continued to struggle to find a balance on how much the state should intervene in the economy since the 1997 financial crisis.Public angst over the administration grew during the nationwide candlelight vigils against reintroduction of U.S. beef imports in 2008, the Yongsan tragedy of 2009, where six people were killed in a clash between redevelopment protesters and riot police, and the passage of media law revision in 2009 that effectively gave broadcasting licenses to major conservative papers. Other incidents followed in the next conservative Park Geun-hye administration including the National Intelligence Service’s alleged interference in the presidential campaign in 2012, and the unprecedented dissolution of the ultraleft Unified Progressive Party in 2014 for being pro-North and seeking to overthrow the government.Most recently, the unresolved problems of South Korean democracy were laid bare when Rep. Yoo Seong-min, then floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party was forced out of his party position after remarks by President Park, who accused him of betraying and hindering the government’s key policies. The NIS, the key organization behind the administration’s anti-North security, has again been placed in the political hot seat with civilian hacking allegations.Fight for democracyAfter liberation from Japan’s colonial rule in 1945, Korea went through national division, a fratricidal war and decades of dictatorship. People resisted, risking their lives and shedding their blood, to bring dictators to their knees.To understand South Korea’s democracy movement, it’s important to look into the political context that motivated the authoritarian government, said Paul Chang, assistant professor of sociology at Harvard University.“A fundamental characteristic of the repressive governments in the 1970s and 1980s was the reliance on the anti-communist ideology to justify the repression of civil and political dissent,” Chang said in an email interview.“The democracy movement and the authoritarian government were locked in a contest to define what South Korean politics and society should be, all within the larger context of the Cold War that loomed over the country’s history since the division in 1948 and the civil war in 1950,” he said.In 1960, students, teachers and intellectuals led a wave of protests to oust Syngman Rhee, the country’s first president, who stayed in power for nearly 12 years. Rhee sought constitutional amendment twice to stay in power indefinitely. Students took to the streets on April 19 to protest against him as he attempted to continue his grip on power through election fraud. Amid mounting public pressure, Rhee resigned and exiled himself to Hawaii, where he died five years later.After Rhee, military elites seized power, through a coup d’etat. On May 16, 1961, Maj. Gen. Park Chung-hee established a military junta and tightened state control, using draconian emergency decrees. In 1972, he declared the Yushin Constitution that gave him a dictatorial power as he was able to extend his presidency without seeking reelection. Anti-Yushin campaigns continued throughout the 1970s despite the government’s harsh oppression of Park’s political opponents, student activists and other civilians suspected of opposing him. Until he was assassinated by his spy agency chief in late 1979, Park’s opponents were held without trial and tortured, with numerous cases of unexplained deaths. After Park’s demise, hopes for democracy spread, but were soon quelled by another coup led by Army Gen. Chun Doo-hwan.Then on May 18, 1980, Gwangju citizens rose up against him as he tried to consolidate his power by expanding martial law. More than 200 people died in the bloody crackdown by the military, but the incident was concealed by his government and its strong control of the media.The Gwangju Popular Uprising, however, eventually led to another mass-democratization movement in 1987. A broader range of people, in cooperation with opposition leaders, held rallies, demanding a return to a direct election system. After several days of protest, the ruling camp, including Chun’s chosen heir Roh Tae-woo, promised that the government would accept popular presidential elections and restore political rights to Kim Dae-jung, the opposition politician, who later became the president a decade later.Between 1987 and 2015, Korea went through five presidential elections, which included two sets of peaceful transition from the ruling party to the opposition.“The 1987 constitutional revision normalized the constitutional system and thus arbitrary abuses of state powers were considerably reduced,” wrote Lee Myung-sik in his 2010 book titled “The History of Democratization Movement in Korea.”The system brought stability in electoral democracy, but played a limited role in improving the quality of the lives and distribution of power, he said.“Progress in political democracy has failed to spill over to socioeconomic democracy. Instead, wealth and privilege has become concentrated in a few upper echelons of society,” he said. “Inter-Korean tension and regional antagonism also remain unresolved.”New challenges Now, calls are growing to amend the 1987 political system to better reflect the changing situation, as society struggles with a polarization of views between the progressives and the conservatives.“Probably the most significant impediment for further consolidating democracy is the polarization of South Korean society and politics. ... Through the crucible of state repression the ideology and identity of progressive forces became entrenched. And because of this, there is very little constructive dialogue between conservative and progressive forces in Korean society and politics,” pointed Chang of Harvard University.“It’s easy to forget that a healthy democracy does not mean that we always get our way. Rather, a mature democracy can accept oppositional leadership and policies, even if we do not agree with them, as long as they reflect the majority will of the people and the rule of law,” he went on, saying that dialogue and mutual respect are necessary between progressives and conservatives.Systematically, the political structure that has remained unchanged since 1987 requires change, other experts noted.“The goal of the 1987 political system was to have the power watched by the people, prevent someone from seeking more than one-term and to establish procedural democracy,” said Kang Won-taek, political professor at Seoul National University, in an interview published by Shin DongA.Kang suggested opening a discussion on constitutional amendments to change the presidential system to a parliamentary system to have the group of leaders more responsible politically.A single-term presidency has resulted in discontinuity of major long-term policies, and the current system is insufficient to determine the political ability of candidates running for the presidency, he said.On mounting calls for political reform, Yoon Seong-yi, a political professor at Kyung Hee University, focuses on a paradigm shift from a growth-driven industrial society to a digital era. It has made not only the people change their everyday behavior but also their political beliefs, he said.Recent talk of open primaries reflects the people’s growing opposition to unilateral decisions made by leaders and also their desire to decentralize power.“The people today no longer remains obedient to the state. They want to their voices heard and reflect their ideas on policymaking by directly communicating with their representatives through digital platforms,” he said.Calls for political reform and fairer distribution of power also appear to be a global trend. “About half of the major parties in established democracies now use primaries or some other representative method to give the rank-and-file more of a say in choosing their standard bearers,” wrote Moises Naim, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in his book “The End of Power.”Such a phenomenon is a reflection of power “decaying” and “slipping away.”“From Chicago to Milan and New Delhi to Brasilia, the bosses of political machines will readily tell you that they have lost the ability to deliver the votes and decisions that their predecessors took for granted,” he wrote.The Korean political parties are now weighing their options to channel reform as their main campaign platform in the lead up to the 2016 general election. The ruling Saenuri Party leader has called for a simultaneous open primary while the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy returned with a call for new proportional representative system.Pundits said in one way or the other, the rival parties may find it difficult to keep the nomination system for the next general election as the public’s patience is thinning over worsening regional antagonism and corruption.“If a lawmaker wins a nomination from his party and runs for a constituency that has strong and traditional support base for his party, he or she will win the election, 100 percent,” said Yoon Pyeong-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. “They may bow their heads in shows of respect during election campaigns, but they do not fear the people if they already have the nomination in the bag.”By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","south korea into powerful economy ,park political opponents student activists ,problems of south korean democracy ,militant rulers who were desperate ,authoritarian government in central seoul","['Japan', 'South Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the Economist Intelligence Unit', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'Yongsan', 'Park Geun', 'the National Intelligence Service ’s', 'Progressive Party', 'south korean', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'NIS', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Paul Chang', 'Harvard University', 'Chang', 'south korean', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Rhee', 'Hawaii', 'Rhee', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Anti - Yushin', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Army', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'the Gwangju Popular Uprising', 'Chun', 'Roh Tae - woo', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Korea', 'Lee Myung - sik', 'Korea', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'korean', 'Chang', 'Harvard University', 'Kang Won - taek', 'Seoul National University', 'Shin DongA.Kang', 'Yoon Seong - yi', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Moises Naim', 'the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace', 'Chicago', 'Milan', 'New Delhi', 'Brasilia', 'korean', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Yoon Pyeong - joong', 'Hanshin University', 'Cho Chung - un']",16,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.7630856   0.2709074

South Korean President Park Geun-hye shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with U.S. President Barack Obama observing at a trilateral meeting held on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, in March 2014. (Park Hae-mook/ The Korea Herald)Growing nationalism in both countries has further heightened the tension between the two neighbors, limiting the possibilities of enhanced bilateral cooperation, particularly in the security realm in the face of their shared threat of a nuclearizing North Korea.In terms of cooperation in the social, cultural and economic domains, they have made great strides. However, these achievements have been eclipsed by unrelenting squabbles caused by Japan’s ambivalence over its colonial-era atrocities and repeated claims to Dokdo, a set of East Sea islets under Korea’s control.Experts say that both nations should exert more efforts to prevent history issues from further damaging their ties, expand areas of cooperation and pursue a future-oriented partnership that would ultimately contribute to regional peace and prosperity.“Seoul and Tokyo should strive harder to build mutual trust and expand their cooperation in the economic and security domains, particularly when North Korea poses a grave threat and the security landscape is now undergoing a shift triggered by the rise of China,” said Park Young-june, political science professor at Korea National Defense University.Before South Korea and Japan signed a treaty in 1965 to normalize their diplomatic ties, the two countries had few political, cultural and economic exchanges. After World War II, the U.S. envisioned a pacifist, demilitarized Japan. But it retracted the plan and made the archipelago nation a key ally to fend off communist expansion, and the process of holding Japan thoroughly responsible for its wartime aggression foundered.For South Koreans haunted by the traumatic memories of Japan’s 36-year occupation of the peninsula, it was unthinkable to have any relations with its onetime colonizer.The first glimmer of hope for positive relations appeared as the Korean War gave a substantial role for Japan to play: The U.S. used Japan as its military’s staging base to provide logistical support to its forces fighting on the peninsula.But relations between Korea and Japan were still frosty, and their grievances were further aggravated by a set of issues including a fishery conflict in the East Sea. Until the two sides reached a fishery agreement in 1965, which was replaced by a new one in 1999, South Korean authorities had seized hundreds of Japanese fishing boats that violated the so-called Peace Line, a “maritime sovereignty line” demarcated in 1952 by the Syngman Rhee government.Japan’s 1959 decision to send a large number of Korean residents in Japan to North Korea, including many from the South, also infuriated South Koreans. With the North struggling to address its labor shortage and Japan seeking to deport Koreans, the two sides pushed ahead with the “repatriation” project despite strong objections from the South that argued that the decision to send even South Koreans to the North disregarded its sovereignty and international humanitarian principles.With Washington’s push to bring its allies of South Korea and Japan together in a Cold War-era campaign against the former Soviet Union, the two sides eventually reached a landmark deal to normalize their relations on June 22, 1965 – but only after nearly 14 years of grueling negotiations.The negotiations, which began in October 1951, were an extremely tough process, as the two sides viewed Japan’s colonization of Korea differently: Korea still sees it as illegal while Japan argues it was the “legitimate” occupation under a formal annexation treaty.Under the 1965 normalization treaty, Tokyo pledged to offer to Seoul $300 million in free grants, $200 million in long-term loans and $300 million in commercial loans. The financial assistance was offered not in the form of reparations for damages from Japan’s colonization of the peninsula, but mainly “economic cooperation.”The deal, thus, did not include any apology from Japan for the occupation of the peninsula. Critics have called the deal “unfinished,” although they recognize it was an “inevitable compromise” for a poor Korea whose per capita annual gross domestic product was merely worth around $100 by today’s dollar values.The negotiations also prompted vehement protests nationwide here among students, opposition forces and intellectuals, which led to the administration declaring a state of emergency in June 1964.With the military-backed regime in Seoul focusing on economic development and the U.S. pressuring its allies to cooperate during the Cold War, historical conflicts seemed to have been defused to an extent. But after the Cold War ended in 1991, historical issues were brought to the fore as Japan sought a greater security role and South Korea’s civil society increased its voices to demand Japan’s sincere contrition for the country’s colonial atrocities. “Under the authoritarian governments in Korea, people’s voices were tamped down in a sense and were not reflected in policymaking. But with the country democratized and civil society rising, calls for postwar compensation and apologies increased,” said Lee Won-deog, an international politics professor at Kookmin University.Under the so-called Yoshida doctrine, a postwar national strategy centering on economic development based on security backing from the U.S., Japan had long refrained from taking any military role beyond the country. But as the international community called for Japan’s greater security contributions since the 1990s, Tokyo has sought to explore a new national identity. With Japanese right-wingers reviving the memories of its past militarism, Tokyo’s moves toward a “normal state” have, nonetheless, triggered strong resistance from Korea.Japanese politicians’ visits to the Yasukuni Shrine honoring Japanese war dead, Tokyo’s refusal to sincerely address its wartime atrocities, including forced labor and sexual slavery, its claim to Dokdo and distortion of history in textbooks have continued to strain bilateral ties.For the past several years, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s seemingly revisionist view of history and his pursuit of the hawkish security agenda including collective self-defense have further damaged bilateral ties. But not all the reconciliatory efforts have gone down the drain. In 1998, Japanese then-Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi expressed “deep remorse and a heartfelt apology” to Korea for Japan’s colonial rule in a joint statement issued at the close of his summit with Korea’s then-President Kim Dae-jung. Seoul also secured the 1993 Kono Statement and 1995 Murayama Statement that expressed Tokyo’s apology for its wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women, euphemistically called “comfort women,” and its colonization, respectively.Above all, the thorniest historical issue is the comfort women issue. Seoul has argued that the “wartime humanitarian” issue is urgent as only 47 known victims are still alive. Tokyo claims the issue was already settled under the normalization pact.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","territorial feuds south korean president ,feuds south korean president park ,feuds south korean president ,summit with korea then president ,south korean president park geun","['Korea', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'the Nuclear Security Summit', 'the Hague', 'Netherlands', 'Park Hae - mook/', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Park Young', 'Korea National Defense University', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'South Koreans', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Soviet Union', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'South Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Lee Won - deog', 'Kookmin University', 'Yoshida', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'Japanese', 'Keizo Obuchi', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea ’s', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Seoul', 'Murayama Statement', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 2.          1.          0.         ... -0.7651369   0.32675514

Neither the 35-year foreign occupation nor the three-year war, however, could thwart South Korea’s epic political and economic ascent from the ashes. More than 60 years on, the country stands as the world’s 13th-largest economy in terms of gross domestic product, a vibrant democracy and an emerging donor of development assistance seeking to bridge the rich and poor worlds. It is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 major economies.  About 2,000 participants hold up a giant national flag, Taegeukgi, as part of the flash mob event to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea’s Liberation Day at Olympic Park in eastern Seoul, Saturday. Yonhap“While going through the postwar and the Cold War periods, South Korea had to find its own way to survive and prosper between the superpowers such as the U.S., China, Japan and Russia, overcoming the handicap of its territorial division,” Jeong Han-wool, executive director and a senior researcher of the East Asia Institute, an independent think tank, said in a recent report. “For the last 70 years, South Korea has not only risen from poverty but also gone from an aid recipient to one of the major economic donors, along with successful democratization after decades of dictatorship.”Seoul bears almost 2 percent of the U.N.’s annual regular budget of $5.53 billion for 2014-15, respectively, as the agency’s 13th-largest contributor. It also pays a similar share of the U.N.’s peacekeeping operations costs totaling $7.06 billion. In addition, it provides more than $5.5 million to 40 U.N. affiliates and other organizations including the OECD, while funding some 60 projects run by the UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR and other institutions, according to the Foreign Ministry. As of January, 530 South Koreans work at international organizations around the globe, 46 of which are at director or higher levels, elected officials or judges, ministry data shows. Seoul has also given birth to chiefs of key multinational agencies including the U.N. and more recently the International Maritime Organization, while hosting major conferences such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2005, G-20 summit in 2010 and Nuclear Security Summit in 2012. South Korea’s 2010 enrollment in the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee was another milestone. It has since been scaling up its aid commitments and personnel to help developing nations fight poverty, disease, climate change and other mounting tasks. Last year, it doled out more than $1.85 billion in ODA, up about 5.4 percent from a year earlier, becoming the world’s 16th-largest patron.In line with its growing economic might and contribution to world affairs, the country’s national prestige is seen to be improving. In a poll conducted late last year by the Seoul-based EAI, survey firm GlobeScan and the BBC World Service in 21 nations, 38 percent of respondents said that South Korea plays a positive role in the global community, marking a 6 percentage point rise from five years ago, whereas 34 percent projected negative images. The biggest increases came from major Western economies such as the U.S., the U.K. and France, Jeong noted. “Taking into account that the global image of a country is highly correlated with its economic success, it seems that South Korea’s remarkable economic achievements, along with its active role in international organizations such as the G-20, the U.N. and the OECD, have enhanced its global status and positive image among foreign countries,” Jeong added. Under President Park Geun-hye, Seoul has been ramping up what it calls middle-power diplomacy aimed at boosting its say on regional and global conundrums by bridging the advanced and developing worlds. It launched an informal consultation body dubbed MIKTA with Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and Australia in late 2013. Yet the newly defined foray has brought challenges and dilemmas, ranging from a prolonged inter-Korean standoff to volatile relations with Japan. Just like her predecessors, Park has introduced a series of initiatives for cross-border cooperation and unification preparation since her swearing-in in 2013, only to be rejected by Pyongyang and die out even before taking off due chiefly to their unrealistic goals and conflicting action plans. With North Korean leader Kim Jong-un showing no signs of abandoning his nuclear ambition, security concerns and ensuing dependence on the U.S. will likely persist for many years, if not decades, to come, taking a toll on Seoul’s global clout and future potentials of a unified Korea. Japan’s economic handouts offered under a 1965 pact to normalize the bilateral ties provided seed money for the development of nationwide infrastructure and core industries on the war-ravaged soil. Yet South Korea has in recent years grown more vocal in history spats on the back of Japan’s constant attempts to whitewash its imperial past and atrocities including its sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II. Seoul continues to demand an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, which Tokyo claims has already been settled through the 1965 agreement.Their strained ties have placed Washington in a tricky position as they complicate its efforts to bolster trilateral security collaboration with its two prime regional allies in line with its strategic refocus to the Asia Pacific amid a rise of China. “As far as South Korea-Japan relations work normally, the three-way partnership could be a mechanism that responds to security threats in the region such as from North Korea in a most shrewd manner,” Kim Sung-han, a former vice foreign and current international relations professor at Korea University, said in a recent analysis. “As Seoul needs to draw Beijing’s cooperation for future unification, it should keep the partnership from looking like a trilateral alliance against China and driving the broad picture into a South Korea-U.S.-Japan versus North Korea-China-Russia face-off.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","tragedy as north korea invaded ,the world 13th largest economy ,thwart south korea epic political ,after decades of dictatorship seoul ,korea epic political and economic","['japanese', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20', 'Korea ’s Liberation Day', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Jeong Han - wool', 'the East Asia Institute', 'South Korea', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'OECD', 'UNDP', 'UNHCR', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'the International Maritime Organization', 'the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'South Korea ’s', 'the OECD ’s Development Assistance Committee', 'ODA', 'Seoul', 'EAI', 'GlobeScan', 'the BBC World Service', 'South Korea', 'western', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'France', 'Jeong', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.N.', 'OECD', 'Jeong', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Mexico', 'Indonesia', 'Turkey', 'Australia', 'inter - korean', 'Japan', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Kim Sung - han', 'Korea University', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'China', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",8,"[ 6.          4.          0.         ... -0.78173602  0.38226837

""We can't and shouldn't rely on others.""To quickly resume the six-party dialogue, Moon suggested a two-track diplomacy in which South Korea would try to improve inter-Korean ties, as well as North Korea-U.S. relations.""We are the impetus for conversation because we want it most,"" he said, adding South Korea is the country most threatened by the North's nuclear program.The 2012 presidential candidate also insisted that South Korea increase its growth potential by expanding business opportunities in the North. (Yonhap)""Should the two Koreas become an economic unity, with our businesses venturing into the North, our market will instantly expand to represent 80 million people, and our per capita income will top $30,000,"" he said.That would make South Korea only the fourth country after the U.S., Germany and Japan to reach the numerical milestones, he added.Economic integration between the two Koreas, furthermore, would add 0.8 percentage point to South Korea's annual growth and create 50,000 new jobs each year until 2050, according to Moon.The 62-year-old former lawyer, who served as chief of staff to late President Roh Moo-hyun, gave the speech a day after South Korea commemorated the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.South and North Korea celebrated the key anniversary separately after talks to hold a joint event fell through.

Command, has said that the blast site was easily eclipsed by the iron fence and surrounded by trees, making it difficult for South Korean soldiers to spot an enemy approaching, which the North apparently took advantage of. “We’re seeking to improve our monitoring capabilities in key areas by gradually expanding badlands around guard posts and eliminating trees,” the JCS said in a report submitted to the parliamentary panel. Later in the day, the defense committee unanimously adopted a resolution condemning Pyongyang’s provocation and urging an apology and preventive steps. The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy have proposed related texts. The document stipulates the North’s mine-planting as a “clear military provocation in which it attempted to cause South Korean military casualties” which constitutes a direct violation of the multinational armistice and inter-Korean nonaggression pacts. During the session, lawmakers pounded Han for what they called slack and belated responses to the mine attack and a confused approach to Pyongyang, citing the Unification Ministry’s failed offer of ministerial dialogue one day after the incident and the presidential National Security Council’s gathering four days later. Though Seoul indeed appears to have few options for retaliatory measures, the border broadcasts have proved to be a source of intense unease for the regime, which maintains a tight grip over one of the world’s most reclusive societies. In the “Voice of Freedom” program, the Defense Ministry chiefly releases news of the execution of elite military executives and other power struggles within the top echelons, information about free democracy and other regional and global issues, along with weather forecasts and music. Many defectors resettled in the South have testified that they had come to gain knowledge about the South and outside world for the first time through the broadcasts, which can travel as far as 10 kilometers. The loudspeakers were taken down in 2004, following an agreement of the two Koreas’ militaries. They were reinstalled at 11 spots along the Military Demarcation Line following the North’s 2010 sinking of the South’s corvette Cheonan, which prompted Pyongyang to threaten to shoot them down, but have not been used since. Last October, the two Koreas traded fire after the North shot heavy machine guns, apparently aiming at balloons containing flyers denouncing the regime, $1 bills, mini radios and other items. In Washington, meanwhile, the U.S. also issued an official condemnation, calling the communist state’s act a breach of the truce accord. “A UNC Special Investigation Team determined the North Korean People’s Army violated sections of the armistice agreement by placing land mines along a known ROK (South Korea) patrol route,” State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement.“We join the UNC in condemning these violations of the armistice agreement.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","south korean troops last week ,three land mines that exploded ,korean troops last week ,in landmine blast while patrolling ,psychological warfare against north korea","['Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'north korean', 'Han', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Han Ki - ho', 'anti - pyongyang', 'U.N.

His remarks came one day after the Joint Chiefs of Staff announced that North Korean troops had recently crossed the border and planted the three land mines that inflicted serious injuries on two South Korean soldiers last week. In retaliation, the South Korean military restarted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts after more than 11 years, on an irregular basis in two frontline midwest regions and plans to gradually expand them. It issued a full alert on Tuesday and is deploying additional firearms and reconnaissance assets such as CCTV-equipped drones in the areas to better monitor the movement across the Military Demarcation Line and counter any potential attacks. “We will carry out an operation to seize the initiative in the DMZ. Our military will remain unfazed by the incident,” Han told reporters after a meeting with ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers, without elaborating. “We’ve restarted the anti-North Korea psychological warfare broadcasts, and built on that we will look into further steps.”  A North Korean soldier glances at a delegation led by British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond at the border village of Panmunjeom on Tuesday. (Yonhap)In another development, the military is reportedly seeking to take a more proactive posture during search and scouting missions within the DMZ and make their operations more unpredictable by changing times and locations. Under its existing manual, if a North Korean soldier violates the MDL, South Korean troops are required to release verbal warnings and then warning shots before firing an aimed shot. But now they will be allowed to shoot any border-crossing enemy right away. In addition, the lead group will wear galoshes and bring detection devices to prevent future mine casualties. The mine blast occurred Aug. 4 in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. The explosion nearly severed the right ankle of 23-year-old Army staff sergeant surnamed Kim and a larger part of both legs of 21-year-old Ha.After a two-day joint probe through Aug. 7 with the United Nations Command, the JCS spotted North Korea as the culprit, citing steel springs, firing pins and other perceived debris of the detonated devices retrieved from the scene which it found to corroborate with the wooden-box mines used by its military.The Koreas halted propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along their tense border in 2004 in line with a cross-border agreement. The equipment was reinstalled at 11 spots after the North’s 2010 sinking of the South’s corvette Cheonan, which prompted Pyongyang to threaten to shoot it down, but it has not been used since. After initially keeping mum, Cheong Wa Dae urged Pyongyang to apologize for the incident and punish those responsible, calling it a “clear provocation” and a “direct violation” of the armistice agreement and inter-Korean nonaggression pact. The presidential office convened a meeting of the National Security Council last Saturday to be briefed on the issue by Han and explore Seoul’s response. “This case is a clear provocation in which the North Korean troops illegally intruded upon the MDL and intentionally implanted wooden-box mines,” presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said at a news briefing early Saturday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also voiced concerns over the escalating tension on the peninsula, calling on the communist state to stop its provocations and come forward for talks. The U.N. Command on Monday proposed general-level dialogue with its military. North Korea should “fully adhere to the obligations under the armistice agreement and engage in dialogue on this incident,” Ban said in a statement.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","soldiers last week in retaliation ,korean soldiers last week ,south korean soldiers last week ,korean soldiers last week in ,korean military restarted loudspeaker propaganda","['Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'North Korea', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'CCTV', 'the Military Demarcation Line', 'DMZ', 'Han', 'Saenuri Party', 'north Korea', 'north korean', 'british', 'Philip Hammond', 'Panmunjeom', 'DMZ', 'north korean', 'MDL', 'south korean', 'Paju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Army', 'Kim', 'the United Nations Command', 'JCS', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'the National Security Council', 'Han', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'MDL', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'the U.N.

The explosion severed the legs of two staff sergeants.   A South Korean investigation has found that three North Korean wooden-box mines were the cause of the blast, a provocation apparently intended to derail the joint Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise scheduled for next week between Seoul and Washington.   North Korean soldiers are believed to have crossed the military demarcation line to secretly lay the mines around a South Korean military-guarded door that opens to the DMZ possibly late last month, the South Korean military said.  Asked what kinds of retaliation will be taken, Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok declined to elaborate, only saying that ""The substance cannot be disclosed now, but we will wait and see.""  Kim highlighted that the military will ensure the punitive action is taken against North Korea because the country's responsibility for the mine detonation has been clearly proven.  ""This provocation is a clear violation of the armistice agreement and the non-aggression agreements between the South and the North,"" the JCS said also said in the statement, denouncing what it called a ""nasty behavior that is unthinkable for any normal military.""  South Korea's ruling and main opposition parties lashed out at Pyongyang's land mine explosion, calling the act a ""provocation.""  ""North Korea's provocation is an unforgivable act that directly goes against the armistice agreement,"" said Kim Young-woo, a spokesman of the ruling Saenuri Party.

(Yonhap)On the sidelines of the multilateral ASEAN-related meetings in Malaysia, Ri Tong-il, Pyongyang’s former deputy U.N. representative, also warned that the U.S. military buildup targeting the communist state could result in a second Korean War.“While the U.S. resorts to its measures to choke up our economy, it is evading negotiations and dialogue (with the North),” Ri said. “The U.S.’ strategic goal is to eliminate the North’s socialist system.”Meanwhile, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se on Thursday renewed Seoul’s calls for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to uphold Tokyo’s past apologies for its wartime atrocities in his planned speech to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.During his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Malaysia, Yun said that the speech would be important for the two nations to “disentangle” the bilateral relations strained due to historical and territorial squabbles. Kishida reportedly said that in his speech, Abe would express repentance for Japan’s wartime aggression and pledge to continue its path as a pacifist country. Abe is expected to deliver the speech next Friday, according to Japanese media. Analysts say that the prime minister could mention Japan’s repentance for its wartime atrocities, but might not touch on its 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. During the 18-minute talk, the two ministers shared the viewpoint that Seoul and Tokyo needed to work together to promote a “virtuous cycle” in enhancing bilateral ties, a Seoul official told reporters, declining to be named.They also agreed to continue close communication to push for a trilateral summit among the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan at the “earliest convenient time” this year as agreed upon during the trilateral meeting among the three foreign ministers in March in Seoul.Foreign ministers of 27 Asia-Pacific states discussed an array of regional and global security issues including escalating maritime disputes in the South China Sea and North Korea’s development of nuclear arms during a regional security forum in Malaysia.At the ASEAN Regional Forum, Yun, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and others explored ways to defuse tensions from the territorial disputes and enhance cooperation on climate change, health security and other issues.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong also attended the multilateral forum. Capitalizing on the ASEAN-related meetings, Yun tried to secure cooperation from the international community in preventing the North from engaging in yet another provocative act and pressuring it to come out for dialogue. Speculation has been rising that the North would launch provocations such as a long-range rocket launch around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of its ruling Workers’ Party, in order to strengthen national unity and show off its military might to the outside world.Before the ARF foreign ministers’ meeting, the ministers also attended the “ASEAN plus three” meeting including the three Northeast Asian states of South Korea, China and Japan, and the East Asia Summit meeting, where Yun also stressed the need to pay more attention to the evolving nuclear threats from the North.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","remove its socialist regime thursday ,conference in malaysia on thursday ,thursday renewed seoul calls for ,atrocities in his planned speech ,deliver the speech next friday","['North Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.N.', 'Malaysia', 'ASEAN', 'Malaysia', 'Ri Tong - il', 'Pyongyang ’s', 'U.N.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Ri', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'the ASEAN Regional Forum', 'Malaysia', 'Yun', 'Kishida', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Malaysia', 'Yun', 'U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi', 'north korean', 'Ri Su - yong', 'ASEAN', 'yun', 'Workers ’ Party', 'ARF', 'ASEAN', 'northeast asian', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Yun', 'Song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 2.          2.          0.         ... -0.49461767  0.68538386

""It should be reviewed carefully.""    Both sides have also shared information on the current security status of North Korea, confirming the prospect that the communist country is highly likely to test-launch a long-range missile or conduct other military provocations, the official noted.    Mindful of South Korea's security concerns, the Japanese side has offered an explanation on its moves to reconfigure national security laws and other rearmament steps in recent years.    Japan had wanted to discuss a South Korean visit by the country's defense minister within this year, but Seoul did not accept it, citing ""improper timing,"" according to the official.

The domestically built MLRS, named “Chunmoo,” is poised to beef up South Korea’s artillery counterstrike capabilities with a range of up to 80 kilometers, more than twice that of the existing “Guryong.” The Defense Agency for Technology and Quality has injected some 131.4 billion won ($112.4 million) into the project since 2009. It completed research and development in late 2013 and carried out initial production in August 2014. “The advanced MLRS has precision strike firepower that can burn to the ground an area as large as three football fields combined all at once, out of the range of North Korean long-range artillery weapons,” Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “When deployed in earnest, it will likely be operating as a key asset in counterfire warfare, while contributing to future defense exports.” The Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province-based DATQ held a launching ceremony in Changwon. About 100 officials participated from the military, Defense Acquisition Program Administration, manufacturer Doosan DST and its contractors. Consisting of a mobile launcher and ammunition carrier vehicle, the Chunmoo is equipped with a firing control system that facilitates real-time precision strikes and is capable of firing 239-milimeter guided missiles and 227 mm and 130 mm unguided missiles. The Army is expected to gradually expand the stationing of the equipment from frontline artillery units to border islands in the West Sea until next year, officials said. By Shin Hyon-hee(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","army on tuesday began deploying ,next generation multiple launch rocket ,korean artillery threats and boost ,deploying next generation multiple launch ,tuesday began deploying next generation","['Army', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'MLRS', 'Chunmoo', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Defense Agency for Technology', 'Quality', 'MLRS', 'north korean', 'Defense Ministry', 'Kim Min -', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'DATQ', 'Changwon', 'Defense Acquisition Program Administration', 'Doosan dst', 'Chunmoo', 'Army']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23970887 -0.09932085

The six countries -- the two Koreas, Japan, China, Russia and the United States -- will join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other partner states for a series of annual ASEAN-led meetings to be held in Kuala Lumpur starting Wednesday. Among them, the security-focused ASEAN Regional Forum on Thursday is expected to be watched closely as it's the only gathering to involve North Korea.It will be their first meeting since the U.S. and other world powers struck a deal with Iran last month to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief.Although officials and experts highlight major differences between Iran and North Korea, they also agree that fresh momentum has been added to the six-party talks due in part to the Iran deal's demonstration that negotiations can work. The six-party talks have not been held since late 2008 after North Korea backtracked on past agreements.Bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table has gained urgency especially as the communist state is widely expected to launch another provocation, possibly a long-range missile test, in October to mark a key anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party.South Korea's chief nuclear negotiator, Hwang Joon-kook, recently said Seoul and Beijing share the notion that North Korea stands at a crossroads between completing its nuclear development and returning to denuclearization talks.North Korea has so far indicated no interest in talks, insisting its nuclear weapons are a deterrent against U.S. hostility toward it.The ARF will also set the stage for a meeting between Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his North Korean counterpart, Ri Su-yong.Expectations of a formal bilateral meeting are low, however, as tensions between the sides remain high over various issues, including Seoul's efforts to increase international pressure on Pyongyang over its human rights abuses.Last year, the two ministers briefly met on the sidelines of the ARF meeting in Myanmar, but they did not hold talks.Both Koreas will likely engage in competitive diplomacy with the ASEAN states to include a clause in the chairman's statement, which will summarize the discussions at the ARF meeting.South Korea has sought to include a clause each year that urges North Korea to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions and past six-party agreements aimed at North Korea's denuclearization.North Korea's meetings with China and Japan will also be watched as their relations with Beijing have been frayed over the nuclear impasse and progress has been slow in efforts to resolve the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea in the past.Talks are under way for a meeting between South Korea's foreign minister and his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, as Seoul pays keen attention to an upcoming statement by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which will mark the anniversary of the end of World War II. Seoul wants Tokyo to offer a clear apology for its wartime atrocities, including its sexual enslavement of Korean women for its soldiers, but Japan maintains that the issue has been resolved by past administrations.If the two ministers meet, they will also likely discuss preparations for a trilateral summit with China later this year.Dominating the ARF meeting will be a fierce debate over the territorial dispute in the South China Sea, with China and the U.S. vying to have their voices heard.South Korea's position in the dispute has been that it is in its interest to maintain peace and stability in the waters that serve as a key trade route for the country.On the sidelines of the ARF meeting, Yun also plans to meet with his counterparts from China, Russia, Indonesia and the European Union, said an official at the Foreign Ministry.He said that South Korea is seeking to hold bilateral meetings with the U.S. and Japan, as well as a trilateral meeting with the two nations, but nothing has been decided yet. (Yonhap)","asean regional forum on thursday ,dismantling north korea nuclear weapons ,last month to curb iran ,meet in malaysia this week ,month to curb iran uranium","[""North Korea 's"", 'Malaysia', 'Koreas', 'Japan', 'China', 'Russia', 'the United States', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'ASEAN', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'ASEAN Regional Forum', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', ""Workers ' Party"", ""South Korea 's"", 'Hwang Joon - kook', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'ARF', 'Yun Byung - se', 'north korean', 'Ri Su - yong', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'ARF', 'Myanmar', 'Koreas', 'ASEAN', 'ARF', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'U.N.

Chang added that while he doesn't yet have specific plans to visit South Korea, it is ""not a bad idea"" to make a cross-border trip.   Last August, the ITF and the Seoul-based World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) reached a breakthrough agreement to allow North Korean athletes to take part in the martial art at Summer Olympics.   Currently, the WTF, led by South Korean Choue Chung-won, is the only global taekwondo body sanctioned by the IOC, and only the athletes of countries recognized by the WTF are allowed to compete in the Olympics.

Kim Moo-sung.  Ban had planned on visiting North Korea’s border city of Gaeseong last May on the occasion of his visit to the South to attend a forum. But the visit, which was hoped to defrost tension between the two Koreas, was cancelled at the last minute by the North.Ban and Kim’s meeting lasted for about 45 minutes as watchers back home pointed to the two as strong presidential hopefuls. Kim has been taking the lead in the latest polls for the next president, while Ban has also been a longtime favorite among voters despite his denial of having any domestic political plans.Saenuri Party officials accompanying Kim said domestic politics was not broached in the two‘s conversation.Separately, Kim was quoted as telling Korean correspondents in New York, “I am not yet qualified to be the presidential candidate.” “My priority is to get the conservative right-wing Saenuri Party’s hold on power. The issue of whether I would become the president or not is a next question,” said Kim, whose U.S. visit has been widely perceived as part of a platform to solidify his conservative support base.Ban has also repeatedly denied any desire to run for president, saying that he cannot afford to divert his attention away from his work as the U.N. chief. He had asserted that he had no interest in domestic politics and described as “ungrounded” and “underside” the attempt to brand him as a contender for the next presidency.During the meeting, both reaffirmed President Park Geun-hye’s initiative to expand support for impoverished young children in North Korea and assessed the efforts to improve inter-Korean relations and consolidate peace process in the region, UN officials said. Ban requested the Korean National Assembly’s support to expand Korea’s donations to the Official Development Assistance, foreign aid for economic development of developing countries, while Kim asked Ban to bring more of the international community’s attention to Pyeongyang’s nuclear development, said Kim Yong-woo, spokesperson of the Saenuri Party.   By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","meeting both reaffirmed president park ,north korea back to talks ,moon on thursday vowed to ,support to expand korea donations ,two koreas this year hope","['U.N', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Inter - Korea', 'New York', 'North Korea', 'Ban', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - Sung', 'United Nations', 'U.N.', 'Koreas', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Ban', 'U.S.', 'Ban Ki - moon(right', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Ban', 'North Korea ’s', 'Gaeseong', 'Koreas', 'Ban', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Ban', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'two‘', 'Kim', 'korean', 'New York', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim', 'U.S.', 'Ban', 'U.N.', 'Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'UN', 'Ban', 'the Korean National Assembly ’s', 'Korea', 'the Official Development Assistance', 'Kim', 'Ban', 'Pyeongyang', 'Kim Yong - woo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48250797  0.70476276

In May, North Korea called off Ban's visit to an inter-Korean industrial complex in North Korea's border city of Kaesong.Ban was scheduled to meet with South Korean business leaders and North Korean workers in the factory park. He would have been the first U.N. chief to visit the complex since its launch in 2004. Ban's planned visit to Kaesong sparked speculation in South Korea that it could be the beginning of a political campaign ahead of the presidential election slated for December 2017.Local polls have often ranked Ban, a former foreign minister of South Korea, as one of the most popular possible contenders.""There was not a word about local politics,"" Kim said after the meeting.Meanwhile, Kim said earlier that he is putting the success of his party in the next presidential election ahead of the ""issue of whether I would become president."" (Yonhap)Kim made the remark during a meeting with South Korean correspondents in New York, even though he said he considers himself ""unqualified to be a presidential runner.""""The highest priority is to get the conservative, right-wing Saenuri Party to hold on to power and the issue of whether I would become president is a next question,"" he said.Kim, a five-term lawmaker, has seen his popularity surge, especially after he led the party to victory in April's by-elections, with a voter survey putting him ahead of all possible candidates in the next presidential election.Kim has been on a visit to the U.S. that earlier took him to Washington, where he held a series of meetings with senior U.S. government officials and congressional leaders to talk about North Korea, the alliance between the two countries and other issues.""As part of parliamentary exchanges, I met with U.S. political leaders,"" Kim said. ""I reaffirmed through the meetings that the U.S. is a staunch ally for us forever.""Kim said the U.S. has been unsuccessful in finding a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue.""As North Korea is refusing dialogue, the U.S. has been unable to find a solution,"" Kim said. ""The U.S. may suggest putting off the issue as the term of President (Barack) Obama is nearing its end. As our burden will be increased in such a case, we have to find a breakthrough.""Kim said U.S. politicians expressed concerns about the strained relations between Seoul and Tokyo, and he told them that it is important for Japan to stop distorting history and resolve historical issues before the two countries move forward.

Seiler, the U.S. special envoy for the six-party talks, is joining the session after holding meetings with his counterparts in South Korea and China earlier this week.After meetings in Seoul on Monday, he said North Korea should learn a lesson from the progress in the U.S.-led efforts to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program.""We will continue to explore the lessons learned as it were from our experience in negotiations on the Iran deal and see what we can do to apply those lessons to bring the DPRK to the negotiating table,"" he said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Following a visit to China last week, Hwang Joon-kook, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, told reporters this week that North Korea stands at a crossroads between completing its nuclear development and returning to denuclearization talks.South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly stressed that they are open to dialogue with the North. In the absence of a response from the North, however, they have also warned of greater pressure on the communist state.They have called on China, North Korea's largest ally and benefactor, to play a bigger role in reining in Pyongyang's nuclear program.Speaking in a rare press conference in Beijing on Tuesday, North Korean Ambassador to China Ji Jae-ryong flatly rejected talks aimed at first unilaterally freezing or dismantling his country's nuclear program.The trilateral session in Tokyo is also expected to be used as a forum to coordinate the three countries' position on the North Korean issue before it is raised and discussed at the ASEAN Regional Forum in Malaysia next week.

As usual, it did not specify the date. Wonsan is known as his hometown.The contest was the second of its kind in the North's seven-decade history, according to the KCNA.It was held on the occasion of the 62nd anniversary of the Armistice Agreement that has effectively ended the 1950-53 Korean War. The North celebrates it as Victory Day.Kim said the contest was intended to ""bring about a radical turn in the drills to round off preparations for a war full of the will to settle with arms accounts with the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, and the South Korean puppet group keen to escalate the confrontation with the fellow countrymen and that of social systems, seized with sycophancy toward the U.S.,"" the KCNA said in its English-version report.In an ensuing speech, Army Gen. Ri Yong-gil, chief of the General Staff of the North's military, also said the peninsula is on the brink of another conflict like the Korean War.Ri accused the U.S. and South Korea of continuing ""distortions and reckless war plots.""On Wednesday, the North's foreign ministry demanded the allies stop their regular joint defense exercises first in order to resume dialogue.It said talks are not being held due to Washington's ""hostile policy"" on Pyongyang.The U.S. is misleading public opinions through distortions, an unnamed ministry spokesman said, citing remarks by Sydney Seiler, Washington's special envoy for the six-party talks.On his trip to Seoul earlier this week, Seiler said his government is willing to talk with the North with flexibility shown in the nuclear deal with Iran.""Dialogue won't be held and the vicious cycle of worsening security situations will continue before the U.S. shows its seriousness on dialogue by halting joint military trainings,"" the spokesman said.It was confirmed that the North's Air Force chief has been promoted to a four-star general, another sign that the young leader Kim places more emphasis on the Air Force.A photo released by the North's media showed Choe Yong-ho, who commands the Air and Anti-Air Force of the Korean People's Army, being put on the rank of a four-star general. Choe was a three-star commander when he made a public appearance for Kim's ""field guidance"" for female pilots on June 22.Choe has apparently emerged as a top military aide to Kim, having accompanied the leader on his public activities more than ten times this year alone.

Even before last year, the assault rifle had defects in many other parts, including barrel movement during firing and the striking mechanism. The agency has successfully developed the technology to reduce the shock generated in firing the 5.56 mm rounds by as much as 40 percent and it is also reviewing a design to decrease the shock of launching the 20 mm shells, Jung said. The envisioned upgrade may cut back by 10 percent the weight of the K-11 rifle, now weighing 6.1 kilograms, he said.The upgrade is also likely to strengthen the ammunition power of the rifle while modifying it to be better fitting for human use, he also said.Since its launch in 1970, the agency has replaced 171 of the military's imported weapons with domestically produced ones while developing precise guided missiles against North Korea's military threats, he said, adding that the agency is also nearing the completion of a 2.76-inch guided missile to better respond to North Korea's military threats over the border islands and the capital area. (Yonhap)","korea will complete major upgrade ,last year the assault rifle ,weapons development with an annual ,assault rifle was suspended last ,annual state budget of trillion","['South Korea', 'k-11', 'Army', 'k-11', 'Hong - yong', 'k-11', 'Army', 'Jung', ""North Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's""]",16,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.64576912  0.22854441

Jang Il-hun (right) is joined by councilor Kwon Jong Gun as he speaks during a news conference on Tuesday at the communist state’s mission in New York. (AP-Yonhap)Based on its analysis of commercial satellite imagery, 38 North, run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, claimed that a new phase of construction, which began in spring 2015 after the completion of a taller gantry tower, appears to have been completed. “A movable support platform is probably now finished and apparently is a much larger structure than originally anticipated, measuring about 24 meters long, 30 meters wide and about 33 meters in height,” the website said, adding that a launch-support building at the end of the pad has also been completed.Each stage of space launch vehicles and payload can be prepared horizontally in the new launch-support building and then transferred to the movable support structure, where they will be erected vertically, checked out and finally moved to the launch tower, the website explained. Speculation has been rising that Pyongyang could set off military provocations around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, in order to strengthen national unity and show off its military strength to the outside world.The U.S. website, however, pointed out that there are still no indications that any test preparations are underway to support a long-range rocket launch. It also noted that there was no public evidence to suggest that a decision had been made by the North Korean leadership to push ahead with a missile launch.“In the coming weeks, if preparations are indeed underway, we would expect to see other on-the ground indications at Sohae (the launch site) including increased rail activity and the possible arrival of missile-related railcars, activity at facilities associated with rocket assembly, the filling of oxidizer and fuel storage tanks associated with the launch pad, activity at range radars intended to track a launch and possibly the arrival of VIPs to observe a launch,” 38 North said.Explaining the new facilities at the launch site, a Seoul official said that based on his analysis of the imagery, he has yet to discover any facilities which will be used to assemble each stage of a rocket for a launch.“There were no facilities yet for the assembly of rocket components,” he said, declining to be named. “Should the North launch a long-range rocket, it would separate each stage of the rocket, which has been developed at a factory near Pyongyang, then transport the parts via train or other vehicles to Dongchang-ri, and then put them together there for a launch.”Regarding speculation of the North’s possible provocation, Pyongyang’s Deputy Ambassador to the U.N. Jang Il-hun told the press that his country is “free to do anything” as a sovereign state.“We made it clear in the past that North Korea would respond to the U.S.’ military deterrence and pressure, with our modernized, expanded and strengthened nuclear weapons,” he said.“Among all these possibilities, none of them has been ruled out, though I am not in a position to tell you about what exactly will happen.”South Korea’s Unification Ministry said its military authorities and government are closely monitoring North Korea’s military activities, as there has always been the possibility of a North Korean provocation.“We are prepared and ready to make our due, legitimate response should something (regarding the North) transpire,” ministry spokesperson Jeong Jun-hee said during a regular press briefing.By Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","during news conference on tuesday ,coming months north korea deputy ,launch pad in north korea ,vips to observe launch 38 ,completed research website said reinforcing","['North Korea ’s', 'Dongchang', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kwon Jong Gun', 'New York', 'AP', 'the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Sohae', 'North', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Dongchang - ri', 'North ’s', 'Pyongyang ’s', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea ’s Unification Ministry', 'North Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Jeong Jun - hee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34693268  0.70224208

432,432,China touts its intervention in Korean War as Kim Jong-un pays tribute,"China has touted its intervention in the 1950-53 Korean War as an ""indelible mark on history"" of its friendship with North Korea after the North's leader Kim Jong-un paid tribute to the Chinese soldiers killed during the war.

The Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950, when tank-led North Korean troops invaded South Korea. The United States and 20 other allied countries fought on the side of South Korea under the United Nations flag, while Chinese soldiers came to help North Korea. The conflict ended in a cease-fire on July 27, 1953. The North's young leader Kim laid a wreath at a cemetery of Chinese war dead earlier this week in the wake of the 62nd anniversary of the end of the war. Asked about Kim's tribute to the Chinese war dead, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a brief statement, ""The historic contribution made by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to maintaining peace and China-DPRK (North Korea) friendship will leave an indelible mark on history."" It was China's first official response to Kim's tribute, and the statement was posted on the Chinese ministry's website late Tuesday. China's state-controlled media organizations have showed keen attention to the tribute. Political ties between North Korea and China, once billed as close as ""lips and teeth,"" remain strained over the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. Diplomatic sources said China has invited Kim to attend events in Beijing marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, but it is unclear whether he will accept the invitation. Despite warming ties between South Korea and China, the Chinese view of how the Korean War started remains controversial. China's school textbooks stop short of mentioning that North Korea's invasion sparked the Korean War, and the Chinese Communist Party officially refers to the three-year conflict as ""The War to Resist the U.S. and Aid North Korea.""

The process of the anthrax sample's delivery and steps taken after the delivery, including the disposal of the sample, will be subject to the firsthand inspection, it said. The schedule of the on-site probe was confirmed in the first meeting of the joint working group held earlier in the day at the ministry in Seoul.The Pentagon said in May that live anthrax samples were accidentally sent from a military laboratory in Utah to other labs in the U.S. and several foreign countries in April, including the lab at the Osan Air Base. (Yonhap)""The on-site visit is expected to defuse public worries by having firsthand verification on whether actions have been taken properly on the concerned facility and those who have been exposed in accordance with the safety guidelines at home and abroad throughout the first shipment and to the disposal,"" the statement read. Anthrax is a lethal disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which is a toxic substance often used to produce biochemical weapons. In 2001, anthrax-laced letters were mailed to U.S. news media and Senate offices and killed five people.As part of next week's inspection, the group of people who handled the live sample in April will enter South Korea and perform a demonstration of how it was tested and disposed of then, the ministry noted.The joint working group will review law revisions aimed at preventing the recurrence of a similar accident and report the result to the joint Status of Forces Agreement committee in December, it noted, adding that it will also delve into ways to step up the allies' cooperation on defense against biochemical weapons, especially from North Korea. Amid growing public outcry over the inbound shipment of the lethal bacterium, the ministry vowed more fact-finding efforts last week, including the on-site probe of the military lab.

The North Korean Ambassador to China, Ji Jae-ryong, also declined to comment on China's role in resolving the North's nuclear issue, apparently reflecting strained political ties between the allies. ""We are not interested at all in dialogue to discuss the issue of freezing or dismantling our nukes unilaterally first,"" Ji told about 50 journalists from international media organizations in a rare press conference at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing.""The nuclear deterrence of the DPRK is not a plaything to be put on the negotiating table,"" Ji said. His remarks were translated into English by an interpreter.The DPRK is the acronym of North Korea's official name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The U.S., five world powers and Iran reached a landmark deal earlier this month that will curb Iran's nuclear capabilities in return for lifting sanctions. North Korea has already said it is not interested in Iran-style nuclear talks. Ji said at the conference that Iran's nuclear agreement is an achievement made by ""protracted efforts to have its independent right for nuclear activity.""""But, the situation of the DPRK is quite different from that of Iran. The DPRK is a nuclear weapons state both in name and in reality,"" he continued. ""And it has an interest as a nuclear weapons state."" Ji held the press conference on the day when Sydney Seiler, the U.S. special envoy for North Korea's nuclear program, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing. Sieler is on a three-nation trip that also included South Korea and Japan. In Seoul on Monday, Seiler told reporters that North Korea should learn from the Iran deal, although there are no signs that Pyongyang is willing to give up its nuclear weapons program.  China is North Korea's economic lifeline and diplomatic backer, but their political relations have remained strained over the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. Ji declined to comment on China's role in resolving the issue. ""On the question related to the bilateral relationship between the DPRK and China, I have no more information so far,"" Ji said.North Korea, which conducted its third and most powerful nuclear test in 2013, has a track record of starting a crisis, coming to negotiations and reaching an agreement in exchange for economic and other concessions, then ditching the deal. Mindful of the North's behavior, South Korea and the U.S. have called for Pyongyang to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization through action before the six-party talks can resume. Diplomatic efforts by China, North Korea's long-time ally, have still been seen as more accommodating toward Pyongyang. The multilateral talks among the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia have been at a standstill since late 2008.Wearing a dark-blue suit, the North Korean ambassador read out a prepared statement before answering three short questions. Ji's statement called for South Korea and the U.S. to halt their annual joint military drills on the Korean Peninsula in the coming weeks, while blaming Washington's ""hostile policy"" toward North Korea for the long-running impasse over the North's nuclear program. ""We have the power to cope with any kinds of war methods of the U.S. imperialists and have the strong power to restrain the provocative nuclear war acts of the U.S.,"" Ji said.

Kim Moo-sung, chairman of South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party without saying what provocation it would be, according to the party's spokesman, Rep. Kim Young-woo, who was present in the meeting.Kim did not identify the U.S. intelligence official.South Korean officials have said the North could conduct a long-range rocket or missile test around the October anniversary as the regime has completed the upgrading of its west coast rocket launch site so as to make it accommodate bigger rockets.The U.S. intelligence official was also quoted as saying that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un appears to be making major policy decisions on his own, and the execution of close aides is believed to be part of a process to consolidate his grip on power.The official also said the U.S. is paying greater attention to the North's human rights abuses.Referring to the North's test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile in May, the U.S. official also told South Korean lawmakers that the U.S. is taking note of the fact that the missile was fired from under water, according to the spokesman.The U.S. official was also quoted as saying that relations between China and North Korea are not good, but Beijing is against imposing sanctions strong enough to put the North into trouble.Kim has been on a nine-day visit to the U.S. since Saturday.Also Monday, Kim delivered an address at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stressing that South Korea and the U.S. should put together an alternative convincing enough for North Korea to give up its ""byeongjin"" policy of pursuing economic and nuclear development at the same time.The U.S. should exercise creativity to come up with such an alternative so as to end the standoff over the North's nuclear program, just as it has resolved the Iranian nuclear problem and restored full diplomatic relations with Cuba, Kim said.Kim also called for support for unification of the Korean Peninsula, saying it would serve as a growth engine for Northeast Asian countries and contribute to world peace and stability.Unification could come earlier than thought, he said.He emphasized the importance of the U.S. and the South maintaining strong capabilities to deter North Korea, saying the communist regime can stage armed provocations at any time depending on its domestic situation.The Korea-U.S. alliance is developing into a ""global alliance""that deals with not only bilateral issues, but also global matters, Kim said, adding that he is certain the alliance will become stronger in the future.Also Monday, Kim held a close-door meeting with Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee.During the meeting, Kim stressed the importance of Japan making a sincere apology for its wartime atrocities, saying Japan's perception of history has been an obstacle to security cooperation between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan, according to Rep. Kim Jong-hoon, who also attended the meeting.McCain told Kim in response that he calls for a sincere apology whenever he meets with Japanese officials and he will continue to do so in the future, according to the lawmaker.

Xi also called for greater efforts to open up the province of Liaoning, they said.The visit came just nine days after Xi traveled to the nearby province of Jilin on July 16-18, a trip seen as leaving open the possibility of economic cooperation with North Korea. Such successive visits to the northeast region near the North are considered unusual, and some observers interpret these trips as a message of his willingness to mend fences with Pyongyang.Relations between North Korea and China significantly soured after Xi took office in late 2012 and the North carried out its third nuclear test a few months later, a provocative move seen as a slight to Beijing.Xi has neither visited the North nor met with its young leader, Kim Jong-un, although he visited the South and held a series of summit meetings with South Korean President Park Geun-hye. He is the first Chinese leader to visit South Korea before North Korea.In a move seen as an olive branch to China, the North's leader also expressed gratitude for China's help during the 1950-53 Korean War as he delivered a speech marking the end of the conflict. Kim did not even mention China in a similar speech last year.China has long been the main provider of economic aid and diplomatic support for the North.Analysts say that China, which considers North Korea as something of a buffer zone, fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border and ultimately the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation next door.

He also paid a courtesy call on South Korea's top nuclear negotiator Hwang Joon-kook.

With no one remaining under quarantine and 12 confirmed patients still at hospitals for treatment, Seoul is to announce a “de-facto end” of the health crisis Tuesday.“We can now confirm that the possibility of community-transmission of the virus is almost zero,” said Choo Moo-jin, head of the Korean Medical Association, at a meeting with government officials and private health experts Monday.The MERS outbreak has killed 36 and infected 186 since the index case was confirmed on May 20. The spread has consistently shown signs of fading, with no additional cases confirmed since July 6. The health crisis pushed the nation’s health authorities to put nearly 16,700 people under quarantine to prevent possible infection from May 30 to July 25, all of whom have now been released. Meanwhile, a total of 138 patients have fully recovered and were discharged from hospitals.  Seoul is to announce its “de-facto end” of the health crisis Tuesday. (Yonhap)The World Health Organization states that the declaration of an end to an outbreak should be made at least 28 days after the last confirmed patient has completely recovered. Among the 12 confirmed patients remaining in hospitals in Korea, 11 have tested negative for the virus and are currently being treated for after-effects of the disease. Of these, three are said to be in unstable condition, although the Health Ministry refused to identify them. It also did not comment further on the condition of the last remaining MERS-positive patient.“We predict that the official announcement can be made as early as late August,” said Kim Woo-joo, a doctor and the head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases. “The medical staff are doing their best for the recovery of the last remaining MERS-positive patient.”Although the official declaration will have to come later, the purpose of Tuesday’s announcement was to inform the public that the outbreak is practically over and it is now completely safe to return to their normal lives, according to the Health Ministry. The MERS outbreak has dramatically affected the everyday lives of Koreans and the nation’s economy since late May, as it sparked a public health scare and eventually dampened consumer spending. Almost 3,000 schools nationwide were shut down in June, while more than 124,000 foreign tourists, mostly from China, canceled their trips to Korea in the same month.The Bank of Korea cut its 2015 growth estimate to 2.8 percent from 3.1 percent earlier this month, citing the MERS outbreak as one of the biggest factors. Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, who has been criticized for his handling of the outbreak, is likely to be replaced once the official announcement declaring the end of the outbreak is made.

As of end-June, the fund stood at an outstanding 12.4 trillion won ($10.7 billion).The ministry said it will overhaul ways to run the fund so as to provide project-based assistance to the North, a departure from its current practice of offering only emergency relief.To this end, the government plans to specify the areas where civilian groups could offer humanitarian aid such as healthcare, agriculture and forestation.""Through the overhaul, necessary aid including food and others could be delivered (to the North) on a project basis,"" Jeong Joon-hee, the ministry spokesman, said in a regular press briefing.South Korea has almost suspended its massive assistance to North Korea at the government level since 2010, when it imposed economic sanctions on Pyongyang following the North's attacks on a South Korean warship and a border island that year. But Seoul has continued to allow civilian groups to extend aid to the North.Seoul said in May that it will encourage more civic groups to increase support to North Korea in non-political areas if they are deemed to promote national unity and reconciliation.

(Yonhap)In recent years, defense discourse here has centered on countering the North’s strategic weapons systems such as ballistic missiles and nuclear arms, while attention to more existential threats -- long-range artillery and multiple rocket launchers -- appears to be insufficient.Though its intentions remain unclear, Pyongyang’s dispatch of the four 122 mm-caliber rocket launchers on Galdo Island, just 4.5 kilometers away from South Korea’s Yeonpyeongdo Island, was a stern reminder that the artillery threats continue to escalate and need greater policy attention, analysts said.“North Korea’s long-range artillery, multiple rocket launchers and short-range missiles are the most serious security challenge facing South Korea, as these could inflict huge damages in the beginning phase of an armed conflict, even if the South may ultimately win,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.“When those weapons are used against the South all at once, there are virtually no viable means to counter them -- a reason why it is crucial for us to maintain deterrence by communicating a clear, repeated message to the North that a provocation would trigger a stronger, costly retaliation.”According to Seoul’s 2014 defense white paper, the communist state has a total of 14,100 artillery pieces including 5,500 multiple rocket launchers, a majority of which have been deployed near the heavily-fortified border. The South, however, has only 5,800 artillery pieces including just 200 multiple rocket launchers -- a reason why the North’s artillery is still seen as an “asymmetric threat.” The North’s major long-range artillery pieces are 170 mm-caliber self-propelled howitzers and 240 mm multiple rocket launchers, which have ranges of up to 65 kilometers -- long enough to strike military targets in Seoul and its surrounding areas. The North has also been developing the longer-range 300 mm multiple rocket launcher, which is thought to be equipped with a GPS navigation system. This rocket system can strike key U.S. military installations in Pyeongtaek and Osan in Gyeonggi Province, and the headquarters of South Korea’s Army, Navy and Air Force in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province.In close cooperation with the U.S. Forces Korea, South Korea has been working to improve its defense against North Korea’s artillery forces. But their responses to the threats can only be limited given the overwhelming size of the North’s artillery.“Yes, in tactical terms, threats from North Korea’s artillery are greater (than those from long-range missiles). We have been striving hard to deal with these threats with a plan to strengthen counterfire capabilities of regional units,” a defense official told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity.“Although the media and experts have focused on the issues of threats from North Korea’s development of intercontinental missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, nuclear warheads and other weapons of mass destruction, our military has also paid due attention to our counter-fire capabilities.”Despite the escalating threats from the North’s artillery, Seoul’s allocation of defense budgets and policy attention have been focused on developing counters to Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear arsenal, such as the Korea Air and Missile Defense program and the Kill Chain preemptive strike system.Many ideas have been put forward to deal with North Korea’s artillery, though budgetary issues have always come in the way. Among them was purchasing a weapons system called, “counter-rocket artillery mortar,” or C-RAM. One of the most well-known C-RAM platforms is the Israeli-made Iron Dome, which Israel has effectively used to fend off rocket attacks from Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which is home to 1.26 million Palestine refugees.Seoul defense officials are known to have conducted research on the feasibility of applying the Iron Dome defense system to protect key state facilities in the Seoul metropolitan area. But they are said to have decided against it due to the cost effectiveness and the peninsula’s mountainous terrain that analysts say would make the system less effective.Military experts say that since it is impossible to successfully counter massive rocket attacks, Seoul needs to strengthen its capabilities to monitor the North’s artillery movements with advanced surveillance and reconnaissance assets, and capacity to strike key artillery units in the North promptly should deterrence fail.Close coordination with the U.S. artillery force is also important, they noted. Earlier this year, the U.S. military decided to deploy another multiple-launch-rocket-system battalion to Korea on a rotational basis.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","other artillery targeting seoul and ,massive rocket attacks seoul needs ,and other artillery targeting seoul ,other artillery targeting seoul ,counter massive rocket attacks seoul","['North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Galdo', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yonhap)In', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yeonpyeongdo Island', 'Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Osan', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Gyeryongdae', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'North ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'North Korea ’s', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'North Korea ’s', 'C - RAM', 'Israeli', 'Iron Dome', 'Israel', 'Hamas', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Palestine', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.57611942  0.1353765

The U.S. authorities confirmed that live anthrax samples had been mistakenly delivered to 86 military labs in 20 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and seven foreign nations -- South Korea, Australia, Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy and Germany.Announcing the outcome of the U.S.’ probe into the case, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall admitted that the shipment was a “serious and inexcusable mistake.”“This was a mistake. As the secretary said, it was a serious mistake. It should never have happened. It’s an inexcusable mistake. We’re taking the actions to correct it,” Kendall told reporters.“It was an unintended delivery. It was anthrax that was believed to have been inactivated and not live and not able to grow that went to an air force base in Korea to a laboratory for testing. I don’t think it ever would have gone anywhere else,” he added.After the release of the investigation outcome, the U.S. Forces Korea vowed to continue joint efforts with South Korea to ensure that bilateral defense programs would continue in a “safe and effective” manner to protect Koreans and the two militaries. “Alliance biological defense programs are designed to enhance Alliance readiness and defensive capabilities in the face of a very real and significant biological threat,” USFK commander Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti was quoted as saying in an official press release. “The establishment of the ROK (Republic of Korea)-U.S. Alliance’s Biological Defense Cooperation Joint Working Group will ensure continued cooperation on biological defense programs.”Both Korean and U.S. authorities have been striving to prevent the anthrax case from damaging the bilateral alliance, as civic groups have expressed their anger at the accidental delivery and called for measures to prevent a recurrence.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","of anthrax bacteria to lab ,korea defense ministry pledged friday ,accidental shipment of live anthrax ,live anthrax sample to base ,bacteria to lab in korea","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Pentagon', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Osan Air Base', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Koreans', 'U.S.', 'Utah', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'South Korea', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'U.S.', 'Defense for Acquisition , Technology', 'Korea', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Alliance', 'Curtis M.

(AP-Yonhap News)A new gantry topping 60 meters was spotted at the Dongchang-ri station, where the communist state successfully fired a long-range rocket in December 2012, the source said. It marks an upgrade from the previous 50-meter-tall pad. Citing satellite imagery, the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said in late May that the construction work “essentially” ended, improving the gantry to support a space launch vehicle larger than the already tested 30-meter-long Unha-3. “The work has apparently almost finished, though the exact size of the pad is to be further confirmed,” a Seoul official said, pointing to SAIS’ analysis. The advancement shores up speculation that the Kim Jong-un regime may stage a provocation as it celebrates the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party on Oct. 10. Defense Minister Han Min-koo also recently raised the possibility for a “strategic provocation” to coincide with the occasion. Pyongyang is reportedly gearing up for a large-scale military parade at Mirim Airport, rallying Scud, Rodong and other missiles with various ranges, 240-milimeter multiple rocket launchers, armored vehicles and other equipment. “Our military is closely tracking and monitoring any missile-related movement by North Korea including the construction activities to extend the launch pad at Dongchang-ri,” Seoul’s Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said. Meanwhile, the regime has deployed four units of 122 mm howitzers on Galdo Island, some 2.5 kilometers north of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto naval frontier in the West Sea, military officials said. The ministry said in late May that the North has been setting up military bunkers on the island, calling it a “grave threat” given its geographic location and the proximity to the NLL and Yeonpyeongdo Island. It attacked the island in November 2010, killing four South Koreans.Nine bunkers have since been built, six of which are designed to house firearms, and about 100 personnel appear to be stationed there, they added.

(Yonhap)Seoul’s condemnation came right after Tokyo’s annual defense policy paper was presented to its Cabinet. Tokyo has included its sovereignty claim on Dokdo, called Takeshima in Japan, in its white paper for 11 consecutive years.Seoul’s ministries of foreign affairs and defense called in senior officials from the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to lodge a protest against the white paper. “Tokyo’s act of including its frothy claim to Dokdo in its 2015 defense white paper is an act of denying its imperialist history of the invasion of the Korean Peninsula, and it let the international community know that it still does not recognize history accurately, even as it marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II,” Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.“We would also like to point out that the Japanese government’s provocation is an act nullifying our efforts to open a new future of the bilateral relationship while squarely facing the history, on the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties.”The ministry called in Kenji Kanasugi, minister and deputy chief of mission at the Japanese Embassy, to criticize Tokyo’s claim to Dokdo.“At a critical juncture when there are the ongoing efforts to enhance the bilateral ties, (Japan) continuing this behavior is never helpful,” Lee Sang-deok, director general of Northeast Asian affairs at the ministry, told Kanasugi.Earlier in the day, Seoul’s Defense Ministry also called in Nobuhisa Goto, a senior defense attache at the Japanese Embassy to deliver a letter of protest in which the ministry urged Tokyo to stop repeating its “wrongful” claim to the islets.“We strongly protest the claim, and strongly urge Tokyo to rectify it immediately and take steps not to repeat this again,” reads the letter. “We make it clear that Dokdo is the Republic of Korea’s territory historically, geographically and by international law. Japan should recognize the fact that as long as it continues its wrongful claim, it cannot expect the development of a future-oriented bilateral defense relationship.” In the defense policy paper, Tokyo said that the territorial issues of the Northern Territories (or Kuril Islands) and Takeshima remained unresolved.On a map depicting Japan’s major military installations, Dokdo is marked as part of Japanese territory, while the white paper incorporates the airspace over Dokdo as part of its territorial air.In this year’s white paper, Japan underscored the escalating threat from China.It noted that China is making what can be seen as “coercive” responses in its maritime activities. It also pointed to China’s push to develop a gas field in the East China Sea and turn reefs and rocks in the South China Sea into artificial islands to build military facilities.As for North Korea, the white paper touched on Pyongyang’s development of a nuclear-tipped submarine-launched ballistic missile, saying that it could have a “grave impact” on its security.Japan incorporated Dokdo as part of its territory in 1905 before colonizing the entire peninsula. Korea has been in effective control of the islets with a small coast guard unit posted there since its liberation in 1945.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday after receiving seoul protest ,after receiving seoul protest over ,receiving seoul protest over tokyo ,ministry in central seoul tuesday ,korea strongly protested japan repeated","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Kenji Kanasugi', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Cabinet', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'japanese', 'Kenji Kanasugi', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Lee Sang - deok', 'northeast asian', 'Kanasugi', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Nobuhisa Goto', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'the Republic of Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Takeshima', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 1.          3.          0.         ... -0.53931028  0.15837082

Security Council and Germany concluded a landmark deal to curb Tehran's nuclear activities, which paves the way for lifting heavy economic sanctions imposed on the country.  Following Iran's nuke deal, Seoul and the U.S. have called on the North to take a lesson from Iran and to abandon its nuclear weapons program.  But North Korea made it clear on Tuesday that it has no plan to give up its nuclear arsenal, reiterating that the North's pursuit of the nuke program is aimed at protecting itself from what it called Washington's hostile acts.  ""The situation of the DPRK is quite different from (that of Iran),"" the Korean Central News Agency reported, citing an unidentified spokesman at the North's foreign ministry.  The DPRK is the acronym of North Korea's official name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  ""The DPRK is not interested at all in the dialogue to discuss the issue of making it freeze or dismantle its nukes unilaterally first.""  The six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the North -- involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia -- have been stalled since late 2008. The North conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.  North Korea has demanded the unconditional resumption of the six-party talks, but Seoul and Washington have called on Pyongyang to take concrete steps to implement its denuclearization commitments.  Pyongyang, however, maintains that it has already become a nuclear power and it wants mutual disarmament.  ""The DPRK is the nuclear weapons state both in name and reality and it has interests as a nuclear weapons state,"" the spokesman stressed.  The KCNA said that it is ""illogical"" to compare Iran's nuclear agreement with the North's situation as Pyongyang is under consistent military threat from the U.S.  ""The DPRK remains unchanged in the mission of its nuclear force as long as the U.S. continues pursuing its hostile policy toward the former,"" the spokesman said.

The two also agreed to build infrastructure for the operation of plug-in vehicles such as setting up charging stations in Honduras. President Park Geun-hye and her Honduran counterpart Juan Orlando Hernandez shake hands at a summit at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday. (Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald)A stable energy supply is crucial for the Central American country as it imports about one-fifth of its electricity needs from neighboring countries. The country loses 32 percent of its electricity in transmission and distribution, compared to an average of 12 percent in Central and South America, according to the presidential office.South Korea, by expanding energy cooperation with Honduras, expects to gain traction from the international community on it efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The two leaders agreed to consider developing a landfill gas-to-energy project in Honduras by utilizing the Green Climate Fund, a financial mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.“We expect that the cooperation with Honduras on creating energy self-sufficient villages, using renewable energy and energy-saving devices will help South Korea reach the target for cutting greenhouse gas emission by 2030,” said Cheong Wa Dae.South Korea recently finalized its 2030 target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent from business-as-usual levels equivalent to 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide. The country is among the world’s top 10 carbon emitters.The leaders also vowed to work closely to boost trade and investment between the two countries through a free trade agreement that South Korea is currently negotiating with six Central American countries.In June, South Korea and the six Central American countries ― Guatemala, Panama, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica ― declared the official launch of negotiations for an FTA.The six countries make up the fifth-largest market in Central and South America in terms of their combined gross domestic product. In 2014, trade between South Korea and the six countries reached $5 billion.South Korea has clinched a series of FTAs with major trading partners, including the U.S. and China, in recent years as part of its efforts to boost growth in the country’s export-driven economy.Hernandez’s trip comes as South Korea pushes to boost economic ties with South and Central America, a region Seoul calls a continent of opportunities that could give a much-needed boost to Asia’s fourth-largest economy.

Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, also reiterated Washington’s opposition to Beijing’s unilateral, coercive approach, while downplaying his surveillance flight over the disputed waters as a “routine” mission. In May, Pyongyang apparently succeeded in ejecting a dummy projectile from a newly built 2,000-ton submarine at a shipyard on the country’s eastern shore, a key early stage in SLBM development. Yet controversy persists over the program’s progress and even the authenticity of the test per se, though the South Korean military assesses that the communist country will likely be able to deploy a submarine equipped with a ballistic missile as early as in two years. “Even if it’s photoshopped, there’s a desire to pursue that capability and that’s very destabilizing,” Swift said during an interview with The Korea Herald and other news outlets at the U.S. Naval Forces Korea command in Seoul, referring to the images released by state media. “So we can’t afford to say there’s nothing there. We have to assume that there’s something there. … We have to have a strategy for the worst case.”  Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald and other news outlets at the U.S. Naval Forces Korea command in central Seoul. YonhapThe admiral was in Seoul as part of his first overseas trip since becoming chief of one of the world’s largest fleets in May, which included a stop in Manila and will bring him to Tokyo on Wednesday. Later in the day, he met with Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jung Ho-sup and other ranking officials here. North Korea’s opacity is a “first element” causing instability within the region, he said, stressing the significance of transparency in diplomatic relations through recent nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran. Yet the commander expressed confidence at his fleet’s capability and readiness against any contingency, saying it was “fully prepared” to support the U.S. Forces Korea led by Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti. “It’s very difficult to determine not only capacity but also capability because North Korea is so opaque. But more important than that is their intent, because intent makes another country’s objectives so dangerous as far as the inability to assess their intent is concerned,” Swift said.“I think that’s the question we have to ask ourselves, ‘Why can’t that be applied with respect to North Korea?’ So the overtures have been made; the opportunities are standing.” In Manila, the admiral joined a “routine” surveillance flight on Saturday over the South China Sea where Beijing has been building artificial islands to the dismay of the Philippines. The seven-hour mission was designed to “see firsthand some of the new operational capabilities” of the P-8A Poseidon, he said, declining to give specific details. While displaying resistance to what he called the “approach of coercion, force to get one’s desire to meet their ends,” he appeared upbeat about bilateral military ties with China, saying they have been “normalized.” “The military-to-military relationship with China that we enjoy is a positive development. And I think the communications at sea are positive and structured,” Swift added.

The voter turnout was the same as recorded in local elections in 2011.  It added that voters unable to go to polling stations due to old age or illness participated in the elections via mobile ballot boxes.  The KCNA said that after casting his ballot, the North's leader praised the candidates for their devotion to the development of North Korea.  Kim's entourage included Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political department of the Korean People's Army, and the North's Premier Pak Pong-ju, it added.  Elected deputies hold a meeting once or twice every year to set their provinces' budgets and draw up plans for law enforcement, experts said.

The reduction of 40,000 will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.  The Army further warned that unless the budget constraints, known as ""sequestration,"" are addressed, the next round of troop cuts will leave the Army with only 420,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2019 and could affect troop levels in South Korea.  ""I worry that some people might perceive that our ability to respond could be degraded, which would embolden them to do things,"" Gen.

Chung Ui-hwa also urged lawmakers here to begin talks over constitutional reforms, without detailing what the reforms should be.  Rep. Chung Ui-hwa speaks at the parliament on Friday to commemorate the 67th Constitution Day. (Yonhap)Chung’s words came amid a long-held debate over whether Seoul should transition to a parliamentary system that would limit the president’s clout over domestic politics. President Park Geun-hye later Friday stressed stability, repeating her objection to holding talks on constitutional revisions.“There are two main halls in the National Assembly,” Chung said. “Our forefathers built two halls, with expectations that the legislature would become bicameral once we unified with the North,” the fifth-term lawmaker said. The South Korean Assembly is a unicameral 298-seat legislature.“It is time we made (unification) a reality,” Chung said. “I officially propose to the North Korean Supreme People’s Assembly to convene a meeting between each legislature’s speakers,” Chung said. “Talks are the only solution.”“I deem Aug. 15 to be the ideal date,” the speaker added, citing the date’s symbolic importance to both Koreas, as it marks the date that Imperial Japan’s 35-year occupation of the Korean Peninsula ended in 1945.“But I will fully cooperate with a time and place of the North’s picking,” he concluded. “I am willing to meet the North anytime and anywhere.” Inside the parliamentary building in western Seoul during the Constitution Day celebrations, Friday. (Yonhap)The speaker’s proposal came months after Chung initially suggested holding talks with North Korean lawmakers when he became Assembly speaker in May last year. Chung had said expressed dismay at the lack of talks with the North generated by the Park Geun-hye administration.Chung also urged South Korean lawmakers to begin steps to reform the Constitution, although he did not say what the revisions should aim to do. “We are at a crossroads of either falling into years of slow growth or creating a new era of big growth through innovation, at the crossroads of either of allowing the middle class to evaporate, or allowing it to grow.”For this, the Constitution must be revised, Chung asserted, saying that the “1987 system” was no longer appropriate for the times.The Constitution last underwent major revisions in 1987 when the last of South Korea’s military governments agreed to relinquish political power.Multiple senior lawmakers have proposed beginning talks to revise the Constitution. The changes should aim to increase the Assembly’s say in domestic affairs, such as naming the prosecutor-general, or the prime minister, lawmakers including ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Lee Jae-oh and main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Woo Yoon-keun have said.Chung’s message also came amid a scandal involving the National Intelligence Service, the South Korean spy agency.

We hope that the North will join our efforts to promote understanding and trust among nations in the Asia-Pacific region through this forum.”The number of the North’s vice minister-level officials of the ministry is said to be five to six.

Officials and experts from at least 32 nations, including the U.S., China and Japan, and four international organizations such as the U.N. are set to attend the forum. It was set up in 2012 with the aims of boosting cooperation and exchanges among vice minister-level defense policymakers in the region and civilian security experts, and promoting peace and stability on the peninsula and beyond. Meanwhile, the two Koreas accused each other of refusing to budge during Thursday’s talks over the wages of North Korean workers and other issues about the complex, the only symbol of inter-Korean economic cooperation.“(North Korea) has yet to throw away its hitherto inflexible stance over the wages and the three problems (of passage, communication and customs clearance),” Seoul’s Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee told reporters. He added that during the talks, Seoul sought to show “sufficient flexibility” in its stance over the wages and at the same time, tried to bridge differences over other issues including the so-called three problems. The wage issue erupted in February as the North unilaterally raised the minimum wage for some 55,000 North Korean workers by 5.18 percent to $74, disregarding the agreed-upon wage increase ceiling of 5 percent.During Thursday’s meeting, the North repeated its position that the increase in the minimum wage is an issue concerning its sovereignty, while Seoul argues it cannot accept any unilateral decision by the North.Expressing frustration, Park Chol-su, the head of North Korea’s delegation for the meeting, said, “We don’t need such a meeting in the future. ...

Sherman said the Iranian agreement also shows multilateral diplomacy is workable.""I still think that the work that we are doing with partners in the region to try to move forward in a united front is critical,"" she said when asked whether she believes the long-stalled six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear issue are still worthwhile.The Iran deal ""demonstrates multilateral diplomacy can work and that United Nations actions have meaning if done in the right way and pursued in the right way and used as leverage in the right way,"" she said.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean impasse have been idle since late 2008. North Korea has demanded an unconditional resumption of the negotiations, and the U.S. has maintained that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.While the six-party talks have been on hold, the North has bolstered its nuclear capabilities and stockpile, conducting its second nuclear test in 2009 and its third in 2013.

The move came as the government offered a 20-day period for both labor and management to express their objections before making public the agreed minimum wage for next year on Aug. 5.Members of the nation's two largest labor unions -- the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions -- hold a press briefing to urge the Ministry of Employment and Labor to reconsider the minimum wage rate for next year on Thursday, Sejoing. (Yonhap)“Korean workers cannot accept next year’s minimum wage that has been decided in an illegal way,” said Lee Byung-kyoon, head of the FKTU, in a news briefing held in front of the ministry building.“It is against the law that the remaining members of the Minimum Wage Council did not even ask the laborers to be present at the final meeting and concluded it by voting on the proposal without us,” he added. The Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of employers, employees and labor experts, set the hourly minimum wage for next year at 6,030 won ($5.25), up 8.1 percent from this year‘s rate of 5,580 won, after weeks of fierce debate. The nine laborers’ representatives did not return to the final negotiations after they walked out in opposition to the disappointing extent of the hike proposed by labor experts in the council. Labor experts had made the proposal for the sake of a breakthrough in the dragged-on meeting. The 8.1 percent hike is also being resisted by the employers’ representatives, who say that such a “drastic increase” would take a toll on small and medium-sized businesses. However, they have yet to officially call on the ministry to reconsider the minimum wage. Regarding the labor unions’ complaints, the ministry maintained that there is no problem in the legal procedure as the labor bloc voluntarily exited from the meeting twice. The Minimum Wage Act stipulates that at least one-third of representatives from trade unions and employers should cast a vote to decide the minimum wage. But if one party refuses to attend the negotiations more than once, the vote can go ahead without that party. In a press briefing, the unions also released a survey by Hangil Research of 1,000 workers in which 75.3 percent of the respondents said that next year‘s minimum wage would still be insufficient. Only 7.9 percent said it was enough, the poll showed. Nearly 35 percent thought that next year’s wage rate was largely influenced by employers, followed by the government and politicians at 25.5 percent, workers at 18.3 percent and public sentiment at 12.8 percent. Six in 10 respondents were in favor of raising the minimum wage to 10,000 won, the rate the labor bloc initially suggested, according to the poll.  Talks among employees, employers and labor experts collapsed several times due to continued clashes over the extent of the hike, failing to meet a June 29 legal deadline. The labor unions initially demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum wage at 5,580 won to 10,000 won, arguing that the hike would curb the nation’s income inequality and boost consumer spending.

Hwang Jin-ha, a general-turned-politician, made the suggestion during a security forum at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, saying addressing Pyongyang's security concerns would be important in persuading the regime to denuclearize.""Like the case between the ROK and the United States, China as a nuclear power can consider an option to provide the nuclear umbrella to ensure North Korea's security and economic assistance,""Hwang said, referring to the U.S. nuclear protection for the South.""North Korea made it clear the reason why they are keeping this nuclear ambition. There were two reasons. First, for their survivability, security of their regime. Secondly, recovery of their economy,"" he said. ""So, the answer could be, if we provide persuadable kind of guarantee of the security to the Kim Jung-un regime, that could be one kind of answer.""Chances of his idea materializing appear low, especially at a time when China-North Korea ties have turned sour.Hwang said he is aware there is opposition to the idea, but said it's worth a try.North Korea claims it was compelled to develop nuclear weapons in self-defense against U.S. nuclear threats despite Washington's repeated assertions that it has no intention of attacking the North.Pyongyang has conducted underground nuclear tests three times, in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and also built a facility to enrich uranium, which gives the communist regime a second way of building nuclear bombs in addition to its plutonium program.The six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear program have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea has called for resuming negotiations without preconditions, but the U.S. has demanded Pyongyang first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.

(Yonhap)Some analysts say that after the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with Iran and Cuba -- two of its three longtime foes, conditions have become more conducive for Washington to pay more attention to North Korea’s nuclear issues.But others argue that with a full plate of policy tasks concerning the implementation of the multilateral deal with Iran, Washington may already have its hands full and still remain reluctant to deal with the North that has claimed to be a nuclear-power state.“After the Obama administration took power from the Bush administration, a series of issues stemming from the Cold War era, such as those concerning Cuba and Myanmar, have been addressed, forming the broad international landscape for openness, coexistence and compromise,” said Park Myung-lim, a political scientist at Yonsei University.“So in light of this trend, the Iran deal could play a positive role in terms of adding pressure for North Korea’s denuclearization.”Park, however, noted that the most challenging issue for now is that, unlike two former North Korean leaders who stably managed the regime, current leader Kim Jong-un is likely to adhere more to the nuclear program due to the country’s deepening isolation and moribund economy.“Kim could be using the nuclear card to address all of its internal and external issues, including domestic instability, isolation, poor economy and the normalization of ties with the U.S. and South Korea, and so forth.”Taking a cautious stance on the implications of the Iranian deal for North Korea, analysts said it was inappropriate to compare North Korea and Iran, given the different status of their nuclear weapons technology and their participation in the global non-proliferation regime.Iran is still a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But the North, which entered the NPT regime in 1985, broke away from the treaty in 1993, reentered it later and withdrew from it again in 2003, which has created international distrust toward the North.Tehran has also argued that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, including medical use, while Pyongyang describes itself as a nuclear-armed state in its constitution and has openly adopted a policy of simultaneously pursuing the development of nuclear arms and its economy.Iran has not conducted any major nuclear tests, while the North carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, arguing that it has already entered the technical phase “to miniaturize and diversify its nuclear bombs.” Another difference between the two is that economic sanctions for the oil-rich Islamic Republic are critical for its trade, while the impact of the sanctions on the North are much weaker, as its economy is largely disconnected from the international system.After the deal with Iran, U.S. State Department spokesperson John Kirby told Yonhap News that the deal clearly demonstrated Washington’s willingness to engage with countries with whom the U.S. has “long-standing differences.” But he stressed, “Pyongyang’s attempts to engage in dialogue while keeping critical elements of its weapons program running are unacceptable,” while noting that the U.S. is ready for negotiations with the North if the negotiations are “authentic and credible.” Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, expressed doubts over the speculation that after the deal with Iran, the U.S. could pay more attention to Pyongyang.“I am rather cautious about whether the U.S. would move in the near future to address the North Korean issue, as there would be many follow-up measures to do to implement the Iran deal including its talks with the Congress,” he said.“Plus … when there is no guarantee that there would be progress to be made in negotiations with the North, which sticks to its nuclear weapons program and calls itself a nuclear power, Washington may not want to spend much time or put policy efforts into the issue.”After all, Seoul will have a critical role to play in bringing Pyongyang to the negotiating table and seeking a resolution to the nuclear issue, particularly when Washington faces a domestic political situation which is unfavorable to tackling the North Korean nuclear issue, analysts said.“North Korea sticks to its nuclear program for its regime and national survival. So, Seoul needs to find a way to assure the North that denuclearization would not endanger its regime, and that it is not pursuing any regime instability or unification by forcibly absorbing the North,” a North Korea expert said, requesting anonymity.“Of course, the critical thing for Seoul is to gain U.S. support for its North Korea policy, particularly, there is growing strategic distrust from the U.S. due to its policy to strengthen its strategic partnership with China.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday landmark deal over iran ,nuclear issues but others argue ,north korean nuclear issue analysts ,korea nuclear issues but others ,korean nuclear issue analysts said","['Iran', 'North Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea ’s', 'North ’s', 'Korea Central Television', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'Cuba', 'Washington', 'North Korea ’s', 'Iran', 'Washington', 'Bush', 'Cuba', 'Myanmar', 'Park Myung - lim', 'Yonsei University', 'Iran', 'North Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'iranian', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'NPT', 'Tehran', 'Pyongyang', 'Iran', 'Islamic Republic', 'Iran', 'U.S. State Department', 'John Kirby', 'Yonhap News', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Iran', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Iran', 'Congress', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",15,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.59977448  1.32062125

It earmarked 17.5 billion won in the budget for setting up such thermal cameras. (Yonhap)","north korean soldiers at night ,korean soldiers at night ,korean soldiers at night the ,korea military set up cctvs ,army last month north korean","['the Defense Ministry', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', ""the south korean Army 's"", 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'DMZ', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'DMZ', ""South Korea 's"", 'DMZ', 'north korean', 'the National Assembly']",16,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.74694675  0.57588041

A total of 124 South Korean small and medium-sized enterprises operate factories there.In August 2013, the two sides decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park following the North's unilateral move in April of that year to shut down the park for about four months.The committee is an integral part of a deal that called for reopening the complex and adopting safeguards to prevent any work suspensions in the future. The committee has not met since June last year due to the North's refusal.The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.Jeong Joon-hee, the ministry spokesman, expressed hope that the talks could pave the way for the smooth operation of the industrial park.""We hope the two sides can resolve pending issues so that the talks can lay the foundation for developing the complex into one that's globally competitive,"" Jeong told a regular press briefing.Hong also added that the government is open to ideas for pursuing more cooperative projects at the complex, including the opening of a college and hospital.""(Seoul) could seek more inter-Korean projective projects after the complex stands on firmer footing through joint committee talks,"" Hong said.

It fleshed out a framework agreement reached in April.U.S. President Barack Obama hailed the deal.""Today, because America negotiated from a position of strength and principle, we have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region. Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said. ""This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it.""The deal stands in sharp contrast with the grim deadlock over North Korea's nuclear programs.State Department spokesman John Kirby said the Iran deal shows the U.S. willingness to engage even countries with ""long-standing differences,"" and that the U.S. is ready for negotiations with North Korea as long as Pyongyang is serious about denuclearization.""We are prepared for negotiations, provided that they are authentic and credible, get at the entirety of the North's nuclear program, and result in concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization,"" he said. ""Pyongyang's attempts to engage in dialogue while keeping critical elements of its weapons program running are unacceptable.""Analysts have said that North Korea stands low in the U.S. priority list and that the Obama administration has little interest in resuming nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang as it has been preoccupied with the Iranian nuclear issue. The conclusion of the Iranian deal raised hope Washington would be able to pay more attention to the North Korean nuclear issue, but American experts said such chances are low and, moreover, North Korea is not interested in negotiating away its nuclear programs.The Iran deal ""will almost certainly embroil the Obama administration in a domestic political debate over its provisions and implementation,"" said Joel Wit, editor of the website 38 North, sponsored by the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.""And given all the other problems the administration is facing abroad, the chances of the U.S. making a concerted effort to restart nuclear negotiations remain small. To be fair, I don't think North Korea is interested in such talks since its policies have been successful in building up its nuclear arsenal while moving forward with some economic improvements,"" he said.Ken Gause, a North Korea expert at CNA Corp., agreed that chances of a breakthrough are low.""While the deal will free up time for the U.S. to focus on North Korea, which it might or might not do, I don't think it will lead to a breakthrough on the six-party talks,"" he said. ""North Korea's calculus will not be impacted by the Iran deal.""Jonathan Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the two issues are fundamentally different as the North has an ongoing weapons program and has withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, whereas Iran agreed to meaningful constraints on even the possibilities of a weapons option.""I don't anticipate any major implications for North Korea's nuclear program,"" he said. ""Barring profound change in DPRK thinking and strategy, the impasse will remain undiminished. Nor do I envision any significant changes in U.S. policy toward North Korea.""Douglas Paal, vice president and director of the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also noted that for Iran, its nuclear program was ""an option, not a prerequisite for the regime's survival"" but Pyongyang believes its weapons capabilities are vital to regime survival.""So the two situations are not analogous,"" he said.Richard Bush, a senior researcher at Brookings, said he sees no implications on the North Korean issue.""Iran is not as far along as North Korea,"" he said, adding that Tehran was willing to place significant limitations on its nuclear program in return for economic benefits while Pyongyang is unwilling to do so. ""So Iran's present won't be North Korea's future.""The Iranian deal is expected to undergo tough scrutiny in the Republican-controlled Congress.House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) criticized the deal, saying it is likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world, instead of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East.""We're going to do everything we can to get to the details and if in fact it's as bad a deal as I think it is at this moment, we're going to do everything we can to stop it,"" Boehner told reporters.Congress has 60 days to study the agreement before endorsing or rejecting it.Should Congress reject the deal, Obama is expected to veto the motion.

We have one that not only has capability to violate sovereignty of our allies and to do things that are inconsistent with our national interests but they're in the process of doing so,"" he said.   Dunford said he considers China the No. 2 threat because of the country's growing military capability and its presence in the Pacific.

A total of 124 South Korean small- and medium-sized enterprises are operating factories there.The South has rejected the communist neighbor's move, saying it is in breach of a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year.In August 2013, the two Koreas decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park following the North's unilateral move in April of that year that shut down the park for about four months.The committee is an integral part of a deal that called for reopening the complex and adopting safeguards to prevent any work stoppages in the future. The committee has not met since June last year due to the North's refusal.The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.In what could be a temporary relief, North Korea accepted South Korea's tentative offer in late May to pay wages at the current level of $70.35, but Seoul and Pyongyang have yet to resolve the issue fully.Meanwhile, the ministry said that Pyongyang has sent a notice to Seoul saying that it will tighten its surveillance over South Koreans moving in and out of the complex.The North is known to have expressed complaints over South Koreans bringing in goods, such as mobile phones and newspapers, that are restricted in the North, vowing to take punitive actions if found.In response, the South said that the issue should be dealt with in accordance with the two sides' agreement and related regulations, according to the ministry.

The Space Operation Center, unveiled at the Air Force’s headquarters in Gyeryong, South Chungcheong Province, is equipped with a common operation picture and situation room to help monitor the movement of satellites in two and three dimensions, its global positioning system’s precision levels and weather conditions in space, while detecting GPS jamming attempts. Air Force officials monitor a screen in the situation room at the Space Operation Center in Gyeryong, South Chungcheong Province, Wednesday. (Yonhap)The organization will enable the country to gird up for unpredictable incidents such as a close encounter between its science satellite and a space object last year and the crash of an unmanned Russian cargo spacecraft early this year. “The military will now be able to forecast the passing of satellites of enemies and neighboring countries, as well as space climate conditions, and thus better support military operations in the air, on the ground and at sea,” the Air Force said in a statement. “As all cutting-edge weapons systems currently being utilized by all military organs are based on satellite communications information including GPS, they can serve their causes only when the satellites are intact above the Earth.” The center will also boost related cooperation with the U.S., such as by sharing information on possible collisions with cosmic objects and assisting each other’s launches of air vehicles and their potential deviation from orbit and reentry. Last September, South Korea’s Air Force and the U.S. Strategic Command agreed to share advanced space monitoring data in line with an accord between the two countries’ defense ministries. “We have until now lifted off satellites without detailed purposes and strategies. With the operation center, we can integrate various information gained from satellites into useful data, while significantly raising our situational awareness in collaboration with the U.S.,” an Air Force official told The Korea Herald on customary condition of anonymity. To facilitate its space programs, the Air Force clinched agreements with the Korea Meteorological Administration, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, KAIST and KT Sat, a leading satellite operator. Under the deal, the institutions will work together to develop a national strategy to counter space dangers and monitoring systems, stably operate satellites and nurture manpower.

The U.S. Strategic Command in charge of space surveillance will provide information to the local monitoring center following a South Korea-U.S. agreement on space data sharing.In September, the allies signed the memorandum of understanding on sharing ""space situation awareness"" to prevent accidental collisions of satellites or other orbital objects.Under the contract, South Korea's Air Force will receive higher quality and more timely space information in exchange for information on satellite positions and radio frequencies, the Pentagon has said.Also on Wednesday, the Air Force signed agreements with the Korea Meteorological Administration, research institutes on space and astronomy and satellite maintenance firm KT Sat to beef up space surveillance, according to the Air Force. Under the agreements, the parties will work jointly toward stopping collisions or the approach of space objects, launching vehicles into space and putting derailed vehicles back into orbit around the earth, the Air Force noted.

Yoo Ihn-tae of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said, citing decades of efforts by human rights workers to have the practice outlawed here.Rep. Yoo Ihn-tae of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy submits an anti-death penalty draft bill early Monday. (Yonhap)“It is time we illegalize the death penalty here, in a country that has produced a U.N. secretary-general and is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council,” Yoo added, referring to U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon.“It’s time that we declare the death penalty something that goes against our country’s conscience.”At least 61 have been sentenced to death here, according to Amnesty International. Lawmakers proposed six draft bills from 1999 to 2010 proposing to abolish the death penalty outright. But the draft bills failed to pass Korea’s unicameral parliament.Yoo’s proposed bill comes nearly five years after the last anti-death penalty bill was chiefly sponsored by lawmaker Joo Sung-young of the Grand National Party, a precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party, in November 2010.The draft bill must pass the Legislation and Judiciary Committee and plenary voting at the National Assembly, before receiving final approval from the Cabinet for it to become law.

Cho Myung-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party also urged Seoul’s National Assembly to pass a human rights bill aiming to improve the situation in the North as soon as possible. The bill has been stalled in the Assembly since 2005.“The North refuses to apologize for the 2010 Cheonan sinking and the 2010 Yeonpyeongdo Island shelling,” Cho told the Korea Herald, touching on the March 2010 sinking of the South Korean naval ship Cheonan and the North’s November 2010 shelling of a South Korean island.Rep. Cho Myung-chul (Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald)A North Korean submarine torpedoed the Cheonan, killing 46 sailors. The North’s shelling of Yeonpyeongdo Island left two South Korean marines and two civilians dead.“Some in the South say it’s time to move on and engage the North in any way possible, even though the North has refused to apologize,” Cho added.“But if we forgive them again and just forget about it, nothing will come of it. How can we just forgive them, when they kill our young men left and right, whenever they want?” the first-term lawmaker said.“One apology from the North would be better than 100 meaningless high-level discussions in building (inter-Korean) trust,” he said.Cho, 56, is a former professor of economics at Kim Il Sung University, the North’s top school. Cho defected to the South in 1994 while serving as an exchange professor in China, leaving his parents, his brothers, a wife and children in the North.Cho also said it was “imperative” that the Assembly pass the North Korea human rights bill sooner than later.“The North is a country where freedom is absolutely absent,” the lawmaker said, widening his eyes as he spoke. “I know this because I’ve been there, and lived there.”The North Korea human rights bill has been stalled due to partisan disagreements between the Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The conservative Saenuri Party backs a version aiming to pressure the Pyongyang regime on its political concentration camps and documented cases of torture. The main opposition backs a version that would not “provoke” the communist government there and worsen tensions.Cho said his frustration with the North’s repressive government led him to come to the South. The former North Korean elite added that he could see “no future” in the North.“I felt that if I, a person from one of the most prestigious families in the North, defected, I would be able to shock the government’s leadership. My defection was a form of protest.”But Cho appeared to be reluctant to discuss his family, which still lives in the North. His father was a top secretary in the Kim Il Sung regime when Cho defected. Cho said he wasn’t sure if his father was alive.“I heard several years ago that my mother had passed away,” he said. “When I came to the South I was lonely, because I was alone.“I overcame this by throwing myself into work.

Koreans naturally want U.S. and South Korean security ties to remain as tight as they were when the U.S. deployed these warheads in Korea,"" he said in the statement.  With advances in military science since l990, however, there now are ""much safer ways to maintain America's nuclear guarantee without employing actual warheads on Korean soil,"" Sokolski stressed.  ""That's why I argued and believe that despite a recent Center for Strategic and International Studies report that recommends again deploying U.S. nuclear warheads in Korea, doing this is not the way to strengthen U.S.-ROK security ties,"" he said.   He was referring to a CSIS report that was published last week and proposed the U.S. place tactical nuclear weapons back in South Korea to better cope with the ever-growing nuclear capabilities of the communist North.   Some hard-line conservatives have called for such a deployment whenever North Korea has made provocative acts, such as nuclear and missile tests. But officials of the U.S. and South Korea have flatly rejected such calls.  Sokolski also said that he recently made a visit to Seoul, and Korean officials he spoke with ""never said that they want to acquire tactical nuclear weapons.""

As the latest South Sudanese Civil War broke out in December 2013, ""the Hanbit unit perfectly carried out its top priority UN mission of protecting civilians,"" Major General Oh Jeong-il said in an interview with a pool reporter, later released by the Defense Ministry. It was very effective in forming the crucial bond between the unit and the local people for Hanbit to have continued its humanitarian assistance operations for about 17,000 Bor war refugees even at the height of the civil war, Oh noted.The South Korean unit is now at a critical crossroads in re-defining its role in the U.N. efforts to help South Sudan stand on its own feet, the major general stressed, adding that transferring South Korea's experience of speedy economic development would be the main focus of future operations.""As our country owns the asset of being an economic success model, the role Hanbit could play in contributing to the development of South Sudan would be the transfer of development experiences,"" Oh noted.As part of those efforts, the military will seek tighter collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency, the official development assistance body, to better provide the services, he said.As South Korea's other foreign-dispatched units, ""Ahk"" in the UAE and ""Dongmyeong"" in Lebanon, mark four and eight years of dispatch respectively, the country plans to reset strategies on its overseas troops deployment in a way it could maximize effectiveness, he said.Through the peace-keeping and rebuilding operations abroad, the South Korean military is amassing capacities and experiences to deal with any crisis situation in the Korean Peninsula, the general said. ""With combat-readiness position firmly maintained against North Korea, the military will proactively take part in the overseas troops dispatch to contribute to the international society.""

In a lunch meeting with the military chiefs, she pointed to unabated cross-border tension on the back of Pyongyang’s ejection test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile last month and continuing reign of terror. Defense Minister Han Min-koo also recently raised the possibility for a “strategic provocation” by the communist regime to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party in October. “We’re at a point where we cannot predict when North Korea will stage what kind of provocation,” Park said during the event held at Cheong Wa Dae. “We should never ease up at any time and maintain a thorough readiness posture.” As the peninsula remains divided 70 years after its liberation from Japanese rule, the leaders are given a “historical mission” to build peace and lay the groundwork for reunification based on a robust security setup and defense capabilities, she noted. “It is vital to safeguard peace on the peninsula by sustaining a prevailing war deterrence through a solid security posture and strong defense capabilities,” Park said. “Only amid that backdrop will we be able to induce a change from North Korea and establish the foundation for a peaceful unification.” The session followed a separate conference presided over by Han to review the military’s readiness and overall defense environment in the first half with the commanders, while formulating the guidelines for the latter half and discussing ways to improve the leadership. With corruption allegations involving former top officials and generals continuing to unravel, Han pledged to devise measures to root out irregularities and clean up the defense industry. “Corruption in the defense industry is identical to aiding the enemy,” the minister was quoted as saying during the 90-minute talks. “We need an in-depth assessment on the overall defense acquisition programs and to come up with comprehensive steps to stamp out corruption and make way for them to facilitate effective improvement of our forces.” Park, for her part, urged them to step up efforts to bring about “innovation” in the military culture, saying that a military shaken by corruption and other reform-related issues will prompt the whole nation to falter. She has regularly invited the military chiefs to the presidential palace for lunch since she was sworn in in 2013. The latest meeting was also attended by Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm.

(Airbus)The National Defense Acquisition Program Committee picked the winner of the 1.49 trillion won ($1.34 billion) project at a session presided over by Defense Minister Han Min-koo. The France-headquartered company is expected to deliver two tankers in 2018 and another two the following year. The A330 MRTT beat two other competitors ― Boeing’s KC-46 and Israel Aerospace Industries’ B767 MMTT ― though the competition was seen as a two-horse race between the European and U.S. aerospace giants, which had the upper hand than their Israeli challenger, whose tanker is based on a secondhand 767 platform originally built by Boeing.“Airbus’ A330 MRTT has excellent performance in terms of the duration of flight in far-field zones, the amount of fuel that can be offloaded air-to-air, the passenger and cargo transport capacity, while earning high scores for its price,” Defense Acquisition Program Administration spokesperson Kim Si-cheol said at a news conference. “It is being employed in many countries around the world, and stable depot maintenance is possible using domestic civilian airlines.” It will be South Korea’s first purchase of European military aircraft in 21 years. Seoul brought in 12 CN-235 transporters from Spain in 1994 and 20 advanced trainer jets from Britain in 1992.The announcement will open the door for the introduction of more European weapons systems in a market dominated by U.S. military equipment. According to the annual Global Defense Trade Report of the research institute IHS, South Korea was the world’s seventh-largest importer of defense equipment in 2014. However, nearly 80 percent of the country’s imports came from the U.S.The Air Force here has sought to acquire refueling aircraft since 1993 as its existing fighters can operate for up to only 30 minutes over the most remote areas of its territory, including Dokdo, its easternmost islets claimed by Japan. With the deployment of the A330 MRTT, they may fly up to Pyongyang and nearby regions in North Korea, Kim said. “It will also enhance our combat effectiveness and facilitate our peacekeeping operations and emergency relief efforts overseas by enabling long-distance, mass supplies,” he added. The decision, initially slated for late last year, was delayed due to drawn-out negotiations with the bidders and their failure to meet the requirements set by Seoul as part of offset agreements, which typically entail technology transfer and other support programs.The A330 MRTT has an edge in rearming and passenger transport capabilities as it can carry 111 tons of fuel and 266 passengers, compared with the KC-46’s 96.1 tons of fuel and 114 passengers. The Airbus model boasts the ability to conduct various missions including air-to-air refueling, the transport of passengers and military servicemen, and aerial medical evacuations. Another crucial factor was the production stage. More than 20 units of the A330 MRTT are currently in deployment, whereas the development of the KC-46 is to be completed in 2017. The U.K., Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and France have decided to purchase the Airbus product. As the KC-46 is a military derivative of the 767 jet, Boeing had highlighted the significance of its interoperability with the U.S. Air Force, which itself plans to procure 179 KC-46s by 2027. Alarmed by a recent string of corruption scandals involving procurement deals, Kim noted that the assessment process was carried out by 19 military officials, scholars and other experts in the fairest possible fashion.

The Second Battle of Yeonpyeong, named after a frontline island in the West Sea, was initiated after two North Korean patrol vessels violated the Northern Limit Line, a de facto maritime frontier, on June 29, 2002. It killed six South Korean seamen and wounded 18 others aboard a warship that later sank amid a towing operation, while destroying a North Korean boat and leaving more than 30 dead or injured. While paying respect to the fallen sailors, Han stressed that his military will “clearly engrave” in Pyongyang’s mind the fact that it could never fulfill any purpose through provocations and threats, citing escalating tension surrounding the NLL on the back of the communist state’s repeated threats. “The Second Battle of Yeonpyeong is a fight of victory during which our servicemen warded off North Korea’s provocation with their own bodies,” he said in a speech during a memorial service at a naval base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. “If North Korea stages a reckless provocation again, our military, as we have declared countlessly, will punish not only its origin but also the enemy’s supporting forces and command so that it will feel the provocation’s price in their bones.”  Defense Minister Han Min-koo delivers a memorial speech during a ceremony to mark the 13th anniversary of an inter-Korean West Sea skirmish that killed six South Korean sailors, at the Navy’s Second Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. (Yonhap)The scuffle struck South Koreans especially because it took place while a football frenzy was sweeping through the country as its national team played against Turkey for third place in the World Cup jointly hosted with Japan. Han was the first defense chief to deliver a funeral oration to mark the clash, which followed the first naval conflict in the area in 1999. His predecessors accompanied prime ministers to the event in 2007-11 and then-President Lee Myung-bak in 2012, who elevated the memorial to a national level and gave the official title instead of referring to the incident as “engagement.” Hosted by Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Chung Ho-seop, the latest ceremony was attended by some 700 people including the former sailors of the Chamsuri-357, the victims’ bereaved families and dozens of ruling and opposition lawmakers led by Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung and New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Moon Jae-in. Among the participants were the director of “Northern Limit Line,” a film centered on the skirmish that has topped the box office since its Friday release, and the actor who played the patrol killer’s boatswain. A replica of the warship is on display at the War Memorial of Korea in central Seoul in honor of the fallen soldiers’ sacrifice.In his own address, Chung lauded the commitment of the six “heroes,” vowing airtight defense posture. “Inheriting the six warriors’ fighting spirit, we must establish a robust readiness posture under which we can strike the enemies immediately at the order and sternly punish them against any additional provocation so that they will not covet our waters and territory,” the navy chief added. The NLL has long been a flashpoint as Pyongyang has persistently sought to invalidate it, arguing that the sea border was unilaterally drawn by the U.S.-led U.N. Command after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War and should be moved further south.In March 2010, the regime also torpedoed the South Korean corvette Cheonan near there, killing 46 sailors, months before shelling Yeonpyeongdo Island, killing two marines and two civilians. Later in the day, Han visited the Daejeon National Cemetery to pay homage to the deceased soldiers of the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong and the Cheonan attack.

The China-led lender is seen as a rival to the U.S.-dominated World Bank and the Japan-led Asian Development Bank.   The AIIB charter allows the bank to invest into non-member countries, including North Korea, if the members who hold 75 percent of its voting rights agree to do so, Choi said.   ""For us, there is no reason to refrain from supporting North Korea through the AIIB.

The Nordic nation is one of 21 countries ― mostly European ― that have a diplomatic presence in Seoul while maintaining official ties with Pyongyang. In an effort to increase the “minimal” trade and investment between Denmark and North Korea, the communist bureaucrats asked Lehmann to visit often, the ambassador told The Korea Herald last week at the embassy. Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann poses beside an Arirang Mass Games poster he obtained on a visit to North Korea in late May. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldLehmann presented his ambassadorial credentials to Kim Yong-nam, North Korea’s chairman of the Supreme People’s Assembly, and met Kung Sok-ung, vice foreign minister in charge of European affairs, alongside other diplomats. The ambassador visited Pyongyang and Sariwon, the North Hwanghae Provincial capital south of Pyongyang. “They wanted to showcase Pyongyang’s economic development over the last 10 years, with new apartments, restaurants, cafes, hotels and malls,” he said. “There was a good deal of market activity, although stark differences existed between the residents ― those with access to privileges and goods, and those struggling to get by.”Residents streamed down the streets in Pyongyang on bicycles much the same as Danes do in Danish cities, though only men rode bicycles in Pyongyang while both men and women did in Sariwon, Lehmann said.In Sariwon, he visited orphanages where the World Food Program has been operating hunger reduction programs, which are also run in schools. Denmark donated $100 million last year to multilateral organizations, of which $40 million went to the WFP. It spends 0.83 percent of its gross domestic product on official developmental aid, well above the United Nations’ recommended rate of 0.7 percent, the ambassador pointed out. “As a developed and wealthy country, we have always had a strong presence in foreign aid,” Lehmann highlighted, adding that development assistance has been a key part of Denmark’s foreign policy. Despite the proliferation of markets in North Korea following the devastating famine of the 1990s, Lehmann said that many North Koreans struggle in their daily lives, with most activities carried out manually. Electricity was cut regularly throughout the day, and people had set up solar panels on balconies to get extra power, Lehmann recalled. Construction in Pyongyang heavily relied on physical labor, with workers lifting concrete and equipment up and down the floors; nearly all work in the countryside relied on brawn. Despite analyses that the drought is unlikely to create a nationwide famine, Lehmann, based on firsthand observation, described the situation as “very serious.” “I saw long lines of children manually pouring water onto the farm fields in bottles, going back and forth between the well and paddies,” he said. “There was no mechanized system of irrigation, and water levels in dams have dropped, creating hydropower shortages.” The ambassador said he saw potential in developing renewable energy in North Korea, using solar energy, which is already being used by Pyongyangers; wind energy, based on Danish companies’ success in South Korea; and biomass energy, by turning urban and agricultural waste products into “green electricity” through bio-refineries.“But all of it requires a high level of investment and technology,” he added. The Danish government’s key foreign policy for the Korean peninsula is peace and security, Lehmann stressed, adding that his country condemned Pyongyang’s nuclear development and human rights violations. “It is very sad and unfortunate that Korea is the world’s last Cold War region with a national division,” he said. “Denmark welcomes the opening of a U.N. field office in Seoul to track the North’s human rights. We also supported the European Union’s resolution at the U.N last year, urging the country’s referral to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","in schools denmark donated 100 ,late may denmark maintains diplomatic ,korea following the devastating famine ,schools denmark donated 100 million ,denmark donated 100 million last","['North Korea', 'Danish', 'Thomas Lehmann', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'nordic', 'european', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Denmark', 'North Korea', 'Lehmann', 'the Korea Herald', 'danish', 'Thomas Lehmann', 'Arirang Mass Games', 'North Korea', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea HeraldLehmann', 'Kim Yong - nam', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Supreme People ’s Assembly', 'Kung Sok - ung', 'european', 'Pyongyang', 'Sariwon', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Danes', 'danish', 'Pyongyang', 'Sariwon', 'Lehmann', 'Sariwon', 'the World Food Program', 'Denmark', 'WFP', 'the United Nations ’', 'Lehmann', 'Denmark', 'North Korea', 'Lehmann', 'North Koreans', 'Lehmann', 'Pyongyang', 'Lehmann', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyangers', 'danish', 'South Korea', 'danish', 'korean', 'Lehmann', 'Pyongyang', 'Korea', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'the European Union ’s', 'U.N', 'the International Criminal Court', 'Joel Lee']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.55473405  0.16981459

It has accused South Korea, the U.S. and other supporters of the office of seeking to overthrow the regime by politicizing the human rights issues and meddling in its domestic affairs.Meanwhile, Pyongyang angrily responded to the U.S.’ publication last Thursday of an annual human rights report, arguing that Washington was trying to “isolate and pressure the North to death” with its hostile policy.In its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014, the U.S. State Department said that the North’s human rights record “remained among the worst in the world” last year with public executions, political prison camps and other forms of abuses. “The U.S. is sticking to its hostile policy without thinking at all of how to change its fixed perception (of North Korea),” an unnamed spokesperson of the North’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.“The U.S.’ dream (to change the North) would prove to be futile and would not be realized,” the spokesperson said. Amid growing calls for the North to stamp out any inhuman practices, the European Parliament plans to hold a hearing on the reclusive state’s human rights situation Thursday, according to the U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia. The hearing will be attended by activists, scholars and Chung Gwang-il, a defector who once lived in a prison camp.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","communist state berated seoul ,weekend warning of ruthless punishments ,state berated seoul and washington ,the communist state berated seoul ,communist state berated seoul and","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'the U.S. State Department', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'the North ’s Foreign Ministry', 'North ’s', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'U.S.', 'the European Parliament', 'the u.s.-funde Radio Free Asia', 'Chung Gwang - il', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.36459824  0.51295304

""It appears that it will be completed by October.""   Such threats from the North have created the conditions for defense talks between South Korea and Japan, but any decision on a bilateral defense ministers' meeting will depend on the two countries' overall ties, Han said.   Relations between South Korea and Japan have only recently begun to show signs of a thaw following years of tensions over disputes related to their shared history.   Meanwhile, the ruling Saenuri Party also plans to mark the anniversary of the naval skirmish to raise public awareness of security issues, according to party officials.   Chairman Kim Moo-sung and other members of the party's leadership plan to attend Monday's anniversary ceremony and meet with the families of those who were killed in the battle.   They also plan to watch the film, together with some 90 young party staff members.

Meanwhile, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se called on North Korea to take a page out of Iran’s diplomacy book to abandon its nuclear ambitions and return to the negotiating table. Citing its underground detonations in 2006, 2009 and 2013, he noted that the North was the only country to have carried out atomic tests in the 21st century. “I truly hope they will soon wake up and open their eyes to reality: Nuclear weapons bring nothing but isolation and sanctions,” the top diplomat said in an opening speech to a meeting of the group of eminent persons for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in Seoul. “The international community has a cast-iron commitment to nuclear nonproliferation, and will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. Pyongyang would do well to learn from the Iranian case and return to the dialogue table.” Yun urged the communist state to join the CTBT that forbids nuclear tests, saying its weapons program posed “the most serious challenge” to the global nonproliferation regime. The fate of the 1996 pact hangs in the balance because eight countries, including the U.S., China and Iran, have not signed or ratified it and will unlikely do so in the near future. Of the holdouts, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel are not members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Currently, 183 countries have signed the document and 164 of them have ratified it, including Seoul. Iran and world powers are working to conclude an accord by the end of the month, putting a 15-year ban on Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for a major lifting of sanctions that have crippled the economy, which is highly dependent on crude exports. Pyongyang, in contrast, refuses to restart denuclearization dialogue, including the stalled six-nation forum, claiming that with its nuclear arsenal, the agenda should now be shifted to nonproliferation. “If North Korea signs and ratifies the CTBT, it would send a strong signal in the path towards denuclearization,” Yun said. “It is crucial to prioritize the entry into force of the CTBT. But this is easier said than done. Breaking nearly two decades of inertia and intransigence will require out-of-the-box thinking.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","north korea declared thursday ,motion second korean war centering ,state media blasted south korea ,nonproliferation if north korea signs ,north korea declared thursday that","['North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Yun Byung - se', 'National Defense Commission', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'anti - north Korea', 'south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'iranian', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Iran', 'North Korea', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'Israel', 'the Non - Proliferation Treaty', 'Seoul', 'Iran', 'Tehran', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Yun', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",1,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.55115968  0.7523278

The deal paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to share such intelligence via the U.S. after the two countries failed to strike a bilateral intelligence sharing deal in 2012 due in part to negative public sentiment in South Korea about signing such a pact with the former colonial ruler.Since then, the three countries have worked out a detailed formula for intelligence sharing.""I can confirm that we have begun implementation in accordance with the trilateral agreement,"" the Pentagon official told Yonhap News Agency on condition of anonymity. It was the first confirmation that Seoul and Tokyo have shared military secrets under the deal.Citing ""the sensitive nature of the information,"" however, the official declined to provide any further specifics, including when the first intelligence sharing happened and how many pieces and what type of intelligence have been traded so far.The intelligence sharing deal is considered an effort to get around frayed relations between South Korea and Japan and move trilateral security cooperation forward.Relations between South Korea and Japan have been strained for years due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation. Their relations worsened further after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came into office as he took a series of nationalistic steps.Their ties have shown signs of improvement recently.On Monday, Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye visited each other's embassy to celebrate the 50th anniversary of normalization of diplomatic relations. Seoul's foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, also visited Tokyo this past weekend for the first time since taking office.The U.S. has called for Seoul and Tokyo to come to terms with each other. Frayed relations between the two key Asian allies are cause for concern for Washington as it seeks to develop three-way security cooperation in an effort to keep a rising China in check.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Seoul and Pyongyang moved to lay the groundwork for the peace system, but their efforts failed due to the communist state’s nuclear ambitions, along with the two sides’ political distrust and ideological division.Experts say that the two Koreas should start a sincere dialogue to remove misunderstandings about each other’s intentions for peace, ease military tensions, build mutual trust and ultimately work together toward a peace system on the peninsula. A U.S. soldier treats the wounds of a Chinese soldier who was injured during the war. (Yonhap)“Confidence building efforts are of paramount importance at this point in time should the two sides hope to replace the armistice regime ― an unstable state of peace ― with a permanent peace here,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies“They should first ensure transparency in their military activities, constantly seek dialogue at various levels to prevent misunderstandings about their intentions and think seriously about how to better coexist.”The armistice agreement, which was meant to be only provisional, has become entrenched as a unique regime to maintain stability here.The armistice, with its enforcement organizations such as the Military Armistice Commission, as well as mutual rules and principles to prevent hostilities, has served as a key mechanism to help deter border crises, defuse military tension and prevent the recurrence of another armed conflict. But some argue the armistice is already in tatters, as Pyongyang has violated it numerous times through provocations such as infiltrating into the South and launching limited attacks on South Korean forces. “Before talking about the peace regime, we should think about whether the armistice agreement has been well managed. It has been in tatters with the North setting off provocations frequently that sort of rubbed salt into the wounds of our people,” said Kim Yeoul-soo, security expert at Sungshin Women’s University.“However, South Korea should also make efforts and has a role to play. Within the comprehensive principle of engaging the North, the South should mix tactical approaches that are flexible enough to persuade the North to move in a direction of peninsular peace.”Above all, the most important task to entrench peace is to denuclearize North Korea. The task appears to be increasingly challenging as Pyongyang has defined itself as a nuclear power state in its constitution and adopted a “Byungjin” policy line of simultaneously developing nuclear arms and its economy. North Korean hostages are interrogated by the South Korean military during the Korean War. (Yonhap)The multilateral denuclearization talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia have been dormant since late 2008. Amid the absence of dialogue, the North has been advancing its nuclear capabilities to the extent that it has already reached a technical level to “miniaturize and diversify nuclear bombs.”Park Myung-lim, a peace expert at Yonsei University, said that the current security status is comprised of two regimes ― the armistice regime and nuclear regime ― and that they should be replaced by a peace regime through the denuclearization of the North and the establishment of its diplomatic ties with the U.S. and Japan.“A peace regime can be established with the North giving up its nuclear program and with both Washington and Tokyo recognizing Pyongyang and normalizing their relations with it. This would lead to a de facto peace regime,” he said.On the part of Seoul, it should exert more diplomatic efforts to activate the six-party talks, he argued.“The U.S., China, Japan and Russia may seek to focus largely on nonproliferation when it comes to North Korea’s nuclear issue. But for South Korea, the focus is on complete denuclearization as it directly affects its own security,” he said.“Thus, Seoul should take small steps first, such as restoring the six-party dialogue channel and improving inter-Korean relations. And then, based on mutual trust, it should ease Pyongyang’s concerns about the reunification by absorption in the South and work up its leadership to bring the North out to the international community.”U.N. Commander Mark W. Clark, North Korea’s Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai, the commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteers, inked the armistice on July 27, 1953 after two years of grueling negotiations over the military demarcation line, prisoners of war and other truce-related issues.

(Yonhap)The armistice was a “temporary” cessation of hostilities. The three parties recommended a higher-level political meeting be held three months later to resolve Korea-related issues including the withdrawal of foreign troops from the peninsula.The political gathering took place from April through June in 1954 in Geneva, Switzerland, with the participation of foreign ministers from 19 countries. But it failed to permanently end the war amid disputes over the UNC role, its activities and other issues.On various occasions, Pyongyang has called for a peace treaty to replace the armistice. But Seoul and Washington suspect Pyongyang intends to pressure the U.S. to withdraw its forces from the peninsula, remove its promise of nuclear protection for the South and stop the allied military drills targeting the North.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","months later to resolve korea ,war the two koreas face ,north korean hostages are interrogated ,replace the armistice but seoul ,two years of grueling negotiations","['Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification', 'the Military Armistice Commission', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Kim Yeoul - soo', 'Sungshin Women ’s University', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Yonsei University', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Mark W.

Sixty-five years on, tension is omnipresent throughout the Demilitarized Zone, a 250-kilometer-long, 4-kilometer-wide strip set up after an armistice agreement separating the two Koreas. Antipodal to its name, it remains the world’s most heavily militarized frontier, brimming with landmines, artillery, watchtowers and soldiers from each side in a perennial face-off. The two sides remain technically at war, as the three-year conflict ended in July 1953 in a truce, not a peace treaty. Official data shows that 137,899 South Korean troops were killed in action while 450,742 were wounded. Some 215,000 North Korean soldiers were estimated to have died on top of the 303,000 injured. More than 2.54 million South and North Korean civilians were killed, wounded or went missing during the war, though estimates vary. The U.S. lost about 37,000 soldiers, whereas about 114,000 Chinese troops were estimated to have been killed.As much as the massive casualties, the Korean War left a legion of hardly healable scars on millions of people across the border. Memories of separated loved ones, prisoners of war and abductees haunt their aging families in South Korea, while many veterans at home and elsewhere struggle to surmount the horrors of the battlefield. Meanwhile, the awareness -- and longing -- for a reunification is increasingly eroding among more affluent and individualistic young generations. The widening gap between the two economies stokes concerns over the astronomical costs of a possible reintegration.Artillerymen reenact a towed artillery mission wearing uniforms from the Korean War (1950-53) on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the war outbreak at a firing range in Cheolwon, Gangwon Province, on Wednesday. YonhapPredawn attackThe 38th parallel was set up as the border between the Koreas chiefly to allow the disarmament of the Japanese troops that occupied the peninsula from 1910-45, following the end of World War II. A communist regime led by Kim Il-sung was established in the North under the supervision of the Soviet Union, while a separate government led by President Syngman Rhee took off in the South, overseen by the U.S. When the Soviet Union withdrew from the peninsula in 1948, it left behind a well-armed and trained North Korean army. At the time of the U.S. pullout the next year, the South Korean military was ill-equipped and unprepared for a sudden invasion. Furnished with a wide range of weaponry, including 242 T-34 tanks and 176 self-propelled guns, mostly from the Soviet Union, North Korean troops crossed the border, catching off guard their southern counterparts, half of whom were on leave over the weekend. The North Korean army numbered around 191,600, while the South Korean military had only some 94,000 personnel.The North initially claimed that it was launching a counterattack in self-defense after the South invaded its territory. Yet hours after its attack, the U.N. Security Council issued condemnation, urging a halt to the hostilities and removal of its forces. On June 27, the council adopted a resolution recommending its member states offer military assistance to the South, while U.S. President Harry Truman ordered the U.S. military to support the South, a pivotal point to contain communist expansion. The U.N. Command was established on July 7, 1950. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was appointed as commander in chief of the U.N. forces in Korea. Sixteen countries including the U.S., the U.K. and Canada joined to fight for the South, with five additional states providing medical support. Despite early defeats, the U.N. forces drove the North Korean troops back past the 38th parallel on Oct 18. The allied forces captured Pyongyang on Oct. 19 and advanced toward the Yalu River running along the North Korean-Chinese border, precipitating Chinese intervention.Truce talksArmistice negotiations began on July 10, 1951, and lasted about two years. Hostilities continued, while the talks ran into stumbling blocks such as a repatriation of prisoners and demarcating of the truce line.Until the cease-fire was sealed on July 27, 1953, the U.N. and the communist forces held more than 760 meetings. Then came the Demilitarized Zone.Though Rhee initially refused to endorse the accord, Seoul and Washington clinched a mutual defense treaty to jointly deal with the military tensions on the peninsula on Oct. 1, which allowed U.S. forces to be stationed in the South as a deterrent against another North Korean invasion. The U.S. maintains 28,500 troops here currently.Deep woundsMore than six decades on, tension remains high on the peninsula as the sides have since engaged in a spate of military clashes. The North torpedoed the South Korean corvette Cheonan in the West Sea in March 2010, killing 46 sailors, and months later shelled Yeonpyeongdo Island. Pyongyang’s denial of responsibility and demand for a lifting of the bilateral sanctions that the then-President Lee Myung-bak imposed to forbid cross-border trade, investment, travel and other exchanges are some of flashpoints between the two Koreas. Further aggravating cross-border tension is Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. It conducted atomic tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 and is beefing up its capabilities by seeking to acquire the technology to miniaturize warheads to mount on missiles. The ongoing territorial division has left deep wounds on South Koreans whose family members failed to come with them during the war, were kidnapped by North Korean agents or taken as prisoners of war. According to the Unification Ministry, only 66,843 of the 129,688 South Koreans registered since 1988 remain alive as of May 31, meaning that more than 2,000 have died each year.Tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers are believed to have been taken prisoner by North Korea, some 500 of which Seoul thinks are still alive. About 80 prisoners of war fled to the South, more than 30 of them have since died. Government statistics say that another 80,000 South Koreans were abducted to the North between 1952 and 1953.Far-fetched dreamReunification has been a cherished dream among Korean people and a foremost goal enshrined in the country’s constitution. Last year, President Park Geun-hye set unification as the centerpiece of her second-year presidency, saying a unified Korea would bring about a “bonanza” to not only the peninsula but the region and the world, and a chance for the national economy to take a leap forward. Yet the long-held national aspiration, preserved in the popular song “Our Wish is Unification,” is rapidly fading among younger South Koreans. A recent poll by Gallup Korea showed that only 64 percent of the 1,000 respondents answered accurately when asked for the year of the outbreak of the Korean War. Aside from the heated debate on unification, many people here remain wary of its potentially immense costs and disorder. North Korea fears it would mean the demise of its iron-fisted regime and absorption into its wealthy neighbor. A 2012 study commissioned by the Unification Ministry put unification costs at between 55 trillion won and 249 trillion won ($49.6 billion to $224.5 billion), based on a 2030 price trajectory, assuming that it takes place within the next 20 years and is a peaceful transition. The upper end of that range is about one-fifth of the South’s 2011 gross domestic product. The ministry in charge of inter-Korean affairs, such as humanitarian aid and the Gaeseong Industrial Complex, aims to collect up to 50 trillion won by 2030 under the South-North Cooperation Fund from public donations and state coffers.

Those in their 30s were most reluctant to take part with 75 percent, which the polling agency viewed as a result of them being the age group where they may feel greater responsibility for their family, being married and having young children.Of 463 female respondents, 55 percent said they would participate in such a war, with 50-something women most willing to play a part in an inter-Korean conflict. The survey polled randomly chose 1,000 Koreans aged 19 or older from June 16-18, using automated phone interviews.  (Yonhap)The survey asked the respondents six questions on their perceptions about the Korean War that broke out on June 25, 1950, later involving more than 20 countries.The poll showed that only 64 percent knew the exact year the Korean War took place, with those in their 40s being the most aware among the groups, with 81 percent. The rate was the lowest among 20-somethings at 53 percent.The survey also suggested that the majority of Koreans, or 87 percent, believe that North Korea started the Korean War. Only 6 percent said that both Koreas were responsible for the outbreak of the war.While it is widely believed that North Korea started the Korean War by invading South Korea, some scholars view the war as having been initiated by both Koreas or intervention by external forces such as the U.S., Soviet Union and China.The U.S. and 20 other allied countries fought alongside South Korea under the United Nations flag, while the Soviet Union and China supported North Korea. It ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically at war to date. Regarding the prospects of any inter-Korean war, more than half of the surveyed said that there is no or little possibility, while 39 percent said that it could happen. Koreans‘ predictions remain largely unchanged for the past decade despite North Korea’s military aggressions. In 2007, 51 percent of Koreans expected a war to break out, but the rate fell to 35 percent in 2013, despite the communist neighbor carrying out its third nuclear test earlier that year.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","percent of koreans expected war ,korean men will readily fight ,51 percent of koreans expected ,10 korean men will ,10 korean men will readily","['korean', 'North Korea', 'Gallup Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'Soviet Union', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'United Nations', 'the Soviet Union', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'Koreans', 'North Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 2.          2.          0.         ... -0.18943901  0.4354662

(Yonhap) Lee explained that the Women’s Development Act has been “the constitution of women’s policies in Korea.” The implementation of the act eventually led to the establishment of other important laws, such as the Domestic Violence Prevention Act and the Act on the Prevention of Sexual Assault, she said. “I think the act is what also made the abolishment of the male-dominated family registration system possible. That happened only 10 years ago in Korea,” Lee said. “Changing its name doesn’t mean that we are going to break away from this history. The act will always carry the essence of the initial act.”One of the biggest changes to follow will be men’s rights to fatherhood in addition to women’s rights to motherhood. Starting July 1, all men will be given the right to take paternity leave once having children. “We believe the new laws will give fathers a greater sense of security,” said Lee.“Many fathers choose not to take paternity leave fearing that it could lead to career disadvantages. But when the law stipulates that every citizen has the right to family life and parenthood, I think it can make a difference.”The number of Korean fathers who chose to take paternity leave increased by almost tenfold from 2008 to 2014, from 355 to 3,421. In spite of the increase, however, the number of fathers who took the leave last year only accounted for 4.4 percent of all working dads in the country. Meanwhile, Korea’s wage gap between men and women last year was 38.9 percent, which was the highest among the OECD countries. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Report in 2013, Korea ranked 111th out of 136 nations. According to the Ministry of Gender Equality, only 53.9 percent of women were in the labor force in 2013. The Gender Ministry hopes to increase women’s employment rate to 61.9 percent from last year’s 53.9 by the year 2017. It also hopes to close the gender gap by more than 10 percent by the same year.Park Nan-sook, the spokeswoman of the ministry, said the name change of the act is to promote work and life balance among all citizens, regardless of their gender.“It can be a virtuous circle,” she said. “Once more women are in the workforce, more men wouldn’t feel the burden of being the sole breadwinner in the family. When more men participate in child care and domestic affairs, more women would have career opportunities that they would love to fulfill.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","gender equality on tuesday ,of gender equality on tuesday ,gender equality on tuesday we ,women rights to motherhood starting ,gender equality act on july","['South Korea ’s', 'Women ’s Development Act', 'Gender', 'Lee Ki - soon', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'the Women ’s Development Act', 'Korea', 'the Domestic Violence Prevention Act', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'the World Economic Forum ’s', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Park Nan - sook', 'Claire Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65490961  0.43783256

The commander, however, refused to comment on his assessment about the situation in North Korea and its capabilities, as well as the potential deployment of the advanced U.S. missile defense system, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery, on the Korean Peninsula.Washington has expressed its willingness to deploy the battery on the Korean Peninsula to better protect South Korea and some 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country from North Korea's threats.In a meeting between Haney and the chairman of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Choi Yun-hee, they ""assessed a wide range of threats by North Korea, including its nuclear and missile programs and cyber attacks,"" reaffirming the importance of the Seoul-Washington alliance for regional peace and stability, the JCS said in a statement.The focus of the talks was ""the discussions about how to effectively respond to them by deploying the U.S. assets in emergency cases,"" the statement said without further elaboration.Officials at the JCS refused to specify on what kinds of U.S. assets would be deployed to the peninsula to deter and counter the communist North, while noting that the THAAD issue was not on the table for the meeting between Choi and Haney.His visit came amid renewed tensions on the peninsula, as North Korea has been further zeroing in on developing ballistic missiles, miniaturized warheads to fit atop them and their delivery means.Last month, Pyongyang announced that it succeeded in conducting an underwater test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.As one of nine Unified Combatant Commanders of the U.S. established in 1992, the Strategic Command is in charge of missile defense, intelligence, global strikes and strategic deterrence, including its nuclear arsenal and combating weapons of mass destruction.

Although they have only recently become widely used, the basic technology that goes into creating a drone was first developed in the early 20th century.Through decades of research, the U.S. military was able to deploy drones during the Vietnam War and increasingly advanced and deadlier versions have carried out precision bombings in recent years, if with mixed results. However, the days when the word “drone” referred mainly to military UAVs are slowly fading away. While much less high-tech, and far from deadly, drone technology has embedded itself into very diverse areas of everyday life. Companies like Amazon have taken up drones as a new delivery system, while camera drones have opened up entirely new angles for video media producers. (123rf)Even news organizations have embraced drones as a novel way to collect information. Earlier this month, China’s Xinhua News Agency launched what has been dubbed the “drone reporters corps” by the Korean media. The state-run agency plans to use drones to collect video footage and information on weather, which will then be used in making news stories. However, the biggest change to take place in the drone market is the rise in drones for recreational use. “To be really honest, I bought a drone just because it seemed like a cool idea,” said Chung Won-jae, a 35-year old office worker who began flying drones a few months ago. “Then I got sucked in. A drone allows me to see my surroundings like an angel, which would otherwise be impossible, and there are so many types out there that it has become almost an obsession.” From the toy-like rudimentary drones to others fitted with professional grade cameras, a huge range of drones are on offer. As drone technology advances, there are now even models like the Hexo+ that autonomously follow and capture images of the user. The way drones are marketed has also changed. Drones were once marketed largely through online shopping services, but now they are readily available at offline stores, including large retail outlets such E-mart, some of whose branches have seen double-digit sales growth this year. There is, however, a darker side to the popularity of drones. The rapidly rotating blades of the drones’ propellers pose a significant threat to the unwary, and drones have been compared to “flying lawnmowers” by some enthusiasts, highlighting the injuries drones can potentially cause.The physical danger drones pose was clearly demonstrated in front of thousands of concertgoers recently when singer Enrique Iglesias sustained serious injury to his hand when he grabbed a drone on stage.However, perhaps the more serious issues surrounding drones are those regarding privacy and their potential use in terrorism and other criminal activities. In a development that prompted Japanese authorities to seek tougher drone regulations, 40-year-old Yasuo Yamamoto flew a drone carrying a small amount of radioactive material onto the roof of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s office. After his arrest, he revealed that he was protesting against the Abe administration’s plans to restart old nuclear reactors. With drones becoming increasingly affordable, camera drones have become a potential tool for the paparazzi and others hoping to take sneaky snaps even when the subject is within the walls of his or her home. Faced with such a possibility, the California government recently passed a law posing hefty penalties for those using camera drones to photograph somebody who is “under circumstances in which (they) had a reasonable expectation of privacy.” Korea’s regulations regarding drones, however, remain far less sophisticated. Existing regulations mainly deal with no-fly zones ― the airspace near the presidential office, military facilities and other areas concerned with security ― and size and flight altitude of drones.

East Asia, on the other hand, has been mired in geopolitical tensions despite its integrated economies, a situation described as the “Asian Paradox.” The Asan Institute for Policy Studies, together with the German, French, Polish and British embassies, held the “Post-WWII Reconciliation and Cooperation: Lessons for East Asia” conference Wednesday, inviting diplomats and scholars to share Europe’s lessons.  British Ambassador Charles Hay (left) moderates a panel beside Etienne Rolland-Piegue (center), deputy head of mission of the French embassy, and Kent University professor Hugh Miall at the “Post-WWII Reconciliation and Cooperation: Lessons for East Asia” conference at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul on Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)While acknowledging the different situation in East Asia, the participants voiced similar opinions on the need to sustain long-term political commitment and activate society for internal cohesion and external solidarity. For Germany, the end of the war meant defeat and division, along with liberation from the Nazi dictatorship, German Ambassador Rolf Mafael said in an opening speech.“The situation was clear. We had started the war and had to take responsibility for the horrendous crimes against Europeans and Jewish people,” Mafael stressed. “We were also lucky in that our neighbors extended their hands of friendship to allow reconciliation to take place.”Germany’s reconciliatory approach involved political leadership and social correspondence with neighboring citizens. French President Charles de Gaulle took “visionary and courageous steps” toward German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, building on the people exchanges from the 1950s. The two countries signed the Elysee Treaty in 1963 to forge friendship.Reconciling with Poland was more difficult, and took institutionalization and top-down leadership. “Building consensus took 20 years of consistent approach by successive governments,” the German ambassador noted, adding that the conservative government of Helmut Kohl inherited the policies of predecessors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt.Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka expressed his opinion that Europe’s successful experience is possible in East Asia, and people should not labor the point of difference between Christianity and Confucianism as underlying values. “What is important is respect for humanity, which exists in both systems,” argued the Polish ambassador. Another lesson is that society-wide reconciliation should be encouraged, as it can create “a momentum of its own” to buttress state initiatives. Passing the buck to the government makes reconciliation diplomatic and compromise more difficult, he said.Majka recommended combining official apology, financial compensation, historical commemoration, joint education projects, student exchange, cultural events and municipal partnership, saying that diverse actors can bring diverse tactics. He also underscored the importance of arriving at a generational accord through dialogue and education. The deputy head of mission of the French embassy, Etienne Rolland-Piegue, said he learned the German language from elementary school and visited a German friend in Frankfurt every summer. He studied German philosophy and listened to German pop music as a teenager. “The French-German reconciliation served as a stepping stone for a larger European integration,” the deputy head of mission said. “We don’t use the word reconciliation anymore, because it is way past us. We talk about friendship and cooperation instead.”French Culture and Communication Minister Fleur Pellerin, who was born in Korea but adopted in France as an infant, went to a French-German high school outside of Paris. University of Kent professor Hugh Miall said: “Reconciliation involves political risk-taking and persuasion to bring the society on board. It requires the whole society to come to terms with itself, sometimes reaching a new identity from that of a victim or perpetrator to fellow human beings.” Unlike the Franco-German reconciliation, which was deep and immediate, the Anglo-German reconciliation took longer to be established, the professor said. Not until 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II visited Germany did the relations begin to thaw. Even into the 1980s and ’90s, Britain’s diplomatic moves to apologize for the bombing of Germany raised criticism from veterans. A full reconciliation with European partners has now taken place, according to the professor. “As Britain emerged the victor of the war, there was no need for Britain to change,” Miall said. “But Germany needed a complete self-transformation to be accepted by its neighbors and regain sovereignty.”In consequence, Britain is currently undergoing identity transformations, as demonstrated by the rise of nationalist movements across the British Isles, he added. Mari Fitzduff of Brandeis University, Jakub Taylor of Warsaw University, Patrician Oster-Stierle of the Franco-German University, Lee Geun of Seoul National University and Lee Jae-hyon of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies spoke as panelists.

""The reactor seems to have been operating irregularly since fall 2014 although the exact nature of the problems facing Pyongyang remain unclear.""The graphite-moderated reactor has been the source of weapons-grade plutonium for the communist nation. The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods which, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make one bomb a year.In addition to the 5-megawatt reactor, the North has also been building a larger-scale light water nuclear reactor at Yongbyon that experts say could give Pyongyang enough plutonium to make about five or six weapons a year.On Wednesday, 38 North also said that the North has begun new construction near the light water reactor.Satellite imagery ""shows Pyongyang is building a structure probably intended to support transformers and power distribution equipment for the production of electricity,"" the North's stated-purpose of the new reactor, 38 North said. ""Nearby power lines can be extended to the building once it is completed, allowing the North to begin reactor operations when ready.

The preliminary signing was done in Seoul on April 22, ending four and a half years of tough negotiations.After the deliberation process in the U.S. Congress, the agreement is expected to take effect at the end of this year, at the earliest, or early next year. Seoul does not need parliamentary ratification to implement the revision.Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said Yun and Moniz recognized that the revision would help the allies elevate their cooperative relationship in the atomic energy sector to a “strategic and future-oriented” partnership and that the agreement would be “another milestone” in the alliance.“Yun evaluated the revision as an expansion of the ‘modern and mutually beneficial’ cooperation between the allies as this is to allow (South Korea) to efficiently manage spent fuel, stably supply nuclear fuel and bolster exports of nuclear reactors,” said the ministry in a press release.“He also said the revision is another example of South Korea and the U.S. strengthening strategic cooperation in an innovative, future-oriented way, and will serve as another core pillar of the alliance.”During the signing, Moniz underscored that the allies are staunch supporters of nonproliferation goals, and that the deal will allow them to enter a “new phase of cooperation.”Under the previous 1974 agreement, South Korea was barred from reprocessing spent fuel and enriching uranium in exchange for technological assistance from the U.S.The revision, however, opens the possibilities for Seoul to produce low-enriched uranium with Washington’s consent. It also allows South Korean scientists to conduct early-stage research into a new type of technology to reprocess spent fuel, called “pyroprocessing,” which is thought to have a lower chance of being used to build nuclear bombs.

The technology, known as ""pyroprocessing,"" has yet to be fully developed for commercial and industrial use.Article 11 of the agreement and section five of the approved minutes stipulate that South Korea may reprocess nuclear fuel in a way that leaves separated plutonium mixed with other elements.

Under Article 11 and Section Seven of the approved minutes, South Korea can enrich uranium with the U.S.' consent.Uranium ""may be enriched only if the parties agree in writing on an arrangement to do so following consultations undertaken bilaterally through the High Level Bilateral Commission"" and ""the enrichment is only up to less than 20 percent in the uranium isotope 235,"" according to Article 11.The commission is to be set up under the agreement, led by a South Korean vice foreign minister and the U.S. deputy secretary of energy.It will ""facilitate the Parties' strategic cooperation and dialogue regarding areas of mutual interest in civil nuclear energy, including the civil nuclear fuel cycle.""These areas will include assured fuel supply, spent fuel management, export cooperation and nuclear security.The agreement opens the path for South Korea to expand its exports of nuclear power plants.""The Parties agree to the retransfer, subject to paragraph 3 of this Section, of unirradiated low enriched uranium, unirradiated source material, equipment and components subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Agreement to third countries or destinations identified as provided for in this Section,"" according to Section Three.

The new deal still bans Seoul from reprocessing and enrichment, but it opens the way for the Asian ally to begin research into a new technology for spent nuclear fuel recycling, known as ""pyroprocessing,"" and to make low-level enriched uranium with U.S. consent.Both Yun and Moniz called Monday's signing a ""historic moment.""""We feel that this new agreement will upgrade our relations to a new height and -- thanks to this innovative, very much future-oriented agreement -- we will be able to work together in many new areas,"" Yun said during the ceremony at the Energy Department. ""This will get us securing a stable supply of nuclear fuel and manage spent fuel more efficiently and there are many areas where we can collaborate together in third countries. So this will give a big boost to Korean and American businesses as well,"" he said.Moniz emphasized South Korea and the U.S. are strong advocates for nonproliferation objectives.""This agreement solidifies that again as we enter a new phase of our cooperation,"" he said. The secretary also said that the U.S.-Korea partnership is an ""absolute anchor"" for peace and stability in the region and the partnership cannot be stronger.Since the initialing, the two governments conducted legal and other internal reviews before South Korean President Park Geun-hye approved the deal in a Cabinet meeting on June 9 and U.S. President Barack Obama gave it a go-ahead last week.The two countries had originally planned to hold a signing ceremony during Park's visit to Washington that had been set for this week, but the plan fell through as she postponed the trip due to the massive outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea.Now that the agreement has been formally signed, the U.S. Congress will review the agreement for 90 congressional days, which could take up to six months, and the pact will go into effect if no opposition is raised during the process.Widespread views are that no objections will be raised.No legislative approval is necessary in South Korea, officials said.The two countries began negotiations in 2010 to renew the agreement that had originally been scheduled to expire in 2014.After failing to find a compromise, the two sides extended the existing agreement by two years to buy time for more negotiations.Meanwhile, Yun was scheduled to meet with U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice later in the day for talks that are expected to include rescheduling Park's visit to Washington, the North Korean nuclear standoff and other pending issues.""We will push for a U.S. visit within the earliest possible time,"" Yun told reporters after the signing ceremony. ""We can say it will be within this year for us.""Asked about North Korea's expression of willingness to hold government-level talks with the South, Yun said that the door for dialogue with Pyongyang is always open and the Seoul government will deal with the issue with an open-minded attitude.

The pair, a 59-year-old man surnamed Lee and a 51-year-old woman surnamed Chin, will be handed over to South Korean authorities at the border village of Panmunjeom on Wednesday, the Unification Ministry said. They went missing on May 11 while traveling near the North Korea-China frontier.Yet Pyongyang reiterated the significance of an “independent approach” to cross-border and unification affairs, calling on Seoul to shelve slander, joint military drills with the U.S. and anti-North Korea international alliances. “There is no reason not to hold dialogue and negotiations between the two states if the mood for trust and reconciliation is created,” said a statement carried in the name of the North Korean government by its official Korean Central News Agency.“The two Koreas should take practical steps to implement the historic joint statements.”  Pak Yong-sik (circled), who appears to have been appointed North Korea’s new defense minister after serving as a deputy director of the People’s Armed Forces’ General Political Bureau, is seated next to leader Kim Jong-un in an image carried Monday by the Workers’ Party’s Rodong Sinmun of them attending a performance by the military’s art propaganda squad. (Yonhap)In 2000, South Korea’s then-President Kim Dae-jung held a watershed summit with North Korea’s late strongman Kim Jong-il and announced the June 15 joint declaration, paving the way for inter-Korean rapprochement through humanitarian and economic cooperation.But cross-border ties appear to have only been souring, rather than showing signs of a thaw, as the North’s Kim Jong-un regime continues to develop nuclear weapons and engage in other provocations and shows of force. The Park Geun-hye administration, for its part, has repeatedly failed to capitalize on the rare momentum for a reconciliation, including a surprise visit on Oct. 4 to the South by three top North Korean officials primarily aimed at attending the closing ceremony of the Asian Games and the first high-level inter-Korean talks since 2007 in February 2014 and ensuing reunions of separated families -- in the face of spats such as over anti-Pyongyang leaflets or Seoul’s sanctions. Ahead of the anniversary, an inter-Korean committee chiefly consisting of the South’s activists and the North’s officials had initially sought to arrange its first joint celebration since 2008 on June 14-15 in the two countries’ capitals simultaneously. Yet their plans did not materialize as the sides wrangled over the location of major events and program details, dampening hopes for an upcoming project to mark the 70th anniversary of the peninsula’s liberation on Aug. 15. Though the latest statement struck an unusually upbeat tone and with the rare conciliatory move to return the South Korean tourists, the prospects for the checkered relationship remain bleak given the regime’s unabated military ambition and inconceivable demands associated with the South Korea-U.S. alliance. The two Koreas agreed to refrain from slander during the February 2014 talks as a first step to building mutual trust. But the heated debate over anti-North Korea leaflets has deepened Seoul’s dilemma between the need for improved ties with Pyongyang and the citizens’ freedoms of expression, assembly and association.Korea and its allies are also scheduled to stage their annual major military exercises in August. With Park’s third year being marred by a string of scandals and bungled disaster responses, the Aug. 15 celebration may mean a pivotal chance to bring about a turnaround in inter-Korean relations and keep the lame-duck period at bay, some analysts say. “We’re hoping to consult smoothly with North Korea for the success of joint projects for the liberation anniversary at the private level, and on the government level. If official dialogue is needed to expedite the plans, we’re longing to hold one,” Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said at a news briefing early in the day.(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","return home two south koreans ,summit with north korea late ,north korea said monday ,two koreas landmark peace declaration ,return the south korean tourists","['North Korea', 'South Koreans', 'Lee', 'Chin', 'south korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'the Unification Ministry', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'anti - north Korea', 'north korean', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'Koreas', 'Pak Yong - sik', 'North Korea ’s', 'the People ’s Armed Forces ’ General Political Bureau', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Workers ’ Party ’s', 'Rodong Sinmun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - il', 'inter - korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'North ’s', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Korea', 'Park', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Unification Ministry', 'Lim Byeong - cheol']",2,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.5786913   0.77546781

It also urged Seoul to abolish legal and institutional systems that hamper inter-Korean exchanges.Pyongyang demanded Seoul abide by the spirit of the landmark inter-Korean declarations, the outcome of two inter-Korean summits in 2000 and 2007, which call for peace and reconciliation on the peninsula.The statement came one day after North Korea test-fired three short-range missiles into the East Sea.The North's provocative acts have never ceased, raising tension on the divided peninsula. Last month, the North claimed it had successfully fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile.The South Korean government has not responded to the North's statement.Experts said that the ball is now in South Korea's court as the North at least showed its readiness for the talks, though some conditions are attached.""Given the statement was rare, the North appeared to send a message that if the South shows some sincerity over the issues of the drills and Seoul's punitive actions, the North is ready to have talks,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.South Korea needs to be active in having talks with North Korea for better inter-Korean ties, said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies under Seoul National University.""Seoul will not lift the punitive sanctions against Pyongyang, but it can show sincerity for the talks by curbing Seoul activists' launch of anti-Pyongyang leaflets or approving inter-Korean exchanges,"" he added.

This deployment will ensure that we stay ahead of the new road-mobile ICBM threat from North Korea,"" he said.Rose was apparently referring to the North's KN-08 missile.Even though the missile has not been tested yet, U.S. military officials have increasingly voiced concerns about the missile as it is harder to keep an eye on as it can be launched from mobile launchers.In April, Adm. William Gortney, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, said the North is believed to be capable of miniaturizing nuclear warheads to put on its new KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile and fire it at the U.S. mainland.Rose also said that the U.S. is developing ""a new radar that will provide persistent sensor coverage and improve discrimination capabilities against the North Korean threat"" and is redesigning the kill vehicle for the ground-based interceptor.Last month, the Pentagon unveiled a plan to deploy a long-range discrimination radar in Alaska by 2020, saying it will increase the capacity of the ground-based midcourse defense inventory of interceptors in Alaska and California.""At the same time, we have made clear, both in our policy and in the capabilities we have deployed, that our homeland defense is not intended to affect the strategic balance with Russia and China,"" Rose said.China and Russia have voiced strong opposition to the potential U.S. deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense battery in South Korea, claiming the deployment would hurt their security interests.

There are 3,680 people under quarantine at present, but this number is down from over 3,800 on Thursday.  ""Taking into account South Korea's advanced medical service sector and high level of expertise of its health professionals, there is no doubt that the current MERS situation will be contained,"" the policymaker said.  He then asked the diplomats to provide detailed information on developments taking place in South Korea to their respective governments so as to prevent excessive measures being taken that can fuel worries.  Choi then said that every effort is being made to halt the spread of MERS this week and highlighted that the government is holding daily meetings attended by top officials to check all the latest developments and listen to feedback. He said a quick response team has been set up to support people who may have been infected by the MERS virus.  The acting prime minister said to reduce the shock on the economy, the government has earmarked 400 billion won ($360 million) to help companies and regions hard hit by MERS and help tourism and hospitality-related businesses that are feeling the pinch as people cancel trips.  ""The lowering of the country's key rate by the central bank on Thursday to a record low 1.5 percent can be helpful in coping with the MERS outbreak,"" Choi said.  He also said that health authorities even set up an English service emergency hotline for foreigners in the country who feel they may have contracted MERS. People can dial 109 to get help and instructions.  ""In the case foreigners who are quarantined, embassy of the country he or she is from will be contacted immediately,"" the official said. At the gathering, representatives from the World Health Organization said there is little risk of South Korea not being able to contain MERS.

The Ministry of Environment said it would choose one from among the four options before the country submits it to the United Nations later this month. National goals will be evaluated for a new global climate change pact to be adopted at a U.N. conference in Paris in December. Korea‘s new proposals call for a reduction by 14.7 percent, 19.2 percent, 25.7 percent or 31.3 percent from the business-as-usual level by 2030. Given more than 850 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent are projected to be released that year according to the government, the options mean limiting the anticipated emissions to between 585 million and 726 million tons. The proposals drew criticism from both environmentalists and businesses. Civic groups say that the plan is weaker than the nation’s previously declared commitments.In 2009, the government proposed a reduction of about 543 million tons by 2020. This was a 4 percent cut in actual emissions from 2005 levels, or a 30 percent cut from projected levels.  Except the most aggressive goal of 31.3 percent, the other three options are likely to allow for more emissions by then, they said. Businesses, on the other hand, expressed concerns about possible damage to cost competitiveness. They claimed the government’s plan underestimates the expected level of emissions in 2030.They project that over 900 million tons of CO2e will be emitted, which is about 50 million tons more than the government’s calculation. The ministry said the targets were drafted in consideration of feasibility, gross domestic product forecasts, potential economic impacts and growing international demand. The government plans to hold public hearings starting from Friday to make a final choice of its “intended nationally determined contribution” to global climate reduction efforts by the end of the month. The U.N. Climate Change Conference, or the Conference of the Parties 21, in December is intended to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which experts consider to be the threshold for catastrophic climate change. About 200 countries will likely set up a new global agreement on climate change in Paris to replace the Kyoto Protocol from 1997. The new agreement is expected to involve developing countries in the climate change effort for the first time. The Kyoto Protocol only required developed states to curb emissions, stirring international calls for the participation of developing countries with growing emissions. Korea was not obligated to cut emissions but has voluntarily sought to contribute to a carbon cut. As of this month, 38 countries, including the U.S. and European Union members, submitted their cut pledges. China, Japan and Singapore are expected to unveil their plans soon, officials said. By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","korea on thursday unveiled four ,south korea on thursday unveiled ,in december korea new proposals ,public hearings starting from friday ,korea on thursday unveiled","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Environment', 'the United Nations', 'U.N.', 'Paris', 'korea‘s', 'the U.N.

The world powers suspect Iran could use its nuclear facilities to build bombs, while Tehran insists they are for peaceful purposes, such as electricity production.  At the start of the session, the diplomats talked briefly about the recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea. The viral disease has claimed the lives of nine people here and infected more than a hundred others.  ""Despite the fact that MERS has been causing a lot of concern to foreign visitors of Korea nowadays, but yet you came here as a good friend, overcoming the concern over MERS. For that, we are very much grateful to you and your delegation,"" Kwon said.  Mohajer joked that his wife had serious concerns about him traveling here, saying the issue was likely exaggerated by the international press.  ""I thought that if I do not come here perhaps it could make some sabotage between the friendship between ourselves,"" he said. ""So I decided finally to come and I pray to God almighty that your country would overcome this disease and you would resolve this issue.""  After the first few minutes, which were open to media, they went into closed-door talks.  Once the nuclear deal is sealed, Iran will be able access its oil money in banks in Europe and other parts of the world valued at tens of billions of U.S. dollars.  Much of that cash is expected to be invested in building infrastructure in the Middle Eastern nation, where South Korean firms could win major construction projects.  South Korea hopes to secure a foothold in the oil-rich nation before the sanctions are lifted, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Talks have been underway to arrange visits to Iran by First Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong and Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Hong-kyun in the coming weeks, the official said. Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se could also plan a trip to Iran following the nuclear deal.  Mohajer is scheduled to meet with Kim during his stay here.  Kwon, meanwhile, will fly to Egypt next week on a three-stop tour of the Middle East, the Foreign Ministry said.  On Sunday, he will meet with Arab League officials in Cairo to discuss bilateral exchanges and ways to strengthen their cooperation, it said in a press release.  He will then fly to Ankara for policy coordination on pending Middle East issues. Kwon will meet with his Turkish counterpart on Tuesday for talks on their response to the Islamic State terrorist group, the Iranian nuclear issue and security issues in the Middle East, according to the ministry.  On the final leg of his trip, Kwon will meet with Lebanese foreign ministry officials in Beirut on Wednesday to discuss bilateral issues, the political situation in the Middle East and Northeast Asia, and cooperation on global issues.  The series of meetings is expected to help enhance ties between South Korea and the Middle East, boost cooperation on Middle Eastern Affairs and secure the support of Middle Eastern nations for South Korea's interests on the international stage, the ministry said.

The Defense Ministry said Monday it has proposed an amendment to the military aircraft operation act to shore up “defects” in its ADIZ management and lay the legal foundation for the use of drones. In 2013, the country announced its new ADIZ that stretches further south to include its submerged rock of Ieodo and areas south of Marado and Hongdo islands. The first expansion in 62 years followed Beijing’s unilateral airspace declaration, which sparked fresh regional tension because its ADIZ included Ieodo and a chain of islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan and claimed by China. The revision calls for “national security” to be included in the aim of the legislation, unmanned aerial vehicles to be added to the definition of military aircraft, and measures to be devised to detect unidentified flyers. “The concept of national security was inserted as more military and civilian jets operated by neighboring countries violate our ADIZ in line with the overlapping of the ADIZs of Korea, China and Japan resulting from China’s demarcation and Korea’s expansion, posing an additional source of threats to the safety of the nation and people,” the text reads. “The newly added phrases are aimed at establishing the legal basis for taking steps to identify unidentified aircraft in our ADIZ given that the current law only stipulates the grounds to formulate the measures.” Though it did not elaborate on the identification measures other than sending military planes, ministry officials are believed to be considering using long-range air search radar. They also refused to provide the number of cases of unreported entries by foreign jets, but indicated that most of them are of Chinese origin. “Japanese planes would not breach ours even though the two countries’ ADIZs overlap, because we’ve agreed to notify any entry to each other,” a ministry official said, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Located south of Jejudo Island and 4.6 meters below sea level, Ieodo has often been a source of diplomatic spats between Seoul and Beijing as it lies in the intersection of the two neighbors’ exclusive economic zones. Until the 2013 expansion, South Korea’s ADIZ, demarcated by the U.S. in 1951 during the Korean War, did not cover the reef, where it has been operating a scientific research facility since 2003.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","2013 expansion south korea adiz ,use of drones in 2013 ,the 2013 expansion south korea ,followed beijing unilateral airspace declaration ,2013 expansion south korea","['South Korea', 'the Defense Ministry', 'ADIZ', 'ADIZ', 'Ieodo', 'Marado', 'Hongdo', 'Beijing ’s', 'ADIZ', 'Ieodo', 'Japan', 'China', 'ADIZ', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'China', 'Korea', 'ADIZ', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'Ieodo', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'South Korea ’s', 'ADIZ', 'U.S.', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 1.          3.          0.         ... -0.52622527  0.54839271

Specific places for the installment will be made public,"" Lim said.  Concerns about the spread of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome are growing in the South as the virus has killed six South Koreans so far, while the number of those infected has increased to 87.  The communist country has been highly sensitive to the outbreak of contagious diseases due to its weak health care system. Last year, Pyongyang imposed an entry ban on foreign tourists for about five months due to concerns over the deadly Ebola virus.  This is not the first time that Seoul has provided such devices to Pyongyang at the North's request.  In November, the South lent three thermal scanners to the North when fears of the Ebola virus gripped the world. In 2009, the North made a similar request to the South over concerns of avian flu.  A group of 124 South Korean firms operating at the complex is also likely to provide masks to the North Korean workers, it said.  Touching on a wage row at the zone, Lim said that there has been no progress over wage talks between the quasi-state committees of the two Koreas. The two countries have been embroiled in a dispute following the North's unilateral wage hike.  In what may be a relief to the prolonged row, on May 20, the North accepted the South's tentative offer to pay wages at the current level for the North Korean workers at the zone. The move allows the two sides to buy time for talks on the more sensitive issue of Pyongyang's unilateral wage hike.  ""Given the period for May wage payment is approaching, the Seoul government plans to make efforts to hold the talks with the North,"" Lim said.

The latest plan, the seventh of its kind, was submitted to the National Assembly. It is expected to be finalized before the end of the month following a parliamentary review.  ""The seventh basic plan on power supply places priority on setting up a mixture of energy sources that can minimize greenhouse gas emissions by building two new nuclear reactors for a stable supply of power while withdrawing earlier plans for coal-generated power plants,"" the ministry said in a press release.  The country currently operates 23 nuclear reactors while 11 others are or will soon be under construction.  The plan comes as the country's overall use of electricity is expected to increase by an annual average of 2.2 percent over the next 15 years, reaching 656,883 gigawatt-hours in 2029, with its peak demand expected to reach 111,930 megawatts from 80,154 megawatts in 2014.  Such estimates, however, reflect an aggressive government plan to cut the country's annual use of electricity and peak demand by 14.3 percent and 12 percent, respectively, from their business-as-usual levels in 2029.  ""The seventh basic plan on power supply contains the most aggressive measures the country can take to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with its Post 2020 Climate Change Mitigation Commitments,"" the ministry said.  The post-2020 regime is a new international agreement sought by the United Nations that will set each of its member's own commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  South Korea is expected to submit its own report before the end of September.  The government has yet to reveal its voluntary commitments, but the latest energy plan suggests the country boost its use of clean and renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, by at least five times to 32,890 MW, in terms of generation capacity, in 2029.  It also calls for the withdrawal of plans for at least four coal-fired power plants under the sixth power supply basic plan to help further reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions.  With the proposed changes in the country's power sources, nuclear power plants will account for 28.5 percent of the country's overall power supply, in terms of generation capacity, in 2029.  The figure compares with 27.4 percent under the sixth basic plan announced two years ago.  The proportion of fossil-fuel power plants, on the other hand, will be lowered from 34.7 percent to 32.2 percent, while that of clean, renewable energy sources will rise from 4.5 percent to 4.6 percent, the ministry said.

I haven’t heard any major discussion on the (Korea-China) free trade deal taking place right now,” main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy spokesperson Kim Sung-soo said Sunday.Representatives of Beijing and Seoul approved the trade deal last November and gave their final blessings at a signing ceremony last Monday in Seoul, ending a decade of talks. Approval at Seoul’s unicameral legislature will seal the deal in South Korea.   South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy Yoon Sang-jick (right) and Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng (left) pose for photos after signing the free trade agreement between their two countries. (Yonhap)The NPAD conditionally supports the trade deal. The governing Saenuri Party is in full support.South Korea’s main opposition party has vowed to OK the deal only if the government provides adequate subsidies to farmers and fishermen, the two interest groups likely to be hit the hardest as the FTA would allow China to export cheaper food products to Korea.“We aren’t necessarily opposing the deal. It is our party line that we will examine the treaty to ensure there aren’t any unfair parts,” Kim said.The NPAD confirmed last Thursday that it would form a panel to review the deal and decide whether to object it.“I’m not sure about the specifics of the panel, but we will form the panel very soon,” said NPAD Rep. Shim Jae-kwon, the senior NPAD lawmaker on the parliament’s foreign affairs committee.“But I also think that the legislature should form a separate panel to discuss this free trade deal, separate from the foreign affairs committee,” Shim said, apparently hinting that talks over the deal could take longer than expected in South Korea’s legislature.The government vowed last Friday it would earmark 897 billion won ($797 million) for subsidies to the agricultural, fishing, dairy and forestry industries. Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs officials expressed hope the funds would improve the quality of South Korean products, and give them an edge over China’s cheaper but lower-quality food producers.The governing Saenuri Party supports the deal, echoing the Park Geun-hye administration’s view that the free trade agreement offers Korea a “second domestic market” that will improve the nation’s long-term economic prospects.South Korea’s real gross domestic production will grow by as much as 0.96 percent, increase consumer benefits by $14.6 billion and create over 50,000 jobs in the next decade, Seoul’s Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy said last Monday.

China and South Korea last Monday formally signed the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA. (Xinhua-Yonhap)The Saenuri Party’s 160-seat majority in the 298-seat Assembly ensures that it can bulldoze the trade deal through the parliament.Although the NPAD could filibuster the treaty, Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa also holds the right to veto the filibuster. Chung is a former ruling party lawmaker who, following typical customs, gave up his party membership after assuming the legislature’s top post last May.The NPAD’s hold on the chairmanship of the parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee also allows the party to stall the treaty from final voting. NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, as the committee chair, can block bills from going to a final vote, unless a three-fifths majority at a related parliamentary panel overrules Lee’s veto. But the ruling party’s three-fifths majority at the foreign affairs committee means Saenuri officials can overrule Lee.But most critical, local analysts point out, is that the main opposition party has no strong public support for opposing the China FTA.“MERS and other affairs are at the head of public attention right now,” Hanshin University professor Yoon Pyung-joong said last Thursday.“I don’t think the main opposition has the public support it needs to stall (the China FTA). And I don’t think the main opposition will have that in the future. The FTA will likely pass smoothly in the Assembly,” Yoon added.Lee Gang-heoun, a former spokesman for dairy farmers who initially opposed Korea’s free trade deal with Australia, said that there was no strong opposition from farmers against the deal.“We know that it’s inevitable. We just want the government to promise to give us enough support to continue our lives,” he said.

(Xinhua-Yonhap)Trade between South Korea and China reached over $4.3 trillion last year according to the Korea International Trade Association. China is South Korea’s largest export market. Experts said China is likely seeking to address its trade deficit with Seoul through the free trade agreement.The deal is also expected to further strengthen the bilateral strategic partnership between the two countries amid intensifying Sino-U.S. competition over regional influence in northeast Asia.South Korea has 11 working FTAs including with the U.S., Australia, India and the EU. Its deal with Washington was the most contentious, sparking fierce opposition from farmers, some lawmakers and swathes of the public.

The Manwoldae palace was constructed in 919 but was completely destroyed during the Red Turbans invasions of Korea during the 14th century.

""We express our deep regret over the North's criticism.""The official called on the North to come to the talks without any preconditions for peace and stability on a divided peninsula.The North has raised the level of its provocation in recent weeks as it claimed it had successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile. It also said that it has already miniaturized nuclear warheads enough to be placed on missiles.Seoul, Washington and Tokyo have recently vowed to increase pressure against the North to make it abandon its nuclear weapons.Despite lingering tension, Seoul has said that it will continue to encourage civilians to expand inter-Korean exchanges if they help promote reconciliation and restore national unity.

President Park Geun-hye attended the event hosted by the state-run Agency for Defense Development in Taean, South Chungcheong Province. The newly developed missile has a range of more than 500 kilometers and thus is capable of striking nearly all parts of the communist neighbor. “The site is where the military is developing key assets designed to counter North Korean threats, and the president observed the guided weapon’s test flight and inspected the military’s readiness posture,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters. The experiment came as Pyong­yang accelerates its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, miniaturized warheads to fit atop them and their delivery means. Last month, it succeeded in ejecting a dummy projectile from a new 2,000-ton submarine along the east coast. South Korea‘s first 500-kilometer-range ballistic missile is test fired at a test site run by the Agency for Defense Development in Taean, South Chungcheong Province, Wednesday.

In a press conference the group said, “While the case involves some 5 trillion won of state budget, the people, the taxpayers, are not aware of the alleged logic behind Lone Star’s demand or who is appearing as witness.”The group called on the government to agree to publicize the trial. It has submitted the request to observe the process with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes this Monday.Both the Seoul government and Lone Star must agree in order for the hearing to be open to public.Last month, the ICSID wrapped up the first round of hearing in Washington.The case is the latest and the biggest in a series of legal battles involving Lone Star’s investments in South Korea, including the 2003 purchase of a controlling stake in Korea Exchange Bank, and its sell-off of those assets for large margins. Lone Star is demanding South Korea pay it nearly $4.68 billion, claiming it was forced to pay unfair taxes and suffered losses due to Seoul’s delay in approving a profitable deal. It represents the first investor-state dispute filed against South Korea’s government. The case has drawn keen attention on South Korea not only because of the amount of money involved but also its possible repercussions amid concern that if the country loses in the case, it could spark similar suits by foreign firms. South Korea has handled the case after forming an interagency team comprising the Office for Government Policy Coordination, Finance Ministry, Foreign Ministry, Justice Ministry, National Tax Service and the Financial Services Commission.

It also allows Seoul to load its ballistic missiles with warheads heavier than the current limit of 500 kilograms, on the condition their range decreases in proportion to the payload.So far, the South Korean military has a ballistic missile with a range of 300 kilometers capable of carrying a 500-kilogram warhead. As one of the key assets for the Kill Chain, the pre-emptive strike apparatus South Korea has been developing against Pyongyang, the missile will be capable of hitting nuclear and missile bases across the communist country, according to officials. ""The successful test today allows us to deploy the new missile starting at the end of the year,"" a Defense Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.The move came amid tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's provocative actions in recent weeks, including a launch of a ballistic missile from a submarine.South Korea has been trying to beef up its defense system against North Korea's possible aggression. North Korea has deployed ballistic missiles with various ranges capable of reaching South Korea, Japan and U.S. military bases in the Pacific, while developing intercontinental ballistic missiles and technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads to fit atop missiles.The North has recently claimed that it has mastered the technology to make nuclear warheads small enough to mount on missiles.

Yet the prospects of dialogue remain bleak as Pyongyang refuses to talk about its nuclear program, a critical tool for regime survival and national security.Seoul, along with Washington and Tokyo, recently accelerated its push to strengthen pressure and sanctions against the reclusive regime, as Seoul officials said there were no other viable means to induce the North to engage in talks.But doubts linger over whether applying additional pressure to the North would help create momentum for talks with the North. Analysts pointed out the North’s unwillingness to renounce its nuclear ambitions.“North Korean leader Kim Jong-un regards nuclear arms and the development of what the country calls a satellite and SLBM as symbols of self-reliance and self-dignity,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.“The symbols will be further emphasized ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party (in October).”As part of its efforts to resume talks with its wayward neighbor, Seoul has been seeking “exploratory dialogue” with Pyongyang, arguing there should be no preconditions for the new form of dialogue, which could lead to in-depth discussions for the resumption of the long-stalled six-party talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S. China, Japan and Russia.Previously, Seoul and Washington demanded that Pyongyang first show “sincerity” in its denuclearization commitments before the resumption of the multilateral talks, which have been stalled since December 2008.But the North has so far rejected the invitation for exploratory talks.“Pyongyang is still opposed to our proposal for exploratory talks even though we have removed all barriers for the talks. This leaves us no option but to raise pressure on the North to come out for dialogue,” a senior Seoul official told reporters on condition of anonymity.The pursuit of exploratory talks with Pyongyang came as the North has steadfastly enhanced its nuclear weapons capabilities. The North has argued that it had already entered a technical stage at which it can “miniaturize and diversify” nuclear bombs ― an argument that sparked calls to resume nuclear talks with the North. “The most important priority at this time is to resume dialogue with the DPRK (North Korea) on the nuclear issue, and to reverse its nuclear armament. Not doing so is potentially catastrophic for the Korean Peninsula,” said Peter Hayes, executive director of the U.S.-based Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability.“Moreover, the longer the ROK (Republic of Korea) and other parties allow the nuclear armament to continue, the harder and more dangerous the pathway will be for inter-Korean rapprochement and eventual reunification.”For North Korean leader Kim, nuclear arms are critical tools to show off to the international audience his country’s military might, analysts said. For the domestic purposes, Kim can use the nuclear program to promote national pride and unity, they added, noting the North is highly unlikely to bargain away its nuclear arsenal.To help change Pyongyang’s strategic calculations, Seoul is poised to use the North’s woeful human rights record. Seoul believes the sensitive issue could help pressure the North to return to the negotiating table, while some observers warned that the human rights issue could further complicate the already challenging denuclearization task.Underscoring the need to use both “carrots and sticks,” Cho Bong-hyun, a senior researcher at the Industrial Bank of Korea, called on Seoul to employ a “two-track” approach under which Seoul maintains a tough stance over Pyongyang’s nuclear development while constantly exploring ways to bolster economic cooperation with it. “Along with the application of pressure, Seoul also needs to seek cooperation with Pyongyang, which would help the North come forward for dialogue,” he said. “Seoul needs to mix carrots and sticks by offering concrete proposals such as providing energy and food aid, or help in the development of special economic zones.”Some observers said that before Seoul seeks to reopen the six-way talks, it should first try to improve the inter-Korean relations so as to revive and speed up the hitherto dormant multilateral dialogue process.For the inter-Korean dialogue to resume, Chang of the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies said that Seoul needs to recognize Pyongyang as a legitimate interlocutor rather than indicating that Pyongyang is one that will collapse or be absorbed into the South to achieve reunification.“Seoul’s mention of reunification and its economic benefits has insinuated that it does not recognize the North Korean regime (as a legitimate partner). It rather hinted that the North may be absorbed into the South after reunification,” he said.“For the talks to begin, each side should recognize the other side as a legitimate interlocutor. That is the basic prerequisite for dialogue.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","struggling to bring north korea ,diversify nuclear bombs an argument ,nuclear ambitions north korean leader ,nuclear bombs an argument ,tough stance over pyongyang nuclear","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'SLBM', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', '“pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Peter Hayes', 'the u.s.-based Nautilus Institute for Security', 'Sustainability', 'ROK', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Cho Bong - hyun', 'the Industrial Bank of Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Chang', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",7,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.35905656  0.40453377

The civilian groups of both sides had tentatively agreed to jointly celebrate the anniversary by hosting a three-day event starting June 14 in Seoul.The North reportedly said it would be better to separately hold the events, the South Korean group said.The event was to mark the summit between the leaders of the respective countries at the time ― South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korea’s Kim Jong-il ― on June 15, 2000, in hopes of thawing the inter-Korean ties that had been icy for the preceding several years.The botched preparation is also expected to dampen the prospects of holding a joint event that marks the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule on Korea’s Liberation Day on Aug. 15, sources said.“Unless there is a change in the fundamental position of the South, no amount of working-level contact to prepare for the event will bring good results,” the North Korean side was quoted as saying in a letter.It cited the Seoul government’s “indifference about the event’s venue and setting unnecessary preconditions.”The two sides had held preliminary talks in Shenyang, China last month.The South Korean side proposed to hold a follow-up working-level discussion mid-May, only to be turned down by the North. It added that despite the North’s rejection, it would continue to work on hosting joint-events.Meanwhile, the North’s Rodong Sinmun, the communist party’s official newspaper, said Tuesday that South Korea’s joint drills with the U.S. were to blame for souring the inter-Korean ties ahead of the summit anniversary.Pyongyang has recently raised military tensions by test-firing what it claimed to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile.Seoul called on Pyongyang to show sincerity in holding joint inter-Korean civilian events, as those events can help restore unity and ease inter-Korean tension.“The South Korean government is urging the North to sincerely respond to the joint commemorative event that could help restore national unity,” said an official, asking not to be named.From news reports","starting june 14 in seoul ,talks in shenyang china last ,first ever inter korean summit ,thawing the inter korean ties ,june 14 in seoul","['Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - il', 'inter - korean', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea ’s Liberation Day', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Shenyang', 'China', 'south korean', 'North ’s', 'the North ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'south korean']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.50510567  0.55744404

Last month, it announced a successful test-launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, while claiming to have already secured technology for miniaturizing nuclear warheads to fit atop missiles.According to the USFK, the first principle of the allies is ""to acquire, field, and employ counter-missile capabilities"" based upon their combined threat assessment of North Korean missile threats.""The capabilities ""include South Korea's Kill Chain and Korean Air and Missile Defense System (KAMD) as well as U.S. capabilities on and off the Korean Peninsula,"" it added.Kill Chain refers to a pre-emptive strike apparatus, and the KAMD is a low-tier air defense program that South Korea has been working to develop in the face of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile threats instead of joining the U.S.-led air defense system.With Washington vowing to deploy its cutting-edge weapons in the Asia-Pacific region as part of its efforts to rebalance toward the region, it has expressed its will to introduce the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system on the peninsula. THAAD is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at a higher altitude in their terminal phase using a hit-to-kill method.According to the second principle, the allies ""will drive progress and enhance proficiency in counter-missile operations through combined exercises, training and inter-operable capabilities and refinement of procedures.""In a move to convey their steadfast resolve and ability against the threats from the North, the two sides also vowed to boost capabilities required to implement the so-called 4D strategy, according to the USFK.The 4D strategy, endorsed last year, postures South Korean and the U.S. ""to detect, defend, disrupt and destroy"" ballistic missile threats by the communist North, and the allies plan to devise operational plans based upon the strategy.In the fourth principle, the two sides ""will execute counter-missile operations based upon bilateral consultation and coordination,"" according to the magazine. Noting that Pyongyang's continued move of developing and fielding asymmetric capabilities, the U.S. stressed the need for vigilance and readiness and vowed to continue to be ""agile"" to meet emerging challenges and threats. Up to 75 percent of the North's ground forces and some half of its air and naval assets ""are within 60 miles of the demilitarized zone"" that bisects the two Koreas, making it challenging to ""assess an indication of its provocation or attack,"" according to the magazine. The North has the fourth-largest military in the world.Regarding the primary goal of the country's regime survival, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un maintains ""an extensive and capable internal security apparatus"" as well as coercive diplomacy, the U.S. said, pointing to his replacement of top military leaders ""with those closer to his age.""The unruly leader of the North has often carried out public executions in what critics say is aimed at instituting a reign of terror to consolidate his grip on power that he inherited upon the death of his father and long-time leader, Kim Jong-il, in 2011. In the latest case, the North executed its defense chief, Hyon Yong-chol, in April with an anti-aircraft gun for showing disloyalty to the leader, according to Seoul's spy agency.

The civilian groups of both sides had tentatively agreed to jointly celebrate the anniversary by hosting a three-day event starting June 14 in Seoul.The North reportedly said it would be better to separately hold the events, the South Korean group said.The event was to mark the summit between then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on June 15, 2000, in hopes of thawing the inter-Korean ties that had been icy for the past several years.The botched preparation is also expected to dampen the prospects of holding a joint event that marks the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule on Korea‘s Liberation Day on Aug. 15, sources said.“Unless there is a change in the fundamental position of the South, no amount of working-level contact to prepare for the event will bring good results,” the North Korean side said in a letter.The two sides had held preliminary talks in Shenyang, China, last month.The South Korean side proposed to hold a follow-up working-level discussion mid-May, only to be turned down by the North.

In January, Ambassador Sung Kim, the chief U.S. nuclear envoy, offered to meet with the North‘s first vice foreign minister, Kim Kye-gwan, in a third country during his trip to the region, but the North virtually rejected the proposal by insisting Kim visit Pyongyang.The North’s repeated rejection of U.S. dialogue offers could suggest that the regime is trying to wait out the term of the Obama administration while continuing to build up its nuclear and missile capabilities.The U.S. is trying to create a momentum for dialogue with the North before tensions on the Korean Peninsula rise again in August when South Korea and the U.S. kick off a new round of annual joint military exercises that Pyongyang is sure to protest angrily.The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.As the six-party talks have been idle, the North has bolstered its nuclear capabilities and stockpile and conducted its second and third nuclear tests, in 2009 and 2013. Some experts now warn that the communist nation‘s nuclear arsenal could increase to 100 bombs by 2020.Meanwhile, North Korea strongly voiced its opposition to the U.N. Security Council’s handling of recent submarine-launched ballistic missile test, saying that it would prove itself to be a “political tool” of the United States if it were to take issue with Pyongyang while ignoring joint military exercises between South Korea and the U.S.The North’s ambassador to the U.N., Ja Song-nam, made the claim in a letter sent to the Security Council president last week, calling the drills “real nuclear war games of aggression” aimed at “occupying Pyongyang” to remove the North‘s leadership.“The recent underwater test-fire by the DPRK of a ballistic missile from a strategic submarine is a legitimate measure of a sovereign state to bolster up its self-defense capability against the provocative military maneuvers of the United States,” the envoy said in the letter, referring to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the official title of North Korea.“The council will be proved to be a political tool of the high-handed and arbitrary practice of one permanent member” if it only takes issue with the submarine missile launch while ignoring the military exercises, he said.Ja demanded the council convene an emergency meeting on the joint exercises.The council can take up the matter only if there is a request from a council member. Last year, North Korea twice asked the Council to deal with the issue, but no formal discussions took place.Pyongyang has long accused the U.S. and South Korea of plotting to invade the country and using their annual military exercises as part of preparations for it. But Seoul and Washington have rejected the claim, saying the annual maneuvers are purely defensive in nature.The North’s letter came after South Korea asked the Security Council‘s North Korea Sanctions Committee to look into the North’s submarine missile test to determine whether it violated U.N. resolutions banning Pyongyang from any ballistic missile activity.The committee reported to the council last week that it will launch an investigation.On May 9, North Korea claimed it successfully carried out an SLBM test underwater, renewing tensions on the Korean Peninsula amid concern that the North‘s SLBM capability, if fully developed, would pose a serious threat because its mobile nature would make it very difficult to detect preparations for a launch.From news reports","talks in seoul last week ,third nuclear tests in 2009 ,president last week calling the ,korea twice asked the council ,last week calling the drills","['the United States', 'North Korea', 'North', 'north‘s', 'the United Nations', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Sung Kim', 'U.S.', 'north‘s', 'Kim Kye - gwan', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the U.N.

The government also vowed to prop up legal and systemic efforts to control all kinds of potentially dangerous materials that may come into the country, Won said.

The bilateral trade pact was initialed in Beijing on Feb. 25.The countries now only need approval from their respective legislatures before implementing the deal, which they plan to do before the end of the year, according to trade officials here.""The Korea-China FTA will not only help expand the countries' bilateral trade and investment, but also become a platform for mutual cooperation through which the countries' governments and businesses will seek new and joint growth engines,"" the trade ministers said, according to Seoul's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.The FTA will be one of the largest and most significant free trade deals signed by South Korea as China is already, by far, the world's single largest importer of South Korean goods, accounting for more than one-fourth of South Korea's overall exports in 2014.Immediately following its implementation, the Korea-China FTA will help expand South Korea's trade territory, represented by the combined gross domestic product of countries with which South Korea has an FTA, from the current 61 percent to 73 percent of global GDP.It is also expected to help boost the countries' annual bilateral trade to more than $300 billion, a 39.5 percent hike from $215.1 billion in 2012, Seoul's trade ministry said.In the 10 years following its implementation, the free trade deal is expected to boost South Korea's real GDP by 0.96 percent while creating some 53,800 new jobs.For China, too, the FTA will be significant and meaningful.A ministry official noted the Korea-China FTA will equally help expand China's economy and trade.However, benefits of the free trade pact will be more political than economic, said the official while speaking on condition of anonymity.The Korea-China FTA comes as Beijing is moving to create an economic bloc in Northeast Asia, apparently as part of efforts to strengthen its leadership while also countering the U.S. presence in the region.""Through the Korea-China FTA, China may have sought to embrace South Korea while competing for economic and political leadership in Northeast Asia,"" the official said.China is currently seeking to sign a three-way FTA with South Korea and Japan while also pushing for a regional FTA, known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, that again involves South Korea and Japan, along with 13 other countries, including Australia, India and New Zealand.In a letter to South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Chinese President Xi Jinping noted the agreement will greatly contribute to economic integration in East Asia.""Signing an FTA between South Korea and China, major economic players in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, is a monumental event. This will not only lead to a new leap in trade relations between the two countries but also bring practical benefits to the people of both countries,"" Xi said in his letter released by Seoul's trade ministry.Park agreed the bilateral FTA will mutually benefit both countries.""The Korea-China FTA will bring a wide range of opportunities and benefits to the people and businesses of both countries, and become a historical milestone in the countries' efforts to deepen their strategic cooperative partnership,"" she said in her reply to her Chinese counterpart.Trade officials here also said the Korea-China FTA is the first of its kind ever signed by Beijing that has separate chapters on electronic trade, finance and communications.""To China, this means it has accepted and opened its market to international norms, which means it can be on the offensive side while negotiating for future FTAs with other countries,"" the official said.Under the Korea-China FTA, Seoul will eliminate its import tariffs on 79 percent of all products, or 9,690 goods, from China within 10 years following its implementation.Beijing will do the same on 71 percent of all products, or 5,846 items, from South Korea over the cited period.In the 20 years after the FTA goes into effect, South Korea will have eliminated its tariffs on 92 percent of all products from China with China eliminating its tariffs on 91 percent of all products from South Korea.

The North also said it has made nuclear warheads small enough to fit on missiles.The allies began the biannual anti-submarine drills in 2012 as part of efforts to boost their underwater capabilities against threats from the North in the wake of its torpedoing of the South Korean warship Cheonan that killed 46 sailors.

The hospital where more than 10 people are believed to have been infected by the first confirmed patient prior to his official diagnosis was temporarily shut down.Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo offered an apology Sunday for the government’s poor handling of the potential MERS patients, and announced that the new task force would put forth its best efforts to combat the spread of the disease. With the establishment of the team, potential MERS patients who are considered the most vulnerable ― those who are aged 50 or older and those with chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease ― will be quarantined with extra medical attention and care.Passengers wearing masks queue to check in at Incheon International Airport in Incheon on Sunday. (Xinhua-Yonhap)“We are considering this coming week as a crucial turning point in which the situation can either get worse or better,” the minister said during a press meeting in Seoul. “We believe all of the 14 cases, except the very first case, are secondary infection cases. The government is doing its best to prevent tertiary infection. And in order to do this, we need cooperation from all health care workers and citizens.”The first confirmed patient, quarantined as of May 20, had visited four medical clinics and hospitals over the course of 10 days prior to his diagnosis, from May 11-20.The incubation period of MERS is two to 14 days, and all of the confirmed patients contacted the first patient, who is believed to be the sole spreader of MERS in Korea, from May 15-17. As the first patient stayed at another clinic ― the last of the four ― prior to his diagnosis from May 17-20, more people may be diagnosed this week as the incubation period of those who may have been infected at the medical facility lasts until Thursday. Among the 14 patients who are believed to be infected by him, 12 worked or stayed at the same facility as the 68-year-old, who was being treated there as an inpatient from May 15-17. The facility is the second of the four clinics he visited or stayed at before being quarantined. The remaining two patients are health care workers who treated the first patient prior to his diagnosis, at two different medical clinics, on May 15 and 17, respectively. The average age of all 15 patients is 53.1 years old. As the number of confirmed patients rose from 1 to 15 within only 11 days, there has been a growing public demand for the government to identify the now-temporarily closed hospital where 12 people were infected. Rumors claiming certain hospitals to be avoided have been going viral since last week, especially via social media and KakaoTalk. The government said hospitals that are related to any infectious diseases cannot be identified according to its protocol, as such facilities and those who stay there can easily be targets of social stigmatization. The Health Ministry and the police also announced that those who spread such rumors online can face punishment.The Health Ministry has been under fire for its inept handling of the spread of MERS, especially after the diagnosis of the fourth patient whose earlier request to be quarantined had been rejected by the authorities. The government also failed to prevent the 10 patient, who is the son of the third patient and the younger brother of the fourth, from going overseas on May 26. Although he was not diagnosed with MERS prior to leaving the country for China, he had already been showing symptoms including a fever.He was eventually diagnosed with MERS in China on Friday. Seoul’s failure to prevent him from leaving the country left 165 passengers and crew members on board with him at potential risk of infection. Once arriving in Hong Kong by plane, the man traveled to China by taking two buses. According to Chinese news outlets, it is not known how many passengers were on the buses.To prevent tertiary infection cases, Health Minister Moon asked the public to report to the authorities if they are experiencing MERS symptoms ― a high fever and coughing ― after visiting the Middle East, as well as to wash their hands properly and to wear masks in public places. He also urged all health care workers to be alert of the situation and file a report immediately if they come across a patient who may have MERS.On top of the two newly confirmed cases, an enlisted soldier, as well as 30 of his colleagues, were isolated on Sunday as he reported that he spent time with his mother, who was later diagnosed with MERS, during his recent break on May 12. Although quarantined, the soldier and his colleagues were not showing any symptoms.MERS is known to be caused by coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of illnesses in humans from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome. There is no known cure or vaccine for MERS, which has a fatality rate of 40.7 percent.More than 95 percent of the confirmed cases worldwide were in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The two countries have the highest number of MERS patients ― 996 and 74, respectively ― followed by Jordan and Korea.

The DPRK is the acronym for the communist nation's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It claimed the U.S. is to blame for the failure of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.Washington is rather ""trying to escape from the responsibility for its totally foiled policy"" toward Pyongyang, said the ministry.The statement came after the top nuclear envoys from South Korea, the U.S. and Japan had a trilateral meeting in Seoul last week.In the session, the North argued, the three parties attempted to distort the truth by giving the impression that they wanted to have a dialogue but the North refused.""It is a well-known fact that the DPRK had long called for the resumption of dialogue without preconditions, making sincere efforts for it, but the U.S. prevented it, raising unreasonable 'preconditions,' "" the ministry said.It said the North's nuclear arsenal and missiles are ""neither a means for threatening anyone nor a bargaining chip for something.""Those are ""self-defensive deterrents to cope with the constant nuclear threat and military invasion from the U.S. and as a force of justice to decisively repel the enemy's invasion and deal a merciless retaliation in case a war breaks out,"" it said.

I think it is something that has to be considered in light of recent information about the advanced step North Korea has made,"" McCain said in a press conference in Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia Security Summit, also known as the Shangri-La Dialogue.Washington has expressed its willingness to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery on the Korean Peninsula to better protect South Korea and the some 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country from North Korea's threats.As an integral part of the U.S.-led missile defense system, it is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at a higher altitude in their terminal phase using a hit-to-kill method.McCain said his judgment is based upon the undisputed assessment that Pyongyang has made ""significant advances in their capabilities as far as both the development of weapons themselves and the delivery system.""The communist North has ratcheted up tensions on the peninsula particularly in recent months. Earlier this month, Pyongyang announced that it had successfully fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile, while claiming that it has already made nuclear warheads small enough to fit on a missile. The senator, also the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, however, said a series of processes are still needed before any decision on the issue can be made. ""I think we should have congressional hearings, and I think we should consult with the president and the secretary of defense before we make that decision,"" he added.Whether the U.S. should deploy the system on the peninsula is a highly sensitive military and diplomatic issue amid concerns that it would antagonize China and Russia.Seoul and Washington have said no official consultations or decisions have taken place on the matter, though Seoul has made it clear that it has no plan to purchase the system.

The site is where the North successfully fired a long-range rocket and put a satellite into orbit in late 2012.Though the upgrading of the gantry to support a larger rocket was completed, Pyongyang has been further modifying the launch area to include a new support building at the east end of the pad and a platform that appears to move along rails from that building to the launch tower, 38 North said, citing recent satellite imagery.""While the exact purpose of this building remains unclear, one possibility is that the North Koreans are building a complex similar to facilities observed in China, such as at the Jiuquan Launch Center, that include buildings where the launch vehicle is assembled, processed, and checked, then placed on a movable platform and rolled to the launch tower,"" it said.The construction raises questions about recent media speculation that the North could launch a long-range rocket on the 70th anniversary of Korean Workers Party in October, the website said.""It would appear difficult although not impossible for the construction to be completed in time to prepare for such a launch.However, ongoing work should not preclude an October launch if North Korea were to interrupt construction and conduct those preparations using existing missile assembly and other facilities,"" it said.The upgrade project is another indicator the North is determined to pursue its space program and points to the fielding of a future space launch vehicle larger than the current one, 38 North said. ""A new larger SLV may further contribute to the North's development of long-range ballistic missiles and provide another sign of Pyongyang's serious commitment to its space program,"" it said.The North's missile program has long been a key security concern in the region and beyond. The communist nation is believed to have developed advanced ballistic missile technologies through a series of test launches, including the most recent and successful launch in 2012.That test sparked fears that the North has moved closer to ultimately developing nuclear-tipped missiles that could potentially reach the mainland United States. The country has so far conducted three underground nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

He also vowed to support South Korea’s vision of peaceful unification and to join the regional efforts to resolve North Korea‘s nuclear threats.  President Park Geun-hye shakes hands with visiting Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov during their meeting at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)Under the agreement, the two sides planned to encourage business projects that link Korean firms’ technological know-how and capital with Uzbekistan’s rich natural resources. Tashkent said it was ready to create a favorable business environment for Korean companies.“The two sides agreed to collaborate on large-scale projects in Uzbekistan to introduce advanced technology and attract direct investment from South Korean firms,” according to a joint statement issued after the summit.Cheong Wa Dae said the agreement between the two sides would help Asia’s fourth-largest economy create a new growth engine and also strengthen bilateral ties to promote its initiative aimed at linking railways between Asia and Europe. President Park has been calling for international support in her vision of linking roads and railways across the continent to connect South Korea directly to Europe, through North Korea, Russia and China.The two leaders also observed the signing of memorandums of understanding on issues including technological development, information technology and security. In particular, the two sides agreed to equally recognize driver’s licenses issued in both countries, allowing Korean and Uzbek travelers or residents to drive vehicles without having to go through additional tests. Koreans in Uzbekistan, however, will be required to carry their licenses along with a translated version of the Korean identification. The Uzbek government also agreed to exempt social security fees for members of Korean firms doing business in Uzbekhistan.The summit was held on the first day of the Uzbek president’s three-day visit in Seoul, his first overseas destination since he was reelected in March, Cheong Wa Dae officials said.

The facilities on Galdo Island, some 2.5 kilometers north of the Northern Limit Line, the de-facto maritime frontier, are expected to house 122-millimeter multiple rocket launchers or guard posts to monitor the movement of South Korean marines and patrol vessels. With a range of 20 kilometers, the weapons were mobilized when Pyongyang bombarded Yeonpyeongdo Island ― merely 4.5 kilometers away from Galdo Island ― in November 2010, killing two Marines and two residents while injuring more than a dozen. The image dated May 28, 2009, shows Galdo Island, north of the Northern Limit Line. In the red circle is a cave camp where the North Korean military is suspected to have deployed shore batteries. (Yonhap)The communist country embarked on excavation activities in the area in March and has since constructed at least five camps, news reports suggested, citing unnamed military authorities here.“The North Korean military is establishing several covered bunkers on Galdo Island, north of Yeonpyeongdo Island in the West Sea,” ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said at a regular news briefing. “Given Galdo Island’s geographic location and the distance between the NLL and Yeonpyeongdo Island, the activities present a grave threat to our military’s operations. We are intensively monitoring any deployment of firearms by the North Korean military.” If the regime presses ahead to station an artillery battery, Galdo Island will be its nearest base to attack the South Korean border islands, which could also make it easier to target warships sailing nearby.The closest existing base is Jangjaedo Island, around 7 kilometers away from Yeonpyeongdo Island. The South Korean military has deployed Spike missiles which have a range of about 20 kilometers on Yeonpyeongdo and Baengnyeongdo islands to help defend the region.The discovery came as the Kim Jong-un regime has been ratcheting up tension in recent weeks by testing a submarine-launched ballistic missile, threatening to attack South Korean Navy ships in the West Sea and claiming to be “miniaturizing and diversifying” means of a nuclear strike. With South Korea and the U.S. exploring ways to stifle its behavior, including extra sanctions, concerns are mounting over a possible provocation such as in the West Sea. The North also staged night gunfire drills early this month. The waters saw bloody cross-border clashes in 1999, 2002 and 2009. Months before the island shelling, the regime torpedoed a South Korean corvette near the NLL, claiming 46 lives.

The professor was referring to realpolitik as China’s growing assertiveness largely in its handling of maritime disputes in the South China Sea.As for China’s territorial disputes, Kim argued that China may not use force to militarily occupy the disputed islands, given the potential diplomatic repercussions, the presence of the U.S. military and difficulties maintaining military operations in the distant islands.Touching on China-North Korea relations, Kim said that despite their repeated official emphasis on their traditional friendship, their relationship has not been good, with China recognizing the South as an increasingly crucial partner to secure its practical interests and the North apparently as a strategic liability.The following is the transcript of the interview with professor Kim. ― Ed.The Korea Herald: How do you assess the current relations between China and North Korea? Although they often talk about their long-standing, traditional friendship, their relations do not appear to be very good.Professor Kim: The overall trend vis-a-vis the China-North Korea relations is that their relations and exchanges are managed just on an official level and, in a sense, merely symbolic. Although North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power three years ago, the two countries have yet to hold a summit. Kim Tae-hoEven though the two countries uphold socialism, they are very different countries. If you read the “Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,” Deng Xiaoping said in reference to Mao Zedong that a leader designating his own successor is a feudalistic act. In Korea, being feudalistic is not regarded as seriously bad. But China founded its nation to construct a “new China” under the slogan of anti-feudalism.“Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping” is like the guidelines and philosophical books that China’s elites learn by heart. Then, how do you think China would view the hereditary leadership succession in North Korea from Kim Il-sung to Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un. It doesn’t make sense and is unimaginable for Chinese elites. And now, so-called revolution generations are nowhere to be found. For China, practical interests come from South Korea, not North Korea. Last year’s trade volume between China and North Korea was around $6.5 billion, while the volume between South Korea and China is $234.5 billion. That is a huge gap. China is South Korea’s largest trading partner while South Korea is China’s third-largest trading partner. Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Li Jinjun said that the friendship between China and North Korea was for good, but that is just a diplomatic statement. Talk of North Korea becoming a strategic liability for China have been around for long, and that is what I often heard each time I visited China.KH: China has recently introduced various foreign policy initiatives such as the One Belt One Road scheme and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which many outsiders view as moves to revise the current international order, based on its increasing military and economic prowess. What’s your take on this?Kim: China has put forward a series of initiatives to play a bigger role in the international community. As a matter of fact, this development is quite desirable. In the past, China did not want to play a bigger role as it did not have the capabilities to do so. Speaking of the AIIB, there are many developing countries in need of foreign assistance for infrastructure construction from organizations such as the AIIB. They may want to rely on the IMF or World Bank, but the two organizations do not have much room for more investment for the developing nations. The AIIB is expected to have a total capital of $100 billion, while those of the Asia Development Bank and World Bank are around $160 billion and $230 billion, respectively. Thus, I believe China will play a bigger financial role through the AIIB, but this would not overwhelm the existing institutions to allow China to challenge the regional financial order. The U.S. and West have their own stakes in the existing order, and I am skeptical that China would seek to realize its dream by challenging the current international order. I believe China would rather seek coexistence. If China should too openly or explicitly pursue a change in the international order to its own advantage, the U.S. would not just sit back and watch it. KH: China has been constructing an artificial island in the South China Sea, and its policy regarding maritime disputes seems to be increasingly aggressive. What do you think about China’s intentions behind its increasing assertiveness?Kim: China has reportedly been constructing an artificial island on Fiery Cross Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands of the South China Sea. China is gradually expanding its influence in the area. But I believe the chances of China using force to occupy disputed islands are not that high. In fact, there were only two cases in which China forcefully overtook a set of disputed islands: one in 1974 and the other in 1988, both in its maritime disputes against Vietnam.China, of course, is able to deploy and focus its military assets to deal with a contingency in border areas, which means it is capable of militarily occupying a particular target in the Spratly Islands. But the reason why China can’t use force to occupy it is that first, China would face seriously enormous diplomatic repercussions. The second reason is the presence of the U.S. military that wants to stably manage its overseas bases and freedom of navigation at sea. As long as the U.S. military maintains its presence in the region, the range of China’s power projection will be very limited. Another issue is whether China can project and maintain its military power far beyond its shores. The Spratly Islands is too far. China’s southernmost Hainan Island is some 336 kilometers away from the Paracel Islands, which is some 1,800 kilometers away from Zengmu Reef, the southernmost end of the Spratly Islands. Thus, given the geographical distance, it is difficult for China to project and maintain power all the way to the islands for long periods.But what we should be carefully watching is China’s duality: China has declared its peaceful intentions, but it has demonstrated an aspect of “realpolitik” in its foreign policy. For instance, in October 2013, China declared its neighborhood diplomacy principles of “qin cheng hui rong” ― meaning the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. But just a month later, it unilaterally declared its Air Defense Identification Zone (that partially overlaps its neighbors’ ADIZ).KH: There has been a heated debate about the U.S. potential deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea. What is your opinion about it?Kim: Some media said that China keeps expressing its opposition to the deployment of THAAD to South Korea merely without fully understanding the technical issues involving THAAD. But, that assumption is totally misplaced. China has run its strategic missile force since 1966, and is fully aware of what THAAD is for and what the S-band radar and X-band radar do. What China has repeatedly said is that it can hardly understand why South Korea, its friendly neighbor, would like to do things that would undermine the efficacy of its nuclear and missile forces.KH: Amid an increasing competition between the U.S. and China, South Korea seems to be in a trickier diplomatic position. What is the way forward for Seoul’s diplomacy?Kim: The U.S. and China are very different from each other in terms of the political system, governing structure, social values, strategic goals, alliance relations and so forth. And these differences are, of course, having a significant impact on the security of the Korean Peninsula. The impact further increased after the sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan in March 2010. From South Korea’s perspective, it cannot help but think of its relations with China when dealing with its relations with the U.S. and vice versa. In the past, handling foreign relations was sort of a simple equation for Seoul, but it is now a higher degree of equation. One of the arguments that I really hate is that South Korea should keep relations with the U.S. for security purposes, and with China for economic purposes. That is absolutely not appropriate. The U.S. is still a very important economic partner for South Korea, and Washington’s influence in world economic and financial institutions remains great. We also have security issues to cooperate on with China. So again, it is like solving an equation of higher degree. The worst scenario is South Korea facing a tough choice between the U.S. and China. South Korea should never let this happen. It should be able to use and well-manage its relations with both the U.S. and China. How to harmonize its relations with the major powers is one of the biggest policy challenges for Seoul. KH: China has been increasing its defense spending, which the West thinks could potentially pose a security challenge and criticism has persisted over the country’s lack of transparency in the calculation of its defense outlays. Can you comment on this? Kim: The U.S. and the West say the level of transparency in China’s military is low because of the lack of transparency in China’s defense budget and its military strategy and doctrines. China’s military strategy has been kept secret as there have not been any official publications detailing its military doctrines. Speaking of China’s defense budget, China’s defense spending is around $140 billion, while that of the U.S. is some $600 billion. There are many ambiguous things that have not been added to calculate China’s defense budget. For example, China’s military has used its own foreign currency reserves to purchase military equipment from overseas, and this expenditure has not been counted as part of the country’s defense spending. The pension payments for retired soldiers and some other officers come from the Ministry of Civil Affairs. All this suggests that there are many things that have not been added to produce the total amount of China’s defense spending. The West has accused China of concealing the exact defense outlays, but from China’s perspective, it has had its own way of calculating its defense spending. Whatever the truth is, the arguments over China’s defense spending are very complicated and seem to be endless. What I want to stress is that one should not overestimate or underestimate China’s military capabilities. From the viewpoints of the U.S. and other militarily advanced nations, China still has a long way to go as it has many vulnerabilities to tackle. But from the viewpoints of neighboring nations in East Asia, China is already a militarily advanced nation. So there are gaps in their perception about China’s military status. This year marks the 30th anniversary of China’s military modernization. China’s military is no longer what it was 30 years ago ― in terms of its military capabilities, its defense industry, training and education. KH: The U.S.-Japan alliance is strengthening with the recent revision of the allies’ defense cooperation guidelines. How do you think China would respond to this? How does Seoul move in this changing security landscape?Kim: The U.S. currently wants Japan (for security cooperation), and thus it is supporting Japan’s push to become a “normal” state (with a full-fledged military). From 2012, what Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants has been to break away from its postwar system ― imposed upon it after its defeat in World War II. Thus, Japan seeks to expand its Self-Defense Forces’ activities and keeps toying with the idea of rewriting its war-renouncing constitution and exclusively defense-oriented policy. China cannot just turn a blind eye to the strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance. Thus, it seeks to bolster military cooperation with Russia. So this security landscape could impact the security of the Korean Peninsula. Still power politics here take hold, and for a middle-power state to survive, it needs prudence and in-depth thinking. One problem facing South Korea is that Seoul is driven into “resetting” its foreign policy when a new government is sworn in every five years.KH: When it comes to China threats, the U.S. has talked much of the A2AD (anti-access/area-denial) challenges. What do you think about the core of China’s A2AD capabilities?Kim: A2AD refers to anti-access/area-denial. In Korea, “area” in this expression has been interpreted as a geographical location. But it is a much more comprehensive meaning that involves ports, airstrips, command and control systems and other major military facilities. The U.S. coined this expression, and A2AD capabilities are referred to as the capabilities to delay, deter and, if possible, defeat the U.S. forces entering the Taiwan Strait in an emergency.China itself has its own expression, “strategic defense” referring to A2AD. It has quite an offensive aspect. For example, under the strategic defense scheme, China is not only to defend against enemy forces, but also to strike its adversary’s facilities to produce war materials and its operations bases. This means South Korea and Japan where the U.S. has its military installations could become targets in the beginning stages of a war (between the U.S. and China). This is why we should carefully watch the developments regarding A2AD.KH: Do you think China would continue its “peaceful rise”?Kim: This issue has become a political, divisive issue in the U.S., a reason why few would like to publicly talk about it. China calls the period of 2000 through 2020 a “strategically important period” during which China has vowed to focus on a “peaceful rise and peaceful development.” Some may say China’s capabilities are growing, but it has no intentions (of challenging the regional status quo). But I am one of the experts who views China’s capabilities as a more important factor than its intentions (in forecasting China’s future direction).I think we should not jump the gun in answering the question of whether China would remain a status-quo power. China has been benefiting from the U.S.-led international system. Except for the Taiwan issue, China is basically a status-quo power. But the question is until when China will remain a status-quo power. Well, in my view, that will continue until at least 2020. But the question mark hangs over whether China would continue to remain a status-quo power well beyond 2020.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","cautious about china duality ,philosophical books that china elites ,china would rather seek coexistence ,be cautious about china duality ,the arguments over china defense","['South Korea', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Kim Tae - ho', 'Hallym University of Graduate Studies', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'China', 'China', 'Kim', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'China', 'Kim', 'Ed', 'the Korea Herald :', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'China', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Tae - hoEven', 'Deng Xiaoping', 'Mao Zedong', 'Korea', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'chinese', 'China', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'China', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'Li Jinjun', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'China', 'China', 'World Bank', 'AIIB', 'the Asia Development Bank', 'World Bank', 'China', 'AIIB', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Fiery Cross Reef', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'the Spratly Islands', 'China', 'Zengmu Reef', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Air Defense Identification Zone', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Washington', 'China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Kim', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'the Ministry of Civil Affairs', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'Self - Defense Forces ’', 'China', 'Russia', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'A2AD', 'U.S.', 'China', 'A2AD', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'direction).I', 'China', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",17,"[ 1.40000000e+01  9.30000000e+01  0.00000000e+00 ... -4.05290216e-01

Addressing a crowd of over 150 diplomats, scholars and businessmen, Kohler said the two countries should form a coalition to tackle global challenges of climate change, terrorism, epidemics, poverty and refugees.Kohler, who also headed the International Monetary Fund from 2000 to 2004, came to Korea to participate in international seminars along with former German politicians Peter Hartz and Horst Teltschik. They spoke at a reception organized by Alumninetzwerk Deutschland-Korea, ADEKO, at the German ambassador’s residence in Seoul on Monday.  Former German President Horst Kohler speaks to members of Germany-Korea alumni organization ADEKO at the German residence in Seoul on Monday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“I feel at home when I come to Korea. I observe similar histories, achievements and challenges here as in Germany. The key difference is I cannot speak your language,” Kohler said in a speech.“Networks strengthen our objectives through common interests and feelings. ADEKO is a symbol of our friendship, and cements our relationship.”ADEKO is an alumni network of Germans and Koreans with academic, commercial and cultural ties. Founded in 2008, it holds knowledge seminars, youth gatherings, and culture events year-round for its active 5,000 members, as an umbrella organization of some 50 alumni groups.The world, according to Kohler, faces a myriad of crises that requires a unified front in environmental conservation and sustainable development. But the current international system, established after WW2, is inapt at addressing these challenges and enforcing remedies, he pointed out. Korea and Germany face similar problems, as both have experienced military destruction, national division and diplomatic challenges. “We have also demonstrated to the world that dedication and innovation can overcome our hardships and achieve prosperity,” Kohler said. “Europe’s lesson is that cooperation is the smarter way toward progress. Peaceful cooperation is the hope of rational people around the world. Rational people make the world work.”As part of an international advisory group, Kohler said he has proposed a model of global partnership to the United Nations for the post-2015 development agenda.This year is pivotal for the world to pave the way for sustainable globalization, he stressed, adding that democratic nations should partner for creative solutions.“In a world where nations are interconnected economically, politically and environmentally, the challenges we face require a new paradigm of cooperation,” he said. “We need to reform the international order based on a new model of participation and partnership across diverse stakeholders.”This requires a mentality and approach of “treating others as one wishes to be treated,” so that different ethnic groups and governments can converge on their common problems, he added. Kim Hwang-sik, former Korean prime minister and ADEKO president, highlighted Kohler’s contribution to the German reunification as a foreign policy adviser to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.“Mr. Kohler was the finance minister in charge of unifying the German currencies and economies,” Kim said in a speech. “He remarked on his visit to Korea in 2010 that our unification could come sooner than expected, and South Korea should make preparations for it.” Kim added, “Mr. Hartz, who masterminded the 2002 Hartz labor and welfare reforms, is well-known in Korea, even more than former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder whom he served.”Hartz explained Germany’s new system of employment and labor market reforms, as the country enters an aging society. The big data and digital software match people with compatible jobs in the labor market, Hartz said. It will help reduce youth unemployment and provide postretirement work for citizens.German Ambassador Rolf Mafael, in a speech, pinned hopes on the younger generations to lead the future of bilateral ties, while paying tribute to the Korean miners and nurses who worked in Germany in the 1960s and 70s.

Iranian Ambassador Hassan Taherian underscored that the nuclear deal framework, which came out of negotiations between U.S., U.K., Russia, France, China, Germany, European Union and Iran from March 26 to April 2, was “definitely a successful achievement.” However, more political consensus is required to seal the final comprehensive agreement, due late June, that would ensure that Iran cannot produce a nuclear weapon, according to the ambassador. In a statement released in Lausanne, Switzerland, Iran agreed to reduce, redesign and convert its nuclear facilities in exchange for lifting of all sanctions on its international banking, petrochemical, oil and gas, telecommunications and automobile industries. Iran agreed to give the International Atomic Energy Agency access to all of its nuclear facilities for monitoring and inspection. “The agreement addressed both parties’ concerns. We are in a process of give and take. Though not a perfect deal, it was the most practical agreement possible,” Taherian said in a lecture at the Asia Society in Lotte Hotel on Tuesday. “The objective of the negotiation is to guarantee Iran’s peaceful use of nuclear energy and lifting all sanctions. We will radically restrict the size and scope of our nuclear program for the next 10 to 15 years.”Taherian, who started his ambassadorship in Korea in July last year, emphasized that Iran accepted “the highest level of transparency and verification in the history of nuclear proliferation” during negotiations. He was previously posted to Seoul as a diplomat from 1980 to 1985, as well as Pyongyang as an ambassador from 1992 to 1993.Iran has long professed its right to develop nuclear technology for industrial and research purposes, with no aim of developing an arsenal. Under the deal, Iran will be allowed to keep its current stockpile of enriched materials for producing nuclear fuel or swapping with uranium in the international markets. International response has been largely positive. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, “A comprehensive, negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue will contribute to peace and stability in the region.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani welcomed the development on Twitter, saying that the agreement would promote Iran’s interaction with the world and the world’s respect for Iran. Despite the optimistic outlook from Iran, analysts have pointed out that denuclearizing North Korea will be much more difficult, as the situation is starkly different. One difference is that Pyongyang attaches far greater importance to the nuclear program, as it sees nuclear armament as a means to shield itself from regime change through external forces. Tehran did not regard nuclear armament as an existential issue, instead pursuing nuclear brinksmanship as a “status matter” in the region to regain national glory, Korean diplomat Chun Yung-woo told the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted sanctions that forced domestic companies to stop doing business with Iran. Other allies, including Korea, Japan, Australia, United Arab Emirates and the European Union, joined the league. The EU and Asian countries, including Korea and Japan, also joined the banking restrictions. Tehran was more vulnerable to sanctions as its economy is more globally integrated and its society is more open and pluralistic, contrary to the isolated and reclusive North Korea, experts have pointed out. Clinching the comprehensive agreement will lure more foreign investment and trade with Iran, Taherian underscored, adding that the country eased investment laws and developed free economic zones.“Iran and Korea have maintained relatively friendly relations since establishing diplomatic relations in 1952. The Tehran Street in Seoul’s Gangnam area and the Seoul Street north of Tehran symbolize our friendship,” he said. Both countries exchanged several high-level meetings in recent years, including Foreign Ministers who met in New York last year on the sideline of the U.N. General Assembly. The Iranian Parliamentary Friendship Group will come to Seoul in early June.The ambassador welcomed Korean investment in engineering, infrastructure and construction in Iran. Korea companies, which have a reliable reputation in Iran, have shown renewed interest in trade and investment, he pointed out. Bilateral trade volume was $9 billion last year, and over 2,000 medium-sized Korean companies have trade ties with Iran at present.

But it called for the 124 South Korean firms to provide retroactive pay based on the outcome of separate consultations.The official said North Korea demanded that South Korean firms in Kaesong pay March and April wages by the end of this month. The official asked not to be identified, citing policy.The sides have yet to produce a deal over the more sensitive issue of a wage cap, which has been set at 5 percent per year.In February, North Korea unilaterally decided to hike the minimum wage by 5.18 percent to US$74 per month for about 53,000 North Korean workers in the factory park.The factory park, an outcome of the first-ever inter-Korean summit of leaders in 2000, is a major symbol of reconciliation between the rival Koreas.It combines South Korean capital and technology with cheap North Korean labor to produce clothes, utensils, watches and other labor-intensive goods.The factory park is a major source of hard-currency for the impoverished north.

Lee Wan-koo who stepped down amid a spiraling graft scandal surrounding deceased business tycoon Sung Woan-jong. Lee was suspected of receiving illicit political funds from Sung, the former chairman of Keangnam Enterprises.Born in 1957, Hwang has held key posts within the prosecution throughout his 28-year career as a public prosecutor until he joined the Park administration as justice minister in 2013. He investigated several cases related to national security, earning a nickname “Mr. National Security Law” for his expertise in the area.  Hwang Kyo-ahnOne of the cases involves self-confessed North Korean agent Kim Hyun-hee, who was convicted of bombing a Korean Air Lines flight near Myanmar, killing all 115 people on board. He also investigated Rep. Lim Su-kyung of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy when the former pro-unification activist made an unauthorized trip to North Korea in 1989. Hwang’s past career and his conservative views on national security, however, will likely face stiff criticism from the opposition bloc, hinting at tough grilling sessions at the upcoming parliamentary hearing.“President Park Geun-hye naming Minister Hwang is an overt declaration that she would reign over the country with a public security-focused (government),” NPAD senior spokesman Rep. Kim Yung-rok said.The NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul also said that Hwang is far from being a leader who can communicate with people and forge national unity.“He is the one who asked the court to dissolve the opposition parties. He ignored the opposition bloc as well as the people,” Lee said, referring to Hwang’s part in leading the dissolution of a minor progressive party and the arrest of its former leftist lawmaker Lee Seok-ki for its pro-North Korea activities while serving as justice minister.“This nomination overlooks the (views) of the opposition and the people. It is worrisome how we, the opposition party, should deal with the (government) control based on force and oppression in the future,” Lee said.Hwang was accused of exerting undue influence on the investigation into the National Intelligence Service’s meddling in the 2012 presidential election to prevent any finding that would hurt President Park. Led by the spy agency’s former director Won Sei-hoon, it allegedly conducted an online campaign to help then-presidential candidate Park win the election. He created a stir after making remarks about how he believed a probe was viable regarding the former Roh Moo-hyun administration’s alleged link to the Sung Woan-jong scandal at a parliamentary committee, which the opposition lawmakers saw as his attempt to affect the ongoing probe.In light of the suspicions over Hwang’s actions, the main opposition NPAD submitted a motion to the National Assembly to dismiss him in November 2013 and February 2014. Hwang’s 17-month stint at a local law firm in 2011 with a lofty paycheck and his exemption from the mandatory military service are also expected to come under close scrutiny.Despite the concerns, the ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung hailed Hwang as “the right person.”“Hwang is fit for the post to support President Park in her drive to root out corruption and make our society transparent,” he said, vowing to hold a parliamentary hearing at the earliest possible.By Ock Hyun-ju  (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","upcoming parliamentary hearing president park ,south korea new prime minister ,the upcoming parliamentary hearing president ,2012 presidential election to prevent ,upcoming parliamentary hearing president","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Justice', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'Hwang Kyo - ahnOne', 'north korean', 'Kim Hyun - hee', 'Korean Air Lines', 'Myanmar', 'Lim Su - kyung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'North Korea', 'Hwang', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang', 'NPAD', 'Kim Yung - rok', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Hwang', 'Lee', 'Hwang', 'Lee Seok - ki', 'north Korea', 'Lee', 'Hwang', 'the National Intelligence Service ’s', 'Park', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Park', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Sung Woan - jong', 'Hwang', 'NPAD', 'the National Assembly', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19984004  0.42068359

The resolution presented on Tuesday by Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy, said Pyongyang poses a “serious threat” to the U.S. and its regional allies, citing the Kim Jong-un regime’s underwater ejection test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile. The text urges the secretaries of state and treasury to “impose additional sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea), including targeting its financial assets around the world, specific designations relating to human rights abuses and a redesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terror.” It also warns against reopening any negotiations ― either bilaterally or within the six-nation denuclearization forum ― “without strict preconditions,” including the communist country’s commitment to halt the nuclear and missile development programs and military provocations, as well as “measurable and significant” improvement in its human rights record. The move reflects Washington’s seemingly hardening line against the Kim regime, which could complicate Seoul’s efforts to foster cross-border rapprochement ahead of the 70th anniversary of the peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Visiting Seoul on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry struck a particularly harsh tone, lambasting the young ruler by name on virtually all fronts ― from weapons programs to personnel management to human rights ― and hinting at enforcing more sanctions or other means to ramp up pressure. The U.S. House of Representatives also passed the defense budget bill for next year a few days ago after attaching a clause at the last minute that brands North Korea as a terrorism sponsor. The North reached the State Department blacklist in 1988 for allegedly having orchestrated a mid-air bombing of a Korean Air jet the year before, killing all 115 people on board. It was removed the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in its denuclearization commitment made at the six-party talks including the destruction of a cooling tower at the Yongbyon nuclear complex.In December, U.S. President Barack Obama said he would “review” whether to relist Pyongyang in the aftermath of a massive hack on Sony Pictures over a film centering on a plot to kill Kim.“The North Korean regime has a long history of belligerence toward the free world and brutal repression of its own people,” Gardner said in a statement. “It’s clear that the administration’s current policy of so-called ‘strategic patience’ with regard to North Korea has been a failure, and it’s time to change course.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","terrorism and levying further sanctions ,nuclear complex in december president ,calling for relisting north korea ,growing nuclear and missile threats ,brands north korea as terrorism","['U.S. Congress', 'North Korea', 'Cory Gardner', 'the Subcommittee on East Asia', 'the Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'communist', 'Washington ’s', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'the U.S. House of Representatives', 'North Korea', 'State Department', 'Korean Air', 'Yongbyon', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Pyongyang', 'Sony Pictures', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Gardner', 'North Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5552783   0.4301852

""It is also regrettable that the North has been posing a threat to the South and making provocative remarks against it.""  It was not the first time that Pyongyang has made a last-minute cancellation of a trip by high-profile figures to the North, including a previously scuttled visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights.  Experts said that the North's move seemed to reflect the bellicose country's intention not to have dialogue with Seoul. The North also might be showing its anger against the South over what it believed were annoying comments about the North's rule.  Pyongyang claimed Wednesday that it has already built technology to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit on missiles, further escalating tensions sparked by its purported test-firing of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.  South Korea said that it will spare no efforts to hold dialogue with North Korea, although it will sternly respond to the North's provocations.  ""The government still thinks that it would be good for the two Koreas to prepare for a joint commemorative event on Aug. 15 in a landmark year,"" the official said.  This year marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule and an inter-Korean division. Korea's Liberation Day falls on Aug. 15.  South Korea is hoping that a joint event will be held in Seoul on the Liberation Day holiday, but the North has rejected Seoul's proposal for such an event.

We do not think that they have that capacity,"" Patrick Ventrell, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said in an email to Yonhap News Agency.  ""However, they are working on developing a number of long range missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that could eventually threaten our allies and the homeland. That is why the administration is working to improve regional and homeland missile defenses and continuing to work with the other members of the six party talks to bring North Korea back into compliance with its nonproliferation commitments,"" he said.  State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf also said the U.S. does not believe the North has mastered the miniaturization technology, but the communist regime has been working on developing missiles ""that could eventually threaten our allies, our partners.""  ""That's obviously something we're very concerned about in terms of that capability,"" she said at a regular briefing, referring to the North's missile capabilities. ""We just don't think they have it (the miniaturization capacity).""  This assessment, however, runs counter to the military's assessment.  Last month, Adm. William Gortney, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, said the North is believed to be capable of miniaturizing nuclear warheads to be put on its new KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile and fire it at the U.S. mainland.  In March, Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, also told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that he believes the North has ""already miniaturized"" some of its nuclear weapons.   And in October, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said that as USFK commander, he assumes the North has the capabilities to miniaturize nuclear warheads and that the country has ""the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they have.""  North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its most recent launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.  Analysts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles. Some experts have recently warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.  The six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean standoff have been stalled since late 2008. North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.

Don’t dare to challenge our measures to strengthen our legitimate self-defense capabilities,” the policy division of the powerful National Defense Commission said in a statement.“It has already been long since we entered the phase. We are also at a stage to secure the top-level striking accuracy of our long-range rockets as well as short- and mid-range rockets,” it added.The statement also portrayed its recent underwater test of the SLBM as a “great feat” and a culmination of North Korea’s efforts to bolster its military might, claiming that “the world acclaimed and praised the test with surprise and envy.”Pyongyang ratcheted up tensions earlier this month by claiming that it succeeded in conducting an underwater test of the SLBM. The claim over the test has caused security concerns in the South, as it has almost no way to cope with the SLBM threat.Koh Yoo-hwan, North Korea expert at Dongguk University, said that the North’s claim over the enhanced nuclear capability seems to reflect its frustration over the situation in which there are no international efforts to negotiate with the nuclear-ambitious regime.“Now there are no talks whatsoever over North Korea’s nuclear program. And there are only sanctions and isolation. Thus, by forging a sense of a crisis, the North appears to ask (the international community) whether it would begin talks with North Korea or not,” he said.“It appears that the North is also frustrated by the fact that tension with the South is still ongoing even after the end of the South Korea-U.S. military drills.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","diversifying our nuclear strike ,and diversifying our nuclear strike ,our nuclear strike means don ,diversifying our nuclear strike means ,recent underwater test of submarine","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'SLBM', 'National Defense Commission', 'slbm', 'North Korea ’s', 'SLBM', 'SLBM', 'Koh Yoo - hwan', 'North Korea', 'Dongguk University', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59656328  0.49584329

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to a joint industrial complex near the inter-Korean border, raising speculation that the isolated state may have chosen to shield itself from international attention due to its internal instability.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visits the National Assembly in Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)Pyongyang told U.N. officials early Wednesday morning that it had canceled his trip to its border town of Gaeseong, Ban said at a forum in Seoul. “No explanation was given for this last-minute change. … This decision by Pyongyang is deeply regrettable,” he said, adding that the notification was delivered via “diplomatic channels.” “However, as the secretary-general of the United Nations, I will not spare any efforts for peace on the Korean Peninsula and beyond,” he said.Later in the afternoon, Pyongyang lashed out at the U.N. that its Security Council is being controlled by Washington, in an apparent move to justify its sudden cancellation of Ban’s visit.North Korea has been under heavy sanctions by the Security Council for three nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 and multiple missile launches. Ban also said on Tuesday that North Korea’s nuclear development and other forms of provocations are a clear violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution.In Seoul, the former South Korean foreign minister met with President Park Geun-hye for talks on current inter-Korean tensions and ways for peace.The U.N. chief said a day earlier that he would visit the joint industrial complex to encourage North Korean workers there and also to bring the message of peace to the reclusive regime.He would have been the first U.N. chief to visit the factory complex, a showcase of cooperation between the South and the North. He also would have been the first U.N. chief to visit North Korea in 22 years since Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1993.Ban’s announcement surprised many in and out of the country. Especially South Koreans, as it came amid growing tension between the two Koreas, despite Seoul’s repeated offer of talks.Prospects for a thaw in inter-Korean ties plummeted rapidly with Pyongyang’s recent test of a ballistic missile from a submarine and the live-fire drill in the western maritime border last week. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s alleged public execution of his top aides also intensified concerns over his reign of terror.The Seoul government also expressed regrets over Pyongyang’s sudden withdrawal of Ban’s visit and urged the regime to come forward to improve strained ties with South Korea and also with the international community.“We regret to hear that North Korea had canceled U.N. chief Ban’s visit to Gaeseong which was being pushed for peace on the Korean Peninsula and to make progress in (the regional) security and in inter-Korean ties,” said an official at the Unification Ministry, adding that Seoul was not informed by Pyongyang of its decision.Pyongyang’s last-minute cancellation -- an explicit diplomatic discourtesy to the chief of the world’s largest international organization -- may have come from a sense of urgency that it needs to reorganize internal affairs first after the purge of Kim’s defense chief Hyon Yong-chol late last month, according to experts here. “The decision could have been made by Kim reflecting his desire to tighten his grip first after the purge of Hyon. … It also reflects that North Korea has little capacity right now to deal with foreign affairs,” said Yoo Ho-yeol, a North Korean studies professor at Korea University in Seoul.“They must have approved the plan in the beginning to use Ban’s trip as a tool to improve North’s image and to promote its propaganda. But things are different now,” he said. Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies also said it appears to be “a safe decision” for North Korea as the regime feels insecure about Ban’s visit.“North Korean officials may feel pressured about Ban’s visit because they fear how his visit would affect their workers there … and they don’t want to upset Kim,” he said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","korea on wednesday abruptly withdrew ,wednesday abruptly withdrew planned visit ,north korea had canceled chief ,korea had canceled chief ban ,on wednesday abruptly withdrew planned","['North Korea', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'inter - korean', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'Gaeseong', 'Ban', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the United Nations', 'Pyongyang', 'U.N.', 'Security Council', 'Washington', 'Ban ’s', 'North Korea', 'the Security Council', 'Ban', 'North Korea ’s', 'the U.N.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's planned visit to the Gaeseong Industrial Complex this week.  Many expected the U.N. chief's trip to help resolve stand-offs between the two Koreas, including the wage row at the complex, where about 53,000 North Korean workers are employed there by 124 South Korean firms.  South and North Korea have been embroiled in a drawn-out dispute following North Korea's unilateral decision to hike wages by 5.18 percent for its workers. Seoul has rejected the North's move, saying that the North violated a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages together.  North Korea's key propaganda website, Uriminjokkiri, argued that the South is trying to ""destroy"" the operation of the complex.  ""The South is sticking to an undue argument over the wage row and putting pressure on the companies with factories at the complex (not to pay the wage),"" it said. ""This is South Korea's deliberate strategy to destroy the Gaeseong project.""  The North stressed that the South should accept its demand for the wage payment, claiming that its unilateral move to raise the wage is a proper exercise of its legislative rights.  Seoul had requested its companies not to send out March paychecks, vowing to punish violators. Despite the warning, about 50 South Korean companies have paid March wages to the North's workers apparently after threats from the North.  The 10-day period for paying wages for April began Sunday, signaling more tension between the two Koreas, experts said.

But the issue came to the fore again this week as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in Seoul that the provocative North Korea is ""why we are talking about THAAD.""   Still, U.S. officials stuck to the previous position that there have been no consultations.  ""Although we're considering the permanent stationing of a THAAD unit on the Korean Peninsula, we have not made a final decision and we've had no formal consultations with the Republic of Korea on a potential THAAD deployment,"" Rose said during the seminar.  ""However, let me be clear on a couple of points. THAAD is a purely defensive system that would improve our ability to intercept short- and medium-range missiles from North Korea. It does not and cannot impact broader strategic stability with Russia or China,"" he said.  Rose rejected Chinese claims, saying the THAAD missile defense system has no capability to intercept long-range Chinese missiles. He also dismissed Chinese claims that the radar that comes with THAAD could be used to spy on China, saying the U.S. already has such radars in the region.  Rose also praised some senior South Korean officials for rejecting Chinese attempts to affect the issue.  ""I've been very, very pleased with some of the statements that have come out of senior officials in the Republic of Korea, saying even though no decisions have been made, the U.S. has not made a request and no formal consultations have occurred today, let us be clear this is about defense and security of the Republic of Korea and we will make our decisions on our own without any input from you,"" he said.

At a meeting with U.S. troops and Foreign Service officers late Monday, the top diplomat cited North Korea’s ongoing creation of a nuclear arsenal and other “extraordinarily provocative activities” to stress the significance of the deployment of ships, forces and other assets here to prepare for “every eventual outcome.”“Nobody quite knows what America’s first line of defense in Seoul will do,” Kerry said.  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaks on cybersecurity at Korea University in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)“This is why we need to deploy ships, forces ... and we are talking about THAAD,” he added, referring to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the final stage of their flight. South Korea and the U.S. quickly attempted to downplay his remarks, saying that the issue had not been discussed at all between the two governments including at his talks with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se earlier in the day. The U.S. Embassy here also reaffirmed this stance. “The secretary was attending an internal event and speaking to an internal U.S. audience,” it was quoted as saying by Seoul officials. With Kerry’s comment, however, Seoul’s dilemma is expected to deepen given stiff resistance from China and Russia, which deem a THAAD deployment as de facto participation in the U.S.-led global missile defense program that they say is directed at them. On Tuesday, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, also said that the allies were “each considering” the matter and will engage in formal discussions “eventually.” “At some point in the future I think we will consider it (deployment) when the time is right. … Both the countries share consideration not only of military factors but also political factors,” he was quoted as saying by the Munhwa Ilbo after a forum in Seoul.  USFK commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti speaks at the Far East Forum in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)During his speech, he also introduced plans to adopt new military assets and integrate the existing ones as part of efforts to modernize the alliance and beef up its defense capabilities, citing Pyongyang’s growing threats in the wake of its recent submarine-launched ballistic missile ejection test and past intercontinental ballistic missile launches. Scaparrotti has been the main driving force behind the debate since he said last June that THAAD would help head off mounting North Korean threats by providing a “greater sensor array, better awareness of the threats and add to the interoperability of all of our systems.”In March, the USFK confirmed that it had conducted site surveys of places around the country where THAAD might be stationed. The furor had slightly subsided following U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s joint news conference last month with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo where he said the two countries have yet to begin any discussions and that THAAD batteries were still in production. Seoul has since maintained its so-called “three noes” line: “no consultations between the allies, no request from the U.S., and no decision made.” The upbeat assessment and related remarks of top Washington officials is likely to speed up internal discussions ― and controversy ― in both countries and prompt official talks, observers say. Rep. Yoo Seung-min, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party and a member of the parliamentary defense committee, said the THAAD issue should be on the agenda for a summit between President Park Geun-hye and U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington next month. “North Korea’s ground-based missiles already pose existential military threats and now with the SLBM becoming an additional threat, the alliance can effectively counter them only if they establish an optimal missile defense scheme as soon as possible,” he told a party meeting Tuesday. “It is abnormal for an ally to repeat the ‘three noes’ at a time when key officials from the State and Defense Departments as well as the USFK have floated THAAD and missile defense.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","forum in seoul on tuesday ,barack obama in washington next ,korea ongoing creation of nuclear ,university in seoul on monday ,its recent submarine launched ballistic","['Washington', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Foreign Service', 'North Korea ’s', 'America', 'Seoul', 'Kerry', 'U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Korea University', 'Seoul', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Yun Byung - se', 'the U.S. Embassy', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Kerry ’s', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Russia', 'Curtis Scaparrotti', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'the Munhwa Ilbo', 'Seoul', 'Curtis Scaparrotti', 'the Far East Forum', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Scaparrotti', 'north korean', 'USFK', 'U.S.', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter ’s', 'south korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'thaad', 'Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Washington', 'North Korea ’s', 'SLBM', 'State', 'Defense Departments', 'USFK', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",18,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.15200728  0.542898

The South Korean government also expressed its intention to provide $10 billion for mutual cooperation in infrastructure and export credits for smart cities, railways, power generation and transmission projects in India, according to a joint statement issued after the summit.The two sides also agreed to boost cooperation in the aerospace sector by promoting ties between the Indian Space Research Organization and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute. On security front, the leaders expressed concern over Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, stating that such moves are in violation of its international obligation and commitments.They also reiterated their commitment to eradicate terrorism for world peace and stability. On culture, the two sides agreed to jointly produce film and TV content and promote human exchanges to better understanding each other.The Indian premier arrived in Seoul on Monday for a two-day trip. South Korea is his last destination of a three-nation trip aimed at enhancing ties with India’s eastern neighbors. Before South Korea, Modi visited China and Mongolia. During the summit, Modi requested the South Korean leader to provide investment and support for his “Make in India” drive ― aimed at bolstering India’s manufacturing sector ― and its participation in infrastructure projects including one to build “smart cities” across the world’s largest democracy.The meeting is expected to offer an opportunity for South Korea to strengthen ties with India, dubbed as “Next China” due to its market size and also its diplomatic status. The leaders were holding the summit for the second time after their previous meeting held on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Plus Three Summit. At the meeting last year, they discussed ways to improve a strategic partnership signed in 2010.

The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year.  The Ministry of Unification said that Seoul proposed last week to hold a joint committee on the industrial park Wednesday to discuss the wage dispute, but the North has rejected the proposal, saying an atmosphere for dialogue has not been created.  ""The South made such a proposal, but the North has refused to accept our offer,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, a ministry spokesman, said at a press briefing.

The committee has not met since June last year due to the North's refusal.  The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.

It is an important political investment in the future.” From left: Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka, military attache Andrzej Markowicz and his wife Anna Warecka-Markowicz, and First Secretary Grzegorz Kowal, stand at a reception marking the May 3 Polish Constitution Day at Millennium Seoul Hilton on Thursday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. With a population of over 38 million, the country is now considered an EU heavyweight along with Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain. Largely due to Germany’s contrition, German-Polish relations became one of the most resilient partnerships in the EU, along with Franco-German ties. According to The Economist, Poland is the only European country to have avoided a recession during the 2008 global financial crisis ― due to the combination of acute fiscal and monetary policies, a flexible exchange rate for the zloty, balanced exposure to international trade and low household and corporate debt. The Polish economy grew by 3.4 percent last year, and is expected to maintain annual growth averaging 3.5 percent for the next five years, the IMF reports. Poland and Korea celebrated the silver jubilee last year, following the establishment of a strategic partnership in October 2013 with the visit of Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski to Korea. Last December, the two countries signed the 2014-16 Action Plan to bolster the strategic partnership adopted in 2013; the plan will facilitate consultation channels, high-level exchanges and joint projects in science, technology and culture. Poland is South Korea’s largest investment destination in Central Europe, while South Korea is Poland’s second-largest economic partner in Asia after China. Bilateral trade volume was $4.5 billion last year, and more than 150 Korean companies, mostly in electronics and automotive sectors, operate in Poland.In another speech, Korea’s Oceans and Fisheries Minister Yoo Ki-june expressed appreciation for the Polish soldiers who have served on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission duty in Korea’s Demilitarized Zone for the last 62 years.“Historically, both countries have experienced a myriad of hardships and sufferings, but managed to preserve their national identities to achieve peace and prosperity,” Yoo said.

Technically, the plaintiffs in the case are eight Lone Star subsidiaries that carried out transactions in Korea on behalf of the parent firm. After a round of paper-based debates, the case's first hearing is scheduled to begin at the ICSID office in Washington on Friday for a 10-day run.Lone Star claims South Korea should compensate it because the firm ended up selling off the KEB stake for a margin much smaller than what it could have gained from an earlier deal that ultimately fell apart because it claims of Seoul's delay in approving the contract.In 2007, the Texas-based firm had agreed to sell its 51-percent stake in KEB to global banking giant HSBC for about 5.94 trillion won (about US$5.4 billion at current exchange rates), but HSBC scrapped the contract a year later amid the global financial crisis.Lone Star sold the stake to Hana Financial Group for some 3.9 trillion won in 2012.South Korea rejects Lone Star's claims, contending it couldn't hastily approve the deal with HSBC because some legal issues involving the firm were going on at the time, including allegations of stock manipulation in the course of Lone Star's acquisition of KEB's credit card unit.Seoul says any sovereign nation would have done the same in such circumstances.Lone Star also claims South Korea should reimburse it for the taxes it paid on the proceeds from selling off its assets because it is technically the subsidiaries based in either Belgium or Luxembourg that carried out the transactions and therefore, they should be exempt from taxes under investments treaties South Korea has with the European nations.But Seoul says the subsidiaries are paper companies and should not be protected by investment treaties.The case has drawn keen attention in South Korea not only because of the amount of money involved, but also its possible repercussions amid concern that if the country loses in the case, it could spark similar suits by foreign firms.South Korea has handled the case after forming an interagency team comprising the Office for Government Policy Coordination, the Finance Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the National Tax Service and the Financial Services Commission.About 10 South Korean officials have arrived in Washington for the first hearing.""Our government has treated foreign firms in a fair and non-discriminatory way in accordance with not only domestic law, but also international regulations,"" said Kim Chul-soo, a justice ministry official. ""The government will make efforts to get best results.""A second hearing is scheduled to take place for 10 days from June 29.Officials said it is unlikely for the ICSID to make a decision any time soon. Widespread views are that it would be at least a year before the tribunal delivers a verdict. Unlike ordinary lawsuits, the ICSID's decision cannot be appealed.

640,640,Purges spark doubts on Kim’s power,"Speculation is rising over the stability of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s leadership as his frequent execution and purge of senior military and government officials apparently indicate their eroding loyalty toward him.Seoul’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, told South Korean lawmakers Wednesday that “skepticism” over Kim’s leadership is spreading among power elites in the communist state.“As ...","Speculation is rising over the stability of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s leadership as his frequent execution and purge of senior military and government officials apparently indicate their eroding loyalty toward him.Seoul’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, told South Korean lawmakers Wednesday that “skepticism” over Kim’s leadership is spreading among power elites in the communist state.“As Kim Jong-un’s distrust toward core senior officials has been deepening, he is strengthening his reign of terror by purging those officials without going through legitimate protocol,” an NIS official told media, declining to be named.Most recently, Hyon Yong-chol, the chief of North Korea’s People’s Armed Forces, was executed for talking back to Kim and dozing off at a military event. An anti-aircraft gun was used to kill him, according to the NIS. Observers say the execution method highlights the brutality of the dictatorial regime. Hyon was one of the scores of senior officials recently purged or executed despite their contribution to the young leader’s efforts to consolidate his power in the military, party and government, according to the NIS. Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies of Seoul National University, said Kim might have eliminated those who were disgruntled about his dogmatic push for seemingly unfeasible policy initiatives. He also pointed out that amid a series of purges, Kim’s legitimacy as a leader could weaken. “Purges and executions could take place against those including technocrats who might have raised questions over the viability or feasibility of Kim’s economic and other projects that he has dogmatically pushed for,” he said.“Kim might have felt a sense of inferiority and growing pressure to press with them and make them successful. Thus, he might have eliminated those who looked skeptical of his initiatives,” he said, noting that doubts might be emerging among the power elites over Kim’s handling of state affairs.Some analysts, however, believe it is still premature to conclude that the execution and purge of senior officials show that his leadership is weak.“Yes, some people would say that Kim’s leadership may be so unstable that he should resort to this reign of terror. But others may think that Kim is still in the process of consolidating his power by getting rid of those who would challenge his leadership,” said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Dongguk University.“Despite his ruthless executions, no one in the military seems to have risen up against him and challenge him, which could also indicate that Kim’s leadership is fairly strong. Kim has frequently demoted or promoted top brass, and executed many of them, and this could also mean he is taking stable control of the military,” he added.Kim’s power base has been regarded as weaker than that of his late father Kim Jong-il as he took the helm of the reclusive state in 2011 after just several years of grooming. But his father was groomed for the leadership over nearly two decades ― long enough to consolidate his power.His relatively weak power base, coupled with a lack of experience in statecraft, Kim appears to be resorting more to a brutal way of controlling the top echelons in the North, analysts said. His reign of terror could also be based on his temperamental personality, they also noted.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korean lawmakers wednesday that skepticism ,terror by purging those officials ,university despite his ruthless executions ,lawmakers wednesday that skepticism over ,lawmakers wednesday that skepticism","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Seoul', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'NIS', 'Hyon Yong - chol', 'North Korea ’s', 'People ’s Armed Forces', 'Kim', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Koh Yoo - hwan', 'North Korea', 'Seoul ’s Dongguk University', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim', 'Song Sang - ho']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40466312  0.52880484

The test, if confirmed, would represent a significant step forward in the North's missile technology.""The North Korean press says it was launched from the submarine. I have some significant doubts whether that's true,"" Bermudez said, citing satellite imagery taken of the North's Shinpo Shipyard a day after the missile test, which shows a submarine docked next to a barge. The North must have tested the missile from the barge, the expert said, speaking via a video link from Colorado, where his AllSource Analysis is based.Noting that the North launched the submarine only in October last year, Bermudez emphasized it is almost impossible for the regime to test an SLBM from the vessel only six to seven months later. Such a submarine-based test is at the"" very, very outside of any possible North Korean technology at the moment,"" he said.""Typically what you do when you develop and test a ballistic missile that is to be launched from a submarine, you test it first on land, then from barges or submersible containers and then eventually you conduct a test from a submarine,"" he said.""If you look at the imagery the way North Korea portrays on KCNA, you are given the impression or you're left with the impression that the submarine itself conducted the launch. I have some serious doubts about that at this point in time,"" he said.Bermudez also said that the missile used in the test is believed to be much shorter than the North's Musudan or Nodong missiles, citing the size of what appeared to be a ballistic missile shipping container adjacent to the submarine in the satellite imagery.""So this would suggest that North Korea's developing a new missile. Some people point at the KN-11.

There is just smoke and water and steam,"" he said. ""This might suggest that some of the imagery that was provided to the public was photoshopped or manipulated in some fashion to give it a different impression.""Bermudez also said that the North has repeatedly conducted ""camouflage, concealment and deception operations.""For now, the North's submarine capabilities are only an ""emerging threat,"" the expert said.""We're not looking at a dramatic increase in submarine capabilities while we're looking at incremental improvements in submarine capabilities, incremental expansion of submarine force and incremental development of ballistic missiles,"" he said.Joel Wit, head of 38 North, also said the North is years away from developing submarine missile capabilities.""Even with a very strong, maximum effort, in five years, they might be able to deploy ballistic missile submarines with help from overseas, but those submarines would not pose a threat to the United States, and once again, be more of a regional threat,"" he said.South Korea's defense ministry described the North's missile launch as ""very serious and worrying,"" and urged Pyongyang to cease the development of such missiles, even though officials said the missile appeared to have flown only about 100 or 150 meters from the surface of the water.President Park Geun-hye also called it a ""serious challenge.""The North's SLBM, if developed, would pose a serious threat because its mobile nature would make it very difficult to detect preparations for a launch.

643,643,Park warns against N.K. provocation,"President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday warned that North Korea’s development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles posed a “grave challenge” to regional peace, as the military stepped up efforts to boost its anti-submarine capabilities to better counter the threat.She also called for “stern punishment” in case of any provocation in the skirmish-prone West Sea, following the communist neighbor’s repeated threats ...","President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday warned that North Korea’s development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles posed a “grave challenge” to regional peace, as the military stepped up efforts to boost its anti-submarine capabilities to better counter the threat.She also called for “stern punishment” in case of any provocation in the skirmish-prone West Sea, following the communist neighbor’s repeated threats over the weekend to strike South Korean Navy vessels that it claimed were breaching its waters. Cross-border tension is rising after Pyongyang last week succeeded in ejecting a dummy projectile from a newly developed 2,000-ton submarine off the eastern coastal city of Sinpo, a key early stage in developing SLBMs. It also fired three short-range ship-to-ship missiles into the East Sea. President Park Geun-hye presides over a meeting with top security officials at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. (Yonhap)In light of the underwater test, the country is expected to be able to deploy ballistic missile-equipped submarines as early as two to three years from now, and fully achieve SLBM capability in four to five years, Seoul military officials said. Park convened her first meeting with foreign and defense chiefs in about a year, calling for airtight military readiness and measures to better respond to the neighbor’s accelerating development of asymmetric weapons. It was the sixth edition since she assumed office in February 2013.“North Korea’s ongoing development of SLBMs, which defies U.N. Security Council resolutions banning all launches using ballistic missile technology and related activities, poses a grave challenge to the stability not only on the Korean Peninsula but also in East Asia,” she was quoted as saying at the meeting by Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Min Kyung-wook.Among the participants in the session were National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin, presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, National Intelligence Service director Lee Byung-ho, and Kim Kyou-hyun, head of the secretariat of the National Security Council. With the mounting SLBM threats, South Korea will adjust and extend the concept of the Kill Chain preemptive strike system and Korea Air and Missile Defense program to be built by the early 2020s, the Defense Ministry said. The military will also shore up its anti-submarine capabilities based on the principles of “detect, defense, disrupt and destroy” or “4D” ― the four major steps to respond to the North’s nuclear and missile attacks, a senior official noted. South Korea and the U.S. have been working to translate the concept into their wartime operational plans. The “detect” represents the allies’ procedures to track North Korea’s missile movements with various intelligence-gathering assets, while the “defense” refers to a set of the allied defensive operations to minimize any damage from potential attacks.The “disrupt” means striking North Korea’s core missile facilities including supporting installations, followed by the allies’ efforts to “destroy” its mobile transporter-erector-launchers and incoming missiles.“We can expand the concept of the Kill Chain and KAMD given that it’s possible to attack multiple targets with the same apparatus,” ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “The expanded concept will help us prop up our operational plans and inject more funding if needed.” The countermeasures reflect remarks by Defense Minister Han Min-koo at a parliamentary session Monday that the existing designs of the Kill Chain and KAMD systems have “limits” in responding to SLBM threats because their chief targets are ground-launched missiles. Criticism also grew that Seoul had not adequately forecast Pyongyang’s SLBM advancement and devised steps to head it off, despite the allies’ years of monitoring. Its midterm defense plan for 2016-20 did not address the SLBM threats and projects on maritime patrol aircraft and long-distance acoustic sensors were put on the back burner. In recent years, the North has carried out a string of onshore and undersea ejection tests as part of its efforts to secure the triad of delivery tools of a nuclear arsenal, which also include strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Yet the latest experiment fueled concerns that it could help acquire a survivable second-strike capability, beef up the country’s nuclear deterrence and ultimately take its threat to a new level. Missile launches from submerged vessels are harder to detect than land-based ones.“The underwater missile test shows that North Korea’s missile capabilities are advancing at a clip that is concerning, if not alarming,” Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote on the think tank’s website on Monday. “The North is moving headlong toward the development of a modern, survivable nuclear deterrent, with the full range of capacity from battlefield nuclear forces to high-yield fission and fusion weapons.” Seoul and Washington are forecast to further review the progress on Pyongyang’s SLBM capability and discuss ways to intensify intelligence sharing including with Tokyo at an Asia security conference in Singapore later this month where Han and his U.S. and Japanese counterparts are slated to take part. Adm. Choi Yun-hee, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also held consultations and fine-tuned their responses on Tuesday with Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, following their talks on Friday.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, for his part, is scheduled to visit Seoul on May 17-18 as the allies are gearing up for a summit later this year in Washington between Park and U.S. President Barack Obama. “We will look into various ways to respond (to the ejection test) at an international level based on discussions with the U.S. and other countries,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Noh Kwang-il said at a press briefing, hinting at the possible engagement of the U.N.

To better cope with the growing threats of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities, both South Korean and U.S.officials have indicated the need for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery in South Korea. Arguing that the U.S. missile-defense system could also target China, Beijing has publicly pressed Seoul not to accept the THAAD battery. In return, South Korea's defense ministry has blamed China for trying to ""influence"" Seoul's security policy.""The fundamental reason why debates over the possible deployment of the THAAD in South Korea continue is that North Korea continues to advance its nuclear and missile capabilities,"" Kim said in an interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix television. Kim said North Korea is ""building up security unrest and this situation is not serving the security and strategic interests of both South Korea and China."" In October, South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo told lawmakers that deploying a THAAD battery at a U.S. military base in South Korea would help defend against North Korea's missile and nuclear threats. South Korea is home to about 28,500 American troops. Chinese scholars say the radar of the THAAD system can monitor objects located deep inside the Chinese mainland. However, Kim, a former defense minister who headed the National Security Council at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, said China ""does not need to be worried because there is a certain limit in the radar of the THAAD system."" Kim did not elaborate further. South Korea and the U.S. have called for China, the economic lifeline of North Korea, to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but China's stance over its ideological ally, Pyongyang, has often been self-contradictory. Many analysts believe that China's ruling Communist Party leadership won't put enough pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions because a sudden collapse of the North's regime could threaten China's own security interests.North Korea's state media reported on Saturday that Pyongyang has successfully test-launched a ballistic missile from a submarine.If independently confirmed, it would be a significant advance in the missile technology of North Korea, which has conducted three nuclear tests so far.

The communist country succeeded in ejecting a dummy projectile from a newly developed 2,000-ton submarine through last week’s experiment at a shipyard in the eastern coastal city of Sinpo, a crucial early stage in developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles, the officials said. They declined to confirm the range of the KN-11 missile but it is believed to have flown about 150 meters. “North Korea is expected to be capable of deploying the submarine fitted with one missile in two to three years,” a senior military official told reporters, requesting anonymity citing sensitive intelligence. “Given its need to obtain the technology for making and miniaturizing a warhead, as well as the missile’s atmospheric reentry, it will take four to five years to fully achieve the SLBM capability,” another official added. Pyongyang is believed to have conducted a series of ejection tests as part of its efforts to secure the triad of delivery tools of a nuclear arsenal, consisting of strategic bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles and SLBMs. Concerns are growing because the latest experiment could help secure a survivable second-strike capability, beef up the country’s nuclear deterrence and thus push its threat to a new high. Missile launches from submerged vessels are more challenging to detect than land-based ones. Defense Minister Han Min-kooOverseeing the event, the young leader Kim Jong-un touted it as a “world-level strategic weapon” and “eye-opening success,” the official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday. The outlet released a few images of the launch in which a projectile soared from the sea into the air, sparking a streak of fire, which the military officials assessed seem genuine. South Korea and the U.S. have been closely monitoring the North’s SLBM-related movement in recent years. Yet the unveiling of the test is apparently designed to divert international attention from Kim’s revoked plan to attend the May 9 ceremony in Russia for the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the officials say. “North Korea has likely sought to ratchet up pressure on the South and the U.S. by showing that it is trying to attain the SLBM capability, as the world was zooming in on the reasons for his canceled trip,” the official said. The Defense Ministry here expressed “grave concern,” while downplaying the view that Pyongyang’s SLBM development may neuter Seoul’s Kill Chain and Korea Air and Missile Defense preemptive strike systems to be established by the early 2020s. The U.S. State Department has also blasted the launch as a “clear violation” of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. “We urge North Korea to immediately cease its SLBM development that hampers the stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “There is no such thing as perfect, but we’re able to counter its threat with what we have now, including our submarines, various missiles and other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets on top of the Kill Chain and KAMD systems.” The government and the ruling Saenuri Party convened an emergency meeting to review the cross-border situation and the allies’ military readiness posture. The National Assembly’s defense committee also held a plenary session later in the day to be briefed by Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Adm. Choi Yun-hee, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other top military commanders. During the earlier session, Han pledged a robust deterrence against and “ruthless” response to any unpredicted provocation. “We do have countermeasures including the South Korea-U.S. joint assets and are devising a plan to expand tools for future effective responses,” Han said. Seoul officials are also looking into possible diplomatic action such as raising the issue at a U.N. panel on May 28 designed to regularly review the implementation of sanctions against North Korea. On Tuesday, Choi is scheduled to hold consultations with Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, following their talks on Friday over Pyongyang’s threats of strikes against South Korean Navy vessels that it claimed were violating its waters in the West Sea. “The sides plan to confer on various military responses including increased surveillance of North Korea’s submarine activities using joint reconnaissance assets,” the JCS said in a statement.

651,651,[Newsmaker] N.K. submarine missile serious threat,North Korea’s push to develop a submarine-launched ballistic missile is posing a daunting security challenge to South Korea and the U.S. as the allies would have almost no means to counter the emerging threat should it become fully operational.

The allies have so far been focusing on countering missile threats from land-based launchers as they believed Pyongyang was far from developing an SLBM given the small size of its submarines and outdated technology.But the North’s test-firing last week showed that the communist regime was close to completing the development of the strategic SLBM. Describing the test-firing as a success, the North called the launched projectile “a world-level strategic weapon.” “There is no effective measure to counter the SLBM for now. It would be, per se, a final-stage, ultimate addition to the North’s strategic weapons list,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.A ballistic missile, called Bukkeuksong, is shown being test-launched from underwater in a photo from a report by North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun on Saturday. (Yonhap)“Whatever top-of-the-line detection systems you have, it would be difficult to keep track of submarine movements. Obviously, there are limits when you conduct antisubmarine operations,” he added. Seoul officials now forecast it would take four to five years for the North to fully develop and deploy the SLBM. They also think that the North will be able to build a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine capable of carrying the SLBM in two to three years.Analysts say that the North’s potential deployment of the nuclear SLBM would be a “game changer,” underscoring the need for Seoul to work on countering the new security challenge.“Obviously, the question is whether North Korea has or will be able to mount a nuclear warhead on the SLBM. If so, this would represent a strategic game-changer,” said Michael Raska, research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, affiliated with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.“Meanwhile, with gradually improving submarine capabilities, North Korea’s naval strategy may be shifting ― from a traditional coastal defense toward a more offensive type of operations,” he added.Fears about the SLBM stem from the North’s potential “second-strike capability” to launch a surprise nuclear retaliation if it suffers a “first strike” from enemy forces. The second-strike capability forms the basis of a condition referred to as “mutual assured destruction” that maintained the “balance of terror” between the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War era. SLBMs are at the core of the capability as submarines can launch targeted surprise attacks on enemy forces.Despite growing concerns over the North’s development of the SLBM, some observers remain doubtful of the North’s capabilities to develop an SLBM that can mount attacks on land-based targets.“A true North Korean SLBM with land-attack capabilities would be a serious new threat. But so far I believe that we only have the North Korean statements and picture describing these missiles, and North Korea often seriously exaggerates its military capabilities,” said Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the U.S. think tank RAND Corporation.“Given the small size of North Korean submarines and the state of their missile technology, I suspect this missile will not have enough payload to carry a nuclear warhead, and may have only a few hundred kilometers’ range,” he added.As the North appears to be developing the SLBM faster than expected, calls have been mounting for Seoul to devise a way to counter the SLBM threats, as there are no good ways to block SLBM attacks due to the difficulty in detecting deep-water submarines.“Even if North Korea may take 5-10 years to pose a truly serious SLBM threat, it will also likely take 10 years or more for South Korea to acquire an adequate set of counters to SLBMs. So South Korea needs to be working on the counters now,” said Bennett.To better handle the evolving nuclear and missile threats from the North, Seoul should step up security cooperation and intelligence sharing with Washington and Tokyo, some analysts said. Some also stress that Seoul should underscore the unacceptable cost Pyongyang would pay should it launch an SLBM to help ensure deterrence against it.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea push to develop submarine ,to launch surprise nuclear retaliation ,its submarines and outdated technology ,korean slbm with land attack ,launch surprise nuclear retaliation","['North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'slbm', 'slbm', 'SLBM', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'Bukkeuksong', 'North Korea ’s', 'Rodong Sinmun', 'Seoul', 'SLBM', 'SLBM', 'North ’s', 'SLBM', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'SLBM', 'Michael Raska', 'the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies', 'Nanyang Technological University', 'Singapore', 'North Korea ’s', 'SLBM', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'Soviet Union', 'North ’s', 'SLBM', 'North ’s', 'slbm', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Bruce Bennett', 'U.S.', 'RAND Corporation', 'north korean', 'slbm', 'Seoul', 'SLBM', 'slbm', 'North Korea', 'slbm', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Bennett', 'North', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'slbm', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.52860963 -0.16353957

The underwater testing of the KN-11, or “Bukkeuksong” (North Star) missile, stoked concerns over the communist state’s possible acquirement of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, a technology that could make way for a survivable second-strike capability and thus bring its nuclear threat to a new level. Leader Kim Jong-un oversaw the event, calling it a “world-level strategic weapon” and “eye-opening success,” the official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday. It also unveiled a few photos of the launch, though some analysts said they appear to have been altered. “A ballistic missile surfaced from the sea and soared into the air, leaving a fiery trail,” the dispatch said. It did not elaborate on the location and date of the launch or details on the missile but its range is expected to be several hundred kilometers.  Images published in North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Saturday show a ballistic missile believed to have been launched from underwater and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un observing the test-fire. (Yonhap)“Through the test, it was verified and confirmed that the underwater ballistic missile launch from a strategic submarine fully achieved the latest military, scientific and technical requirements.”Also on Saturday, the North fired three short-range anti-ship missiles into the sea off Wonsan, a major port city on the country’s eastern shore. The KN-01 cruise missiles with a range of 100 kilometers were launched over a span of one hour starting from 4:25 p.m., according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The missiles are the same type as those that were fired in February from the East Sea with Kim Jong-un also in attendance, and the launch was apparently intended for a display of force and performance improvement,” the JCS said in a statement. The test followed the North Korean military’s repeated warnings to the presidential National Security Office here ― through a border communication channel ― of strikes against Navy vessels that it claimed were breaching the West Sea border. The KCNA also carried an “emergency special warning” late Friday, vowing “targeted strikes without notice” against the ships. Pyongyang does not recognize the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime frontier in the West Sea, arguing that it was drawn unfairly by the U.S.-led U.N. forces at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. In 2007, it unilaterally declared a border located farther southward. Uriminzokkiri, a North Korea propaganda website, again disputed the NLL on Sunday, saying the South staged a “grave military provocation” by claiming the NLL as the sole boundary and violating its territorial waters. Seoul’s Defense Ministry expressed “grave regret” over the North’s continuous “high-intensity threats” and attempt to shift blame for the heightened tension in the West Sea. JCS chairman Adm. Choi Yun-hee on Friday pledged robust deterrence and close cooperation during consultations with Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, while visiting the Navy’s western command headquarters earlier in the day in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, and holding a video conference with other operations commanders on Saturday to ensure vigilance against any unpredicted provocation. “In case of the enemy’s provocation, we will inject strong joint forces to sternly punish not only the origin of the attack but the command and supporters,” Choi said during the trip, according to the ministry. Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Council, for its part, convened an emergency meeting to examine the current situation and the intention behind the military and verbal threats, as well as the possibility of an actual provocation. Choi briefed its members on the allies’ military readiness posture and ongoing movement across the border. The participants included NSO chief Kim Kwan-jin, presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee, foreign, defense and unification ministers, NSC secretariat head Kim Kyou-hyun and Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary on foreign affairs and security. Of their particular concern is the underwater test, because missile launches from submerged vessels are more difficult to detect compared with land-based ones. Combined with Pyongyang’s publicly professed efforts to miniaturize nuclear warheads to mount on such projectiles, its potential threat could be much greater, experts and officials say. Satellite imagery analyzed by the U.S.-Korea Institute of Johns Hopkins University in recent months pointed to the Sinpo shipyard as the likely site of the latest experiment. In a separate report the same day, the KCNA said Kim visited a fisheries facility in the eastern coastal city. In January, the 38 North blog run by the institute cited satellite photos to report that the North appears to have been building a submarine that may house one or two vertical launch tubes for ballistic or cruise missiles and thus may become an “experimental test bed for land-attack missile technology.”“North Korea’s development of a submarine-launched missile capability would eventually expand Pyongyang’s threat to South Korea, Japan and U.S. bases in East Asia, also complicating regional missile defense planning, deployment and operations,” analyst Joseph Bermudez wrote. “Submarines carrying land-attack missiles would be challenging to locate and track, would be mobile assets able to attack from any direction, and could operate at significant distances from the Korean Peninsula.” The U.S. State Department did not offer any assessment of the North’s advancement on its SLBM program but said that launches using ballistic missile technology are a “clear violation” of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. “We call on North Korea to refrain from actions that further raise tensions in the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments and obligations,” the department said in a statement.

""Launches using ballistic missile technology are a clear violation of multiple U.N.

If confirmed, it would be the country's first test-fire of a ballistic missile from a submarine.   South Korean officials said, however, that the North's submarine-launched missile was more of a test for an ejection rather than firing, since the missile is assumed to have flown only about 100 meters after it soared from the waters.   ""We call on North Korea to refrain from actions that further raise tensions in the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments and obligations,"" the State Department spokesperson said.   ""The United States remains steadfast in its commitments to the defense of its allies.

But it is assumed to have taken place on Friday near Sinpo South Shipyard on the east coast, as the media said in a separate report that Kim paid a visit there on the same day to instruct a fishery complex. Intelligence sources from Seoul and Washington have claimed the North has been developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), warning that it can be a fresh menace to the security of the Korean Peninsula. They believe the North has succeeded in installing the missile launcher onto the submarine, predicted to weigh about 2,500 tons, after conducting a series of experiments on shore as well as underwater. In February, North Korea said it had carried out a test of a missile ejection launcher from the seashore in Sinpo a month prior.Early this year, U.S.-based website 38 North, said the North appears to have been developing a submarine capable of firing missiles, based on satellite imagery taken of the Sinpo shipyard in December.It showed a roughly 2.25 meter-wide rectangular opening on top of the conning tower of a submarine that is believed to be designed to house missile launch tubes.North Korean watchers have raised concerns over Pyongyang's move, since it is seen as part of efforts to equip its missiles with miniaturized nuclear bombs. They said if what North says is true, it would mean the communist regime has reached a point where its naval strike capability is at least a decade ahead of the South. The South Korean navy has just come up with a plan to build six 3,000-ton submarines equipped with vertical missile launchers between 2027 and 2030. North Korea's move is believed to be aimed at making its submarine-launched missiles eventually capable of a long-range firing, experts said, which could set off the South to modify its tactics against the bellicose state. The KCNA said the latest test-fire ""proved and confirmed that the ballistic missile fire from the submarine fully met the requirements of the latest military science and technology."" Kim ""highly praised"" the officials and experts who led the project for ""having successfully perfected the technology,"" the state media added.(khnews@heraldcorp.com)","test fire of submarine ballistic ,been developing submarine launched ballistic ,build six 000 ton submarines ,underwater test fire of submarine ,developing submarine launched ballistic missile","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'KCNA', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'SLBM', 'North Korea', 'sinpo', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'North', 'south korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'KCNA', 'Kim', 'added.(khnews@heraldcorp.com']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61957562 -0.11581047

Despite the warning, 49 out of 124 South Korean companies have paid the March wages to the North's workers apparently out of threat by the North.The South Korean government said that it plans to lay down ""corresponding"" punishment on such violators.""Seoul is probing into the exact motive for the wage payment. Depending on the results, the government will definitely impose punitive actions on such companies,"" said an official at the government, asking not to be named. He said that it is not clear whether all of the 49 firms will be punished.The South has not accepted the North's unilateral move, saying that Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set the wages together. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year. Currently, the North is requesting for a 5.18 percent hike.The two quasi-state committees from each side have not held the talks on the wage dispute since April 20.The official said that there has been no reported slowdown or strike by North Korean workers even as most of their employers have not paid their wages.  The joint factory park, opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.

They had a meeting in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang earlier this week.A historic summit between then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was held on June 15, 2000 and Korea's Liberation Day falls on Aug. 15, which marks Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.""During that period, the two sides plan to actively push for joint events and cooperative projects to promote national unity, reconciliation and move toward unification,"" read a joint statement.Representatives from the South said that the two sides tentatively agreed to hold a summit anniversary event from June 14-16 in Seoul. But the two sides have not reached a consensus on a joint ceremony to mark the liberation day, they added.The South Korean government will wait for further details to decide whether to approve the scheme.Seoul has recently vowed to spur civilian inter-Korean exchanges in the areas of culture, sports and other non-political programs to help improve the strained inter-Korean ties.In the June 2000 summit, the leaders of the two Koreas produced a landmark joint declaration, which outlines reconciliation and economic cooperation. South and North Korea remain technically at war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.The summit events were last held in 2008 on Mount Kumgang, a scenic resort on North Korea's east coast.The move comes as this year also marks the 70th anniversary of liberation from Japan's colonial rule and the division of the two Koreas.To support the celebration of the landmark year, Seoul approved civilian groups' preparatory talks on the summit events for the first time since 2010 when it imposed punitive sanctions on North Korea that ban inter-Korean exchanges with the North except humanitarian aid.South Korea imposed the sanctions in May 2010 to punish the North for its deadly torpedoing of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March of that year.Seoul's civic group also said that North Korea is positively considering sending its cheering squad to the Gwangju Universiade that will be held on South Korean soil from July 3-14.South Korea said that it is too early to say that the government would approve the commemorative events as the two sides have not reached a consensus for the venue and other details.""The government will review whether to approve them if details for the events are finalized,"" said a Unification Ministry official, asking not to be named. He added that ""civilian exchanges in non-political sectors"" would be permitted if they helped improve inter-Korean ties.The relations between the two Koreas have been frayed as North Korea has continued its provocative acts by launching nuclear tests and missiles.Seoul has offered high-level talks with Pyongyang, but the North has not responded to the South's proposal, calling for South Korea to lift its punitive sanctions as a precondition for the talks.

(Yonhap)To be commissioned in November 2016, the diesel-powered sub has a maximum underwater speed of 20 knots (37 kilometers per hour), which makes it possible to travel between South Korea and Hawaii without refueling.It will be operated by Air Independent Propulsion, which bolsters the vessel’s submerged endurance and allows the crew to carry out underwater missions for up to two weeks without access to atmospheric oxygen. The Navy currently has 13 submarines: nine 1,200-ton, 209-class submarines and four 1,800-ton, 214-class submarines. By 2019, its fleet is slated to be expanded to 18 submarines with the addition of five 214-class submarines. In the 2020s, the Navy plans to add nine 3,000-ton submarines fitted with vertical launchers for submarine-to-ground missiles. The 209-class submarines, introduced in 1992, will be decommissioned in the 2020s as the new submarines are introduced.

Historians say more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced to serve as sex slaves. Diplomacy, however, should not be viewed as a zero-sum game in which a gain for one side translates into a loss for another, insist officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, once rated as the best performing agency in the government.Park In-hwi, a professor of Ewha Womans University in Seoul, disagrees.""The Northeast Asian order surrounding us has been showing a structural change,"" she said in a phone call with Yonhap News Agency. ""The U.S., China, Japan and Russia are responding to the structural change and using new strategies, while we are revealing problems all around, including a lack of vision and absence of a practical strategy.""Such a disappointment reached a new level late last month when Japanese Premier Abe visited the U.S. and demonstrated a growing alliance with Washington without paying heed to Seoul's demand for an apology over Japan's wartime atrocities.A highlight of the visit was the two allies' revision of their defense cooperation guidelines, which South Koreans viewed as a revival of Japan's past militarism. South Korea suffered under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.A foreign ministry official, however, claimed the revision would help, rather than damage, South Korea's national interests.""If, for example, Japan sends forces to combat piracy off Africa, why would that be bad for us?"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""If U.S.-Japan relations were bad, would that be good for us? That's certainly not the case.""The official also argued that Seoul has no say in shaping U.S.-Japan ties in the same way that other countries would not be able to affect South Korea's bilateral diplomatic relations. Some experts called for a more flexible stance in handling relations with South Korea's neighbors, including North Korea.""The first step in overcoming this diplomatic crisis is normalizing inter-Korean ties,"" said Hong Hyeon-ik, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. ""Without resolving the current tensions between South and North Korea, our diplomacy loses its strength.""The remark dovetails with views that North Korea is an important factor in South Korea's relations with foreign countries. The U.S., for example, began to see South Korea as a dialogue partner only after the North began to pose a threat to Washington's national interests by building up its missiles and nuclear weapons programs, the official said. Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, meanwhile, has maintained his stance that the concerns over South Korea's diplomatic leverage ""go too far"" and ""do not reflect reality.""Earlier this year, critics had argued that South Korea may have to accept the U.S.'s wish to deploy an advanced missile-defense system in South Korea in return for joining a China-led regional bank as a founding member.China had expressed strong opposition to the possible deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery in South Korea, apparently viewing it as a security threat, while Washington had questioned the transparency and standards of governance of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.The U.S. is South Korea's traditional ally, while China is South Korea's largest trading partner.Yun described the situation as ""a blessing, not a dilemma"" for South Korea.Lawmakers offered a different view.""In judging success and failure in foreign policy, the people's dignity and sentiments are a very important yardstick,"" Rep. Na Kyung-won of the ruling party said in a parliamentary meeting on Monday. ""What the people are feeling now is that our foreign policy is too closed and stiff.""Rep. Kim Han-gil of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy jumped on the bandwagon.""Not recognizing a crisis as a crisis is a truly serious crisis,"" he said.On the same day, President Park Geun-hye made clear she would maintain her current approach of separating history from other issues.""I would like our foreign affairs (team) to clearly address history issues while continuing to make active efforts for a clear goal and direction in foreign affairs such as the South Korea-U.S. alliance, South Korea-Japan relations, and South Korea-China ties,"" she said in a meeting with her senior secretaries.Park's remarks came several days after her senior secretary for foreign affairs, Ju Chul-ki, made similar comments during a forum.""The press has been criticizing us a lot, but they don't offer a solution, saying that's the job of the Foreign Ministry,"" another ministry official said.It remains to be seen what the Park administration's policy option will be on Japan's repeated provocations on the shared history and the need to improve ties with its former colonial ruler of whom South Koreans still have a bitter memory.

""We've christened it Yu Gwan-sun, to honor her sacrifice and to promote public security awareness, marking the 70th anniversary of independence from Japan's colonial rule and the establishment of the Navy.""Yu is an iconic symbol who played a major part in the so-called March 1 civil uprising in 1919 against the colonial regime. The Japanese arrested the teenager and sentenced her to seven years in prison, where she died at age 18 after being tortured. Korea was under harsh colonial rule by Japan from 1910-1945.According to the Navy, the ship is armed with indigenous ship-to-ship cruise missiles named Haeseong, or Sea Star, and torpedoes and mines for anti-vessel and anti-submarine operations.The cruise missiles with a maximum range of 1,500 kilometers are capable of carrying out precision strikes against enemies' key facilities.The sub's maximum underwater speed is 20 knots, which enables it to travel between South Korea and Hawaii without refueling.The diesel-powered submarine will be operated by Air Independent Propulsion, which bolsters the vessel's submerged endurance and allows the crew to carry out underwater missions for up to two weeks without access to atmospheric oxygen.  Currently, the Navy operates nine 1,200-ton submarines and four 1,800-ton subs, while planning to build five more 1,800-ton submarines by 2019. In addition, it plans to deploy nine 3,000-ton submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles, starting in 2020.North Korea has a significant superiority in the number of submarines, as is believed to have some 70 vessels, including about 20 1,800-ton Romeo-class submarines.

""They can't stop everything and even if they said they stopped everything, your next question is, how do you know they stopped everything?""Wit said China had attempted to bridge the gap in precondition positions between the U.S. and North Korea, but was unable to do so.""I think the key issue here is whether there is any signs of flexibility on the part of the United States,"" Wit said.The six-party talks have been stalled since late 2008.

South Korean leaders would then not want to be vulnerable to both nuclear-armed North Korea and Japan.”In the report, Ferguson also noted that Seoul could secure potential capabilities to produce dozens of nuclear warheads within five years, with “near-weapons-grade plutonium” from four pressurized heavy water reactors at its Wolseong power plant in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang province.The report came amid a lingering debate over South Korea’s “nuclear sovereignty” and its nonproliferation commitment. The debate remained intense until after Seoul signed a revised civilian atomic energy accord with Washington last month. Seoul officials said the accord paved the way for more efficient use of nuclear energy in South Korea.Despite the talk of South Korea’s possible nuclear armament, most experts said it remains unlikely that Seoul will pursue nuclear arms given that any damage to the current Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty would seriously strain ties with Washington and drive Seoul into diplomatic isolation. “For nuclear armament, a national leader should decide to break away from the NPT regime and should be ready to accept international criticism and isolation,” said a security expert, who requested anonymity.“South Korean leaders, politicians and officials are not and will not be willing to take that risk. Considering that the U.S. is pushing for its vision of a “nuclear-free” world, South Korea, a staunch ally of the U.S., will not make a decision that undermines that vision.”South Korea once pursued nuclear armament in the 1970s. Former President Park Chung-hee secretly pushed to develop nuclear weapons as security concerns rose, with Washington seeking to withdraw its troops from the Korean Peninsula.Concerns over the North’s nuclear threats have been escalating as the communist state continues to improve its nuclear weapons capabilities including its technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads to mount on long-range missiles. Amid Pyongyang’s technological advancement, no talks over Pyongyang’s denuclearization have been held since December 2008, which has further deepened security jitters surrounding the North’s nuclear adventurism.Some observers presume that in the case of the U.S. being unable to stably provide “extended deterrence,” Seoul may have to pursue nuclear armament for its national survival. Extended deterrence refers to the U.S. commitment to defend the South against the North’s conventional and nuclear threats.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","debate over south korea nuclear ,seoul will pursue nuclear arms ,south korea possible nuclear armament ,possible nuclear armament most experts ,korea once pursued nuclear armament","['South Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Charles Ferguson', 'the Federation of American Scientists', 'Japan', 'North ’s', 'the United States', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Ferguson', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Ferguson', 'Seoul', 'Wolseong', 'Gyeongju', 'North Gyeongsang', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Treaty', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'NPT', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Washington', 'North ’s', 'amid Pyongyang ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 4.          1.          0.         ... -0.4566063   0.43525881

""One plausible purpose of this signaling of these initial 'diplomatic' bombs would be to prod Washington as well as Beijing to engage seriously on the denuclearization of North Korea,"" the report said.South Korea could then leverage its base of a handful of nuclear bombs and implement its potential to make dozens of nuclear warheads annually from near-weapons-grade plutonium produced from its four PHWRs, he said.""The initial steps could take place conceivably within a five-year period,"" he said.Ferguson also claimed that the HANARO research reactor at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute in the central city of Daejeon could also be used to produce up to 11 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium annually if operated at full power.The scientist cautioned, however, that his intention is not to argue for South Korea's acquisition of nuclear bombs, adding that the best option for South Korea and Japan at the moment is for the U.S. to continue to demonstrate its resolve to provide conventional and nuclear extended deterrence.

Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV cited a Russian defense expert, reporting that the North floated a proposal to purchase four sets of Russia’s S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile systems during a visit by Hyon Yong-chol, minister of the People’s Armed Forces, to Moscow last month to take part in an international security conference. The fully-automated equipment was first deployed by the former Soviet Union in the late 1970s to defend its airspace, military bases and industrial and administrative facilities against aircraft and cruise missiles. But Moscow declined Pyongyang’s offer of barter in favor of cash, and indicated that it could upset the “strategic balance” in the region and thus needs the consent of China and other neighbors, the expert was quoted as saying.  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (third from right) speaks with officials during his visit to a newly built satellite control and command center. (Yonhap)The report came shortly after the Kremlin announced that the Kim regime had delivered via diplomatic channels his decision to back out of what would have been his first overseas trip since taking power in December 2011, citing “domestic affairs.” The trip was chiefly designed to attend a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II on May 9 and on its sidelines to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Beijing has apparently leaned toward lingering uncertainties until the last minute, some Seoul officials also raised the possibility that the young ruler had indeed planned to go but did an about-face after certain demands were not met. Meanwhile, Kim has inspected a new satellite control and command in charge of rocket launches, calling space development a “critical task” for the people and vowing to carry on the project, the North’s official media reported Sunday. Run by the National Aerospace Development Administration, the 13,770-square-meter facility is responsible for satellite launches and consists of chambers to show the entire launch process in real time, a control room, observatory, e-library and other spaces. “Peaceful space development is an option taken by our party and people and a legitimate right of Songun (military first) Korea,” Kim said. “The status of (North Korea) as a satellite producer-launcher remains unchanged though the hostile forces deny it and its space development can never be abandoned, no matter who may oppose.”The communist country has fired five long-range missiles since 1998 and successfully put a satellite into orbit in the fifth round in December 2012, prompting the U.N. Security Council to impose a series of stifling sanctions.

Reza Moridi, head of Ontario's Ministry of Research and Innovation, said South Korea has made ""landmark technological achievements"" since importing four Candu reactors from Canada four decades ago and is getting ready to team up with Canadian partners to tap into the global market. ""Korea has played a strong role in the development of nuclear science and technology. I am encouraging Korea and the Ontario Candu energy sector to work together in terms of new reactors and services, as well as various other nuclear technologies in the world,"" Moridi said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency. Moridi was in Seoul to attend the Korea Atomic Power Annual Conference and to meet with Korean government and company officials to discuss ways to forge closer ties with the energy sector in his jurisdiction.  South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply, and plans to build 11 more by 2024. Among them, four are Candu 6 units imported from Canada, which are pressurized heavy water reactors used for generating electric power. The four are located in Wolsong, a major nuclear hub located on the southeastern coast.South Korea is the largest operator of Candu plants outside its home and ""among the top performers in the world,"" he said. Moridi expressed hope that the bilateral free trade deal, which took effect in January, will boost economic ties in the nuclear and renewable energy sector, noting nuclear reactor technology and uranium were among the top 10 goods Ontario exported to South Korea last year.The recently revised 1974 nuclear energy cooperation pact with the United States that now allows South Korea to reprocess spent fuel and enrich uranium will provide more opportunities for Canada's nuclear industry to work with Korean partners to develop spent fuel technology, the reutilization process and future nuclear energy systems.  ""Korea would be an ideal market in which to use recycled uranium in its Candu fleet, thereby opening new opportunities for cooperation,"" he said. ""We look forward to the opportunity to discuss mutual priorities and share best practices for our nuclear sectors.""Although there are lingering safety concerns in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011, the Canadian official said nuclear energy is still a safer and more environment-friendly option compared with traditional power plants, noting it is important to raise public awareness of the benefits of nuclear energy.""Nuclear reactors and power stations are heavily regulated in such countries as Korea, the United States and Canada. In that sense, it's very safe,"" he said. ""There's no risk-free activity, but when you compare all these things, nuclear energy is a good way to produce electricity.""

Abe arrived in the U.S. Sunday for a weeklong visit. (AP-Yonhap)“Fettered by the past, Seoul has seen Japan-related issues through the lens of historical experience. But it also needs to treat them from the standpoints of security and economics, meaning it needs a restrained and balanced approach.”The efforts to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance are expected to culminate in the revision of the allies’ defense cooperation guidelines and their agreement on a major Pacific free trade pact, which they are set to finalize during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’ trip to the U.S. this week.Washington and Tokyo’s focus on a “forward-looking” policy is expected to raise pressure on Seoul to do more to enhance the frayed ties with Tokyo ― particularly when a nuclear-ambitious North Korea remains a grave security challenge for all three nations.Upgraded U.S.-Japan allianceWith their shared strategic goal of maintaining the current regional order that is being reshaped by the rise of China, Washington and Tokyo have been striving to upgrade their long-standing alliance.The revision of the allies’ 1997 defense guidelines and the bilateral agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ― an envisioned free trade deal linking 12 Pacific-rim states ― will be the climax of their efforts to deepen and broaden the alliance, observers say.“The U.S. and Japan are now working on removing a set of elements that hinder the evolvement of their alliance so that they can further tighten their ties to better cope with emerging challenges including those from China,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.The revision of the guidelines scheduled for Monday is likely to broaden Japan’s security role, which has been limited under the war-renouncing Article 9 of the Constitution ― a change that the U.S. has long encouraged over the last few decades.With the revision, the U.S.-Japan alliance is to be elevated to the level of the South Korea-U.S. alliance as both Asian allies will be able to come to the defense of the U.S. should it be under attack. “This (Washington’s call for Tokyo’s expanded security role) has been a consistent and nonpartisan push by the U.S. government ― which is very rare ―, and carried on throughout the George W. Bush administration, and now the Obama administration,” said Balbina Hwang, former State Department adviser and diplomacy expert at American University.“Prime Minister Abe is building on this desire and utilizing it for his own nationalist agenda, which is to strengthen his country, raise Japan’s profile and become a more ‘normal’ country.”The revision to the guidelines has been made when the need arose to reflect new security challenges facing the alliance. First adopted in 1978 to counter Soviet threats, the guidelines were last amended in 1997 to reflect post-Cold War security threats.According to Japanese media reports, the revised guidelines are to stipulate that the U.S. and Japan would collectively defend the set of disputed islands in the East China Sea, which is called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, should China attack the islands.The revision is also reported to specify the allies’ security roles ― the defense of the Japanese mainland for Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and the counterstrike on enemy territory for U.S. troops.To legally justify Japan’s expanded security role, namely collective self-defense ― the use of force to help its ally under attack, Tokyo altered its constitutional interpretation last July rather than pursuing the tougher process of rewriting the 1947 pacifist constitution.It is also pushing to overhaul its local security laws to enable Japan to provide rear-area military support to the U.S. not only in the areas surrounding Japan, but also in the entire world ― a move that a financially-strained Washington welcomes. “With Japan’s Self-Defense Forces exercising the right to collective defense and its alliance with the U.S. being globalized, Japanese troops can be dispatched to the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere in the world as per the U.S. requests,” said Kim Soung-chul, senior fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute.“As Abe is doing what the U.S. wants security-wise, the Japanese leader has apparently been perceived as a good partner for Washington.”On the economic front, the U.S. and Japan are expected to reach a broad agreement over the TPP during the summit between U.S. President Barack Obama and Abe, which is scheduled to take place in Washington on Tuesday.The agreement over the 12-nation free-trade deal that would cover a third of the world’s trade is to further enhance the bilateral relationship and help advance Obama’s core economic policy agenda. The U.S. has been leading the negotiations over the TPP, which analysts say can help counter China’s growing economic clout. Due to high standards on intellectual property, labor rights and the environment, China has been effectively excluded from the TPP negotiations ― a reason why Beijing has pushed for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a mooted free-trade deal involving 16 nations including South Korea, China and Japan.Strategic dilemma for Seoul The enhanced U.S.-Japan alliance is likely to escalate pressure on Seoul to improve ties with Tokyo and the trilateral security cooperation that Washington has pushed for as a centerpiece of its rebalance to the region. “As the U.S. and Japan are firming up their alliance, they seek to jointly keep China, Russia and North Korea in check, and for this, Washington regards Tokyo as a very important partner,” said Kim of the Sejong Institute.“As South Korea has been seeking to tighten relations with China, there might be some public opinion in the U.S. that the U.S.-Japan alliance is strategically more invaluable than the Korea-U.S. alliance.”Although the leaders of South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly highlighted the strength and depth of their evolving alliance, signs of friction in the relationship have apparently been emerging, some analysts noted.“The U.S. has agreed to a conditions-based transfer of wartime operational control, floated the idea of stationing an advanced missile defense asset here in Korea, and asked Seoul to separately deal with history and other practical issues,” said a security expert, declining to be identified.“But Seoul appears not to have responded to that positively. So, there could be some complaints from the U.S. brewing below the surface.”Well aware of the need for the enhanced security cooperation with Japan and the U.S., Seoul has reiterated that it would take a “two-track” approach under which it would stick to its stern stance over history, but keep cooperative ties with Tokyo in the economic and security realms.However, the public sentiment has always gotten in the way. Anti-Japanese sentiment has been deteriorating as Tokyo has been seen attempting to whitewash or gloss over its wartime wrongdoings and stepping up sovereignty claims to Dokdo. Some senior U.S. officials have pointed to the need for Seoul to adopt a forward-looking stance to focus on the future rather than on the past. But their efforts to foster reconciliation between the U.S. allies have been met with a strong backlash here. Critics argue the U.S. officials suggested Seoul was also to blame for strained ties with Tokyo.Hwang of American University said that historical events should be remembered and taught, but policy focus should be on the danger in the future, not the past, and what countries can do to ensure a better future.“If Japan, Korea and China insist on focusing primarily on the problems of history, then the future will be just as grim as the past,” she said.“The U.S. should also not blindly pursue trilateral security (U.S.-Japan-South Korea) without acknowledging that history issues are real and important for Asians,” she added. Tokyo’s recent moves to enhance ties with Beijing have also underscored the need for Seoul to employ a more proactive strategy to maximize its diplomatic interests in the volatile geopolitics of Northeast Asia.Abe and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a summit on the sidelines of the Asian African Summit, in Bandung, Indonesia, last Wednesday. Signaling a thaw, they shared the view that the two sides should be partners for each other, not a potential threat.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","strategic dilemma for seoul ,korea remains grave security challenge ,strategic dilemma for south korea ,strategic dilemma for seoul the ,japan strategic dilemma for seoul","['South Korea', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Korea', 'sino - Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Lee Won - deog', 'Kookmin University', 'U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Kerry ’s', 'Boston', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'AP - yonhap)“fettere', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'japanese', ""Shinzo Abe '"", 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'asian', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Balbina Hwang', 'State Department', 'American University', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'soviet', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Senkaku', 'Japan', 'China', 'China', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Self - Defense Forces', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Japan', 'Self - Defense Forces', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'Kim Soung - chul', 'Sejong Institute', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'TPP', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Abe', 'Washington', 'Obama ’s', 'U.S.', 'TPP', 'China', 'China', 'TPP', 'Beijing', 'the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Kim', 'the Sejong Institute', 'South Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'anti - japanese', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'American University', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.-Japan - South Korea', 'Asians', 'Tokyo', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Abe', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Bandung', 'Indonesia', 'Song Sang - ho']",11,"[ 5.         10.          0.         ... -0.78845185  0.30608582

During the recent four rounds of testing, the system successfully hit targets, ADD officials said, noting the development project has proceeded well.The ADD will test-fire six additional rockets by August and expects the new system will be deployed to the country’s northwestern frontline islands such as Baengnyeongdo and Yeonpyeongdo as early as next year. “There will not be any blind spots in our security for the border islands after we deploy the new system there,” said an ADD official, declining to be named. “This system is seen as a core weapons system to target the fast-moving targets that are headed for South Korean territory.”The 1.9 meter-long system, with a range of up to 8 kilometers, consists of a flying controller, infrared-ray seeker, a launching vehicle, a target acquisition and designation system, and other parts. It is the first time in the world that a rocket its size has been equipped with an infrared-ray seeker, the ADD said.When a hostile hovercraft is caught moving toward the border islands, the target finder of the launching vehicle will identify the hovercraft and supply target information to the guided rocket, which will then hit the hovercraft.The rocket system can detect multiple targets at the same time and incapacitate them some 20 seconds after launch, officials explained.North Korea is believed to have built a large-scale base, which houses some 70 hovercrafts, in Goampo, South Hwanghae Province in 2012. Its infiltration threats have recently increased as Pyongyang carried out military drills aimed at infiltrating South Korean territory.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","test fire six additional rockets ,six additional rockets by august ,new guided rocket system will ,additional rockets by august ,fire six additional rockets by","['South Korea ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'Agency for Defense Development', 'Baengnyeongdo', 'Yeonpyeongdo', 'south korean', 'ADD', 'North Korea', 'Goampo', 'South Hwanghae Province', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5928762   0.25926292

Smart grid technology is designed to increase power system efficiency. President Park Geun-hye (left) shakes hands with her Brazilian counterpart, Dilma Rousseff, before their summit in Brasilia on Friday. (Yonhap) The summit -- the first between the two leaders -- came as South Korea is pushing to secure greater access to South America's biggest economy.South Korean officials hail South and Central America as a continent of opportunities that could give a much-needed boost to Asia's fourth-largest economy.Rousseff said Brazil and South Korea also agreed to cooperate in renewable energy to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that scientists blame for global warming.South Korea has been seeking to go green by slashing carbon emissions, switching to renewable energy sources and ending its heavy reliance on fossil fuels.South Korea and Brazil signed a set of memorandums of understanding (MOU) calling for cooperation in a broader range of areas, including telemedicine and job training. Park and Rousseffobserved the signing of some of the MOUs following their summit.South Korea said it expects its young skilled professionals to make inroads into Brazil's manufacturing and information and technology sectors through the exchange of skilled workers.The move comes four months before Sao Paulo hosts the WorldSkills competition, the world's largest professional education event held every two years.Separately, South Korea said it will set up a ""K-move center"" in Brazil to help young people get jobs in Central and South American countries. So far, South Korea has been running such centers in seven countries, including the United States and Japan.Park has recently challenged young South Koreans to seek jobs in foreign countries at a time when college graduates are struggling to find work at home.The unemployment rate for young people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 10.7 percent in March, down from 11.1 percent a month earlier, according to government data.A private MOU signed on the sidelines of the summit calls for bilateral cooperation in nurturing business startups of young, aspiring entrepreneurs.Samsung Electronics Co., the world's top smartphone maker, plans to invest about US$5 million over the next five years to support promising startups in Brazil.Also Friday, Park and Rousseff agreed to make efforts for the denuclearization of North Korea, though they did not offer any specific details. Brazil has diplomatic relations with South and North Korea.North Korea, which has conducted three nuclear tests, has repeatedly vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem in defiance of international pressure.After the summit, Park traveled to Sao Paulo where she met with hundreds of business leaders of the two countries. Park called for joint efforts between the two countries to revitalize trade. Bilateral trade between the countries stood at US$15.2 billion in 2013, up from $9 billion in 2009.She also voiced hope that South Korean companies can participate in building an airport, a high-speed railway and other infrastructure projects in Brazil (Yonhap).","startups in brazil also friday ,for global warming south korea ,support promising startups in brazil ,following their summit south korea ,brazil also friday park","['Park Geun', 'brazilian', 'Dilma Rousseff', 'Korea', 'Brazil', 'Rousseff', 'Brasilia', 'Smart', 'Park Geun - hye', 'brazilian', 'Dilma Rousseff', 'Brasilia', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Rousseff', 'Brazil', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'MOU', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'Sao Paulo', 'WorldSkills', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'Park', 'South Koreans', 'MOU', 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Brazil', 'Park', 'Rousseff', 'North Korea', 'Brazil', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Sao Paulo', 'south korean', 'Brazil', 'Yonhap']",13,"[ 7.          0.          0.         ... -0.50809556  0.24057145

The new agreement still bans Seoul from reprocessing and enrichment, but it opens the way for the Asian ally to begin research into a new technology for spent nuclear fuel recycling, known as ""pyroprocessing,"" and to make low-level enriched uranium with U.S. consent.""All kinds of factors will be looked at. What does the international market in enrichment services look like? Is it well supplied? Is it a buyer's market? What are the costs of enriched uranium over time?"" said Robert Einhorn, former special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control at the U.S. State Department.""All of these factors will be taken into account in evaluating whether indigenous enrichment is a good option for the ROK or not. This will take a number of years,"" he said during a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace discussion.Einhorn led negotiations for the pact's revision for more than two years until May 2013.Some critics have raised worries about possible implications the new agreement will have on the negotiations aimed at ending the North's nuclear program, but Einhorn and other experts dismissed such concerns.""I don't think this agreement will have very much impact on prospects for success for negotiations with North Korea. I think the main impediment now is North Korea's determination to pursue a dual-track approach of improving economic development at the same time improving its nuclear deterrent,"" Einhorn said.""There's nothing in this agreement that in any way precludes going forward with denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" he said. Victor Cha, chief Korea analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also said the new agreement still ""keeps South Korea's obligations intact"" with regard to the 1991 inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.Scott Snyder, a senior researcher on Korea at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the new deal allowing Seoul to peacefully use nuclear energy highlights the ""consequences"" of North Korea's decision to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

(AP-Yonhap)""We always stress that it's important to address history questions in honest, constructive and forthright manner that promotes healing but also in a way that reaches a final resolution,"" Medeiros said during a conference call with reporters.""We are very supportive of diplomatic efforts between Japan and the ROK to improve their relationship. We think all sides should address history issues from that perspective of being constructive and focusing on the future and final resolutions.""Abe is set to arrive in the U.S. on Sunday for a weeklong trip that includes summit talks with President Barack Obama and an address to a joint session of Congress, the first Japanese prime minister to do so.Critics have said Abe is unworthy of the privilege because he has attempted to whitewash Japan's militaristic past and wartime atrocities, especially the sexual enslavement of women during World War II, refusing to acknowledge the country's responsibility and compensate victims.In the run-up to the visit, calls have been mounting in the U.S. for him to use the visit as a chance to improve relations with South Korea, including a bipartisan group of 25 congressmen sending a joint letter urging Abe to address history issues.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have been badly strained for years, due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation. Abe's trip is seen as a bellwether of the ties amid widespread views that the relations are unlikely to improve unless he offers a sincere apology.Frayed relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation, seen as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" initiative aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.""We believe that a better, closer, more constructive relationship between Japan and the ROK contributes to peace and security in Northeast Asia,"" Medeiros said. ""That approach ... should be one that is honest and forthright and focus on the future.""Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the U.S. has encouraged Abe to constructively address historical issues ""consistent with Japan's past statements,"" apparently referring to previous statements of apology, such as the Kono and Murayama statements that have served as the basis for Seoul's relations with Tokyo.

The North has threatened to collect arrears charges if the Seoul firms pass the Friday deadline for the wage payment.The unification ministry called on North Korea to return to the dialogue if it wants to deal with this issue.""If North Korea hopes to hike wages, it should actively come back to the negotiating table for consultations through the quasi-state committees and stop pressing South Koreans companies into paying wages,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at Seoul's unification ministry, told a press briefing.Lim said that more than 10 South Korean companies have been found to pay the wage earlier this week, apparently due to the North's pressure.Seoul has not accepted the North's unilateral move, saying that Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set the wages together. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year. Seoul warned that violators would be penalized.Vice Unification Minister Hwang Boo-gi said Friday that Seoul plans to impose punitive actions on the companies that paid wages to North Korean workers despite the government's warning.""The government plans to take the necessary actions against those firms after closely reviewing why they violated the government's guidance,"" Hwang said during a meeting with officials from the local firms who operate factories in the industrial complex.He also called on the officials to join the government's efforts to tackle the wage dispute.The joint factory park opened in the early 2000s and is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.

With a US$40 billion fund, China has aggressively pushed the so-called ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative aimed at building ports, expressways, railways and other infrastructure with its neighboring countries. ""Ambassador Li introduced the concept and vision of 'One Belt, One Road' and hopes the two sides will work together to seize the opportunity to promote China-North Korea economic and trade cooperation,"" the statement said. Li said, ""Developing friendly and cooperative relations with North Korea is the unswerving policy of the party and the government of China. China is ready to work together with North Korea.""The statement did not say how the North Korean minister responded. Political ties between North Korea and China remain strained due to the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons, but China is the North's economic lifeline and diplomatic backer at the United Nations. Both North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to visit Moscow early next month to attend the May 9 celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the end of the World War in Europe. North Korea has made no comments on Kim's possible visit to Moscow. However, if Kim visits Moscow, it will be his first overseas trip since taking power in 2011.

Park and Bachelet observed the signing of some of the MOUs following the summit.South Korea said it expects about 180 young aspiring entrepreneurs in the information and technology field to make inroads into Chile over the next 10 years by taking advantage of the Start-up Chile program.The program, launched by the Chilean government in 2010, has made the South American country an attractive hub of innovative startups with its support package, including a fund worth $40,000 to applicants of a successful project.Each year, Chile selects about 240 projects out of 5,000 aspiring entrepreneurs from around the world.South Korea has been pushing to help its young aspiring entrepreneurs advance into foreign countries, though no one has entered the South and Central American markets hailed by Seoul as a continent of opportunities.South Korea and Chile also agreed to strengthen cooperation in health care, a move that Seoul says could help its companies export telemedicine and hospital information systems to the South American country.Telemedicine is designed to improve access to quality care for those in medically deprived areas by using information technology, mostly the Internet.Chile, slightly smaller than two times the size of the U.S. state Montana, is interested in telemedicine as it suffers from a shortage of doctors. Chile has 1.6 doctors per 1,000 people, compared with an average 3.2 for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 mostly rich nations.South Korea also said it has secured a foothold in renewable energy markets in Chile as the South American country has set the goal of providing 20 percent of its electricity through renewable sources by 2025, compared with 6 percent in 2012.Chile's renewable energy markets are expected to grow to a size worth US$5.2 billion by 2018.Separately, Park expressed hope that the two countries will cooperate in spreading renewable energy and developing smart grids during her meeting with business leaders of the two countries.Smart grid technology is designed to increase power system efficiency.Also Wednesday, South Korea's top music agency, SM Entertainment, showed a replay of the performance by boy band Super Junior in Japan last week on a 270-degree screen at a digital concert hall in Santiago.The move is part of Seoul's efforts to help further spread ""Hallyu,"" or the Korean wave.

The preliminary signing followed four years and seven months of grueling negotiations since their launch in October 2010. The ceremony was in Seoul and led by Park Ro-byug, Korea’s chief negotiator and ambassador for nuclear energy cooperation, and U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert.The revamped agreement, last amended in 1974, will expire in 20 years, but the two countries have installed options for additional modifications or an early closure. The existing deal was due to expire in March 2014 but extended by two years for further consultations. Korea’s chief negotiator Park Ro-byug (right) and U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert make a preliminary signing for the civilian atomic energy accord at the Foreign Ministry in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The text establishes a legal framework of conditions and controls to govern commercial atomic activities involving U.S.-origin materials or others used in U.S.-origin facilities. It has 21 articles and two separate agreed minutes, each on detailed implementation plans and a high-level joint panel to be set up to oversee the pact on a standing basis. With Korea’s newly defined foray into the global nuclear market as a reactor exporter, the previously one-sided deal has now become more “equal, reciprocal and mutually beneficial for both sides,” yet will minimize any risks of nuclear proliferation, the two countries say. “As the existing accord sealed 40 years ago had various components that needed to be improved, the new one contains various progress focusing on three main areas ― spent fuel management, a steady fuel supply and reactor export promotion,” Park said at a news conference after the ceremony. “While affirming the two countries’ ‘inalienable right’ to the peaceful research, production and use of nuclear energy as members of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the document stipulates that there ought not be any breach of sovereignty as they expand cooperation,” the government said in a statement. Lippert lauded the initial so-called 1-2-3 agreement as “one of the most sophisticated and dynamic peaceful nuclear cooperation” pacts the U.S. has ever negotiated. While Washington ensures a reliable supply of fuel for 24 reactors here, the allies will be able to pursue Korea’s enrichment of U.S.-origin uranium up to 20 percent if necessary, through the high-level commission. The panel is to be jointly headed by Seoul’s vice foreign minister and U.S. deputy energy secretary, and operate four working groups on the three major fields and nuclear security. The accord will also facilitate bilateral cooperation as Seoul explores ways to tackle the pressing issue of spent fuel management. An advisory panel consisting of municipal leaders, scholars and environmental activists has been established to look into various options in partnership with the government, including storage, disposal and reprocessing at home or overseas. The two countries are conducting a 10-year fuel cycle study to review a technology called pyroprocessing, which Korean experts have floated as a possible solution to handle Korea’s mounting spent fuel inventory, instead of traditional reprocessing capabilities that run against the longstanding U.S. nonproliferation drive. They will decide on the technique’s commercial feasibility and proliferation implication after the study is completed. The method is known to be less likely to be used for military purposes and thus less prone to proliferation because it leaves separated plutonium mixed with safer fissile materials. On the research front, Seoul also secured Washington’s long-term advance consent for such activities as post-irradiation examination and electroreduction, as well as for medical studies, using U.S.-origin spent fuel. Scientists here were previously required to seek U.S. approval on a regular basis, about which they had long grumbled due to delays in their work schedule and what they call bureaucratic hassle. “A research reactor currently being constructed in Busan will help the production of medical isotopes, which we have been importing entirely from other countries for a fortune because they have to be carried by aircraft given their short half-life,” a ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. “With the change, some 1.3 million cancer patients will get examinations more easily, the costs plummet from the current 20 million won ($18,500), and the door opens for us to export the isotopes when the generally old overseas reactors retire.” Long-term consent was also given for the retransfer of U.S.-origin fissile material and equipment to a third country that has nuclear agreements with both countries. The U.S. would speed up the authorization process for imports and exports. The deal also calls for greater exchanges of technology and information between the two countries’ industries to expedite joint exports of reactors. In 2009, Korea won a landmark contract to build four reactors in the United Arab Emirates in partnership with U.S.-based Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, becoming the sixth member of the high-barrier league following the U.S., France, Russia, Canada and Japan. Korea has since grown into the world’s sixth-largest atomic power generator and had no major accidents. Its maiden commercial domestic operation began in 1978. Its 24 reactors churned out nearly 22,000 megawatts of electricity as of April 21, according to data by the International Atomic Energy Agency, accounting for about 35 percent of the total power needs. “The United States is pleased that (Korea) has become one of the leading nations in the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy,” Lippert said. “The terms of (the proposed agreement) would also strongly reaffirm the two governments’ shared commitment in nonproliferation and nuclear security as the cornerstone of their nuclear cooperation relationship and will thereby enhance the global nuclear nonproliferation regime.”For the text to come into force, it will undergo a review in Korea by the Ministry of Government Legislation, intra-agency vice-ministerial and Cabinet meetings and presidential authorization. In the U.S., it is subject to intra-agency and nonproliferation assessments before being delivered to the president for approval. After a formal signing by the two administrations, the accord will be sent to Congress for a 90-day review and, if it does not disapprove, take effect.

Teng Jianqun, a senior researcher at the state-run China Institute of International Studies, has also said the possible deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea has become a ""tough choice"" for how Seoul is balancing bilateral ties with Washington and Beijing. China's concerns over the possible deployment of the THAAD battery to South Korea have been known, but the warning by Teng took a more caustic and stark tone. ""The possible deployment of the U.S. THAAD system in South Korea will test relationships among China, South Korea, the United States, or even Russia,"" Teng said in his English-language report dated April 1 and recently posted on the Chinese institute's website. ""It is not simply a military project for the sake of South Korean and U.S. security,"" Teng said. ""If necessary, China will take some solid measures to counter the power of the U.S. missile defense program, including updating and increasing the number of its conventional and nuclear warheads."" To better cope with the growing threats of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities, both South Korean and U.S. officials have indicated the need for the THAAD battery. Arguing that the U.S. missile-defense system could also target China, Beijing has publicly pressed Seoul not to accept the THAAD battery. In return, South Korea's defense ministry has blamed China for trying to ""influence"" Seoul's security policy.Last October, South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo told lawmakers that deploying a THAAD battery at a U.S. military base in South Korea would help defend against North Korea's missile and nuclear threats. South Korea is home to about 28,500 American troops. ""South Korea used to be very cautious toward the U.S. proposal but today has become more flexible to the possibility in consideration of geopolitics, the economy and the security relationship,"" Teng said. ""Sandwiched between the two major powers in this region, South Korea has to make a tough choice over the deployment of THAAD in the near future,"" the Chinese scholar said. South Korea and the U.S. have called for China, the economic lifeline of North Korea, to do more in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but China's stance over its ideological ally, Pyongyang, has often been self-contradictory. Many analysts believe that China's ruling Communist Party leadership won't put enough pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions because a sudden collapse of the North's regime could threaten China's own security interests. (Yonhap)","nuclear warheads to better cope ,threats of north korea nuclear ,china could increase its nuclear ,korea missile and nuclear threats ,nuclear ambitions because sudden collapse","['China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Teng Jianqun', 'China Institute of International Studies', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Teng', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'Teng', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Teng', 'China', 'U.S.', ""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', ""South Korea 's"", 'China', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'american', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Teng', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Communist Party', 'North Korea', 'China']",19,"[11.         10.          1.         ... -0.604514    0.51949012

The wage cap has been set at 5 percent per year. Seoul warned that violators would be penalized.Despite Seoul's warning, three unidentified South Korean firms paid the wages on Monday, the original deadline, and signed documents that guaranteed their duty to pay arrears.An official at Seoul's unification ministry said that it has asked the North to delay the deadline through quasi-government committees.""The government made a written request to the North over the deadline extension,"" said an official, asking not to be named. ""We have not yet received a response from the North.""After making a one-day visit to the industrial park, officials from the Seoul firms said Monday that Pyongyang decided to extend the deadline by a week for the March wage payment.It is not immediately known whether or how long the North will officially delay it.Meanwhile, Seoul's unification ministry said Tuesday it is first looking into why the three firms paid the wages before deciding whether to impose punitive actions against them.""The three firms followed the government's guidance that they should stick to the current wage agreement,"" an official said, asking not to be named. ""But we think that it is problematic that North Korea required them to make pledges to pay arrears later.""The North has threatened to collect arrears from the South Korean firms if they do not pay the higher wages.South Korea is concerned that the wage row could set a precedent for the North to make unilateral decisions on the operation of the industrial park.The Gaeseong Industrial Complex opened in the early 2000s and is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.

The quota requires companies to hire five Koreans full-time and have a yearly fiscal revenue greater than 60 million won to hire a foreign employee.“He has been very reactive on that subject, and he has really promised us (foreign business representatives) that he will tackle the issue this year. He told us that this year the quota system will be erased,” Jalicon told The Korea Herald in an interview Friday. Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Yoon Sang-jick (Yonhap)Yoon made the comment during a breakfast meeting in February with ministers and foreign business leaders, said Jalicon, adding that he had been pushing the issue for at least five years before the minister addressed it. According to Jalicon, Yoon stressed that the quota was in place to protect Korean jobs, but acknowledged that Korea’s laws were not keeping up with its fast economic development. Jalicon said a Ministry of Justice official, also present at the meeting, agreed on the need to change the policy.  “They all know their system is not good. There is discrimination, clearly. It’s discriminant and inconsistent,” Jalicon said, adding that the treatment of foreign workers in Korea was also an issue of reciprocity with how other countries treat Korean employees. A Trade Ministry spokesperson confirmed that Yoon and Jalicon had never met one-on-one but the question may have been raised at an informal meeting. He added that Yoon may have pledged to address the visa issue, but did not promise concrete steps to deal with it. The Ministry of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.The foreign worker quota and related restrictions in issuing the E-7 special occupation visa are cited by businesses as a stumbling block for expansion. Foreign employees who do not have permanent resident status, Korean ethnicity, a Korean spouse or a corporate investment in Korea generally require an E-type visa. More than 18,000 E-7 visas were issued last year.The Ministry of Justice imposed the quota in 2011 after immigration officials discovered lax labor laws were being “abused” by brokers overseas, according to an official at the Seoul Global Center, a foreign resident assistance agency run by Seoul City. The brokers were allegedly issuing work visas for people to come to Korea to search for factory jobs, with the government “losing control” of the situation, he said. The law requires companies to employ five Korean workers for every E-7 visa holder, with exceptions for specialized professions or those with a specific recommendation by certain government agencies. Meanwhile, the minimum investment requirement for a foreigner to start a company was doubled in 2011 from 50 million won to 100 million won. The requirement was again raised in 2013 to 300 million won for sole proprietor companies, while remaining at 100 million won for corporate investments.Jalicon said it was important to support businesses with foreign investment, which would hire more Korean workers as they expanded, and that the foreign worker quota was hindering direct foreign investment. “I told (Yoon), ‘You can ask us every day to bring more foreign direct investment into Korea.’ People follow the money,” he said. “As a practical man, he said, ‘OK, you’re right on this. We cannot have a double attitude. We should all go in the same direction.’ So I really hope it will change.”Bae Ji-sook contributed to this article. ― Ed.By Elaine Ramirez (elaine@heraldcorp.com)","companies to hire five koreans ,hire more korean workers ,hire five koreans full time ,korean workers for every visa ,other countries treat korean employees","['south korean', 'Korea', 'french - Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'David - Pierre Jalicon', 'Trade , Industry and Energy', 'Yoon Sang - jick', 'Koreans', 'Jalicon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Yoon Sang - jick', 'Jalicon', 'Jalicon', 'Yoon', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Jalicon', 'Ministry of Justice', 'Jalicon', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Trade Ministry', 'Jalicon', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'Seoul City', 'Korea', 'korean', 'jalicon', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Ed', 'Elaine Ramirez']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39535698  0.64921594

The move comes as Seoul and Washington are to wrap up a months-long joint military exercise on Friday, which the North has claimed is a rehearsal for an invasion of the North.On April 3, North Korea test-fired short-range missiles presumed to be KN-02 ground-to-ship missiles into the Yellow Sea following the test-firing of a single projectile the day prior.The North is known to have designated a no-fly and no-sail zone in the East Sea earlier this month, a sign of an immediate missile launch.In a report to the National Assembly, the ministry said it will closely watch movement in the North on April 25, the country's military foundation day, noting that North Korea seems to have raised its guard after Seoul activists resumed the launch of anti-Pyongyang leaflets to the North.""It seemed that North Korea has increased military exercises involving artillery and guns at areas near where Seoul activists fly balloons carrying such leaflets,"" the report showed.Leading activists have recently resumed a cross-border campaign to launch leaflets and DVDs of the U.S. movie ""The Interview,"" a comedy about a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The defense ministry said that the North has raised its combat readiness by deploying a patrol ship and other artillery in waters off its northwest coast, raising concerns of a possible accidental military clash between the two Koreas.The two Koreas fought bloody battles in 1999, 2002 and 2009 near the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea, the de-facto inter-Korean maritime border. Pyongyang does not acknowledge the border, which was drawn unilaterally by the U.S.-led United Nations Command when the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a ceasefire.

The talks are set to be held on Monday.South Korea said a planned rollout ceremony for the first basic trainer ,which would be assembled in Peru in cooperation with the Korea Aerospace Industries, could help Seoul’s push to export FA-50 fighter jets to Peru.The ceremony is to be held on the sidelines of Park’s visit.South Korean officials said that they hope Park’s visit will help open the path of mutual growth between the two countries, citing Peru’s push to embrace South Korea’s economic and social development strategy for its own national development.Peru is the second stop on Park’s four-nation swing to South America. Park’s trip will also take her to Chile and Brazil where bilateral economic and trade cooperation is expected to be high on her agenda.Prior to landing in Peru, Park met with her Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, in Bogota on Friday and called for a quick ratification of a bilateral free trade agreement the two countries signed in February 2013. South Korea has already ratified the FTA with Colombia but Bogota has yet to ratify it.Park met with Colombian veterans of the Korean War on Saturday to illustrate Seoul’s appreciation for the sacrifice Colombia made to help defend South Korea.Colombia was the only nation from Central and South America to fight alongside South Korea against Chinese-backed North Korean forces. About 5,100 troops were dispatched halfway around the world to help fight the North’s invasion, of which 213 were killed and 448 wounded. About 1,000 veterans are believed to still be alive.“Once again, I deeply appreciate your sacrifices and courage,” Park in a meeting with about 180 surviving veterans and family members of the war dead at a hotel. High-profile participants included Francisco M. Caicedo, an 85-year-old veteran, who met Park in 1975 when he was invited to Seoul. At that time, Park served as a stand-in first lady because her mother had been killed in a failed assassination attempt on her father, then President Park Chung-hee.Also Saturday, Park met with more than a dozen people from the Korean community.From news reports","lima on saturday for talks ,on saturday to illustrate seoul ,santos in bogota on friday ,the korean war on saturday ,war on saturday to illustrate","['Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Peru', 'south american', 'Park', 'Lima', 'peruvian', 'Ollanta Humala', 'South Korea', 'Peru', 'the Korea Aerospace Industries', 'Seoul', 'Peru', 'south korean', 'Peru', 'South Korea ’s', 'Peru', 'Park ’s', 'Chile', 'Brazil', 'Peru', 'Park', 'colombian', 'Juan Manuel Santos', 'Bogota', 'South Korea', 'FTA', 'Colombia', 'Bogota', 'colombian', 'Seoul', 'Colombia', 'South Korea', 'Colombia', 'Central and South America', 'South Korea', 'Chinese', 'north korean', 'Francisco M.

Naoko Ishii, the president of the Global Environment Facility, which funds projects to improve the global environment, said the challenge was to sustain growth without compromising environment preservation. The GEF unites 183 countries with international institutions, civic groups and companies to plan and enforce sustainable development. Since 1991, the organization has provided $13.5 billion in grants and leveraged $65 billion toward 3,900 projects in 165 countries to protect groundwater. “Our industrial activities for the last two centuries have eaten away at the earth’s carrying capacity in climate, water, forest and land,” Ishii told The Korea Herald ahead of her participation in the World Water Forum 2015 in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. “People finally understand that they have reached a tipping point in some of these systems.”Climate change has aggravated the distribution of water across the world, disproportionately affecting poorer countries, which generally receive low rainfall. According to research, 3.5 billion people worldwide do not have access to clean water, and 2 billion are dependent on groundwater.  Global Environment Facility president Naoko Ishii. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Groundwater extraction has increased threefold over the last 50 years, with freshwater reserves drying up in large parts of China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Most urban aquifers suffer from sanitation problems, while coastal aquifers face saline water intrusion. Reservoirs worldwide are contaminated by pollutants, pesticides and fertilizers. Water management and urban development can be integrated for sustainable development, Ishii explained, adding that cities should be responsible for the large share of energy they consume to feed urbanization and globalization. The GEF took part in the ICLEI World Congress 2015 in Seoul to advise mayors on sustainable policies for planning and administration. The Seoul Declaration produced by the congress includes action targets for efficient water use in cities, enabled by resource efficiency, environmentally friendly transport, smart grids and biodiversity and resilience toward climate change. Mayors stressed the importance of local initiatives to drive national and international efforts. This year is full of international conventions that address the climate change, Ishii emphasized: the United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai in March; the International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July; the U.N. Summit for the post-2015 development agenda in New York in September; and the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris in December.The former Japanese Deputy Vice Minister of Finance said that issues cut across fields including the environment, human rights, institutional governance, scientific management and public hygiene.The world’s growing population puts increasing strain on water, fueled by middle class consumption. Managing water has spillover effects on trade and energy, transport and infrastructure, construction and development, and agriculture and food, Ishii pointed out. But as no official inter-governmental organization currently exists to deal with these issues, people in different fields must collaborate through venues such as the WWF, she said. Ishii shed light on the Danube river basin, which has been plagued by the “tragedy of the commons,” where individual interests exhaust common resources. Through 15 years of work, the GEF brought different governments, communities, scientists and civic groups together, turning the region into a model of successful river basin management.“We have added to the ‘global commons’ by eliciting collective and coordinated actions among stakeholders,” Ishii pointed out. “It was a tedious process which consumed a lot of scientific, political and institutional energy, but all participants learned that their needs would be better met when they work together.”More importantly, the project eliminated long distrust in the region, laying the ground for stability and prosperity.As a middle-power nation, the Korean government should bridge the environmentally-conscious developed world and energy-consumptive developing world through “water diplomacy,” Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press release. Korea should set the global agenda, facilitate partnership between developed and developing nations and provide assistance to developing countries. The document also stressed implementing the ministerial declaration produced from the forum; combining water management and information communication technology policies; and exporting Korean technology overseas.

""They had not made any agreements or improvements.""The two Koreas have been in dispute since the North unilaterally decided in February to raise wages by 5.18 percent to $74 per month starting in March for about 53,000 North Korean workers hired by South Korean firms at the Kaesong Industrial Complex in the North's border city of the same name. None of the 124 South Korean firms have paid March wages to North Korean workers yet.The meeting was the second contact between the South and North authorities since their first fruitless meeting on April 7. The deadline for the March wage payment is due on Monday.The ministry said the government will keep holding quasi-government level talks and encourage North Korea to come to the government-level table to discuss the issue.Due to the stalled talks, South Korean firms in the joint industrial park in North Korea have been sandwiched between North Korea's unilateral pay hike and South Korea's refusal to honor it.North Korea has threatened to impose an arrears charge of 15 percent per month if South Korean companies do not pay the wages on time.The South Korean government would not accept the North's unilateral move, saying Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for two quasi-government committees from each side to set the wages together.

The talks are set to be held on Monday.South Korea said a planned rollout ceremony for the first basic trainer assembled in Peru in cooperation with the Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. could help Seoul's push to export FA-50 fighter jets to Peru.The ceremony is to be held on the sidelines of Park's visit.Under a 2012 deal, the sole South Korean aircraft manufacturer is helping Peru assemble 16 turbo-prop planes called the KT-1P for the Peruvian Air Force. Separately, KAI has already built and delivered four trainers to Peru.Park's visit came as KAI is competing with foreign rivals to win a contract worth about $1 billion for Peru's next generation light attack aircraft by offering its FA-50 supersonic jets.Park's ""state visit could raise the possibility that we could win a deal,"" KAI President Ha Sung-yong said in a brief comment to Yonhap News Agency in Lima.The FA-50 is a light attack variant of the T-50 Golden Eagle supersonic trainer that was co-developed by KAI and U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin. It is the most advanced variant of the T-50 family operated by the South Korean Air Force.The FA-50 has a radar warning receiver and a night vision imaging system, and is capable of carrying 4,500 kilograms of weapons. It also has a 20mm cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles.Last year, South Korea signed a US$420 million deal to export 12 FA-50 fighter jets built by KAI to the Philippines under a government-to-government deal.Also Sunday, Park visited Peru's oldest state museum as the first stop of her trip to Peru.Park took a brief tour of the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History of Peru. The museum -- once the home of revolutionary hero Jose de San Martin -- houses about 300,000 Incan and pre-Incan artifacts.She also met with about a dozen representatives of Peruvian fan clubs of ""Hallyu,"" or the Korean wave, a symbolic move that illustrated the growing popularity of Korean pop culture in the South American country.South Korean TV shows, films and pop music have gained immense popularity in Peru and other South American countries in recent years beyond China and Southeast Asian countries.The young Peruvians clapped their hands and greeted Park with ""annyeonghaseyo,"" which is ""hello"" in Korean, before giving her a stuffed llama doll and a silver brooch.Park's office said that more than 120 fan clubs are active in Peru and estimated that their members could be somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000.Later, Park had dinner with about 80 representatives from the Korean community in Peru and asked them to further promote Korean culture in Peru.Peru is the second stop on Park's four-nation swing to South America designed to boost economic ties with the region. Seoul officials hail the region as a continent of opportunities.Park's trip will also take her to Chile and Brazil, where bilateral economic and trade cooperation is expected to be high on her agenda.

A smart grid technology is designed to increase power system efficiency.South Korea also hopes that its companies can participate in building a subway system in Bogota and other infrastructure projects.

South Korean Deputy Defense Minister Yoo Jeh-seung and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretaries David Helvey and Elaine Bunn signed the bilateral agreement to launch the DSC tasked with developing the allies’ antimissile operational concept into a concrete operational plan.  North Korean missiles on trucks take part in a massive military parade to mark the 65th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party in Pyongyang on Oct. 10, 2010. (AP-Yonhap)“The allies have so far discussed how to respond to North Korea’s possible nuclear and missile attacks at a conceptual level,” said a Seoul official on condition of anonymity. “But we have decided to create an operational plan that involves concrete military procedures.”The official added that the operational plan would aim to strengthen the efficacy and capabilities of the U.S.’ extended deterrence by mobilizing its conventional strike capabilities as well as the nuclear umbrella. The launch of the allies’ new military panel came as concerns are rising that the North has secured considerable technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads to mount on long-range missiles such as the KN-08.At the DSC, the allies will focus on developing the so-called “4D” concept, the allies’ proactive defense concept. The 4D stands for “detect, defense, disrupt and destroy” ― the four major steps to handle Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile attacks. The “detect” represents the allies’ procedures to track North Korea’s missile movements with various intelligence-gathering assets, while the “defense” refers to a set of the allied defensive operations to minimize any damage from potential attacks.The “disrupt” means striking North Korea’s core missile facilities including supporting installations, while the “destroy” refers to the allies’ efforts to demolish the North’s mobile launchers, called TEL (transporter erector launcher), and incoming missiles. “Through the operation of the DSC, the allies will be able to effectively deter and respond to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, based on the 4D concept and the tailored deterrence strategy,” said Seoul’s Defense Ministry in a press release.“The DSC will also help enhance interoperability of the allied forces, and make it possible for the allies to more systematically utilize America’s capabilities ― both on the peninsula and outside it ― and South Korea’s Kill Chain and KAMD capabilities.”The Kill Chain and KAMD are Seoul’s preemptive strike system and Korea Air and Missile Defense system, both of which are under development.At the KIDD, the two sides also agreed to launch the Korea Defense Veterans Association, an organization of retired former U.S. Forces Korea troops, to honor their past contribution to peninsular defense and help strengthen the long-standing alliance.“After the end of the Korean War in 1953, some 3.5 million U.S. soldiers have worked in Korea,” said a Seoul official. “We expect the KDVA to play a crucial role to open the future of the Korea-U.S. alliance as they have contributed to the development of the alliance and combined defense system.”Launched in 2011, KIDD is a comprehensive defense meeting between the allies that integrates the four existing consultative meetings ― the Security Policy Initiative, Extended Deterrence Policy Committee, Strategic Alliance 2015 Working Group and Counter Missile Capability Committee.

In recent years, the U.S. has deployed a series of rotational units to Korea, including an 800-strong cavalry battalion and a fleet of 12 F-16 fighters, claiming they were better-trained, more agile forces that would enhance military preparedness and operational maneuverability.But some observers say that the rotational troops of the 28,500-strong U.S. Forces Korea might be more easily deployed to undertake a broader range of tasks across the region rather than focusing wholly on peninsular security, and that their understanding of Korea-specific issues could be superficial.“U.S. rebalancing strategy stipulates the need for realignment of the U.S. forces deployed on the Korean Peninsula, which would be gradually reconfigured toward supporting regional or even global missions rather than addressing traditional static peninsular defense,” said Michael Raska, research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, affiliated with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Korean and U.S. soldiers participate in amphibious operations in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, as part of the annual joint military exercise on March 30. (Yonhap)After the prolonged warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. has pushed to realign its troops across the globe in line with its efforts to reduce ground troops and increase the strategic flexibility of its forces. The rotational deployment is one of the methods to back its troop realignment amid cuts in defense spending.This summer, the U.S. will dispatch a new brigade combat team comprising some 4,600 soldiers from 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, to Camp Casey in Dongducheon, north of Seoul, on a nine-month rotational basis. The new unit is to replace the deactivating unit, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, which has served here for some 50 years. The deactivation, slated for June, comes as the U.S. Army seeks to reduce the number of combat brigade teams to 32 from 45.The U.S. also plans to deploy the Multiple Launch Rocket System battalion to join the 210th Field Artillery Brigade in Camp Casey in June on a nine-month rotational basis. The battalion consists of some 400 troops from the 2nd Battalion, 20th Field Artillery.Last year, the U.S. also rotationally deployed a dozen F-16 fighter jets with 300 troops to Osan or Gunsan air bases, and an 800-strong cavalry unit to Camp Hovey in Dongducheon and Camp Stanley in Uijeongbu, north of Seoul. In 2013, the U.S. deployed an attack reconnaissance helicopter unit including 30 OH-58D Kiowa Warriors and 380 troops on a rotational basis.U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter cast the rotational deployment of his troops here as an effective system in terms of maintaining readiness.“You can’t afford to have a situation where people are coming in and they don’t know the situation and they’re coming in dribs and drabs and being trained up as they go, and that has historically been the case for the Army on the Korean Peninsula ― unaccompanied tours, short, people would come in and get trained up,” he said during a meeting with U.S. Forces in Korea last week.“So, I think from a point of view of readiness, which is at a high premium here on the peninsula, it is better.”Some critics said that the rotational forces could be less skillful in handling Korea-specific issues as they would be deployed here for only six to nine months and move out to other operational areas. They also pointed out that the expeditionary troops would have less time to forge a rapport with South Korean forces, a critical element of the alliance.“As they come here for a shorter period of time and then move between different operational theaters, they may have less time to get used to Korean security issues,” said a security expert, who requested anonymity.“There may also be some issues regarding their skillfulness and experience, even though they may be nimbler and better in responding to various types of security challenges in the region and beyond. There could also be a transitional period ― when troops are rotated in groups ― which could affect combat readiness.”But some U.S. military experts say that in terms of readiness and troop cohesion, the rotational deployment is better for peninsular defense. Most ordinary U.S. troops have so far come here for up to one year without any significant training on Korean culture and their specific roles on the peninsula ― the reason why they have had to spend the first several months getting familiarized with the host nation.The troops have also come from all over the Army rather than uniformly coming here or leaving as a group, with some of them leaving sooner than one year. This has resulted in constant personnel changes, which has apparently affected troop cohesion, analysts said.“I have been told that most units in the 2nd Infantry Division have had about 7-9 percent turnover of personnel each month. With that level of turnover, they need to train once they arrive in Korea. (Thus) it is very difficult to keep any unit really cohesive, trained and ready to operate,” said Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the think tank RAND Corporation.“So, the U.S. Army decided to change to the kind of rotational basis that it used so well in Iraq and Afghanistan.” But in the rotational system, a unit is to master all individual and unit skills required for their missions in Korea before arriving. And troops come here as a group and stay together for nine months, reducing the personnel turnover, he explained.“Yes, occasionally a soldier does have to go home early, but not very often ― there is supposed to be very little turnover of unit personnel when they are in Korea. This approach makes for a far better trained unit that is more cohesive,” he said.“The bottom line is that rotational units like the U.S. armored brigade combat team are much better trained and far more cohesive ― they should be a much more capable unit, and thus more likely to deter North Korea.”Concerns about the possible downsides of the rotational deployment mostly revolve around the increasing “strategic flexibility” of U.S. troops ― an abiding source of friction in the South Korea-U.S. alliance.“The USFK’s flexible deployment would essentially limit their vulnerability to a potential surprise attack by North Korea ― by lessening the ‘tripwire’ effect of having U.S. forces close to the Demilitarized Zone, but more importantly, also provide greater latitude for new supporting roles, missions and capabilities that would cover wider multifunctional, expeditionary context, including regional contingencies beyond the Korean Peninsula,” said Raska.“However, some Koreans have interpreted the proposed changes as a removal of the traditional frontline ‘trip-wire’ deterrent and commitment to defend South Korea.”South Korea has long wanted U.S. troops here to focus entirely on deterring its communist neighbor, which has constantly posed security threats with its pursuit of nuclear arms and longer-range ballistic missiles.But the U.S. has sought to increase the strategic flexibility of its troops here rather than maintaining them as static forces whose missions are only limited to peninsular defense. The need for strategic flexibility has further increased as Washington has faced potential adversaries like terrorists who could launch attacks anytime in any place and by any method ― without any geographically fixed strongholds. The U.S.’ financial challenges, coupled with its troop drawdown, have also driven Washington to pursue the efficient system of the rotational deployment.The issue of strategic flexibility was one of the hot-button issues in the early 2000s ― a period when the bilateral alliance was going through a structural change amid Washington’ global troop restructuring and Seoul’s push for a greater self-defense role. The thorny issue was settled as the allies agreed on the strategic flexibility of the U.S. forces in 2006. Noting the need for Seoul to respect the U.S.’ military decisions, security experts say that the rotational deployment of the U.S. forces should proceed in a transparent way that would not aggravate South Korea’s long-running concerns over its possible downsides.Some also pointed out that what matters most is whether the U.S., despite its troop reduction and cuts in defense spending, is fully capable of providing augmented forces to the peninsula during a contingency regardless of static or expeditionary forces.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea has long wanted troops ,global troop restructuring and seoul ,aggravate south korea long running ,500 strong forces korea might ,enhance deterrence against north korea","['U.S.', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Forces Korea', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Michael Raska', 'the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies', 'Nanyang Technological University', 'Singapore', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', '2nd Brigade', 'Combat Team', '1st Cavalry Division', 'Dongducheon', 'Seoul', '1st Armored Brigade Combat Team', 'the U.S. Army', 'U.S.', 'the Multiple Launch Rocket System', 'the 2nd Battalion', 'U.S.', 'Osan', 'Camp Hovey', 'Dongducheon', 'Uijeongbu', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Kiowa Warriors', 'U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'Army', 'U.S. Forces', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'Army', 'Infantry Division', 'Korea', 'Bruce Bennett', 'RAND Corporation', 'the U.S. Army', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Raska', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",11,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.60086614  0.29123807

During her summit with Hungarian President Janos Ader, Park expressed hope for the Eastern European country’s cooperation in convincing Pyongyang to change course and relinquish its nuclear ambition. “North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons and thus consistently poses a threat to peace on the peninsula and in Northeast Asia,” she said. “I hope to work more closely with Hungary so that (North Korea) will realize as soon as possible that its parallel pursuit (the so-called byungjin policy) won’t succeed and it needs to take the path of change and development by learning from Hungary’s successful experience of political transformation.”  President Park Geun-hye (right) shakes hands with her Hungarian counterpart Janos Ader ahead of their summit on Tuesday at Cheong Wa Dae. (Yonhap)On the bilateral front, Park displayed gratitude for Budapest’s decision to defy various difficulties and forge diplomatic relations with Seoul as a member of the former Soviet bloc in 1989. The two sides agreed to boost collaboration in information technology, auto parts, biomedicine and other up-and-coming industries, Cheong Wa Dae said. A large delegation of Korean leaders of small and medium-sized businesses is scheduled to visit Hungary this week, in line with an agreement between the two presidents during their last summit in November. Park has been holding summits with leaders such as Ader on the margins of the ongoing World Water Forum in Daegu and Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. Later in the day, she met with Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome and agreed to accelerate the two countries’ plan to set up a textile factory complex and boost rural development based on South Korea’s Saemaul Movement in the East African country through official development assistance.

The six-party talks, involving South Korea, North Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan, have been dormant since late 2008 and diplomatic efforts to resume the talks have failed to produce a tangible outcome. While North Korea has showed no signs of abandoning its nuclear weapons program, South Korea's top nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kook said last month that the five nations of the six-party talks besides North Korea have agreed on certain conditions to resume ""exploratory dialogue"" on Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Still, it remains uncertain whether North Korea will accept such conditions, Hwang said.North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its latest launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.

They will decide on whether to clinch a formal contract based on the outcome of the two pilot operations.The project could help realize South Korean President Park Geun-hye's vision for a united Eurasia.In October 2013, Park unveiled her Eurasia initiative that calls for, among other things, infrastructure development and freer trade among Eurasian nations by linking their railways.South Korea imposed the May 24 punitive sanctions on North Korea in 2010 following Pyongyang's deadly sinking of the Cheonan warship in March of that year.The move has suspended all trade and exchange programs with the North, apart from a joint factory park project in the North Korean border city of Kaesong.

After more than four years of negotiations, Seoul and Washington are now close to announcing a revision to their 1974 nuclear energy cooperation pact, known as the ""123 agreement."" The agreement has centered on banning the South from enriching uranium and reprocessing spent fuel in exchange for U.S. technological assistance.The main sticking point in the negotiations has been Seoul's demand that it be allowed to undertake enrichment and reprocessing activities, just as Japan is allowed to do so under a U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation agreement. But Washington has been reluctant about Seoul's demand due to proliferation concerns.Considering Washington's concerns, Seoul has demanded that it be allowed to use ""pyroprocessing,"" a reprocessing technology that poses fewer proliferation risks because it leaves separated plutonium mixed with other elements.On Monday, Duyeon Kim and Mark Hibbs, researchers at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a report that the envisioned agreement will allow South Korea to ""carry out the first pyroprocessing stage, called electroreduction, as research and development.""""The United States does not want South Korea to enrich and reprocess. But it is not asking Seoul to adopt the so-called gold standard, which would require South Korea to legally renounce these techniques in the agreement text, as was the case with the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan,"" the researchers said in the report.That means that the new agreement is expected to make no provision for South Korea to enrich or reprocess, but it will not foreclose this possibility for the future, they said.The 1974 pact had been scheduled to expire in March last year, and Seoul and Washington launched negotiations to revise it in 2010. But after failing to find a compromise, they extended the existing pact to March 2016 to buy more time for negotiations.Widespread views are that the two countries are expected to hold their last meeting on the issue to conclude the agreement later this month.

The case stirred an intense controversy here as many South Koreans are against any military cooperation with Japan, their country’s onetime colonizer that has not fully atoned for its wartime atrocities including the sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.“From time to time, our peacekeeping forces need logistical support (from Japanese forces),” Kim said. “But we are not pursuing any military cooperation deal with Japan due to various issues between the two countries.”During the Shangri-La Dialogue, the defense ministers of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are likely to hold a trilateral meeting on the sidelines of the forum as they have done so for the past several years. But it remains to be seen whether the defense ministers of Korea and Japan will hold a bilateral meeting.Seoul has been cautious about its military cooperation and exchanges with Tokyo, as public sentiment has worsened against Japan.

731,731,[News Focus] U.S. struggles to shore up Asia rebalance policy,"The U.S. is struggling to shore up its “rebalance” policy toward the Asia-Pacific as China strengthens its regional influence and with skepticism lingering over its much-trumpeted refocus on the strategically vital region.At the core of the efforts is strengthening Washington’s security cooperation with its key allies of South Korea and Japan, and crafting a systematic mechanism for trilateral defense collaboratio...","The U.S. is struggling to shore up its “rebalance” policy toward the Asia-Pacific as China strengthens its regional influence and with skepticism lingering over its much-trumpeted refocus on the strategically vital region.At the core of the efforts is strengthening Washington’s security cooperation with its key allies of South Korea and Japan, and crafting a systematic mechanism for trilateral defense collaboration ― a reason why U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter traveled to Seoul and Tokyo last week.Carter’s weeklong trip to Asia came as China has sought to bolster its regional influence through various initiatives such as the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, seen as a counterbalance to the U.S.-led financial institutions, and what it calls maritime and overland “silk roads.”  U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter speaks during a town hall meeting with some 200 U.S. troops at the U.S.’ Osan Airbase, Gyeonggi Province, Thursday. (Yonhap)China has also pushed for a stronger “periphery diplomacy” to strengthen ties with its neighboring states ― a move that some observers view as Beijing’s attempt to put Asian states under its expanding sphere of influence through a series of bilateral and multilateral economic projects.China’s increasing influence, coupled with the U.S.’ financial challenges and its attention to conflict-laden zones in other parts of the world, has spawned speculation that Washington might have difficulty stably advancing the rebalance policy.Cuts in the U.S.’ defense spending have raised questions over whether Washington can keep its vow to bolster its military presence in the Asia-Pacific, while the ongoing campaign against Islamic militants and other terrorist entities in the Middle East and North Africa, have apparently distracted it.China’s growing economic presence in Southeast Asia has also posed a tricky challenge to the rebalance policy. Washington has been courting Southeast Asian states, which are strategically vital in terms of protecting major sea transport routes for energy and trade, but many of them have seen a delicate balancing act between the U.S. and China to maximize their national interests. The rebalance policy was crafted as the U.S. realized the urgent need to deepen its engagement in the Asia-Pacific emerging as a fulcrum of global power and wealth, after more than 13 years of ground warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq.“Rebalance … What it stands for is that we recognize that after so many years of such necessary but strong preoccupation with Iraq and Afghanistan, we need to make sure that we look up and look around and pay adequate attention to what is going on out here,” Carter said during a meeting with U.S. troops in Korea last Thursday.The U.S. has been pushing for the policy in various ways: through strengthening multilateral diplomacy at institutions such as the East Asia Summit; deepening security alliances and partnerships with regional states including Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar and Indonesia; and pushing for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an envisioned free trade deal linking Pacific-rim states.Amid the continuing doubts over the sustainability of the rebalance, a series of U.S. officials including President Barack Obama and Carter have underscored that the policy remains steadfast, and that their plans to bring in new, state-of-the-art military equipment demonstrate the top priority on this policy.“All the newest stuff is coming out here, all the most high-tech stuff and all the best stuff is coming out here, and this is where we have strong alliances,” Carter said during the meeting with U.S. troops here.The “new stuff” to be deployed to the region includes eight ballistic missile defense destroyers to be deployed to Japan through 2017; four littoral combat ships to be deployed to Singapore by 2017; P8 antisubmarine, surveillance aircraft to Japan; the marine squadron of F-35s to Japan; and three DDG-1000 Zumwalt stealth destroyers.Above all, the most important task concerning the rebalance is to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance, which Carter called “the bedrock” of America’s alliance network in the region.Washington and Tokyo are currently working on revising their 1997 defense cooperation guidelines and seeking to conclude their bilateral negotiations over the Pacific-rim free trade agreement ― the two core elements of the U.S.’ multifaceted engagement in the region.The revision of the guidelines is expected to contain a set of joint measures to cope with Chinese threats regarding maritime disputes in the East and South China seas, and other emerging scenarios, observers say. First adopted in 1978 to counter Soviet threats, the guidelines were last amended in 1997 to reflect post-Cold War security threats.Meanwhile, the closer strategic cooperation between the U.S. and Japan is putting pressure on Seoul to enhance its cooperation with the two. Due to North Korea’s escalating nuclear and missile threats, Seoul shares the need to strengthen security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo. But it is struggling to deal with domestic and diplomatic challenges. China has opposed stronger trilateral security cooperation among the U.S., South Korea and Japan. Seoul’s security cooperation has also been restricted due to Japan’s failure to fully atone for its wartime wrongdoings amid public calls for more contrition on the part of Japan.Amid the U.S.’ push for the rebalance, Washington has also sought to strengthen its missile defense ― a reason why the U.S. considers deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, an integral part of its multilayered missile shield.The THAAD issue has also posed a tricky diplomatic challenge to Seoul as China has strongly opposed the deployment, arguing that it could undermine the regional security balance and cause military tensions.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","carter weeklong trip to asia ,distracted it china growing economic ,china has opposed stronger trilateral ,challenge to seoul as china ,weeklong trip to asia came","['U.S.', 'China', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Defense', 'Ashton Carter', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Carter', 'China', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Osan Airbase', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Beijing', 'asian', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'islamic', 'North Africa', 'China', 'Washington', 'southeast asian', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Carter', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines', 'Myanmar', 'Indonesia', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Carter', 'Carter', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Singapore', 'Japan', 'F-35s', 'Japan', 'Zumwalt', 'Carter', 'America', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'soviet', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",11,"[ 2.          7.          0.         ... -0.58550936  0.64678532

The Global Times made the comments in an editorial on the day when U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter was in South Korea, a visit that is aimed at bolstering America's diplomatic and military rebalancing to Asia. In Seoul, Carter told reporters that the U.S. is not yet ready to discuss with South Korea the possible deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system.""Both the U.S. and South Korea claim the installation of the defense system is aimed at containing North Korea, not China,"" said an editorial in the paper published by the ruling Communist Party.""However, this is viewed as 'words to beguile kids' by almost every Chinese military analyst. One thing is for certain -- the Chinese public's accumulating goodwill toward Seoul would be severely battered if THAAD finally lands in South Korea, and the foundation of the bilateral ties would be shattered,"" it said. China's concerns over the possible deployment of the THAAD battery have been known, but the language used by the newspaper took a more caustic tone. To better cope with the growing threats of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities, both South Korean and U.S. officials have indicated the need for the THAAD battery. Arguing that the U.S. missile-defense system also targets China, Beijing has publicly pressed Seoul not to accept the THAAD battery. In return, South Korea's defense ministry has blamed China for trying to ""influence"" Seoul's security policy.South Korea and the U.S. have called for China, the economic lifeline of North Korea, to do more in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but China's stance over its ideological ally, Pyongyang, has often been self-contradictory. Many analysts believe that China's Communist Party leadership won't put enough pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions because a sudden collapse of the North's regime could threaten China's own security interests.

The negotiations are in the final stage with a view to conclude the pact around Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the U.S. later this month.The pact has also been a focus of attention in South Korea because it is expected to reflect Japan's decision to exercise its collective self-defense right that empowers Japan to fight alongside its allies even if the country is not attacked.South Korea has worried about the possibility of Japan sending forces to the Korean Peninsula in the name of aiding the U.S. ally under the collective self-defense right in the event of contingencies, such as conflicts with North Korea.Japanese forces putting their boots on the peninsula is considered one of the last things that South Koreans want to see due to painful memories of Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910-45. Concerns about Japan seeking greater military power have worsened as Abe has taken a series of nationalist steps.South Korea has demanded Japan should win explicit consent from Seoul if it wants to exercise the collective self-defense right in contingencies on the peninsula. It also urged Tokyo to dispel doubts and concerns stemming from history and work harder to win confidence from its neighboring countries.Diplomatic sources in Washington said that South Korea is making multi-faceted efforts to make sure that the U.S.-Japan defense pact addresses its concerns about the collective self-defense. They said they expect the pact to address Seoul's concerns, but did not elaborate.An interim report of the defense guidelines published last year said that the pact will detail cooperation between the two countries in case of an attack not only on Japan, but also ""against a country that is in close relationship with Japan where Japan's use of force is permitted"" under last year's revised constitutional interpretation.The issue is also expected to be a topic when senior defense officials of the three countries hold annual three-way cooperation talks in Washington next week. The Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT) will involve assistant or deputy minister-level officials.Critics have denounced Japan's decision on collective self-defense as a precursor to ultimately amending the country's pacifist constitution. Seoul and Beijing view the move warily as it calls to mind Japan's past militarism amid concerns that the power could be misused.Despite such concerns, Japan's government adopted a new constitutional interpretation on July 1 to exercise the right in one of the biggest changes in the country's post-war security policy.

William Gortney said Tuesday that Pyongyang was thought to be capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead to mount on a long-range missile. It was the first time that a top U.S. officer has confirmed that the North had secured miniaturization technology.“Our assessment is that they have the ability to put it on ― a nuclear weapon on a KN-08 and shoot it at the (U.S.) homeland,” Gortney said during a press briefing at the Pentagon, referring to the North’s intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of up to 12,000 km. In this file photo, North Korean missiles on trucks make its way during a massive military parade to mark the 65th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party in Pyongyang, North Korea. (AP-Yonhap)“We assess that it’s operational today, and so we practice to go against it. … We haven’t seen them test the KN-08 yet and we’re waiting to do that.”Noting the unpredictable nature of the communist regime, Gortney also said that the road-mobile launcher of the KN-08 is a source of concern. “We’re very concerned about the mobile nature of the KN-08. We lose our ability to get the indication that something might occur,” he said.Seoul’s Defense Ministry said U.S. intelligence authorities have confirmed that what Gortney said does not represent the official stance of the U.S. government.The KN-08 missile was unveiled on April 15, 2012, during a military parade to mark the Day of the Sun, the birthday of the North’s national founder Kim Il-sung. As it had not been seen being tested, some argued that the missile could be a mock-up.According to the latest analysis by the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, the KN-08 ICBM would reach an initial operational capability with growing numbers deployed by 2020.Meanwhile, Frank Rose, U.S. assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance, said THAAD was a “critical capability” in defending against North Korea’s Rodong and Scud ballistic missiles.“U.S. missile defenses in the Asia-Pacific region are designed to deal with the threat from North Korea, specifically their threat from Rodongs as well as extended-range Scuds,” Rose told reporters following a seminar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“So the bottom line is: no decision to date. Nor are there any negotiations underway between the U.S. and the ROK (South Korea) on this issue. But what I would say is that in the future, were we to move in this direction, THAAD would be a critical capability to dealing with the threats from North Korea’s Rodong and extended-range Scuds.”The North has deployed some 1,000 missiles that can strike the South, a reason why calls are mounting for a stronger missile defense against those missiles ― some 700 Scud-B and -C missiles with ranges of 300-500 km and about 300 Rodong missiles with a range of around 1,300 km.The potential deployment of THAAD has been a hot-button issue here as China has repeatedly expressed opposition to it, fearing that the system would undermine the regional security balance, escalate military tension and potentially spark an arms race.The issue is expected to be unofficially discussed during the talks between Seoul’s Defense Minister Han Min-koo and his U.S. counterpart Ashton Carter on Friday. Carter is to arrive here Thursday for a three-day visit for talks with senior officials and U.S. troops here.Apparently mindful of the opposition from Beijing, Seoul said that THAAD would not be on the official agenda for the talks between Han and Carter. But the two are to discuss ways to better counter the North’s nuclear and missile threats which are high on the agenda.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","highlighted north korea evolving nuclear ,korea evolving nuclear and missile ,north korea evolving nuclear ,north korea evolving nuclear and ,korea evolving nuclear","['U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S. Northern Command', 'William Gortney', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'kn-08', 'U.S.', 'Gortney', 'Pentagon', 'North ’s', 'north korean', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'AP', 'Gortney', 'KN-08', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'U.S.', 'Gortney', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'Kim Il - sing', 'the U.S.-Korea Institute', 'the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies', 'Frank Rose', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Rodong', 'Scud', 'North Korea', 'Scuds', 'U.S.', 'ROK', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Rodong', 'Scuds', 'North', 'Rodong', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'Carter', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Han', 'Carter', 'North ’s', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.31205034  0.50957447

The two sides are eyeing the mid-2020s as the time frame for the handover.  The allies' meeting comes at a time when North Korea has continuously ratcheted up tensions by building military capabilities and making good on threats.    As the latest move, Pyongyang test-fired four short-range KN-02 missiles into the West Sea last week against the ongoing Seoul-Washington military exercise. On Thursday, Adm. William Gortney, in charge of the U.S. Northern Command, said the bellicose regime is believed to be capable of building a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a long-range missile that can reach the U.S. mainland.  Following the ministerial talks, Han and Carter also plan to visit the Navy's 2nd Fleet Command to pay tribute to the sailors who died in the sinking of the warship Cheonan.  On March 26, 2010, an explosion rocked the 1,200-ton naval corvette, which sank in the Yellow Sea, killing 46 sailors. A South Korean-led international investigation found that the North had torpedoed the ship, though Pyongyang denied its involvement. The hull of the vessel is on display in the Command headquarters in Pyeongtaek, some 70 kilometers south of Seoul.   ""Carter will be the first U.S. defense minister to visit the site to commemorate the deceased,"" the official said. ""It will be a chance to display the allies' staunch will to jointly cope with any threat and provocations by North Korea.""  Whether Carter will broach the issue of the possible U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system on the peninsula has drawn key attention at home and abroad, though Seoul and Washington officials have said they have decided not to bring the matter up this time.  Washington has expressed its willingness to deploy the battery here to better defend South Korea from the North's threats and to guarantee the safety of the around 28,000 U.S. troops stationed here and their families. The move has since been one of the most controversial security issues at home and abroad amid concerns and opposition from neighboring countries, mainly China and Russia.   THAAD is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at a higher altitude in their terminal phase using a hit-to-kill method.  After their talks, Han and Carter will hold a press conference, according to Seoul officials, adding the U.S. secretary will leave here on Saturday for the country's Pacific Command in Hawaii.

Kim, who was in his late 20s at the time, said he was leading a life that didn’t seem worth living, stressing that it was too painful for him to bring back the bitter memories from the past. Then he brought up a name: Park Chung-hee. Kim called him a “founding leader,” who rebuilt South Korea and transformed the impoverished nation into one of the most advanced countries in the world. Despite debated views on the military strongman who ruled the nation with an iron fist for 18 years, Kim said he believed Park was “the one” who opened the future for his children. Citizens line up to enter the house of late former President Park Chung-hee in Sindang-dong, Seoul. (Yonhap)“I feel delighted as if I am seeing him alive and having a life in this house with his family,” said Kim in the front yard of Park’s old residence in Sindang-dong, central Seoul.Kim is one of hundreds of people who queued up to visit the old red-roofed home where Park and his family including his daughter Park Geun-hye, the current president, lived between 1958 and 1961. The family left the house when Park took over the government through a military coup.The house, 129 square meters, has been open for public viewing since last month as part of Seoul city’s cultural experience program. Although it admits only 15 persons per session through online reservations, the area is crowded with people wanting to get a glimpse into the former authoritarian ruler’s ordinary life. The house, owned by the Yookyoung Foundation, was registered as the city’s cultural heritage site in 2008. The Seoul city government recently recreated the house citing its historic value. It represents the housing culture in the 1930s that added Western and Japanese architectural styles to the existing structure of hanok, the traditional Korean house.The three-bedroom residence is equipped with a modernized parlor and kitchen decorated with various items from the 1960s to best reproduce the residential life of the Parks ― based on testimonials and media reports. Family photographs are displayed, including young Park Geun-hye playing the piano with her younger sister Geun-ryeong. Park Geun-hye was 6 when the family lived in the house. She returned to the Sindang-dong house in 1979 from Cheong Wa Dae, after she lost both parents at the hands of assassins. She left a year later to live by herself, according to reports.The city also recreated the then-Major Gen. Park’s study ― the very location where he plotted the May 16 coup that eventually allowed himself to become the dictatorial president of the country.“He was a man who dedicated his whole life to the country’s prosperity, and I deeply respect that,” said Lee Ki-seong, 81, staring at a military uniform hanging on the wall in Park’s old study.The house sees an average of 200 visitors a day who come from across the country, said Cho Young-hoon, a Seoul city official who manages the overall operation of the tour program. Visitors are mostly in their 60s and over, those who are nostalgic of the former president and the economic legacy he built, Cho said.The long line of seniors waiting to go inside may reflect their attachment to the past and resentment toward the younger generation that fails to acknowledge their contribution to the country, pundits said.“To them, the name Park Chung-hee is a keyword that symbolizes Korea’s rapid economic growth and that brings back the memories of the good old days,” said culture critic Ha Jae-keun.“With the economic condition deteriorating as well as the widening gap with younger generations, they are recollecting memories of the days when they were once full of energy and enthusiastic, by rephrasing the name Park Chung-hee,” he said.After devoting their youth to rebuilding the household and national economies, the generation is now facing aggravating poverty and solitude. A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that the poverty rate of South Korea’s elderly was nearly 50 percent, meaning half of seniors earn 50 percent or less of the median household disposable income.“For them, denying Park Chung-hee and his legacy is like neglecting their lives and the contribution they had made during and after his time,” said Lee Moon-won, another culture critic in Seoul.“By watching Park Geun-hye rising into power, they wanted to see their sacrifice being compensated,” Lee said.Yoon Seong-yi, political professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, said the seniors thereby had high expectations of her, projecting hopes that she would bring another economic miracle like her father and recognize their past contributions.The higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment, Yoon said. “Park’s image as an uncommunicative leader and her disappointing economic achievements, in turn, appear to be making it difficult for the senior voters to stay hopeful.”Despite her ambitious three-year economic reform plan aimed at overhauling both the public and private sector, Asia’s fourth-largest economy has been going downhill. Korea saw its gross domestic product grow by 3.3 percent in 2014, lower than the G20’s 3.4 percent average, with increasing concerns for deflation.On top of the disappointing indexes, in the eyes of nostalgic conservatives, Park is also failing to show the charisma or leadership reminiscent of her father’s rule.“I think the daughter falls short of her father, especially in terms of the leadership and the generosity he had,” said Kim Pan-soo, a 75-year-old retiree, who visited the Sindang-dong house with his wife.Another visitor, Lee Young-dong, agreed.“Park Geun-hye seems to be wavering in her policies, particularly on her economic and welfare drive, unlike her father who charged through with the ‘can do’ spirit,” said the 60-year-old.“I admit that the senior Park had dictatorial power at that time but I think her daughter’s (leadership) is too weak. She has to push ahead with plans and be fearless in the face of criticism.”Behind the economic success achieved in the 70s, Park Chung-hee held a near-absolute power to rule the country by crushing the opposition forces. The Yushin Constitution gave Park dictatorial power as he was able to extend his presidency without seeking re-election. He also secured himself the right to appoint a large portion of the parliament that secured majority seats for his ruling party.At the cost of brutal oppression against democracy and human rights, Park remained one of the most praised presidents in Korea’s modern history, as he brought the country under one shared goal ― to escape from poverty.Daughter Park, meanwhile, faces a different time and different demands, while still based on conservative support.During her five-year single presidential term, she must muster up cooperation from the opposition in implementing the reform initiatives including the civil servants’ pension system and the labor markets, all the while upholding the new National Assembly Advancement Law that limits bulldozing of bills by the majority party.Her leadership is also tested within the ruling Saenuri Party, which is deeply split between her supporters and opponents. To the younger, progressive voters, Park is the daughter of a former dictator, who thereby often resorts to outdated politics of oppression and obstinacy.Park’s approval ratings, which passed 50 percent upon her election, plummeted to below 30 percent in January this year. Gallup Korea had noted that the positive ratings of Park among those in their 50s ― the president’s core support group ― had started to decline. Park’s approval ratings from this age group have fallen 10 percentage point in just over a year. “The president needs more powerful tools that could coax conservative voters and also embrace the progressive blocs at the same time … such as the war against corruption and other social reform efforts that can be endorsed by people beyond their ideological differences,” said Yoon Hee-woong, senior analyst of Opinion Live, a Seoul-based consulting firm.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)Staff reporter Sohn Ji-young contributed to this article. ― Ed.","leader who rebuilt south korea ,late former president park ,the war torn country back ,korea and transformed the impoverished ,presidents in korea modern history","['Kim', 'Kim', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Sindang - dong', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Park ’s old', 'Sindang - dong', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul city ’s', 'the Yookyoung Foundation', 'Seoul', 'western', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Parks', 'Park Geun', 'Geun - ryeong', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Cheong', 'Lee Ki - seong', 'Park ’s', 'Cho Young - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Cho', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Korea', 'ha Jae - keun', 'Park Chung - hee', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'South Korea ’s', 'Lee Moon - won', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Yoon Seong - yi', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Seoul', 'Yoon', 'the G20 ’s', 'Park', 'Kim Pan - soo', 'Sindang', 'Lee Young - dong', 'Geun', 'Park', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Daughter Park', 'National Assembly Advancement Law', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Yoon Hee - woong', 'Opinion live', 'Seoul', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Sohn Ji - young', 'Ed']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.57291895  0.77528453

We need to get to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. So the responsibility is on them, though, and regardless of what’s happening in other nuclear talks around the world.”Meanwhile, officials from South Korea and other members of the six-party talks are expected to gather at a civilian forum in Japan in May to potentially discuss how to address North Korea’s nuclear problem. Director general-level officials from the six countries may attend the Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue, a forum hosted by the University of California’s Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. The IGCC has reportedly sent an invitation to the North Korean delegation.The six-party talks have been stalled since December 2008. Pyongyang had called for an unconditional resumption of the talks. But Seoul and Washington have claimed that for the talks to resume, the communist regime should first show its sincerity in its denuclearization commitments.Angrily responding to the allies’ demands for “sincerity,” the North has said that it would not bargain away its nuclear arms.

Wang Geon has been in charge of combating pirates off the coast of Somalia.It said that the Cheonghae unit was ordered to provide space and communications equipment for the diplomatic office. Two Korean diplomats were moved last week to the ad hoc office.The Cheonghae unit on the destroyer has been operating near Somali waters since early 2009 as part of international efforts to help protect ships passing through the Gulf of Aden, used by some 500 South Korean vessels annually.A total of 13 South Koreans, including two employees at the embassy, have been evacuated from Yemen by a U.N. plane so far as security concerns heightened following airstrikes against a militant rebel group there.On March 26, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Gulf Arab nations launched air strikes against Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, which ousted Yemen's government and dissolved the parliament in early February.Before the evacuation, a total of 38 Koreans were living in four different areas, including Sanaa and Taiz, according to the foreign ministry.

The Angolan people have overcome considerable barriers and external interference but through their perseverance and courage they achieved peace, having tremendous development nationwide since.Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold and copper, as well as a rich abundance of wildlife, forest and fossils. Oil and diamonds have been the country’s most important economic resource. That said, smallholder and plantation agriculture have begun to grow since 2002.Jose Eduardo dos Santos, president of the Republic of AngolaAngola established a relationship with Korea in 1992, after signing the general agreement on economic, technical and scientific cooperation. During this period, there were two sessions of a joint committee between both countries, and the second session was held in August 2009, where commitments were made to strengthen cooperation. Since 2005 the quantity of imports and exports between the two countries has increased, which is the fruit of close cooperation in various fields.After peace was achieved on April 4, 2002, Angola has developed an ambitious program for development: Strengthening democracy and internal cohesion; developing institutional capacity and achieving significant improvements in governance; ensuring high economic growth and improving the quality of citizen’s lives; and national reconstruction. New houses, roads, bridges, railways, ports and airports were constructed and renewed across the country. Luanda International Airports is one of the projects that will be completed in 2017, surging as one of the largest and most modern airports in Africa. The new international airport in Luanda will be an important hub in regional and continental air traffic.Angola also opened the Lobito transport corridor that starts in Lobito port in the Benguela province to the inland of Angola up to the regions rich in minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia.In Angola, the construction is ongoing of new cities and apartment centers.In this environment of peace and stability, intelligent and realistic economic policies adopted by the Angolan government ― leading to the consolidation of macroeconomic stability and laying the foundations for sustained growth and development ― has allowed the economy to grow faster than any other economy in Africa and, indeed, the world.Luanda City, the capital of AngolaOverall, Angola’s economy has undergone a period of transformation. It has been the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007. From 2001 to 2013, Angola had the world’s highest average GDP annual growth at 11.1 percent. Diamonds and oil make up 60 percent of Angola’s economy, almost all its revenue and are its dominant export. Growth is almost entirely driven by oil production, which surpassed 1.4 million barrels per day in late 2005 and almost 2 million barrels per day by 2013.

""Some of the rockets appear to have landed inland in its own territory, which is not usual.""Dongchang-ri is where the North's missile test site is located, though it was not immediately confirmed whether the North fired the rockets Friday from the facility.Friday's firing ""appears to be the North's provocations in opposition to the ongoing Seoul-Washington joint military exercise and civic groups' move to launch anti-Pyongyang leaflets,"" the JCS said.The joint annual Foal Eagle field training exercise between South Korea and the U.S. has been under way since March 2 as part of the allies' efforts to improve the combined forces' operation and combat capabilities to deter threats from the communist country.

Two weeks later, the communist country also test-fired seven ground-to-air missiles into the East Sea.Dismissing North Korea's claims, the allies have stressed the exercises have been staged on a regular basis and that they are defensive in nature, aimed solely at bolstering readiness against a possible invasion by North Korea.(Yonhap)","north fired the rockets friday ,korea test fired four short ,fired the rockets friday ,north korea test fired four ,fired the rockets friday from","['North Korea', 'Seoul', ""South Korea 's"", 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'JCS', 'north korean', 'Dongchang', 'North Pyongan Province', 'JCS', 'JCS', 'JCS', 'Seoul', 'anti - pyongyang', 'JCS', 'Foal Eagle', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'North Korea.(Yonhap']",6,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.29275468  0.66155899

The walk proposed for May 24 is a call for reunification of the two countries.The DMZ is the world's most fortified border, with the two Koreas still technically at war. The walk would mark the 70th anniversary of the division of the Korean Peninsula.The walk would include two Nobel Peace laureates, and Ahn says North Korean women will walk with the group from Pyongyang to the DMZ.Organizers of the effort called WomenCrossDMZ.org have said they hope for 30 women to cross from North Korea to South Korea on May 24, which is International Women's Day for Disarmament.The DMZ is one of the most highly charged places in the world. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers face off across the heavily mined zone that separates South Korea from closed-off, nuclear-armed North Korea.``It's hard to imagine any more physical symbol of the insanity of dividing human beings,'' Steinem said during last month's announcement of the walk. Co-organizer Christine Ahn said she had meetings in Pyongyang in the past week with officials from the country's Overseas Korean Committee and Democratic Women's Union. She said she received support to hold a symposium in North Korea on women and peacebuilding as well.``I wish I knew how the ultimate decision was made, but at this point I'm just relieved that at least we have Pyongyang's cooperation and support,'' Ahn said in an email.A North Korean diplomat to the U.N., Kim Song, last month told the AP the proposal was being discussed in his capital.Ahn and the other participants also are calling on U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a South Korean, as well as President Barack Obama and the leaders of North and South Korea to take the necessary actions to finally end the Korean War with a peace treaty. The war ended in 1953 with the armistice.The women would like to cross the DMZ at the village of Panmunjom, which straddles the border and is the place where troops from North and South come closest, just a few yards (meters) from each other.The women have said they take heart from successful crossings of the DMZ by five New Zealanders with motorbikes in 2013 and by 32 Korean Russians by motorcade last year. Both had permission from both sides.This new attempt includes Nobel peace laureates Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia, who worked to end those long-running conflicts.Ahn has said the women are being advised by former U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson, and that the U.N. Command at the DMZ has said they would be willing to facilitate their crossing once South Korea's government gives its approval.","north korean women will walk ,korean war with peace treaty ,korean russians by motorcade last ,two nobel peace laureates ,hold symposium in north korea","['UNITED NATIONS', 'AP', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'Gloria Steinem', 'South Korea', 'Christine Ahn', 'the Associated Press', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'DMZ', 'Koreas', 'Ahn', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', ""International Women 's day for Disarmament"", 'DMZ', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Christine Ahn', 'Pyongyang', 'Overseas Korean Committee', ""Democratic Women 's Union"", 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'U.N.', 'Kim Song', 'AP', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'Barack Obama', 'North and South Korea', 'DMZ', 'Panmunjom', 'North and South', 'DMZ', 'New Zealanders', 'korean', 'Russians', 'Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland', 'Leymah Gbowee', 'Liberia', 'U.N.', 'Bill Richardson', 'the U.N.

Negotiators plan to put the tentative deal in a final agreement by June 30.  Thursday's agreement represented the crystallization of more than a dozen years of efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The six world powers -- the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- have held years of the so-called ""P5 plus one"" negotiations with Iran.  U.S. President Barack Obama hailed Thursday's deal as ""historic.""   ""Today, the United States, together with our allies and partners, has reached a historic understanding with Iran, which if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said. ""If this framework leads to a final comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies and our world safer.""  The Iran deal contrasts sharply with the long-running impasse in the North Korean nuclear issue.   Six-party talks aimed at resolving the North Korean impasse has been idled since the last session in late 2008. North Korea has demanded unconditional resumption of negotiations and the U.S. has maintained that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.  While the six-party talks have been idling, the North has bolstered its nuclear capabilities and stockpile, conducting its second and third nuclear tests in 2009 and 2013. Some experts now warn that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to up to 100 bombs by 2020.  Many analysts have said that North Korea stands low in the U.S. priority list and that the Obama administration has little interest in resuming nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang as it has been preoccupied with the Iranian nuclear issue.   Resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue, however, is unlikely to affect the standoff with the North, experts say.  ""I don't know anyone who thinks the administration is going to have a moment's time to give more attention to North Korea,"" said Joel Wit, a top North Korea analyst who runs the website 38 North that specializes on North Korea issues.  Wit pointed out that the U.S. has more work to do to finalize the Iran deal and implement it. In addition, the U.S. should also put together measures to bolster security ties with concerned countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, he said.  ""Plus, we are entering the presidential election season and that is going to intensify as we get to June into the end of this year,"" he said.  Scott Snyder, a senior researcher on Korea at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, also said that the North Korean nuclear issue will likely remain on the back burner as the U.S. needs more time to put the Iran deal into force.  Though it is still premature to say how the Iran deal will affect the Obama administration's thinking toward North Korea, Snyder said, it is possible that the conversation on implementation will demand so much attention that it will ""crowd out North Korea further.""  ""North Korea is in a different situation from Iran, because it has shown no interest in coming back to talks on minimally acceptable terms to the administration,"" he said.  Alan Romberg, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center, also said the two nuclear issues are different.  ""Iran has obviously shown a willingness to curtail its still-nascent program and forgo nuclear weapons. North Korea has not. So there really are no parallels,"" he said. ""Perhaps Pyongyang could draw a lesson about the potential benefits if it changes its approach.""

People stage a rally to express their opposition to the U.S.’ possible deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system to Korea in downtown Seoul last month. (Yonhap)Those in favor of the THAAD deployment argue that the current missile defense programs employed by the U.S. Forces Korea and the South Korean military are insufficient to prepare against Pyongyang’s possible missile attacks.The USFK has maintained the Patriot Advanced Capability-2 and PAC-3 interception systems at its bases in Osan and other locations. The two systems are designed to shoot down incoming missiles at altitudes of 10-15 km in the so-called “terminal phase” of flight. The South Korean military which has only PAC-2 interceptors plans to purchase PAC-3 interceptors from the U.S. and upgrade the radar and launchers of its existing interception system. PAC-3 interceptors employing advanced “hit-to-kill” technology have stronger strike capabilities than the PAC-2 with fragmentation warheads. With only PAC interceptors deployed here, military planners and experts have raised the need to establish a multiple-interception structure with the deployment of THAAD or other additional assets to intercept missiles at higher altitudes and boost chances of success. THAAD can incapacitate missiles at altitudes of 40-150 km.But critics say that when the North has more than 1,000 missiles that could bring all South Korean targets within striking range, it would be impossible for any interception system to counter a massive attack. They argue that diplomatic losses from the deployment of THAAD may outweigh military benefits. The North has deployed some 1,000 missiles that can strike the South: some 700 Scud-B and C missiles with ranges of 300-500 km and about 300 Rodong missiles with a range of around 1,300 km. Scud missiles are designed to strike South Korean targets. Rodong missiles can fly all the way to Japan, but can also target South Korea after adjustments to their operational range. But proponents of THAAD argue that Seoul should secure defensive platforms to fend off missile threats to strategic military units to keep combat capabilities, even though those platforms might not be able to cope with massive missile strikes.“Do we have to just sit and watch without doing anything just because THAAD or other assets can counter only limited missile attacks?” one military expert said, declining to be identified.“We should secure at least the means to protect our strategic military bases against the enemy’s counterforce attacks (on military targets), even if we may not be able to fully protect some populated areas. That way, we can keep our warfighting capabilities, protect our citizens and send a signal that the missile salvo would only be futile.”Some critics argue that since the North has many mobile launchers, called TEL (transporter erector launcher), it would be very difficult to detect its missile movements for interception purposes. They also note the North could use deceptive mechanisms such as decoys to make it difficult to identify and strike the right warhead of a flying missile. Should the North use a missile capable of carrying multiple warheads, some of which could be fake payloads, it would also be difficult to accurately intercept the missile, they point out.Another issue that critics have raised is that the Korean Peninsula is too small to employ any effective missile defense system. Missile experts say that it would take less than 4 minutes for a Scud missile to travel to Seoul.Proponents of THAAD, however, argue that to maximize national security interests and defense capabilities, Seoul should devise whatever method is available.“Even though it (THAAD) may not be as effective as we expect, it may be the starting point for us to improve our missile defense until we have perfect defense capabilities,” said Park Hwee-rhak, political science professor at Kookmin University.“There are many people who want to highlight only the negative sides of this. But the question is what we should do to counter North Korean threats. We need to have an option. I would like to ask them what kind of options they have to protect South Koreans against North Korean threats.” By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","prepare against pyongyang possible missile ,koreans against north korean threats ,to counter north korea missile ,installing thaad in korea arguing ,north korea missile threats rather","['U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Russia', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'south korean', 'Pyongyang', 'USFK', 'Osan', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Rodong', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'TEL', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park Hwee', 'Kookmin University', 'north korean', 'South Koreans', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.54336786  0.18697484

Pelosi was the House Speaker when the House of Representatives adopted a landmark 2007 resolution on Japan's wartime sexual slavery that called on Tokyo to formally acknowledge, apologize and accept historical responsibility for the atrocity.South Korea hopes to help the U.S. lawmakers better understand the issue of Japan's wartime sex slaves ahead of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress later this month.South Korea has repeatedly pressed Japan to face up to history, especially over the elderly Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II.Still, there is no sign of progress in resolving the issue that hinders close relations between South Korea and Japan, two key U.S. allies in Asia.Abe described the sex slave issue as ""human trafficking"" without specifying the perpetrator in a recent interview with the Washington Post.

The collider is a 27-kilometre ring-shaped tunnel on the French-Swiss border, in which two beams of protons are sent in opposite directions.Powerful magnets bend the beams so that they collide at points around the track where four laboratories have clusters of sensors.In 2012, scientists at CERN, one of the world's top research centres on particle physics, announced they had discovered the Higgs boson, until then only theorised as the mass-giver to all matter -- a feat crowned with the 2013 Nobel Prize in physics.Scientists hope the new run of the LHC will shed light on theoretical concepts like dark matter and dark energy, and possible extra dimensions.","world largest proton smasher making ,cern wrote tuesday the lab ,2013 nobel prize in physics ,tuesday the lab super powered ,nobel prize in physics scientists","['AFP', ""Hadron Collider 's"", 'the European Organisation for Nuclear Research', 'french', 'CERN', 'LHC']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30087036  0.12661918

766,766,[News Focus] Hopes dim for resolution of N.K. nuclear dispute,"Hopes are fading for a resolution to the dispute over North Korea’s nuclear programs as Pyongyang sticks to its adventurism and Washington seems unlikely to focus on the issue with Iran topping its denuclearization agenda.The North has recently made a series of statements in which it insisted on developing what it calls “nuclear deterrence,” dampening the mood for the resumption of the long-stalled multilateral ai...","Hopes are fading for a resolution to the dispute over North Korea’s nuclear programs as Pyongyang sticks to its adventurism and Washington seems unlikely to focus on the issue with Iran topping its denuclearization agenda.The North has recently made a series of statements in which it insisted on developing what it calls “nuclear deterrence,” dampening the mood for the resumption of the long-stalled multilateral aid-for-denuclearization talks.In a media interview, the North’s delegation at the U.N. said it would not engage in any negotiations over its denuclearization, including the six-party talks that involve the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia.“North Korea will never put down its nuclear weapons first. Denuclearization should not be an objective of any negotiations,” an official of the delegation told the U.S.-funded broadcaster Voice of America in a report released on Wednesday. “Denuclearization is something that we may consider only after the rest of the world including the U.S. is denuclearized.”A day earlier, the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, said that Pyongyang would not renounce its “byungjin line” ― a two-pronged policy of simultaneously pursuing the development of nuclear weapons and its economy, stressing that the policy would lead the country in a “direction of peace and prosperity.” “We should hold fast to our invincible byungjin line, and conscientiously push for a struggle to build a strong and prosperous nation,” the paper said as it marked the second anniversary of the announcement of the policy line. The North’s insistence on the development of nuclear arms has put a damper on the efforts to resume the six-party talks that have been stalled since late 2008. The participating countries of the nuclear talks have agereed on the need for the resumption of negotiations, but they have differed over the preconditions: The North and China have called for an unconditional restart of the talks, while the U.S. and South Korea demanded that the North first prove its sincerity in its denuclearization commitments.The recent series of statements by the North on its nuclear program apparently underscored Pyongyang’s growing discontent over Washington’s lack of attention to its repeated calls ― tacitly or explicitly ― for dialogue that would help ease its international isolation.Robert Gallucci, who served as the chief U.S. nuclear negotiator during the 1993-1994 nuclear crisis involving the North, said that the Obama administration may have little room to deal with the North Korean issue as it would have to focus on defending a possible agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear activities that a Republican-controlled Congress might attack.Iran and six powers ― the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany ― have been struggling to reach an agreement, with the nuclear negotiations going past a March 31 deadline and into overtime.Gallucci noted during a meeting with reporters that the senior U.S. officials dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue were the same people in charge of the North Korean nuclear issue, meaning that the officials already have their hands full with the Iranian conundrum.Experts mostly consider the Obama administration, whose term ends in January 2007, to be unlikely to take any bold steps to improve relations with the North in the near future, given that Pyongyang has lost Washington’s trust due to a series of provocative actions and its breach of past deals.“President Obama was burned by the early missile and nuclear tests in 2009, by the sinking of the Cheonan and Yeonpyeongdo shelling, and also by the breakdown of the so-called Leap Day deal in 2013,” Stephan Haggard, a North Korea expert at the University of California, San Diego, said in an interview with The Korea Herald earlier this year.Under the 2012 Leap Day deal, Pyongyang was to put a moratorium on its nuclear program, cease atomic and missile tests in exchange for 240,000 tons of food aid from Washington. But the deal was broken after the North launched a long-range rocket in April 2012.“In addition, the Sony hack has played a much more significant role in U.S.-North Korea relations than is realized. … With a Republican Congress in place, initiatives from Washington are unlikely unless North Korea makes a bold move,” Haggard added.With Washington unlikely to move to mend fences with Pyongyang, observers say that Seoul should take the initiative to create momentum on a series of North Korean issues. But Seoul has itself found it difficult to take any bold steps amid the North’s continued saber-rattling and menacing rhetoric.Given the absence of dialogue with the isolated regime, Pyongyang is thought to be improving its nuclear weapons capabilities. The North has already conducted three nuclear tests ― in 2006, 2009 and 2013. It has also been pushing to develop a technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads to mount them on long-range ballistic missiles. The North has claimed that it has already succeeded in making “miniaturized, lighter” warheads. The North is believed to possess some 40 kg of plutonium, according to Seoul’s 2014 defense white paper. To produce one nuclear bomb, around 6 kg of plutonium is required. The North is also running a uranium-based nuclear program.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","to curb iran nuclear activities ,nuclear deterrence dampening the mood ,moratorium on its nuclear program ,curb iran nuclear activities that ,dispute over north korea nuclear","['North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Iran', 'U.N.', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Korea', 'Voice of America', 'U.S.', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Robert Gallucci', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'north korean', 'Iran', 'Republican', 'Congress', 'Iran', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'China', 'Britain', 'France', 'Germany', 'Gallucci', 'U.S.', 'iranian', 'north korean', 'iranian', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Obama', 'Yeonpyeongdo', 'Stephan Haggard', 'North Korea', 'the University of California , San Diego', 'the Korea Herald', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Sony', 'U.S.-North Korea', 'Republican', 'Congress', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'Haggard', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 1.          3.          0.         ... -0.6843316  -0.024143

KF-X (KAI)KAI beat Korean Air in a two-way competition to win the country’s largest-ever acquisition deal under which Seoul plans to develop the KF-16-class warplane to replace aging F-4s and F-5s. Seoul seeks to deploy 120 fighters by 2032. The manufacturing cost ― excluding the development cost ― is estimated around 9.6 trillion won.“We have evaluated the development plans of the two candidates, their capabilities and development costs, and picked KAI as the preferred bidder,” the Defense Program Acquisition Administration said in a press release.The DAPA will carry out negotiations with KAI over price and technology-related issues through May, officials said. The national defense acquisition program committee will make a final decision and confirm the winner of the project at its session in June, though KAI will become the winner should there be no serious problems with the firm.KAI participated in the project with a technological partnership with the U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin to win the high-profile project. Meanwhile, Korean Air teamed up with Airbus Defense and Space.From the beginning of the competition, KAI was seen as the most likely winner due to its unrivaled experience in developing military aircraft. KAI has manufactured and exported the T-50 trainer jet and the FA-50 light attack fighter, both of which were developed with technological assistance from Lockheed Martin. It also built the Surion utility helicopter.After the military officially raised the need for the KF-X project in 2002, state and civilian research institutes conducted feasibility studies seven times. But the project has been delayed due to failures to secure adequate funds. Indonesia joined the project, agreeing to shoulder some 20 percent of the development cost. KAI expressed confidence in developing the home-built fighter, which will help bolster national defense and increase defense exports.“We will do our utmost to develop the aircraft, definitely by the deadline, and minimize any aerial security vacuum (that may arise due to a shortage of fighter jets),” KAI said in a press release. “We will also secure our capabilities to upgrade the aircraft to meet the operational needs in future battlefields. Beyond our contribution to national defense, we will also push to develop the aircraft that is exportable.”During Monday’s defense acquisition committee session, defense leaders also decided to purchase Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptors through a government-to-government “foreign military sale” deal with the U.S. government. The committee also picked the U.S. firm Raytheon as a contractor to upgrade the radar and launchers of Korea’s current PAC-2 interception unit. Seoul plans to purchase the PAC-3 interceptors and upgrade the PAC-2 system by 2020 with a budget of around 1.6 trillion won.To counter North Korea’s evolving ballistic missile threats, Seoul has been pushing to upgrade the PAC-2 system with fragmentation-type warheads to the PAC-3 system that employs advanced hit-to-kill technology.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","fighter jet by 2025 seoul ,class warplane to replace aging ,jet by 2025 seoul military ,lockheed martin to win the ,monday defense acquisition committee session","['Korea Aerospace Industries', 'Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Korean Air', 'Seoul', 'KF-16', 'f-5s', 'Seoul', 'KAI', 'the Defense Program Acquisition Administration', 'DAPA', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'U.S.', 'Lockheed Martin', 'Korean Air', 'Airbus Defense and Space', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'Lockheed Martin', 'Indonesia', 'KAI', 'KAI', 'Patriot Advanced', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Raytheon', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,[0.         0.         1.         ... 0.00440882 0.35558179 0.35145277]

The proposal was made by representatives of Chinese firms in Dandong on Thursday when they met with a North Korean trade delegation, led by Pak Ung-sik, director of the North's Korean International Exhibition Corporation, according to a statement posted on the Chinese city's website. More than 70 percent of bilateral trade between North Korea and China is conducted through Dandong. Pak reacted positively to the proposal, saying he would relay it to the relevant North Korean authorities and hopes to hold more discussions over the proposal, according to the statement. Another Chinese border city, Tumen, in the northeastern Jilin province, opened a non-tariff trade market with North Korea in 2010, but the market was quickly suspended as North Korea banned civilians from participating in it due to concerns over the spread of banned materials that may enrage the North's leadership. At that time, Tumen had pledged not to impose tariffs on the trade of goods worth less than 8,000 yuan ($1,287) per person. China's is the economic lifeline of North Korea, but their political ties remain strained over the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear ambitions.

The total to be used for infrastructure will reach $200 million with the IDB pledging to provide matching funds.  In addition to the EDCF with the IDB, Seoul reached an understanding to provide extra support funds to Bolivia and Nicaragua in talks held on the sidelines of the board meeting.  Besides enhancing two-way ties, the IDB members agreed on the forging of a cohesive ""mid-term strategy"" in Busan, which will help the development bank better meet its main goal of poverty reduction, social inequality and gap in productivity that has hindered regional integration.  Members then touched on measures to create a ""New Corporation"" that aims to merge existing private institutions under the IDB into a more centralized entity.  This move, that requires inflow of fresh capital by members, is designed to strengthen the corporation's capabilities and improve efficiency.  South Korea's finance minister said that while the country wants a greater stake in the New Corporation, such a move requires the approval of other IDB members.  Presently, Asia's fourth largest economy only has a negligible 0.002 percent stake in the bank itself and because fresh injections of funds are usually based on existing share holdings, it cannot hold a sizable stake in the new entity, unless changes in capital injections are made.

South Korea announced its decision on Thursday, becoming the latest U.S. ally to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), despite U.S. concerns about the bank's governance structure and decision-making process. ""The Chinese side welcomed South Korea's decision,"" China's finance ministry said in a brief statement. If agreed upon by existing members of the AIIB, South Korea will become a founding member of the new regional lender by April 11, according to the statement. During a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying echoed the welcome, saying that South Korea submitted its application to join the AIIB on Thursday. ""As the chair of the AIIB negotiations, China will consult with existing member states and, if the application gets approved, South Korea will become a prospective founding member of the AIIB,"" Hua said. So far, about 30 countries, including major Western economies such as Britain, Germany and France, have applied to join the AIIB. China has offered $50 billion to the bank, which is expected to start operations by the end of this year, with other member countries expecting to increase the total funding to $100 billion.

The U.S. has said it was considering deploying the missile defense system, known as the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, in South Korea, home to about 28,500 American troops, to better cope with the growing threats of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities.But, China has publicly pressed South Korea to refuse to allow the American missile defense system to be deployed, claiming that the THAAD battery could also target China if deployed in South Korea. In a rare public rebuttal against China's concern over the possible deployment on March 17, South Korea's defense ministry blamed China for trying to ""influence"" Seoul's security policy. During a monthly press briefing on Thursday, China's defense ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng again expressed concern over the matter. ""Our stance on the deployment of the missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region is clear and consistent. And we think that to deploy the missile defense system by some countries in the Asia-Pacific region is neither conducive to the strategic stability and mutual trust, nor to regional peace and stability,"" Geng said, according to a transcript of the press briefing posted on the Chinese ministry's website on Friday. ""And we hope the relevant countries can be prudent in taking actions,"" Geng was quoted as saying. China's concerns over the possible deployment of the THAAD battery in South Korea have illustrated how difficult it is for South Korea and China to develop common security interests in Northeast Asia, despite their booming economic relations. South Korea and the U.S. have called for China, the economic lifeline of North Korea, to do more in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but China's stance over its ideological ally, Pyongyang, has often been self-contradictory. Many analysts believe that China's Communist Party leadership won't put enough pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions because a sudden collapse of the North's regime could threaten China's own security interests.

It argued that existing institutions such as the Asian Development Bank and World Bank have not been able to fully meet regional demands for capital.Data provided by the ADB said infrastructure investment demand among Asian countries will stand at some $730 billion every year at least until 2020. The foreign ministers of China, South Korea, and Japan are seen after a trilateral meeting last Saturday. From left are Wang Yi of China, Yun Byung-se of South Korea and Fumio Kishida of Japan.(Yonhap)""Once AIIB begins operations, it will likely spur large scale infrastructure work in Asia that can help South Korean companies with extensive experience in construction, communication and transportation to expand their market presence,"" the ministry said, making clear that the decision to join had the best interest of the country in mind. It added that becoming an early member of the AIIB can allow the country to expand its financial influence, and permit it to play a greater role in international affairs commensurate with its economic size. The bank is the first multinational financial institution South Korea will join as a founding member.On the governance structure and other safeguards that are needed to run a multinational investment effectively, the finance ministry, which has been in close consultation with all interested parties, stressed it joined forces with countries that have opted to join the AIIB to demand the setting up of operational guidelines that reflect best international practices.""In this regard, considerable headway was made,"" it claimed, adding that it will continue to work with others to enhance transparency, accountability and sustainability of the new institution so it can meet high international standards and contribute to global economic growth.The new bank will be tasked with providing funds and consulting expertise to economies that want to upgrade their social and industrial infrastructure, which is vital for creating an environment for sustainable growth. The move by Seoul, meanwhile, was anticipated as China is South Korea's largest trading partner, surpassing the United States, and a key destination for business investments. The two countries inked a free trade pact, and Seoul is striving to become a leading renminbi hub in the coming years. China is expected to foot the bulk of the initial $50 billion needed to get the bank started, with other members expected to make donations to increase the size of the authorized capital to reach $100 billion.South Korea is seen as wanting to better reflect the country's interest in the overall ownership of the investment bank and play a role in the drafting of the organization's charter that is expected to be released in June.Behind South Korea's decision on the AIIB were complex diplomatic elements, squeezing Seoul between its decades-long alliance with Washington and the reality of Beijing's growing influence. Some observers speculated that it is because of Washington's influence that Seoul had put off joining the investment bank for eight months.Developed European economies such as Britain, Germany, France and Italy have all announced that they will join the AIIB, with New Zealand following suit. Switzerland and Luxembourg have said they will join. The move by such countries has upset the U.S., which has been persuading its trading partners and allies to sit out. Washington had been the first to raise doubts about the China-led institution meeting the rigorous standards of governance the world has come to expect from the World Bank and ADB. It said the new bank must also be clear on what measures it will take on environmental issues such as global warming and social safeguards like people's welfare.Despite such objections, many local economists said that joining the AIIB makes sense for South Korea because local companies, can undertake AIIB-funded infrastructure building projects. While the World Bank and ADB do offer funds, they have in the past come under attack for not responding quickly and effectively to growing infrastructure-related demands in the Asia-Pacific region.""Joining the AIIB will further strengthen South Korea-China economic ties as well as making it possible for the country to directly participate in infrastructure development in developing economies,"" said Lee Moon-ki a professor of China trade and commerce at Sejong University in Seoul said.In regards to the future, South Korean officials have said joining the organization is just the start, with the real challenge coming when the country has to secure voting rights that directly impact its role in the bank. Among Asian members that joined the AIIB, South Korea's economy is the third largest by size after China and India, although all details related to voting rights, including those of China, will be worked out in the next few months.AIIB participants have generally agreed that voting rights will be proportional with the contributions made, with Asian countries largely expected to get 75 percent of the voting rights and the rest going to other outside partners. The structure of the bank will be made up of Board of Governors and Board of Directors as well as a management secretariat, with China unlikely to demand veto power.The finance ministry said while it has agreed to join, with its intent being sent via a formal letter, its status as a founding member will be decided after other countries that joined earlier agree to include the country.Once it becomes a founding member, the National Assembly will be asked to ratify the move, with the AIIB itself to start operation late this year or early 2016.

(Yonhap)A radio communication between the satellite and South Korea’s ground station was established at 1:05 p.m. KST, or 5 hours and 57 minutes after its launch, according to officials from the Korea Aerospace Research Institute.“We may conclude that the launch and deployment of the KOMSAT-3 have been successful following its successful communication with the country’s ground station in Daejeon,” Choi Seok-won, a KARI official in charge of the satellite program, said.Beacon signals from the 1,100-kilogram satellite were earlier picked up by Norway’s Troll Satellite Station, then again by Svalbard Satellite Station in Norway, indicating the satellite has reached its target orbit.The KOMSAT-3A was sent into space on a Russian rocket, Dnepr, a launch vehicle converted from a Soviet-era intercontinental ballistic missile.Real-time observation of the launch was unavailable as the Russian launch pad remains off-limits to public access.The science satellite is designed to complement South Korea’s three other multipurpose science satellites that are currently operational.The KOMSAT-3A is equipped with an optical lens with the highest resolution so far on any South Korean satellite that can provide clear images of any object greater than 0.5 meter in diameter on the Earth’s surface.It is also equipped with an infrared sensor that can detect changes in temperature, enabling it to monitor any volcanic movements or forest fires.Together with the KOMSAT-5, the country’s first science satellite with synthetic aperture radar launched in August 2013, the new satellite will help enable 24-hour monitoring of the Earth’s surface regardless of weather conditions, KARI officials said.The KOMSAT-3A will circle the Earth approximately 15 times a day in a synchronous orbit for the next four years.South Korea is planning to develop its own space launch vehicle for a test launch in 2019.(Joint Press Corps-Yonhap)","russia on thursday yonhap radio ,new science satellite into space ,on russian rocket dnepr launch ,base in russia on thursday ,successfully sent new science satellite","['yasny', 'Russia', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Multipurpose', 'Yasny', 'Moscow', 'the Korea Multipurpose', 'Yasny', 'Russia', 'South Korea ’s', 'KST', 'the Korea Aerospace Research Institute', 'Daejeon', 'Choi Seok - won', 'KARI', 'Beacon', 'Norway ’s Troll Satellite Station', 'Svalbard Satellite Station', 'Norway', 'russian', 'Dnepr', 'Soviet', 'russian', 'South Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'KARI', 'South Korea', 'Press Corps - Yonhap']",3,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.63354343  0.46750721

The sanctions ban all cross-border economic exchanges except for the operation of the inter-Korean industrial park in Gaeseong.“Seoul has called for an apology or an expression of regrets over the sinking before the sanctions are lifted. Such sophistry is not going to work for good,” the North’s powerful National Defense Commission said in a statement issued two days before the fifth anniversary of the attack.“Our consistent claim is that the sanctions that were conjured up based on fabrications (about the sinking of the Cheonan) should be lifted without delay.” Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min (right) speaks during a meeting with party lawmakers at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Yoo called on the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, which recently pledged to become security-oriented, to first acknowledge North Korea’s responsibility for the Cheonan attack. (Yonhap)The NDC also renewed its calls for a joint probe into the sinking, arguing that it can confidently establish its innocence. “Should the South bring all pieces of evidence regarding the sinking of the Cheonan to the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjeom or any place, we can immediately explain to the world what the truths really are,” said the statement. A Seoul-led multinational investigation team concluded in May 2010 that the 1,200-ton vessel was torpedoed by a North Korean midget submarine in the West Sea. The team presented the conclusive evidence ― the North Korea-made torpedo part retrieved from the scene. As for the May 24 sanctions, the Seoul government has recently shown a flexible stance, saying it can discuss all pending issues including the sanctions, the resumption of tours to Mount Geumgangsan and reunions of separated families, when the two Koreas resume talks. But the North has called for the lifting of the sanctions as a precondition to start the long-stalled bilateral dialogue. Cross-border tension has also been ratcheted up as the North hardened its rhetoric against the ongoing South Korea-U.S. military drills. Amid the deadlock in the inter-Korean ties, calls have been growing for Seoul to consider lifting the sanctions. Over the issue, cracks have emerged in the ruling Saenuri Party with some still maintaining a tough stance against the North and others calling for more reconciliatory gestures.Meanwhile, Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min pressed the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy to recognize the North’s culpability for the sinking of the corvette, noting that the liberal party has so far shown a “vague” stance on the issue. “The NPAD can start as a party focusing on security when it clearly recognizes the North’s responsibility for the attack,” he said during a meeting with party lawmakers. The NPAD has recently vowed to become a party focusing more on security issues as the rival parties are gearing up for the April 29 by-elections in which four parliamentary seats are up for grabs.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","may 24 sanctions the seoul ,for the 2010 torpedo attack ,on tuesday repeated its denial ,north korea on tuesday repeated ,lifted the sanctions ban all","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Gaeseong', 'National Defense Commission', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoo', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'North Korea ’s', 'Cheonan', 'inter - korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'NPAD', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.76189786  0.56660223

Jackson served as a strategy adviser and a senior country director for the Pentagon from 2009 to 2014.Kim made the sensitive comment as he called for the deployment of a U.S. missile system, called the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery that is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles in their terminal stage.South Korea is struggling to walk a diplomatic tightrope between the U.S., Seoul's key ally, and China, Seoul's largest trading partner, over whether to allow the U.S. to deploy a THAAD battery to South Korea.Washington hopes to deploy the THAAD in South Korea to counter ballistic missile threats posed by North Korea, saying it is a purely defensive system.Still, China has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the possible deployment of a THAAD battery in South Korea, suspecting it is part of U.S. attempts to contain a rising China.

Last week, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao publicly said Beijing hopes Seoul will take China's concern into consideration.""Without a North Korean threat there, we can talk about the future of missile defense but right now it's entirely unproductive to talk about what else it may be for, given the nature of the North Korean threat,"" said Chiu, who is now serving as a security expert at the Atlantic Council.Van Jackson, a visiting fellow at the Center for a New American Security, also said that missile defense is a ""minimum"" operational counter that the U.S. can use to mitigate growing vulnerabilities to U.S. bases in South Korea and elsewhere.""Within certain cost constraints, the more the better, and being part of an integrated system is optimal. It's not that this is going to solve our problems but this is sort of a minimum measure necessary to be able to sleep at night, to know that we're doing something more than nothing about this problem that's getting worse with time,"" he said.Jackson, who also served as a senior country director for Korea at the Pentagon, also said that he had been ""very much against missile defense because of its cost, because of its effectiveness or unprovenness"" but such views have changed.""It's not that those things are untrue today. It's still expensive and still largely unproven, but it's also one of the least provocative or antagonistic things you can do to mitigate vulnerability,"" he said.

We must remove them and create a mood of peace,” said Rep. Rhee In-jae, a member of the party’s supreme council.“I am sure that letting our money, our aid, and our products flow into the North will hasten unification,” the sixth-term lawmaker said.Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung added weight to adopting a flexible approach, saying “Although humanitarian aid is still viable under the sanctions, we have neglected it.”“There may be a need to reach a middle ground by more actively fostering (humanitarian aid),” Kim said.The party’s floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, however, opposed it.“Some are claiming the sanctions must be scrapped when in fact the North has not taken any measures such as admitting the attack, punishing those responsible, offering an apology or promising such an attack will not happen again,” Yoo said. Party spokesperson Rep. Kim Young-woo sided with Yoo, reportedly saying that lifting sanctions would damage the principle and consistency of policies toward North Korea, aggravating the debate between South Korea’s progressives and conservatives.The sanctions limiting inter-Korean trade and humanitarian aid to the North were levied after a North Korean submarine torpedoed the Cheonan, a South Korean Navy ship in March 2010. This Thursday marks the fifth anniversary.The North has yet to issue an apology over the sinking. It has been the South Korean government’s official stance that the North’s apology is a prerequisite to any reconsideration of the sanctions.But calls to take a more flexible approach have constantly surfaced among the members of the Saenuri Party, as the party struggles to pick up approval ratings by appealing to moderate voters while further consolidating the conservative supporters ahead of next month’s by-elections. Four parliamentary seats are set to be contested in next month’s polls, and three of the voting districts are viewed to be the opposition strongholds.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, has consistently called on the Park Geun-hye administration to remove the so-called May 24 sanctions for the sake of inter-Korean relations.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","after north korean submarine torpedoed ,party butted heads on monday ,north korea following pyongyang sinking ,scrap sanctions on north korea ,north korea aggravating the debate","['Saenuri Party', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'south Korean Navy', 'inter - korean', 'Rhee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Kim', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Yoo', 'Kim Young', 'Yoo', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Cheonan', 'south Korean', 'Navy', 'south korean', 'North ’s', 'the Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'inter - korean', 'Jeong Hunny']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47296652  0.5067749

U.S. President Barack Obama (EPA-Yonhap) and Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP-Yonhap)“For most of the past millennium, of course, China was the dominant country in the region ― the so-called ‘Sinosphere.’ It’s only in the past century and a half that its role has been so significantly reduced,” Rana Mitter, a China expert at the University of Oxford, said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.“China is keen to create a new regional order that will enable it to take the leading role in the region.”Observers say that since Xi Jinping was sworn in as president in March 2013, Beijing has been seen as pursuing a national identity as a great power, given that it has sought a bigger say on global issues and become more aggressive in maritime disputes in the South and East China Seas.“China used to identify itself as the world’s largest developing country. But the perception of its national identity seems to have changed into one as a developing major power,” said Kim Heung-kyu, international relations professor at Ajou University.“China also used to regard itself as a land-based nation, but this perception too has changed into a nation encompassing both land and sea. It is now pursuing an identity as a central, hub nation on the Eurasian continent.”Amid China’s pursuit of a reemergence on the global stage, the U.S. has been carefully watching Beijing’s diplomatic and political moves that could possibly challenge the rules, norms and institutions that Washington has fostered since the end of World War II. It has sought various diplomatic and security measures to maintain the status quo in Asia.China seeking new orderThe ongoing ruckus over the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has revealed one aspect of the Sino-U.S. rivalry. Analysts say that China has sought to establish the bank to revise the U.S.-led financial order. The U.S. has opposed the bank, citing a number of issues including transparency in the bank’s governance structure. Despite Washington’s disapproval, more than 30 nations including Britain, France, Germany and all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have decided to join the AIIB, dealing a blow to the U.S. efforts to keep Western nations out of the ambitious institution. Observers say that the AIIB, which is designed to finance infrastructure projects for underdeveloped countries in Asia, may rival the World Bank and Asia Development Bank that have been dominated by the U.S. and Japan.“These proposals (the AIIB and other Chinese initiatives) suggest that China does want to challenge American leadership of key international institutions, but it has a long way to go before it is in a similar position of power,” said Stephen Walt, political scientist at Harvard University. “If China does move in this direction, it will also have to be willing to take on other global responsibilities, and that is something Beijing has been reluctant to do so far.”The AIIB has a capital target of $100 billion, and China will become the largest stakeholder with its contribution of $50 billion. The bank is expected to become operational by the end of this year. South Korea, a major ally of the U.S., has been under pressure from China to join it as a founding member.The AIIB is not the only initiative that China has put forward in a move to emerge as a financial leader on the global stage. Last year, the leaders of BRICS ― Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa ― agreed to establish a New Development Bank to be headquartered in Shanghai. They also agreed to create the $100 billion Contingency Reserve Arrangement. Although the NDB will be run on an equal-share voting basis, China is expected to wield massive influence over the contingency reserve, given that its contribution will account for more than 40 percent of the total CRA capital.The agreement to create the NDB and CRA are viewed by Western critics as China’s efforts to challenge the Bretton Woods institutions ― World Bank and International Monetary Fund ― to maintain the U.S.-led financial order. China’s recent moves reflect the Asian power’s growing frustration over its limited voting rights in major global financial institutions. It has called for a greater say in the West-dominated institutions that befits its status of the world’s second largest economy. The AIIB could also be used as a tool to promote the yuan as a key global currency.All the commotion about the AIIB has come amid China’s push for an ambitious project, called “One Belt One Road.” The project, which Xi Jinping unveiled during his visit to Kazakhstan in September 2013, seeks to connect China with Europe, Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia through “land and maritime silk roads.”The AIIB is expected to bankroll the massive connectivity project that consists of the “Silk Road Economic Belt” to link China’s landlocked neighbors and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” to connect the littoral states of the Indo-Pacific Oceans. This is the reason why analysts call the AIIB a fundraising organ for China’s version of the “Marshall Plan” ― a U.S. initiative during the Cold War to support the postwar reconstruction of Europe, which helped America enhance its soft power ― one crucial element to become a great power.The connectivity schemes have been promoted as initiatives to promote coprosperity, reduce development gaps and create new business opportunities for China’s neighbors. But observers have viewed the schemes with great suspicion, arguing that China could exploit them to secure its geopolitical interests and establish itself as a regional hegemon.

U.S. Navy (photo by Cameron McCulloch)Geopolitical tensions over China’s logistical projects have been exacerbated by Beijing’s seemingly aggressive stance on maritime sovereignty particularly in the South China Sea where it has engaged in disputes with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. Despite the competing claims over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, China has been turning numerous rocks and reefs in the archipelago into military bases equipped with naval harbors, airstrips, radar facilities and other equipment, reports said.China has delineated its claim to the vast majority of the South China Sea with “the nine-dashed-line,” a maritime demarcation line that takes in more than 80 percent of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer South China Sea.The sea boundary was first published on an official Chinese map in 1948 and has been included in other maps published after the communist state was launched in 1949, according to China’s claim. The critics, however, argue that the boundary was illegal and vague.China’s moves to apparently establish a new order have also been seen in the security realm. Last May, at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, the Chinese leader called for a new Asian security cooperation architecture that would exclude any U.S. involvement. There, he indicated that bilateral military alliances in Asia were the “outdated thinking of the Cold War.”On the economic front, China is pushing to establish the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a mooted free trade deal involving 16 nations including South Korea, China and Japan. But the U.S. has been leading the negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which China has virtually been excluded due to the high standards on labor, intellectual property, the environment and other sections.U.S. struggles to maintain orderAmid China’s moves to apparently reshape the regional order, the U.S. has been deepening its diplomatic and military engagement in the Asia-Pacific with its much-publicized policy, called the “rebalance” toward the region.Noting the looming shift in the dynamics of regional power due to China’s rise, the U.S. has been striving to strengthen its network of alliances and partner nations such as South Korea, Japan, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines to boost bilateral or multilateral diplomatic and security cooperation. One of the biggest concerns for the U.S. is the possibility that China could block what it calls the global commons ― the freedom of navigation and commerce at high sea, which is critical for all Pacific nations to ensure reliable supplies of energy and goods from the Middle East and elsewhere.Thus, China’s aggressive claims to the islands and reefs in the South China Sea have driven the U.S. to strengthen military ties with the countries that have been embroiled in territorial disputes with China.Last April, the U.S. and the Philippines signed the “Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement,” which gives the U.S. military greater access to military bases across the Philippines for a decade, and allows for the increased rotational presence of U.S. troops there.The U.S. has also been upgrading its military ties with Vietnam as concerns have been rising in the Southeast Asian state over China’s maritime assertiveness. The U.S. has been conducting a series of military support programs for Vietnam including the provision of five patrol vessels. With Australia, the U.S. has signed a 25-year deal to allow 2,500 U.S. marines and air force personnel to be deployed to the northern city of Darwin on a rotational basis.Above all, the most crucial security partner for the U.S. in the Asia-Pacific is Japan given that the archipelago state has financial capabilities and military technologies, not to mention the strategic goal of keeping a rising China in check.During Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Washington, slated for late-April, the two allies are expected to sign a revision of its 1997 bilateral defense cooperation guidelines.The revision is expected to contain a set of joint measures to cope with Chinese threats and other newly emerging scenarios. First adopted in 1978 to counter Soviet threats, the guidelines were last amended in 1997 to reflect post-Cold War security threats.Amid China’s growing assertiveness in maritime disputes, the U.S. has also been developing a series of new military strategies and operational tactics. Among them was the AirSea Battle concept that was designed to neutralize the adversaries’ capabilities to block the U.S.’ military’s access to operational areas near Chinese coasts, and to project power across the region.The concept, however, has triggered a controversy due to its apparently hostile connotation and its focus on aerial and naval components that apparently spawned interservice tension and rivalries. In January, Washington dropped the controversial name and renamed it as the “Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons.”The new name apparently reflects the U.S. resolve to protect the global commons amid China’s continued claims over the vast majority of the South and East China Seas that contain the world’s major trade routes.On the diplomatic front, the U.S. has increased its participation in a series of regional summit forums including the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum where Washington has consistently called for a peaceful, diplomatic resolution of regional disputes.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","threats amid china growing assertiveness ,security threats amid china growing ,geopolitical tensions over china logistical ,tensions over china logistical projects ,exacerbated by beijing seemingly aggressive","['U.S.', 'China', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'EPA', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Rana Mitter', 'China', 'the University of Oxford', 'the Korea Herald', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing', 'Kim Heung - kyu', 'Ajou University', 'eurasian', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'China', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'sino', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Britain', 'France', 'Germany', 'the Association of Southeast Asian nation', 'AIIB', 'U.S.', 'western', 'AIIB', 'the World Bank and Asia Development Bank', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'AIIB', 'chinese', 'China', 'american', 'Stephen Walt', 'Harvard University', 'China', 'Beijing', 'AIIB', 'China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'AIIB', 'China', 'BRICS', 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China', 'South Africa', 'New Development Bank', 'Shanghai', 'ndb', 'China', 'CRA', 'NDB', 'CRA', 'western', 'China', 'Bretton Woods', 'World Bank', 'International Monetary Fund', 'China', 'asian', 'AIIB', 'AIIB', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Kazakhstan', 'China', 'AIIB', 'China', 'the Indo - Pacific Oceans', 'China', 'U.S.', 'America', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S. Navy', 'Cameron', 'China', 'Beijing ’s', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Taiwan', 'Brunei', 'China', 'China', 'chinese', 'China', 'China', 'the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures', 'chinese', 'asian', 'U.S.', 'China', 'the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Vietnam', 'Indonesia', 'Philippines', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Philippines', 'U.S.', 'Philippines', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Vietnam', 'southeast asian', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Vietnam', 'Australia', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Darwin', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'Washington', 'chinese', 'soviet', 'amid China ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'ASEAN Regional Forum', 'Washington', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 3.         37.          0.         ... -0.69259644  0.30519763

Should the North proceed with its provocations across the military demarcation line, our military will react in a strong and stern manner,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. It reiterated that the leaflet campaign falls under the freedom of expression, a basic civil right, and thus cannot be forcibly regulated.Earlier in the day, North Korea renewed its threat against the South Korean civic group’s plan to send thousands of anti-Pyongyang leaflets into the hermit kingdom. The group, consisting of North Korean defectors, plans to use hot-air balloons to scatter thousands of leaflets along with copies of the U.S. comedy film “The Interview,” which depicts the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.North Korea warned it will shoot down the balloons and vowed to “strike those who aggravate inter-Korean tensions.” It said South Koreans living near the inter-Korean border should evacuate after the leaflets are sent.Pyongyang said distributing the movie “The Interview” was “a grave provocation and effectively an act of war,” adding that South Korea would have to take blame for “the catastrophic aftermath” of the leaflet campaign.A similar scuffle took place last October, when both sides exchanged fire after balloons carrying anti-North Korea leaflets were launched into the communist country. No casualties or property damage were reported.The two Koreas technically remain at a state of war, after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a cease-fire, instead of a peace treaty.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","north korea which threatened sunday ,korea on sunday vowed firm ,threatened sunday to take military ,carrying anti north korea leaflets ,korea which threatened sunday","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'anti - pyongyang', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'South Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'anti - north Korea', 'Koreas', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.59150738  0.03097453

Burlacu participated in the eighth round of high-level policy consultations at the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, meeting Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yong. They exchanged views on regional political developments; strengthening strategic partnership; and boosting investment in infrastructure, energy and information technology sectors. “Our relations have progressed constantly over the last 25 years and the last several years have seen marked growth and diversification in trade and investment,” Burlacu told The Korea Herald at the Romanian Embassy in Seoul on Mar. 17. “Through our annual consultation, we keep dialogues moving forward and give more substance to our collaboration.”Both diplomats affirmed their commitment to develop the port of Constanta and better manage an IT collaboration center in Romania; they also signed a provisional contract to ease immigration procedures for businesspersons. Romania and Korea established diplomatic relations on March 30, 1990, and strategic partnership on September 11, 2008.  Romanian Vice Foreign Minister Carmen Burlacu (left) and Romanian Ambassador to Korea Fabian Calin speak to The Korea Herald at the Romanian Embassy in Seoul on March 17 about the eight rounds of policy consultation held during Burlacu’s visit and the EU Strategy for the Danube region. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The strategic partnership led to a joint action plan decreeing holding annual consultations to promote political dialogue, economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges through tourism, educational and cultural programs.Discussions on implementing concrete measures are made to address bilateral, regional and international issues under the umbrella of the plan, Burlacu said.Romanian Ambassador to Korea Fabian Calin explained that policy consultations involve “reviewing the agenda” without having to “show something extraordinary,” such as signed agreements as is often the case during minister-level visits. “The point is to figure out where the gaps are in our relationship, to fill in the missing link,” Calin said. “Like in music, diplomats try to keep the rhythm of dialogue flowing free of interruption.” Since 1990, bilateral trade volume increased nearly seventyfold, topping $1.24 billion last year. Over 220 Korean companies, including Samsung Otelinox, LG Electronics, Hyosung Corp., Doosan IBGM and Daewoo Mangalia Heavy Industries, have invested in Romania with cumulative investment over $650 million, according to Korea’s Foreign Ministry. Information communication technology, agriculture, renewable energy, oil and gas industries have much potential for enhancement, said Burlacu. Burlacu has been a career diplomat with experience at the United Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, European Union and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Previously she was an ambassador to Ireland and became a state secretary of global affairs since May last year. The vice minister highlighted Romania’s involvement in the EU Strategy for the Danube project, which aims to enhance physical connectivity along Europe’s second longest river by developing harbors and infrastructures.“Korean companies can enter into the heart of the Europe, all the way into Germany, through the Danube starting from the Black Sea,” Burlacu explained. “Watercourse is also the most economic and environment-friendly means of transport.”The Danube Strategy ranges from area-specific to regionwide projects, and Romania and Korea are in the process of identifying joint ventures, she said. Similar to the Mekong River Development Strategy, the EU-led initiative aims to increase mobility, protect environment, promote prosperity and strengthen institutional capacity and security across the Danube by conjoining various stakeholders.Calin pointed out, “There is a much deeper philosophy behind the strategy ― facilitating regional dialogue across and between the Balkan and Central European countries and integrating them economically.”Burlacu said that by participating, Korea can materialize visions envisioned in the biennial Asia-Europe Meeting and triennial World Water Forum.The ASEM is an international forum established in 1996 to foster cooperation between Europe and Asia through political, economic, social, cultural and educational ties to achieve a more balanced world order. Korea will host the seventh WWF in Daegu and Gyeongbuk from April 12-17 to address global water challenges and mobilize innovative solutions and joint policy actions.Romania will participate in the Water Forum to promote its hydro energy and transport industries. Romania also took part in the Yeosu World Expo 2012 in Korea with a pavilion dedicated to the Danube Delta that attracted over 800,000 visitors.

Park Sang-hak, head of the activist group, said earlier this month he and other North Korean defectors would release balloons holding 500,000 leaflets, as well as DVDs of the U.S. film ""The Interview,"" a comedy depicting a fictitious assassination of the North's leader Kim Jong-un. According to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the KPA's open notice said the campaign ""deliberately (escalates) tension on the Korean peninsula where the situation has reached the brink of war"" on top of the annual Seoul-Washington military drills that kicked off March 2. Should the campaign be carried out, the North's frontline army will ""blow up"" the balloons with ""all the firepower strike means,""it said, adding that any countermeasures will ""entail double and treble merciless retaliatory strikes.""In October the two Koreas exchanged gunfire after the North attempted to shoot down balloons carrying similar leaflets. South Korea suffered no casualties or property damage. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said it will handle any provocation by the North with ""powerful and firm"" measures. ""A civic group's scattering of leaflets is a part of its rights to free speech, and we clearly state once again that it is those people's judgment call to make and cannot be restricted by force,"" the JCS said in a release. The two Koreas are technically still at war after the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.Nearly 2 million troops, including 28,500 U.S. forces, are on standby across the heavily armed border. Despite Pyongyang's continued threats pressing the South Korean government to put a stop to the anti-North campaigns, the conservative Park Geun-hye administration here maintains that it does not have the legal means to forbid it, which could be seen as a restriction on freedom of speech. A recent court ruling, however, dictated that while freedom of speech is a relevant factor, authorities can ban the spread of the fliers if it puts public safety at risk, considering Pyongyang's warnings of military retaliation. The unification ministry said it respects the court's decision and that it will continue to seek appropriate measures to protect people from any possible outbursts by the North.

The trilateral meeting was held for the first time in almost three years.""The three ministers decided to continue their efforts to hold the trilateral summit at the earliest convenient time for the three countries,"" Yun told a press conference.A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012.In November, South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed her hope to meet with the Chinese and Japanese leaders following a meeting of their top diplomats.""By facing history squarely and advancing toward the future, the three foreign ministers also agreed that the three nations should address related issues properly and to work together to improve bilateral relations and to strengthen trilateral cooperation,"" Yun added.Relations between South Korea and Japan, and China and Japan have been strained for years due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation.Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.South Korea and Japan have long been at odds over the issue of Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan's troops during World War II.Meanwhile, China and Japan have been sparring over a territorial dispute involving islands in the East China Sea, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.""For the three countries, the issue of shared history is not a matter of the past, but a current issue,"" Wang said in a press conference. ""It is important to face up to the history and move forward to the future based on such understanding.The foreign ministers also reaffirmed their ""firm opposition""to North Korea's nuclear weapons program.""The three ministers decided to continue their joint efforts to resume meaningful six-party talks to make substantial progress in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" a joint statement showed.The six-party talks involving the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia have been dormant since late 2008 when the North walked away from the negotiation table.Pyongyang later demanded that the six-party talks should resume without any preconditions. But Seoul and Washington have said that North Korea should first demonstrate its willingness to denuclearize.""We cannot tolerate Pyongyang's nuclear program. It is important to make the world free of nuke weapons as this year marks the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan,"" Kishida said.The ministers also agreed to make efforts towards the acceleration of negotiations for a trilateral free trade agreement.The trilateral meeting also came at a time when Seoul's diplomacy has been put to the test amid a mounting Washington-Beijing row over the possibility of an advanced U.S.missile defense system on Korean soil and a China-led Asian development bank.South Korea is struggling to walk a diplomatic tightrope between the U.S., Seoul's key ally, and China, Seoul's largest trading partner, over the sensitive security issue.Separately, Yun held bilateral meetings with Wang and Kishida, respectively, earlier in the day.Wang did not bring up the controversial issue of Washington's possible deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system on Korean soil at the meeting with Yun, according to a Seoul official.Yun and Fumio, meanwhile, agreed to make efforts for progress over ongoing bilateral talks on the former sex slaves.Last April, Seoul and Tokyo launched talks on Japan's sex slavery, but no breakthrough has been made due largely to Japan's attitude.

We don't want war but we are not afraid of war. This is our policy of the government.''North Korea is thought to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs and has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006. But experts are divided on how far it has come in developing the technology needed to miniaturize warheads so they can be placed on missiles.The spokesman for South Korea's Defense Ministry, Kim Min-seok, said Saturday that while North Korea might have advanced its technologies for miniaturizing nuclear warheads so they can be installed on missiles, Seoul does not believe they have succeeded yet. Kim pointed out that the North has conducted only three nuclear tests so far and it's unclear how successful they were. The Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security recently estimated that North Korea currently has between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons, some based on plutonium, others on uranium. It concluded that North Korea already has plutonium-based weapons small enough to mount on medium-range and intercontinental-range missiles.The United Nations has imposed sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.Hyun's comments come as rival South Korea and the United States conduct annual springtime military drills that North Korea says are aimed at preparing to topple its government.

The system is seen as a strong deterrent to long-range artillery threats posed by North Korea, which has built up its rocket capabilities. The move came after Seoul and Washington agreed last year to retain the 210th Brigade in its current location until around 2020, when South Korean forces are expected to complete their counter-fire reinforcement plan. The agreement has sparked controversy over a reversal of their earlier plan to move all U.S. troops south of the South Korean capital.In Washington, Army spokesman Lt. Col.

The vessels were supposed to be deployed from August 2015 to 2019.  After a four-week inspection of the project, the Defense Acquisition Procurement Agency found that the hull-mounted sonar to be installed on the vessels failed to meet the standards of required operational capability, according to its officials.  ""We've also learned that the contractor for the towed array sonar does not have the ability to fulfill the deal,"" a DAPA official said, adding that the agency canceled the contracts with the two companies at the end of last year and has been searching for new contractors.  According to the inspection results, the DAPA even received two types of sea-searching equipment, another key part of the 700-ton minesweepers, without checking their test certificates.  ""Officials in charge received the certificates later but they were found to be forged,"" another DAPA official said. The fabricated documents left the procurement agency unable to check if the equipment was fit for the ships.  The minesweepers were to be put into service starting August this year, but the faulty parts will delay the deployment at least one year, he said.  The sub-standard HMS was the same as that to be installed on the country's controversial salvage ship Tongyeong. The component's failure to meet the military's standard prevented the country's first indigenous salvage ship from being delivered to the Navy.  The minesweeper case comes as the government has launched a massive inspection into a series of irregularities in the defense industry.

Speculation has grown recently over the health of Kim, who is 87 years old.   If Kim retires, Choe Thae-bok, chairman of the SPA, is a candidate to succeed him, the observers said.  In the previous session held in September last year, Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political department of the Korean People's Army, was appointed vice chairman of the National Defense Commission.  Defense Minister Hyon Yong-chol and Ri Pyong-chol, vice chief of the KPA General Staff, were named new members of the commission chaired by leader Kim.

And we think they already miniaturized some of this capability,"" Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.  In October, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said that as USFK commander, he assumes the North has the capabilities to miniaturize nuclear warheads and that the country has ""the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they have.""  Early this year, South Korea's Defense Ministry said in its ""white paper"" report that it believes the communist nation has reached a ""significant"" point in efforts to mastering the warhead miniaturization technology.  The U.S. Department of Defense later said, however, that there is no evidence the North has mastered the miniaturization technology, and what Scaparrotti said was that it is prudent for him as a commander to prepare for such a contingency.  North Korea has conducted three underground nuclear tests so far, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The country has also conducted a series of long-range missile or rocket launches since 1998. In its latest launch in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.  Experts have warned that it is only a matter of time until the North develops nuclear-tipped missiles.  Joel Wit, editor of the website 38 North, and David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security, also said that they believe the North can miniaturize warheads sufficiently to place them on the Nodong medium-range ballistic missiles.   The two experts on North Korea's nuclear program made the claim in an article while rejecting criticism of their surprising estimate announced late last month that the North's nuclear arsenal could expand to 100 weapons by 2020.

Over the course of time, Germany was unified while Korea still remains divided. Thus, the end of the war left unfinished business for Korea, and the Cold War structure still persists here,” said Huh Moon-young, a senior fellow at the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification.“We should break the Cold War mentality to bring in a new era, new perspectives. Thus, the THAAD issue will be a crucial litmus test for Korea that will affect not only Korea but also Northeast Asia as a whole. We cannot solve this issue with a dichotomous way of thinking.”Indeed, in Korea, any sensitive issue that involves the U.S. and China has turned into a tricky diplomatic choice for South Korea, which wants to maintain both its security alliance with the U.S. and strategic partnership with China.Thus, debate on such issues tend to focus on which side South Korea should take ― rather than on the security aspect of the issue ― based apparently on the views that, like the Soviet-U.S. relationship, the U.S.-China relations would only be a “zero-sum” game in which one side’s gains mean the other side’s loss.In the case of THAAD, public discussion has centered on whether Seoul should okay the U.S.’ dispatch of THAAD here ― not on whether THAAD is really an effective option to counter North Korea’s missile threats, or whether there is any alternative to better defend the South.“The world is far more complex with growing economic interdependence, international rules and all. The U.S. and China are not running toward each other on a one-dimensional line only to clash,” said Kim Tae-hyun, political scientist at Chung-Ang University and chairman of the Korean Association of International Studies. “There may be four or five more dimensions in the Sino-U.S. relations, or perhaps more than that. (The public and media) seem to only pay attention to that one security dimension when they talk about the multidimensional relations.”Touching on the causes of the failures to see the multifaceted aspects of the relations between the major powers, Kim noted that in the public domain, there tend to be a flurry of conspiracy theories due to Korea’s historical experience of victimization by foreign forces. He added that the public and media tended to exaggerate, simplify or overly generalize complicated issues as they often do not seriously affect citizens’ daily lives. Beyond the domestic factors, the trend of power politics in East Asia and beyond appears to have affected the Cold War-era thinking in Korea, according to Jo Yang-hyeon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.“Along with the national division on the peninsula, elements of power politics, which have recently been strengthened amid tension between the U.S. and Russia and between the U.S. and China, might have impacted the way we view our relations with China and the U.S.,” he said.Amid the “U.S. vs. China” debate, Seoul officials vowed to make their decision on the issue strictly from the standpoint of national interests and military efficacy. Yet, the toughest challenge facing Seoul comes from the symbolism that the public attaches to THAAD.Should Seoul consent to the deployment in South Korea of THAAD, one of the core strategic U.S. defense assets, the public would perceive the country as a staunch ally of the U.S. that would stand up against future U.S. adversaries, potentially China and Russia. If THAAD is installed here, Seoul would likely be the first U.S. ally to host a THAAD battery, which would further reinforce the symbolism. The U.S. currently runs four THAAD batteries in the U.S. mainland and Guam, and plans to deploy a few THAAD batteries to its allies including Korea.Analysts say that to overcome the symbolism, the public debate should be oriented toward enhancing national interests rather than churning out “U.S. vs. China” discourse, and that the government should employ a more strategic, prudent diplomacy to persuade Beijing of its intentions about the security cooperation with the U.S.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","will complicate seoul strategic approaches ,vs china debate seoul officials ,toughest challenge facing seoul comes ,will complicate seoul strategic ,and will complicate seoul strategic","['U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Sino - U.S.', 'Koreas', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea Institute for National Unification', 'thaad', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Soviet', 'U.S.', 'u.s.-china', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Kim Tae - hyun', 'Chung - Ang University', 'the Korean Association of International Studies', 'sino', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Jo Yang - hyeon', 'the Korea National Diplomatic Academy', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Guam', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Beijing', 'the U.S.By Song Sang - ho']",11,"[ 3.          9.          0.         ... -0.6258288   0.34877118

Launched in 2011, the KIDD is a comprehensive defense meeting between the allies that integrates the three existing bilateral consultative meetings ― the Security Policy Initiative, Extended Deterrence Policy Committee and Strategic Alliance 2015 Working Group.The allies have so far maintained that there have not been any bilateral consultations over THAAD, even though the U.S. carried out a site survey in Korea last year to find suitable locations for the missile defense asset, which China argues could threaten its security.Seoul has been under pressure to make a clear decision over whether to allow the U.S. Forces Korea to run THAAD as senior Beijing officials have repeatedly expressed opposition to its deployment. Under the mutual defense treaty, the U.S. must consult with Korea over a plan to install new military equipment on its territory.On Tuesday, Seoul’s Defense Ministry displayed discomfort over Beijing increasing pressure on Seoul to oppose the deployment of THAAD, saying a neighboring country “should not attempt to exert influence over Seoul’s security policies.”Before the KIDD meeting, the allies’ military leaders are expected to touch on the THAAD issue. U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey will visit Seoul later this month. He will hold talks with South Korean JCS Chairman Adm. Choi Yun-hee over bilateral issues that observers say may include the THAAD.The THAAD is a core element of the U.S.’ multilayered missile defense program. It is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the terminal phase of flight after detecting the missiles with land-based radar that has a maximum range of about 1,800 km.The U.S. THAAD program currently consists of seven THAAD batteries. Lockheed Martin, the U.S. defense giant and contractor for the THAAD program, has so far delivered four THAAD batteries to the U.S. government. It is to deliver the remainder according to the U.S. government’s schedule. Three of the four delivered batteries have been deployed on the U.S. mainland, while the other has been installed in Guam. A THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors (eight per launcher), a fire control and communications unit and an AN/TPY-2 radar.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","next month to discuss bilateral ,territory on tuesday seoul defense ,seoul and washington will discuss ,visit seoul later this month ,on tuesday seoul defense ministry","['Seoul', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'Defense', 'KIDD', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Yoo Jeh - seung', 'U.S.', 'Defense for East Asia David Helvey', 'KIDD', 'the Security Policy Initiative', 'Working Group', 'thaad', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'KIDD', 'thaad', 'U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Martin Dempsey', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Choi Yun - hee', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Lockheed Martin', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Guam', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.87017721  0.45888025

""The government did a good job in stating, albeit belatedly, that China and other neighboring countries should not try to influence our security.""  The ruling party has been in close consultations with the government and the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae over the issue and plans to back up the government if it makes the right decision based on national security considerations, he added.  The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, denounced the government's move as ""very inappropriate,"" saying it could lead to diplomatic friction and tensions between Seoul and Beijing.  ""The incompetence of Cheong Wa Dae, and especially the National Security Council, is inviting diplomatic trouble,"" Kim Yung-rok, NPAD's senior spokesman, said during a press briefing at the National Assembly.

""After all, it has been one of the most urgent and critical security issues not only between Seoul and Washington but in terms of their relations with China.""  China has increased pressure on South Korea to not go through with the possible deployment of the battery here, claiming it will hamper its security interests. Stressing that the system aims to better counter North Korea's nuclear and missiles threat, however, Seoul has said the battery will help boost national security though it has no plan to buy one.  Also drawing attention is whether the issue is to be on the table during the planned talks between the chairmans of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from South Korea and the U.S. slated for this month in Seoul.   Gen. Martin Dempsey is scheduled to visit South Korea later this month ""to meet with his South Korean counterpart Adm. Choi Yun-hee and discuss a wide range of issues including how to further boost joint defense posture,"" according to a Seoul official.   Dempsey's trip here is considered a return visit before he leaves office in May, the official said, noting Choi traveled to the U.S. in July last year.   The allies have said the primary purpose of a THAAD battery on the peninsula is to better defend South Korea from the North's evolving security threats and to guarantee the safety of the U.S. troops stationed here and their families.  Seoul's defense ministry, however, said whether to bring THAAD here ""does not have to be included in the list of agendas"" for the April talks, though Seoul and Washington have been in working-level discussions on when to hold the meeting and what to discuss during the meeting.  THAAD is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at a higher altitude in their terminal phase using a hit-to-kill method.  Whether to bring THAAD to South Korea has drawn keen attention as it is seen by critics as part of a broader U.S. attempt to get the Asian ally to join its air defense system.  Instead of joining the U.S. missile defense, however, South Korea has been developing KAMD, a low-tier air defense program, and the Kill Chain, which is designed to launch strikes right after signs are detected of imminent nuclear or missile provocations by Pyongyang.

Their relations worsened further after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came into office as he took a series of nationalistic steps.  The two countries have not held a formal bilateral summit for more than two years as Tokyo has refused to accept Seoul's demand that it take sincere steps to resolve the issue of Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.  The United States has called for Seoul and Tokyo to come to terms with each other.

Although politicization of such issues is inevitable given the nature of a democracy, its intensity appears to be greater than in other countries due to the political and ideological polarization of South Korean society, observers noted.“The increasing fragmentation of South Korea’s political arena has arguably led to an erosion of strategic consensus, which subsequently resulted in contrasting calibrations in South Korea’s defense planning processes,” said Michael Raska, research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, affiliated with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.“The evolving and diverse nature of inter-Korean relations over the past decade has polarized South Korea’s political arena, with persisting debates on the magnitude and character of North Korean threats; terms and conditions of potential Korean unification; changes in U.S. strategy; and levels of American security commitment to South Korea.” Activists wave national flags of Korea and the U.S. along with pickets condemning pro-North Korean forces on March 10 in Gwanghwamun, Seoul, following a knife attack by a radical activist on U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert on March 5. (Yonhap)With the society divided over issues that require exhaustive consideration of diplomatic, security and technical factors, many of Seoul’s security initiatives have been delayed or scrapped due to negative public opinion that was shaped amid political wrangling. In some cases, delays in security projects resulted in a waste of taxpayers’ money.Park Won-gon, international politics professor at Handong Global University, said that the government should strive to insulate security issues from political influence, though it might not be an easy task given that the government should reflect public opinion in formulating policies.“Security issues should not be politicized considering that security is, in some sense, a public good, and is something that involves careful technical, professional considerations. Thus, security policies could, sometimes, run counter to popular opinion,” he said.“It is often dangerous to leave all complicated issues completely open for debate among the public and politicians, who may lack expertise and knowledge on those issues. It is of course important for the government to persuade the citizens of their policies after careful consideration of interests.”One hot-button issues is the U.S.’ possible dispatch of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system to the peninsula. It has been stuck in intense political debate, triggering concerns that politicization of the issue would limit policymakers’ strategic options. The March 5 attack by a radical activist on U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert reignited the debate, as throngs of South Koreans took to the streets calling for a stronger Seoul-Washington alliance with conservative groups becoming vocal about the eradication of pro-North forces.Some lawmakers of the conservative ruling Saenuri Party jumped into the fray, arguing that THAAD batteries would help better cope with North Korean threats. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, said that THAAD would create a Cold War-like tension and damage economic ties with China. Beijing’s repeated displays of opposition to THAAD, in turn, further escalated the political debate.“The strong Chinese statements coupled with the importance of China to the ROK (Republic of Korea) economy have politicized this issue and will affect many others in the future if South Korea sets the wrong precedent,” said Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the think tank RAND Corp.The Seoul government is aware of the need for THAAD to better deter North Korea’s escalating missile threats. But it has so far rejected the possibility of purchasing it due to the political overtones amid partisan wrangling.Instead, Seoul has decided to develop the L-SAM, which is the long-range surface-to-air missile with interception capabilities similar to those of THAAD, as part of efforts to construct an independent missile defense system, called the Korea Air and Missile Defense. Critics argue that when Seoul recognizes the need for THAAD, developing a new missile defense platform may not be a wise option considering that the development would take much time and money when THAAD has already been developed through trial and error.In a similar case, the delay in a controversial security project because of political confrontation has resulted in massive financial damages.The government has been pushing to develop a strategic naval base on Jejudo Island. But the completion of its construction has been delayed for more than a year due to partisan bickering and objections mostly from leftist activists. Damages from the delay are estimated to be nearly 19 billion won ($16.8 million).Military officials have claimed that the naval base is necessary to properly cope with contingencies in the southern sea area, secure the country’s maritime transportation routes and help boost the regional economy. But critics argued that the naval base can be used by the U.S. military as a strategic outpost to secure its regional maritime hegemony.Security issues have also been politicized due to historical conflicts. The public has opposed any security collaboration with Japan, South Korea’s onetime colonizer, posing a challenge to Seoul’s efforts to foster practical cooperation with Tokyo to counter North Korean threats.In 2012, Seoul and Tokyo failed to sign a military intelligence sharing deal amid strong public opposition. Last year, Seoul, Washington and Tokyo managed to sign a trilateral information sharing arrangement despite strong protests from progressive activists.“Many Americans have difficulty understanding why historical issues appear to take precedence over current security requirements, failing to recognize that security cooperation is fundamentally based on trust, which has been seriously eroded by starkly different views of historical events,” said Bennett.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea escalating missile threats but ,polarized south korea political arena ,korea escalating missile threats ,has polarized south korea political ,north korea escalating missile threats","['U.S.', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Michael Raska', 'the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies', 'Nanyang Technological University', 'Singapore', 'inter - korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'american', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Gwanghwamun', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'pro - north', 'Saenuri Party', 'north korean', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'China', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'China', 'ROK', 'South Korea', 'Bruce Bennett', 'RAND Corp.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Americans', 'Bennett', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 4.          2.          0.         ... -0.82608348  0.44237649

It is a matter that can be resolved if you join hands and go together with the government,"" Lee Kang-woo, chief of the ministry's Kaesong district development bureau, said in the session held in Seoul.  Last month, Pyongyang announced that it would increase the minimum wage for its workers in the joint venture from $70.35 to $74 starting in March.  Should the South's firms comply with the North's decision, which is not based on a mutual agreement, it would set a bad precedent, Lee stressed.  The government may even push for legal and administrative punishment against companies that accept the North's demand, Lee said.  Meanwhile, more than a dozen South Korean businessmen with factories in the Kaesong zone will visit the zone on Wednesday to meet the North's related officials, according to the ministry.  About 15 representatives from the council of those firms plan to deliver their position directly to the North, it said.    The North has rejected the South's repeated offer of government-level dialogue to discuss the wage problem and other pending issues on the operation of the Kaesong facilities, saying it is a matter associated with its sovereignty.   The communist nation has instead ratcheted up pressure on the South's firms.  The North's Central Special Development Guidance Bureau convened a meeting with the heads of the South's factories and offices in the Kaesong complex at 11 a.m. Tuesday, a ministry official told reporters on background.  They refused to attend it, however, at the request of the South Korean government, he said.  The South's firms, mostly small and medium-sized ones, employ about 53,000 North Korean workers in the complex created in 2004 to combine the North's cheap labor and the South's capital and technology.

The country, including its capital city of Seoul with more than 10 million people, is within striking distance of North Korea's missiles.  ""The threats posed by North Korea are considerably substantial and we need to brace for them,"" Lee said at the hearing.  South Korean officials have said a THAAD battery, if deployed by U.S. troops in South Korea, could be helpful in the country's security and defense. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea as a deterrence against North Korea.  Lee also said South Korean activists and North Korean defectors should continue their ""efforts to spread the truth to North Korea,"" referring to leaflets critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  However, he mentioned that the South Korean government should take steps in the leaflet campaign in case public safety is jeopardized as well, though he did not elaborate.  Propaganda leaflets have long been a constant source of tension between the two rival Koreas. Tension flared up in October when the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the border after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.  North Korea, which bristles at any outside criticism of its leader, has since ratcheted up rhetoric against South Korea over the anti-Pyongyang leaflets.  Lee also vowed not to engage in any illegal activities as he promised to reform the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's top spy agency whose image was sullied by a series of scandals, including election meddling, in recent decades.  Lee said he will make a clear break from the past, noting that any political intervention by the agency will ""ruin the NIS.""  Last month, the Seoul High Court sentenced Won Sei-hoon, who headed the NIS from 2009 to 2013, to three years in prison for intervening in the 2012 presidential election.  The parliamentary confirmation hearing is widely seen as a formality because Lee's formal appointment as the spy chief does not require approval from the National Assembly.

Tom Cotton in an interview with CBS.""Now the world has to live with the consequences of a nuclear North Korea. I don't want the world to live with the consequences of a nuclear Iran.""The 1994 deal, which committed Pyongyang to freeze and ultimately abandon its nuclear program, fell apart in late 2002 as the communist regime was found to have pursued a clandestine nuclear program in violation of the agreement.Cotton led 46 other Republican senators in sending an open letter last week that warned Iran's leaders any deal with the Obama administration could be undone after Obama leaves office in 2017. The Obama administration heavily denounced the letter as interfering and undermining negotiations with Tehran.Cotton denounced the deal being negotiated with Iran as ""a very bad deal.""""It would allow Iran to have thousands and thousands of centrifuges to continue enriching uranium,"" he said. ""It would do nothing to the military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. It's excluded entirely the ballistic missile program that Iran has, which is designed solely to strike the United States right here at home.""The senator also said he has no regrets about the open letter to Iranian leaders.Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also cited North Korea as a bad example of U.S. efforts to get a foreign nation to give up nuclear ambitions, as he delivered a powerful speech before a joint session of U.S. Congress.""Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn't stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb,"" Netanyahu said. ""Now, we're warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs.""Netanyahu was referring to a recent estimate by U.S. experts that Pyongyang's nuclear stockpile could expand from the current 10-16 nuclear weapons to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.""Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors ...

Last week, the U.S. Forces Korea confirmed for the first time that the military has carried out a site survey for possible stationing of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system. Though no final decision had been reached on its deployment or location, THAAD would help stave off threats from North Korea, the USFK said. “THAAD is one of the assets to be provided by the U.S. military in case of an emergency on the Korean Peninsula,” a military source was quoted as saying by Yonhap. “My understanding is that the THAAD system is easy to mobilize as (it is) transferrable by military aircraft.” THAAD is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal stage. The months-long study is believed to have taken place early last year at five sites including Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province; Wonju, Gangwon Province; and Busan. But Seoul has been reluctant over its stationing as it would spark repercussions at home and abroad by giving signs that the country is joining the U.S.-led global missile defense program, which China and Russia deem is directed at them. As an alternative, the government has been developing its independent Korea Air and Missile Defense system, a low-tier, multiple-interception scheme aimed at destroying incoming missiles at altitudes of 40-50 kilometers.South Korea also opposes the deployment of AN/TPY-2, an early missile warning system capable of detecting missiles up to 2,000 kilometers away, which covers China’s military facilities.“Our military has our own missile warning system, Green Pine, which has a range of 600 kilometers, so we don’t need AN/TPY-2 if we were solely to stay ready for North Korean nuclear and missile threats,” a Seoul official said.Debate is nonetheless heating up here after some lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party relayed calls for an introduction of a THAAD battery in the wake of a recent knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in Seoul.As the issue topped the agenda for a high-level three-way meeting on Sunday between the party, the administration and Cheong Wa Dae, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination Hyun Jung-taik took a veiled swipe at the party for chipping hurriedly in with suggestions for a THAAD adoption, saying that the economy and people’s livelihood must take center stage at the talks. Meanwhile, an intensive diplomatic race is set to unfold in Seoul this week as top Washington and Beijing officials are scheduled to arrive. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel will respectively hold consultations with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Kyung-soo starting Monday and pay a visit to Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong. Another key sticking point is Seoul’s possible participation in the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which the U.S. opposes. Some 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed throughout South Korea as the two Koreas are technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in armistice, not a peace treaty.

Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon visited for a three-day trip to meet Korean counterpart Han Min-koo and sign a memorandum of understanding geared at joint exercises, training exchange, intelligence sharing and humanitarian relief. With progress in the peace process launched in 2012 to end half a century of conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the defense chief promoted his country’s enhanced security environment for foreign investors. “My visit was about recognizing our achievements so far and creating a framework for future cooperation,” Pinzon told The Korea Herald at the Colombian Embassy in Seoul on Thursday. “It would be fair to say that the last five years of our defense collaboration have borne more fruitful results than the last 50 years combined.” Colombia and Korea began strengthening military cooperation in recent years that included vice-ministerial visits and MOUs being signed, transfer of a warship, and participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.  From left: Colombian Defense Attache Col. Gonzalo Herrera Cepeda, Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon, Colombian Ambassador to Korea Tito Saul Pinilla, Korean Defense Attache Lt. Col. Jung Chang-woo and Colombian Deputy Head of Mission Manuel Solano pose at the Colombian Embassy in Seoul on Thursday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Colombia was the only South American country to dispatch troops to the Korean War (1950-53) as part of the United Nations Forces. Of more than 5,300 Colombian soldiers who fought, 131 men died in combat, 476 were injured and 69 went missing. Pinzon expressed being impressed by Korea’s miraculous development from the ruins of the war, affirming his government’s determination to follow suit. “Due to our history of violence and conflict with guerilla groups,” he said, “Colombia’s defense ministry became the most important outlet for exercising public policy.”Combating one of the bloodiest and longest insurgencies in modern history, the administration under President Juan Manuel Santos has made critical inroads into the peace process, the minister pointed out. The negotiations underway in Cuba led to three of the five points in the agenda being signed: land reforms to boost agricultural production, political participation of FARC members and counternarcotics policies. The more difficult parts remain with confiscating weapons and compensating victims. According to the New York Times, the process has reached a “make-or-break” phase ― the ultimate success hinging upon “the willingness of Colombians to make tough compromises” with the guerilla organization. The Times credited President Santos for making strides in the deal, noting that reported incidents of violence dropped from over 2,000 in 2013 to less than 1,200 last year. With improved political stability and public security, the Colombian economy’s growth has surpassed 4 percent annually for the last decade, one of the fastest rates in Latin America. Foreign direct investment rushed into Colombia, with spikes in 2011 ($13.4 billion) and 2012 ($15.8 billion), according to the World Bank. “We were only able to reach this stage by the combined success of our military and police, who put together their strategy, sacrifice and heroism,” Pinzon said. “We can now devote efforts into noncombat areas like development, environment protection, border security, joint training and exercise, international peacekeeping and peace-building operations.”Pinzon invited Korean companies to participate in modernization programs through joint venture projects, training and technology transfer for the country’s 420,000-strong military and law enforcement.In return, “Colombia stands ready to share our expertise in counterterrorism and conflict management to help relieve tensions with North Korea,” he said. The 43-year-old wunderkind from Bogota is the youngest defense minister in Colombian history. He has an extensive background in economics, finance and public policy, having studied at Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University in the U.S.Colombia has relatively young ministers compared to other governments: Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin, 51; Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas Santa Maria, 52; Information Communication Technology Minister Diego Molano Vega, 47; and Education Minister Gina Maria Parody, 41. The trend of young leaders in office is not exclusive to the Santos administration, Pinzon said, explaining, “As a result of our conflict-ridden life, young Colombians have long been drawn to the public sphere with zeal.”“Under such circumstances,” he added, “It’s natural for people to search for ways to help, support and change the country. This energy has actually changed our country.”Pinzon put ministers’ first-rate academic credentials in the limelight, pointing out they helped steer government politics and policies in a progressive direction. The minister’s own experience at the World Bank, Finance Ministry, Colombian Banking Association and Citigroup proved instrumental in economizing the defense budget. “Defense is as much about economics as politics of security and order,” Pinzon said. “To move massive resources, train personnel and update equipment, a modern military requires an integrative strategy combing public policy, private investment and social initiative, recognizing that peace cannot be made by force only.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","korea last week colombian defense ,official visiting korea last week ,visiting korea last week colombian ,korea last week colombian ,in seoul on thursday joel","['Colombia', 'Korea', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'colombian', 'Juan Carlos Pinzon', 'korean', 'Han Min - koo', 'the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia', 'FARC', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Colombian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'United Nations', 'colombian', 'Gonzalo Herrera Cepeda', 'colombian', 'Juan Carlos Pinzon', 'colombian', 'Korea', 'Tito Saul Pinilla', 'Korean Defense Attache Lt', 'Jung Chang - woo', 'colombian', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea Herald)Colombia', 'south american', 'the United Nations Forces', 'colombian', 'Korea', 'Colombia', 'Juan Manuel Santos', 'Cuba', 'FARC', 'the New York Times', 'Colombians', 'Times', 'Santos', 'colombian', 'Colombia', 'the World Bank', 'Pinzon', 'korean', 'Colombia', 'North Korea', 'Bogota', 'colombian', 'Princeton University', 'Johns Hopkins University', 'Harvard University', 'Maria Angela Holguin', 'Finance', 'Mauricio Cardenas', 'Maria', 'Information Communication Technology', 'Diego Molano Vega', 'Education', 'Gina Maria Parody', 'Santos', 'Pinzon', 'Colombians', 'the World Bank', 'Finance Ministry', 'Colombian Banking Association', 'Citigroup', 'Pinzon', 'Joel Lee']",1,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.69979119  0.90111232

""My understanding is that THAAD is easily transportable with a U.S. military aircraft.""  Washington has recently hinted at the deployment of a battery on Korean soil to better deter the North's growing nuclear and missile threats. The U.S. stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which is technically ongoing since no peace treaty has been signed to end it.  The issue of whether or not South Korea should host the American missile defense system has caused a bipartisan divide in local politics. While conservatives support the system, the liberal side has not been so welcoming since it believes the U.S. presence here undermines South Korean sovereignty. The U.S., meanwhile, claims the battery is defensive in nature.  THAAD can shoot down a wide variety of ballistic missiles at higher altitudes than any other defense system owned by South Korea.  South Korea has yet to decide whether to allow the U.S. to deploy THAAD here at all times and has maintained strategic ambiguity to appease China.  Sources within the South Korean government also said Seoul has no intention to shoulder any of the cost involved in stationing THAAD on local soil.  South Korea also says it opposes the U.S. deployment of AN/TPY-2, an early missile warning system that detects missiles up to 2,000 kilometers away, which would include China's military facilities.  ""Our military has our own missile warning system, the Green Pine, which has a range of 600 km, so we don't need AN/TPY-2,"" a source within the South Korean government said.

Beijing remains sternly against the deployment, which it believes could target China.“China must play an important role in mediating inter-Korean relations,” Moon told Qiu at the National Assembly. Qui nodded in agreement before proposing that Moon visit China.An NPAD spokesman later said details of the visit would be worked out, but that it would likely come sometime after the by-elections in late April, when four new lawmakers will be chosen.Moon also expressed support later Friday for keeping U.S. troops in Korea even after unification of the two Koreas, at a separate meeting with The Financial Times’ chief foreign affairs columnist Gideon Rachman.“(The U.S military’s presence) in Korea contributes to the balance of power in Northeast Asia, and continued peace in the region,” Moon said in his meeting with Rachman. The balance of power refers to the parity of strength between two opposing sides in international relations.“The U.S. must stay in the region until leaders (in Northeast Asia) figure out how to set up a mutual security network,” the former presidential candidate added.Moon, who lost the 2012 presidential election to President Park Geun-hye, is projected to be the opposition’s next presidential candidate in 2017. A Gallup Korea poll conducted from Tuesday to Thursday showed that 50 percent of the survey’s 1,005 adult respondents supported Moon over the 33 percent garnered by his potential competitor, Rep.

Offsets in defense trade encompass a range of industrial compensation arrangements required by foreign governments as a condition of the purchase of defense articles and services from a non-domestic source.""We will resume negotiations with the candidates next week,"" said a DAPA official, requesting anonymity.

They also raised doubts about the BBC’s ability to reach listeners in the North as Pyongyang authorities would likely try to block the BBC’s frequencies.“I consider the plan meaningful as it would provide outside information to the citizens of the secretive state,” Rep. Na Kyung-won of the governing Saenuri Party told The Korea Herald. She is the chief of the National Assembly’s Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee. South Korean soldiers patrol the inter-Korean border. (Yonhap)“Access to information is in itself a human right,” Na said earlier.“I am in full support of the idea,” Saenuri Rep. Ha Tae-keung told The Korea Herald, while Rep. Shin Kyoung-min of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the proposal “wasn’t a bad idea.”Unnamed BBC officials said the company had plans to set up a Korean language news service to reach the 25 million citizens of the North, according to The Telegraph on Wednesday. The plan has garnered support from the British Parliament, the report said.If the BBC begins a radio news service for the North, it will join the Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and South Korean public broadcaster KBS, the only other media outlets trying to provide outside information to the North through radio signals.Technicalities such as how the BBC broadcasts would be sent to the North were unclear though, as the plan is still in its early stages.Lawmakers here voiced mixed opinions on the details.“I doubt the BBC will be able to get through the North’s firewall,” Shin said. If the BBC uses shortwave signals to reach the North, authorities there would easily block the frequencies, according to radio industry officials here.Shin also said any BBC relay station set up in the South to send radio signals to the North would be set up “secretly.”“I don’t think detailed information on building a relay station for sending news to the North would be disclosed publicly,” the legislator said. It would not be something for him to either support or oppose, he added.Ha, an outspoken critic of Pyongyang, said he would fully support any effort by the BBC to set up news services for the North in his capacity as a lawmaker in Seoul.“If there is any bill that must be remedied or a regulation that must be adjusted, I will do it,” he said.Na, meanwhile, said that she hoped the BBC’s efforts would help convince the North to “change by communicating with and coming out to the international community.”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","korean lawmakers on thursday ,south korean lawmakers on thursday ,korean lawmakers on thursday expressed ,radio news in north korea ,lawmakers on thursday expressed support","['south korean', 'the BBC ’s', 'North Korea', 'BBC', 'BBC', 'Pyongyang', 'BBC', 'Na Kyung - won', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Korea Herald', 'the National Assembly ’s Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'Saenuri', 'Ha Tae - keung', 'the Korea Herald', 'Shin Kyoung - min', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'BBC', 'korean', 'the British Parliament', 'BBC', 'the Voice of America', 'south korean', 'KBS', 'BBC', 'BBC', 'North ’s', 'Shin', 'BBC', 'Shin', 'BBC', '”“i', 'Pyongyang', 'BBC', 'Seoul', 'BBC ’s', 'Jeong Hunny']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54605168  0.9225899

""Our government is pursuing a peaceful reunification, not unification through absorption unilaterally by either the South or the North,"" the vice chairman said, reaffirming the government stance. ""(The committee) has reviewed various road maps, but it has determined that a peaceful reunification is the only alternative in ending the division and going forward (with the North) to a new future,"" he also noted. Such a peaceful reunification cannot be achieved alone either by the South or the North, Chung said, adding that only through dialogue and more cooperation based on mutual trust can the reunification be accomplished. Economic development of the communist country is also crucial in cutting an expected huge cost of a potential reunification, the vice chairman also said. As part of President Park Geun-hye's signature policy vision for reunification of two Koreas, South Korea launched the 50-member committee in July last year, which includes the unification minister, foreign minister, five other ministers, the heads of state-run think tanks and 30 private experts. Park is the chairman of the panel.Earlier last year in Dresden, Germany, Park unveiled her vision to lay the groundwork for a future unification of two Koreas which technically remain at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce.Later the North bitterly criticized the so-called Dresden Declaration, saying it is a push to reunify the countries by force.

""If we can find Pyongyang's sincerity, the six-party talks can be resumed.""Hwang said that Pyongyang should end its ongoing nuclear activities and invite inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the North to resume their monitoring.""North Korea should halt its plutonium and uranium nuclear activities at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor and allow the IAEA inspectors to return as the first step toward complete denuclearization.""North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors in 2009 and restarted its atomic activities after it walked out of the six-party talks in late 2008.Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Since the latest nuke test, North Korea has demanded the unconditional resumption of the six-party talks, but Seoul and Washington have claimed that the North should first show its sincerity about denuclearization.Hwang said that Seoul is ""willing"" to have the talks with Pyongyang, but the ball is in the North's court as it should first demonstrate its willingness to give up its nuclear weapons.""As North Korea has been advancing its nuclear capability, the next several years will be very important (for us to achieve the goal of the North's denuclearization),"" he said.

Beijing has reportedly decided to let its border provinces increase economic cooperation with the North. Its Jilin and Liaoning provinces have announced they would expand their tour programs to the isolated country.This week, the North resumed tourism programs, bringing scores of Chinese tourists into the country for the first time since it suspended the program four months ago to prevent Ebola infection. The North also seeks to invite Chinese people to participate in the 2015 Pyongyang Marathon on April 12.The resumption of the tours came a few days after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that the two countries could hold a bilateral summit at a “mutually beneficial time.” “As the basic foundation of the North Korea-China relationship is strong, the relations will not be or should not be influenced by transient events,” he addedAnalysts said that China appeared to be attempting to mend fences with the North as it feels the need to address the drawn-out diplomatic tension ahead of a possible meeting between its leader Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during a World War II victory ceremony in Russia, slated for May 9.The bilateral relationship deteriorated after the North pushed ahead with its third nuclear test in February 2013 and the execution later in the year of Jang Song-thaek, the North Korean leader’s once-powerful uncle and a pivotal figure to manage cooperation with China.Since he took power in 2013, Xi has yet to hold any bilateral summit with the North Korean leader, which has underscored the diplomatic estrangement between the two nations. Yet, Xi has met with South Korean President Park Geun-hye six times.Pyongyang is seeking to diversify its diplomacy, which has been dominated by China, bolstering economic cooperation with Russia through several projects including the Hasan-Rajin logistic cooperation scheme.“I think China’s apparent steps to enhance ties with the North seem to signal that it wants Pyongyang to pursue a balanced diplomacy (rather than focusing too much on Russia),” said Ahn Chan-il, the head of the World North Korea Research Center.He added that amid the U.S.’ consideration of deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, an advance missile defense asset, to the peninsula, Beijing might have recalibrated the geostrategic importance of North Korea as a “buffer-zone state.”Recently, sources of tension have emerged between Seoul and Beijing. Among them was Seoul’s ambivalent stance on the U.S. Forces Korea’s desire to deploy THAAD here. Seoul has said that THAAD could help defend South Korea against North Korean threats, but it has yet to stake out any clear position, arguing that no official consultations between the allies have taken place.The issue of Seoul’s participation in the formation of the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank has also been a source of friction. Beijing has encouraged Seoul to join the bank, but Seoul remains reluctant as Washington opposes it. Washington views the AIIB as part of China’s attempt to challenge the existing financial order in the region, which has long been dominated by the West and Japan.Despite signs of improved relations between Pyongyang and Beijing, some experts cautioned against making hasty judgments on the relations. They argued that the North’s continued pursuit of nuclear arms would continue to pose hurdles to the relationship.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","2015 pyongyang marathon on april ,resumed tourism programs bringing scores ,pyongyang marathon on april ,pyongyang marathon on april 12 ,week the north resumed tourism","['China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Jilin', 'Liaoning', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Russia', 'north korean', 'China', 'Xi', 'north korean', 'Xi', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Russia', 'Hasan - Rajin', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Russia', 'Ahn Chan - il', 'the World North Korea Research Center', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'the U.S. Forces Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'AIIB', 'China', 'Japan', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'North ’s', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 1.          8.          0.         ... -0.50947195  0.56140578

Pyongyang has never ceased its threats of another nuclear test and missile launches, raising tension on the divided Korean Peninsula.""Of course, nuclear ambitions of North Korea are a matter of great concern to us ... and to the international community,"" Hay said.He said that Britain will continue to work with the global community to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, adding that peace and stability in the region is ""extremely important"" to Britain as well.When it comes to strained relations between Seoul and Tokyo, Hay refrained from making specific comments but expressed hope that this year can become a meaningful moment for a better future. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of Seoul-Tokyo ties.""I hope that the anniversary will be a moment to look ahead to the future, as well as dealing with the past,"" Hay said. ""I think it is up to each country to find their own way of coming to terms with the past and looking forward to the future.""Hay said learning the Korean language can be challenging, but it is also a rewarding experience in better understanding South Korea and its people.""I will continue to work on my Korean and deepen my knowledge and understanding about this country (during my stint here),"" he added.He also said that he will do his best to develop the Seoul-London relationship into moving further forward down the road.

The plan, put forward by the Dandong city government in Liaoning province on Tuesday during the country's annual session of the Communist Party-controlled parliament, came as the bilateral trade deal between South Korea and China is expected to be signed within the first-half of this year. ""China and South Korea completed free trade negotiations. Dandong will make efforts to serve as a bridgehead of trade between China and South Korea,"" the Chinese city government said in a statement. The trade deal is expected to give a big boost to the city's ambition to become a trade hub in the northern parts of the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Strait, adjacent to the Korean Peninsula, it said. Details of the Chinese city's plan are sketchy, but the city is expanding its logistics and marketing facilities to cope with rising trade if the South Korea-China free trade deal is implemented, according to the statement. As much as 80 percent of bilateral trade between North Korea and China is conducted through Dandong. Although China's trade with North Korea appears largely unaffected, large-scale economic projects between the allies have made little progress as China's leadership has been increasingly frustrated with the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. Last week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing will spare no effort to formally sign a bilateral free trade agreement with South Korea ""as soon as possible."" The deal calls for South Korea and China to remove tariffs on about 90 percent of goods traded between the two nations over the next two decades. However, rice and cars were excluded from the deal.

South Korea is concerned that its relations with the U.S. or China could sour in either case.Min's comments came two days after Yoo Seong-min, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, said he will forge his party's consensus over the controversial issue by holding a meeting of lawmakers later this month.Yoo said a possible heated debate on the issue is the duty of the party as it is a matter of survival for South Korea.The ruling party appears to be split over the issue, with some lawmakers believed to be close to President Park Geun-hye favoring strategic ambiguity and a low-profile approach to the issue.Meanwhile, some activists accused the ruling party of pushing for the deployment of a THAAD battery with South Korean troops and U.S. troops in South Korea, claiming the deployment of the missile defense system would hurt relations with China and Russia.South Korea has long been under security threats posed by North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs. The country, including its capital city of Seoul with more than 10 million people, is within striking distance of North Korea's missiles.South Korea's defense ministry said it has no plan to buy a THAAD battery from the U.S., noting that Seoul plans to set up its own missile defense system to shield the country against North Korea's ballistic missiles.Still, South Korean officials have said a THAAD battery, if deployed by U.S. troops in South Korea, could be helpful in the country's security and defense.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea as a deterrence against North Korea.

Yet, right-wingers in Seoul called the attack an act of terrorism triggered by pro-North Korea forces, sparking a confrontation with those on the other side of the political spectrum. (Yonhap)Capitalizing on the worsening public opinion against extremist activists with ties to Pyongyang, the Saenuri Party has called for “driving out” pro-North Korean forces and criticized the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy for having sided with Pyongyang sympathizers in the past.North Korea has long been a divisive ideological issue for political parties here with the conservative parties maintaining a usually reciprocal, tough stance, and the liberal parties in support of a softer approach to Pyongyang.On Monday, Saenuri spokesperson Park Dae-chul called the NPAD a onetime “host of pro-North Korean forces,” prompting a strong protest from its rival party. Park said, “It is the time for the NPAD to write a letter of repentance.”The NPAD, which had remained cautious to fend off any fallout from the attack by an ultraleft activist, countered the Saenuri’s offensive, arguing that the ruling party has been politically exploiting the incident and fanning a hackneyed ideological dispute concerning the communist state.“The U.S. did not use the word ‘terrorism’ when referring to the incident. It instead used the word ‘attack,’ and has showed a calm, reserved response to it,” said NPAD Rep. Jung Chung-rae during a meeting with senior party officials.“The ruling party should refrain from making remarks that undermine national interests and get out of its excessive ideological campaign to blame pro-North Korean forces.”NPAD Rep. Oh Young-sik said, “The Saenuri Party’s chronic illness of a campaign against pro-North Korean forces has re-emerged. Such old-fashioned moves ahead of an election (the April by-election) should be stopped.”Amid intense partisan fights, Lippert stepped in to highlight the strength of the Korea-U.S. alliance, effectively dwarfing anti-U.S. sentiment that had followed U.S. Undersecretary Wendy Sherman’s earlier remarks that tacitly blamed South Korea and China for exploiting “nationalist feelings” toward Japan.During the visits by the leaders of the parties, the ambassador urged the main parties to use the incident as an opportunity to strengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance and to refrain from creating more political wrangling out of the attack.

It also said it would collect 15 percent of their basic wage plus overtime payments as ""social security."" Currently, the South's firms pay 15 percent of the basic wage alone.If the measure is implemented, the North would earn a total of $450,000 in additional revenue from the Gaesong district, according to the ministry. Around 53,000 North Korean workers are employed by 124 South Korean firms, mostly small and medium-sized, in the zone created in 2004.The companies will start to pay March wages on April 10.""The government maintains a firm position that it can't accept North Korea's measure this time,"" the official said. The ministry asked the firms not to follow the North's one-way decision in a meeting with their association last week. ""The government plans to send a formal notice to the firms on what to do and legal and administrative steps they would face if they defy it,"" the official said. He would not elaborate, saying it's still too early to talk openly the measures considered.The official said the North is expected to put more pressure on the South via unjust measures such as the withdrawal of its workers from the complex and negligence of duties.The government will do its best to minimize damages to the South's firms, he said. Half of the South's companies in the Kaesong zone have already bought government-sponsored insurance in case their business there is closed, he noted.He questioned whether Pyongyang has the will to operate the complex normally, citing a number of similar cases.In 2013, the North levied unjust taxes on the South's firms in violation of an agreement on tax exemption. It is also refusing to implement a deal on facilitating cross-border travel, communication and customs.""Still, we do not have the scenario of shutting down the Gaesong Industrial Complex in mind,"" he said. ""The only way to resolve the problem is consultations between the authorities of the two sides. We have a problem with the process of North Korea's decision (on the issue), not its demand for a wage increase itself.""

""The defense ministry has no plan to purchase a THAAD system,"" ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told a regular briefing.""Basically, the system would do good to better defend the country from missiles from North Korea, but we will make a judgment by putting the national interest as our top priority.""While officials here, including defense minister Han Min-koo, have said its deployment would be helpful for the security of the Korean Peninsula, though the nation is not considering buying the system, the Seoul government has said it will make a decision ""after the U.S. sets its position and asks for cooperation or any consultation.""The issue has been the focus of attention here as the move is seen by critics as part of a broader U.S. attempt to get the Asian ally to join its missile-defense (MD) system. But instead of joining the U.S. system, South Korea has been developing its own Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD), a low-tier air defense program, and the Kill Chain, which is designed to launch strikes right after signs are detected of imminent nuclear or missile provocations by Pyongyang.

Security Council resolution and a counteraction is needed,"" the government source said.The letter was conveyed to the North Korea sanctions committee under the Security Council, he said. The committee was established pursuant to resolution 1718, which was adopted in 2006, right after the communist country's first nuclear test.The resolution, along with other similar resolutions adopted later on the North, prohibits the communist country from conducting nuclear tests or ballistic missile launches.In similar efforts to curb North Korea's military provocations, Seoul is also reviewing taking steps with like-minded countries to voice complaints over North Korea's recent action. Seoul filed a similar letter with the U.N. committee on North Korea sanctions last year after the North conducted a flurry of ballistic missile test-firings in the first half of 2014.In a follow-up step, a panel of experts under the sanctions committee will review the legality of the ballistic missile tests before deciding whether to formally file the case with the committee.It is unlikely that the latest case will directly lead to the U.N. taking any action against the North.

(Yonhap)“(Seoul’s probe) stems from Seoul’s vicious attempt to stamp out pro-unification, patriotic forces and adhere more to its anti-North Korea campaign,” said the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.South Korean police are currently looking into the possibility that Kim violated the National Security Law by possessing books and materials that are pro-North or promote the activities of antistate organizations.The North’s statement also called Kim’s attack a “righteous act” and a “reflection of public sentiment in the South,” stressing that the incident would not have occurred if the ongoing South Korea-U.S. military drills had been canceled“Based on Kim’s records of visiting the North, (Seoul) is turning him into a pro-North Korean figure, whipping up anti-North Korea sentiment and insulting the supreme dignity (the North Korean leader),” the statement said.Seoul officials have upbraided Pyongyang for making such remarks, saying that the isolated regime was distorting the facts about the incident, and that it was deplorable for the North to condone such an act of violence.Pyongyang’s rhetoric also promoted an angry response from the U.S. amid bilateral friction over a series of issues including the North’s alleged cyberattack on Sony Pictures and its continued pursuit of nuclear arms.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters last Friday that the North’s remarks about the knife attack were “outrageously callous but unfortunately consistent with the nature of the regime and its rhetoric.”The rising tension between Washington and Pyongyang is expected to pose a hurdle to Seoul’s push for dialogue and improved ties with the North. In consideration of the deteriorating anti-Pyongyang sentiment both in the South and the U.S., Seoul may not be able to take bold steps to boost cooperation with the North, analysts said.The KCRC that has played a vital role to foster cross-border cooperation is in a state of crisis with its leader Hong Sa-deok having stepped down to take responsibility for the attack. The council had planned to push for a series of inter-Korean cooperative projects to mark the 15th anniversary of the June 15 inter-Korean declaration announced after a summit in 2000 between then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. But the projects could lose traction after the attack.The knife attack also triggered tension between the rival parties as the ruling Saenuri Party stepped up its ideological offensive against pro-North Korea activities and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy cautioned against politicizing the attack.Saenuri spokesperson Park Dae-chul said its liberal rival should write a “letter of repentance” for having sided with pro-North Korean forces in the past.“The opposition party has sided with pro-North Korean (forces on many occasions), not just yesterday or today. Thus there are things the opposition needs to explain (to the public) about the unprecedented terror (attack),” he said. “It is about time for the opposition to write a letter of repentance.”The NPAD argued that the ruling party was using the attack as a pretext to “drive out pro-North Koreans.”“The government and the ruling party are making claims as if the attack was an organized crime by pro-North Korean people, and this shows that the party was trying to use the incident politically,” said NPAD spokesperson Kim Sung-soo in a media interview.“Such an ideological offensive would not be helpful for improving the South Korea-U.S. alliance.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","probe into thursday knife attack ,seoul probe into thursday knife ,thursday knife attack on the ,thursday knife attack ,crime by pro north korean","['inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation', 'Lippert', 'inter - korean', 'North', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ki - jong', 'Seoul', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'the North ’s Committee', 'North ’s', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'North ’s', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Sony Pictures', 'U.S. State Department', 'Marie Harf', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'anti - pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'KCRC', 'Hong Sa - deok', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Saenuri Party', 'north Korea', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Park Dae - chul', 'north korean', 'pro - north korean', 'pro - north Koreans', 'north korean', 'NPAD', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",7,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.07797858  0.35290101

The oil-rich Gulf state will host the event and plans to spend about $100 billion on construction projects including railroads, expressways, harbors and stadiums.Taking the opportunity of the bilateral summit, South Korean officials said that they expect to participate in $29 billion worth infrastructure projects in the future, including the construction of the main stadium, railway and sewage processing.  President Park Geun-hye (third from left) and her Qatari counterpart emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thanion at their summit on Sunday (Yonhap)The two sides also agreed to make joint investments in global markets. Qatar Investment Authority and Korea Investment Corporation have agreed to jointly establish a fund worth $2 billion for this purpose, they said. The Qatari agency also expressed its interest in six projects in Korea, raising the possibility that the Gulf state would start making substantial investments in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. QIA ranks ninth in terms of the asset size. It currently holds about $256 billion worth of assets, according to officials. The meeting between Park and emir Tamim came only four months after the leaders met in November in Seoul.The two leaders observed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on nurturing professionals in the field of nuclear energy and development. The agreement was meant to secure more opportunities for Korean firms if Qatar plans to build nuclear reactors in the future, officials said.Qatar was Park’s final destination of her four-nation trip to the Middle East. She earlier traveled to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to diversify business relations amid falling oil prices and a slowing Korean economy. Her senior secretaries said the trip helped South Korea diversify its business relation with the Gulf states, and expanded Park’s diplomatic landscape to the region. During her trip, South Korea signed a total of 44 MOUs and her business delegates clinched 1 trillion won ($ 900 million) worth of contracts with their partners in the four countries. An MOU on nuclear reactors reached with Saudi Arabia was the highlight of her trip. Under the agreement, the two sides are set to conduct a joint study to review the feasibility of building Korean-made midsized multifunctional nuclear reactors in the kingdom. If realized, the $2 billion project will help firms secure more opportunities as Saudi plans to build up to 18 large-reactors in the future.

North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong-un, has yet to visit China since taking the helm of the reclusive state in late 2011, while Russia has said that Kim would be among those attending a May 9 ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.Political ties between North Korea and China remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in February 2013. Asked whether North Korea's Kim could visit China this year, Wang replied, ""As to when our leaders will meet, we will have to see when it is convenient for both parties."" ""The China-North Korea relationship has a strong foundation. It should not and will not be affected by temporary events,"" Wang said. North Korea is China's only formal treaty ally, but Beijing's leadership has appeared to become increasingly frustrated by the North's nuclear and missile ambitions. Analysts say North Korea won't give up its nuclear weapons program because having it would prolong the Kim regime and help obtain political and economic benefits from the international community.With China cold-shouldering North Korea's nuclear policy, Pyongyang is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong told a U.N. meeting last week that Pyongyang would strongly respond to ongoing joint military drills between South Korea and the United States. Wang urged all relevant countries to exercise calm and restraint on the Korean Peninsula, saying the situation there ""is entering another delicate period."" ""We call on the relevant countries to exercise calm and restraint and say and do things that will have a positive effect so as to continue fostering an atmosphere and conditions for resuming the six-party talks,"" Wang said. The six-party talks, aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear ambition, have been dormant for nearly six years. The talks involve South Korea, North Korea, the U.S., China, Russia and Japan. North Korea has called for the resumption of the six-party talks without preconditions, but South Korea and the U.S. insist that the North should first show its sincere commitment toward forgoing its nuclear weapons program.China plans to invite world leaders to a military parade later this year marking the end of World War II, an event that could highlight the surrender of Japan. Asked whether China would invite Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the military parade, which is likely to be held in September and presided over by President Xi Jinping, Wang sidestepped the question. Instead, Wang said China would welcome ""anyone who is sincere about coming."" Relations between China and Japan have always been rocky because of their shared history, but the ties deteriorated further because of a simmering territorial dispute involving a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.Wang called on Japan to learn from its past history of aggression. ""The more the perpetrator is conscious of his or her guilt, the more relieved the victim can feel about the suffering,"" Wang said.""This is common sense in interpersonal communication, and a correct attitude toward history as well.""

The destroyer was carrying soldiers from the Akh unit tasked with training the Gulf state’s Special Forces and the Cheonghae Unit deployed to join an international antipiracy campaign in the Gulf of Aden off the Somali Coast.Park is the first commander-in-chief to visit a destroyer on an overseas mission, her spokesman Min Kyung-wook said. She was visiting the vessel to meet both units at the same time, he added. President Park Geun-hye hugs a Korean soldier of the Cheonghae Unit aboard the destroyer Dae Jo Young anchored at Zayed Port in Abu Dhabi on Friday. (Yonhap)“Every one of you is the military diplomat representing the Republic of Korea and your operation here makes the people proud,” the president said during a talk with soldiers.“So I wish for you to make the utmost effort to complete the mission by having greater responsibility and pride,” she said.The South Korean unit Akh, meaning brother in Arabic, has been based in the eastern region of Al Ain in the UAE since 2011. The soldiers were deployed after a South Korean consortium won a $20 billion deal in 2009 to build nuclear reactors in the oil-rich country.The unit is in charge of special operations, antiterrorism missions and staging joint drills. It is also tasked to protect South Korean residents in the state during emergencies.The Cheonghae Unit, consisting of a 4,500-ton destroyer, a helicopter and three high-speed boats, has also escorted hundreds of vessels passing through the waters off Somalia and assisted in their safe navigation. Before leaving Abu Dhabi, Park also met Korean residents as well as a group of doctors and nurses dispatched to treat patients in the wealthy Gulf state.Since 2011, South Korean hospitals started operations in UAE amid growing interests in Korea’s advanced medical technology and services. Currently, about 200 medical staff are working in four institutions including Seoul National University Hospital and St. Mary’s Hospital.Later in the afternoon, Park left for Qatar, the final leg of her four-nation trip to the Middle East.Park plans to meet Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani on Sunday in return for the Qatari leader’s visit to South Korea in November. Her visit is expected to secure more business opportunities for Korean firms in Qatar, the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent(christory@heraldcorp.com)","geun hye hugs korean soldier ,the 2022 fifa world cup ,president visited the 500 ton ,hugs korean soldier of the ,since 2011 south korean hospitals","['ABU DHABI', 'Park Geun', 'south korean', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Dae Jo Young', 'Zayed Port', 'Akh', 'Park', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park Geun', 'korean', 'Dae Jo Young', 'Abu Dhabi', 'the Republic of Korea', 'south korean', 'Akh', 'Al Ain', 'UAE', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'the Cheonghae Unit', 'Somalia', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Park', 'korean', 'south korean', 'UAE', 'Korea', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'Park', 'Qatar', 'park', 'Qatar', 'Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani', 'qatari', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Qatar', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Korea Herald correspondent(christory@heraldcorp.com']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29928419  0.31883055

The attack ""reflects the mindset of South Korean people"" amid growing anti-American sentiment in the South, the North added through its official news agency KCNA.""(The government) strongly criticizes North Korea for distorting the true nature of this incident and supporting it,"" ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said, reading out the statement at a press briefing.The North should stop ""irrational propaganda"" activities and think about what it has to do for the development of inter-Korean ties and peace on the peninsula, Lim said.The South's law-enforcement authorities are investigating the case, after the suspect, Kim Ki-jong, was arrested at the scene. Leading a progressive civic group, the 55-year-old suspect is known to have engaged in anti-war and pro-reunification campaigns for a long time. He traveled to North Korea seven times -- six to Kaesong between 2006 and 2007 and one to Mount Kumgang in 1999 -- according to the unification ministry.Police said they are looking into whether Kim was involved in any act violating the anti-communist National Security Law.The unification ministry spokesman said the government had approved his trips to the North in accordance with related rules.""I don't think we have any specific ways, other than his testimonies, to confirm what he exactly did during his visits to North Korea,"" Lim said. He would not speculate on the future of inter-Korean relations amid concerns that the incident will have a negative impact on the already frosty bilateral ties, let alone the Washington-Pyongyang standoff.The attacker is a member of the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation (KCRC), the organizer of the forum during which the incident happened.KCRC, a coalition of nearly 200 political, civic and religious organizations working to promote peace on the peninsula, has long endeavored to promote civilian exchanges between the two Koreas.The council has come under public criticism for failing to prevent Kim's entry into the conference. He was not formally invited. The head of the KCRC, Hong Sa-duk, immediately resigned from his post and there are worries that the council's activity may be affected. The South is seeking to arrange a number of joint events with the North this year, the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 35-year colonial rule.The unification ministry said it hopes that the council will continue to make appropriate contributions to South-North cooperation and exchanges.Experts said the incident may deepen rifts between conservative and progressive people in the ideologically-divided nation.""There is a possibility that internal conflict will intensify over the angle to look at this case. It's needed to take a prudent approach until the results of the investigation come out,"" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korea studies at Seoul's Dongguk University.

The global market for halal food, which is produced or processed under Islamic dietary guidelines, is expected to grow to $1.62 trillion in 2018 from $1.08 trillion in 2012, according to officials.Korean food companies have faced difficulties in exporting their products to the Middle East and other Islamic countries due to a lack of market information and low recognition of Korean brands in the regions.Under the agreement, the two sides will work together to share market info and establish a halal food certificate system, to open doors for Korean firms seeking international opportunities. If realized, they are expected to export $1.2 billion worth of food products by 2017, officials said.“The agreement is expected to help Korean agricultural products make inroads into the Middle East for the first time,” said An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economy.The two countries are also set to seek opportunities to enter emerging markets in Africa and the Middle East by combining South Korean nuclear reactor technology with the UAE’s funding power. On the occasion of Park’s visit to the wealthy Gulf nation, officials from two countries also signed separate MOUs to expand cooperation in the fields of medical service, oil exploration and education.The summit on Thursday was their third meeting after Park entered office in early 2013.This is Park’s second visit to the wealthy Gulf state. The South Korean president visited the UAE last year for a ceremony marking the installation of a Korean-built nuclear reactor at a power plant under construction in Barakah, some 300 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi.South Korea signed a final agreement in 2009 to build four nuclear reactors. The project worth $20.4 billion marked South Korea’s first exports of nuclear reactors.Park said in an interview with Emirates News Agency that the construction of a nuclear power plant by Korean firms in Barakah carries “great symbolic significance” as it has laid the groundwork for bilateral cooperation for “the next hundred years.”The president also called for joint efforts to advance the bilateral ties by shifting the focus from heavy industries to high-value-added industries. “Rather than remaining content with what we have achieved thus far, we are eager to expand the sphere of cooperation to a much broader range of areas, including health care, intellectual property, IT and new and renewable energy,” she said.The UAE is her third destination of the four-nation trip to the Middle East.

The drill involves 200,000 South Korean and 3,700 American troops and is scheduled to run until April 24. ""Five Navy ships from the U.S. 7th Fleet arrived at local naval ports one after another,"" a CFC official said.

A three-way summit has also not been held since May 2012 amid long-standing historical grievances.During a regional summit in Myanmar in November, South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed her hope to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a trilateral summit following an envisioned meeting of their foreign ministers in the near future.Since taking office in early 2013, Park has shunned a bilateral summit with Abe, calling on Japan to first sincerely apologize over the sex slavery issue.

Since its latest nuclear test, North Korea has demanded that the six-party talks should be resumed without any preconditions. But Seoul and Washington stressed that Pyongyang should first demonstrate its willingness to denuclearize. Established in 1979, the Conference on Disarmament is a multilateral forum to negotiate arms control and disarmament. This year's conference kicked off on Jan. 19 and will run until March 27.

She was quoted as saying “it’s not hard ... to earn cheap applause by vilifying a former enemy,” sparking outrage in Korea and China. (Yonhap)The change was anticipated, as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe simply referred to South Korea as the most important neighbor without further elaboration in his policy address to the nation in February. In a 2013 speech, Abe called South Korea the most important neighbor, and said the two countries shared the basic values of liberty and democracy, and the same interests. In 2014, he described South Korea as the most important neighbor, and said they shared basic values and interests.During her speech marking the 96th anniversary of the March 1 Independence Movement, President Park Geun-hye described Japan as an “important neighbor sharing values of liberal democracy and a market economy, and jointly pursuing peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia.” Observers said that Tokyo might have altered its previous description to express its discomfort over the diplomatic impasse between the two nations. An article in Japan’s Asahi Shimbun noted that a “change of Tokyo’s perception” of Seoul appeared to have driven it to change the description.The deletion also came amid widespread furor in Seoul over U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman’s recent remarks in Washington that suggested South Korea and China were to blame in deteriorating relations with Japan over history issues. The unusual remarks by Sherman stoked speculation that Washington has begun to less discreetly urge Seoul to mend the fences with Japan.Since President Park Geun-hye took office in February 2013, she has not met Abe for a bilateral summit discussion, although the two met at a trilateral summit brokered by U.S. President Barack Obama last year.Abe has repeatedly expressed his wish to hold a bilateral summit with Park. But Park has rejected the offers as Abe’s apparently revisionist historical views have seriously damaged public sentiment in South Korea, and there has been little progress over the issue of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery.The two sides appeared to have moved toward practical cooperation on security as they agreed last December to sign a trilateral military information-sharing arrangement with the U.S. But diplomatic friction flared up again after Japan continued to claim sovereignty over Dokdo and refused Seoul’s demands to properly address the sexual slavery issue.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","enslavement of korean women and ,enemy sparking outrage in korea ,discontent with seoul the website ,enslavement of korean women ,sexual enslavement of korean women","['Japan', 'Foreign Ministry', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'South Korea ’s', 'korean', 'the U.S. Embassy', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Wendy Sherman', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'Korea', 'China', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'South Korea', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', '1 Independence Movement', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Asahi Shimbun', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Wendy Sherman', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Sherman', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Abe', 'Park', 'Park', 'Abe ’s', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 7.          3.          0.         ... -0.64673507  0.25345853

But given Russia’s poor economic conditions and small volume of trade with the North, Russia’s clout over Pyongyang would be much smaller than speculated, the analysts said, noting that China remains the most influential country for the North.“Moscow and Pyongyang have expanded their cooperation because of their shared need for it, but there are limits on the extent to which the cooperation would develop (for Russia) to gain a large influence (over peninsular issues),” said Cho Bong-hyun, a senior researcher at the Industrial Bank of Korea.“For Russia to push for a series of joint economic projects with the North, it should have the economic capacity to implement them and also examine their feasibility. Having said this, there are many challenges ahead for bilateral cooperation.”As the North seeks to diversify its diplomacy away from China, it has sought to bolster its economic ties with Russia. For Moscow, Pyongyang has been an attractive partner to help spur the development of its Far East region, explore new business opportunities and ease its isolation stemming from the Ukraine crisis.But expecting Russia to gain a considerable influence over the North through their strategic collaboration would be a hasty judgment, experts said.Given the trade volume between Russia and North Korea, Russia’s influence over the isolated regime appears to be much less than that of China. The trade volume between China and the North last year was around $6.4 billion ― more than 90 percent of the North’s trade outside the Korean Peninsula ― while the trade between Russia and the North was around $100 million.Last month, Moscow and Pyongyang agreed to increase their trade volume to $1 billion by 2020, but experts remain skeptical about the ambitious target given that Russia’s economy has faltered under plunging oil prices and the West’s sanctions against Moscow in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.“Russia has expressed a willingness to undertake large-scale trade and investment with North Korea, but most of the projects in question involve quite substantial financing that will have to come from Russia,” said Stephan Haggard, a North Korea expert at the University of California, San Diego.“There may be some opportunities for transshipment of coal and other commodities, but I am doubtful that the ambitious targets for two-way trade between the two countries will materialize.”Haggard also pointed out that the North and Russia are not good trade partners in light of their trade items. “The DPRK (North Korea) will need imports of capital, intermediate and consumer goods as well as raw materials; Russia is not going to be an important supplier of those items,” he said.“In addition, North Korea will need wide market outlets if it pursues a more export-oriented strategy, and the natural partner for that effort would be Chinese and Korean ― not Russian ― firms. The DPRK’s natural trading partners are China and South Korea.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","given russia poor economic conditions ,given russia poor economic ,but given russia poor economic ,korea for russia to push ,that russia economy has faltered","['Russia', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Moscow', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'May.', 'Russia', 'North', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Russia', 'Cho Bong - hyun', 'the Industrial Bank of Korea', 'Russia', 'China', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Pyongyang', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'China', 'China', 'North ’s', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Pyongyang', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine', '“russia', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Stephan Haggard', 'North Korea', 'the University of California , San Diego', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'korean', 'russian', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",14,"[ 1.          5.          0.         ... -0.72489715  0.29363883

Speaking at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul called on the international community to provide “special care and protection” to North Korean asylum seekers, taking a veiled swipe at China for deporting them despite the harsh punishment they face back home. “One cannot veil the sky with the palm of a hand. Darkness can never defeat light. How much longer does the DPRK wish to continue its inhumane acts of trampling on the human dignity of its people?” he said at a high-level segment of the council’s 28th session, which kicked off Monday for a four-day run. He was using the official name of the communist country, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Cho Tae-yul and Ri Su-yongWhile North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong was present, Cho criticized his earlier speech ― in which Ri claimed falsehood of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry report ― calling it a “pitiful effort born out of desperation.”“The minister knows better than anyone else about the horrific human rights situation in the DPRK and the grave concern verging on despair of the international community over the situation,” Cho said. “We call on the DPRK to immediately take concrete and sincere steps so that its people can carry on a normal, dignified life.”Unveiled last February, the 400-page document chronicled harrowing accounts from defectors and witnesses of “systematic, widespread and gross” rights breaches including rape, murder and torture in the reclusive country, which it concluded constitute crimes against humanity.The report laid the foundation for watershed resolutions passed last year by the 47-member council and the U.N. General Assembly, calling for the culprits to be held accountable. Shortly before Cho’s address, Ri argued that the COI study should be nullified given a recent renunciation of some testimony by Shin Dong-hyuk, a high-flying North Korean defector and core witness in the survey.Ri condemned defectors as “human scum who committed crimes, abandoned their parents, spouses and children and ran away,” while asserting that the U.N. is growing “impartial” as a big countries rally their followers to “haze” disobedient ones. The North’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva has in recent months circulated a series of letters refuting criticism over its rights record among member states in an apparent effort to water down a forthcoming council resolution to be adopted at the end of the session later this month. In a February dispatch, it said that following Shin’s confession, the basis for last year’s General Assembly text has “collapsed and proves the utterly unjust nature of the U.S. and other hostile forces’ act” of bringing in refugees to the U.N. Dismissing the claim, Cho praised them for “breaking the imposed silence,” calling for the world to comply with the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids repatriating victims of persecution. China has taken flak for sending back North Korean defectors, whom it calls “illegal economic migrants,” though they face torture, labor camps or even death upon return. “Even at this moment, North Korean asylum seekers are wandering around searching for freedom,” the vice minister said. “All members of the international community should adhere to the principle of non-refoulement, and spare no efforts to provide protection and assistance so that they can settle down safely in a place of their choice.” Highlighting the plight of the so-called comfort women under the frame of sexual violence in conflict, Cho urged Tokyo to resolve the longstanding row with Seoul through a “genuine apology and accountability.”“We cannot further delay investing all that we can to help the surviving victims restore their dignity and self-esteem,” he added. “The past mirrors the present and the future. Without healing the wounds of the past, we cannot anticipate a healthy future.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","sending back north korean defectors ,korean asylum seekers taking veiled ,south korea on tuesday urged ,swipe at china for deporting ,high flying north korean defector","['South Korea', 'U.N.', 'the U.N.

The report did not elaborate further, or include the volume of the rejected North Korean coal. After three decades of rapid industrialization, China regularly sees hazardous air pollution with levels of particulate matter rising to nearly 40 times the limits set by the World Health Organization during the winter months. In September, China announced strict regulations against the sale and import of coal with high toxic pollutants, including mercury and sulfur, to improve the country's air and water quality. Anthracite coal accounted for 39.8 percent of North Korea's total exports to China last year. In January, China's imports of North Korean coal plunged 53.2 percent from a year earlier to 16.78 million tons, according to Chinese customs data.

Park arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, after wrapping up a three-day visit to Kuwait. Saudi Arabia is second destination of her four-nation Middle East trip, which will also include UAE and Qatar. President Park Geun-hye talks with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud at the Erga Palace in Riyadh on Tuesday. (Yonhap)After the summit, the two leaders observed the signing of a memorandum of understanding aimed at developing South Korea’s SMART reactors and commercializing its technology in order to jointly enter the global market. The SMART reactors, designed by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, was developed to target the Middle Eastern countries as it generates electric power and also desalinates sea water.Under the agreement, the two countries are set to conduct a three-year preliminary study by 2018 to review the feasibility of constructing SMART reactors in Saudi Arabia. “The agreement is expected to open opportunities for South Korean firms to participate in Saudi Arabia’s nuclear reactor project,” said An Chong-bum, Park’s senior secretary for economic affairs.With the agreement, the South Korean government expects to win $2 billion worth of nuclear reactor deals in Saudi Arabia and additional orders in the future. If realized, it will be the world’s first case of small- and medium-sized reactors being exported to a foreign country, officials said. The world’s largest producer and exporter of oil plans to build more than 12 18-gigawatt nuclear power plants by 2040 to prepare for growing domestic demand for electricity and to secure new energy sources.Taking advantage of Park’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the two sides agreed to introduce South Korea’s vision of a creative economy aimed at nurturing creative ideas and assimilating them with ICT, science and technology and other industries.

Security Council resolutions against the North’s use of ballistic missile technology, and that Seoul and Washington were ready to counter additional provocations.Between 6:33 a.m. and 6:41 a.m., the North fired two Scud missiles from its western port city of Nampo southwest of Pyongyang, Seoul officials said. The two missiles, which traveled at a top speed of Mach 4.3 and maximum altitude of 134 km, flew 495 km and 493 km, respectively.“We believe the launches are a show of force against the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle drills. Our military is keeping close tabs on the North Korean military’s movements and maintaining a robust readiness posture,” Seoul’s Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told reporters.Given the trajectory and range of the missiles, Seoul believes the North fired Scud-C missiles. The North has Scud-B missiles with a range of 300 km, Scud-C missiles with a range of 500 km, Scud-D missiles with a range of more than 700 km, and the Scud-ER ― an upgraded version of the Scud-D missile. Over the past month, the North has ratcheted up military tension, calling on Seoul and Washington to cancel their annual drills, which the allies argue are defensive in nature and will proceed transparently.On Feb. 6, the North fired four KN-01 ship-to-ship missiles with a range of some 100 km. Two days later, the North launched one KN-02 missile and four KN-09 missiles that have a range of around 200 km.  SHOW OF RESOLVE -- K-200 armored vehicles drive through Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, during the ongoing South Korea-U.S. Key Resolve/Foal Eagle drills on Monday. (Yonhap)Before the missile launches on Monday morning, the General Staff of the North’s Korean People’s Army criticized Seoul and Washington for conducting the joint drills, repeating its argument that the drills are a rehearsal for a “nuclear war of invasion” against the North. “We will never just stand by idly. We will make (South Korea and the U.S.) deeply regret (their decision to push ahead with the drills),” said an unidentified spokesperson of the General Staff in a statement carried by the North’s Korean Central News Agency.“The only means to deal with the imperialist U.S. and its sympathizers is neither dialogue nor peace, but a baptism of fire.”Seoul’s Defense Ministry spokesman criticized the North’s threatening rhetoric as a “very serious challenge” to the security of the Korean Peninsula.The allied Key Resolve command post exercise will continue through next Friday. The computer simulation exercise involves some 8,600 U.S. troops and 10,000 South Korean troops. The Foal Eagle field exercise, which involves 3,700 U.S troops and 200,000 South Korean troops, will continue through April 24.Meanwhile, Japan issued a protest against the North’s missile launches, calling them “very problematic” in terms of the safety of aircraft and vessels operating in the areas where the missiles had traveled.

Two years later, ties are still frosty. Many diplomatic and security initiatives are at a standstill. Businesses have closed down or scaled back investment, while tourist in- and outflows contracted. Though Tokyo is historically considered a key neighbor, Park is yet to have a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In contrast, she has held at least four meetings each with her U.S. and Chinese counterparts. While Abe’s revisionist moves are chiefly to blame for the current strain, many experts and former officials have voiced concerns about the Park government’s lack of flexibility and pragmatism, which they said could reduce its leverage and trigger a backlash from the U.S. Now signs of eroding patience are seeping out of Washington, which has been seeking to beef up a trilateral security partnership with its two prime allies in the region in line with its strategic refocus toward Asia and growing North Korean threats. At a seminar in Washington on Friday, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman said “disagreements” about history and territory issues between South Korea, Japan and China are “understandable, but it can also be frustrating.”“Nationalist feelings can still be exploited, and it’s not hard for a political leader anywhere to earn cheap applause by vilifying a former enemy,” she said.“But such provocations produce paralysis, not progress. To move ahead, we have to see beyond what was to envision what might be. And in thinking about the possibilities, we don’t have to look far for a cautionary tale of a country that has allowed itself to be trapped by its own history.”The Obama administration’s “rebalancing” strategy is flawed in the first place in the sense that it overlooks the significance of wartime history in relations between Northeast Asian countries. Seeking to cement a diplomatic legacy, however, Washington will likely continue to pile pressure on Seoul to focus more on the future, but without sufficient efforts to contain Tokyo’s ambitions to reshape the postwar order. Wary of any policy discord with the U.S., Seoul officials have in recent weeks been arguing that there is “no daylight” between the allies especially in their North Korea approaches. Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong was adamant, telling lawmakers on Monday that “a U.S. siding lopsidedly with Japan will never happen.” The existence of daylight is not a bad thing as long as it does not blind others’ interests and goals. Instead of trumpeting a hollow, implausible line, it’s time for them to revisit their policy and prove their diplomatic capability once and for all. One welcoming change was the latest appointment of Lee Byung-kee as the new presidential chief of staff, whose pragmatist credentials, command of Japanese affairs and wide network with officials and politicians boosted hopes for a levelheaded exit strategy during his brief stint as ambassador to Japan last year.

Despite prolonged inter-Korean feuding over the leaflet issue, the South Korean government has largely remained inactive, saying that the campaign is part of the activists' right to free speech.

In other words, they have not mastered the weaponization process,” ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a regular news briefing.His remarks run counter to an analysis by Joel Wit, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute of Johns Hopkins University, that the country is believed to have built up to 16 atomic devices ― six to eight of them based on plutonium and four to eight on highly enriched uranium.Wit, who previously oversaw North Korea affairs at the U.S. State Department, also argued that Pyongyang seems to have acquired the technology to make bombs small enough to fit on its medium-range Rodong missiles, which are capable of striking South Korea and Japan, and on the intercontinental Taepodong-2 missiles.“Would you be able to make nuclear weapons without succeeding in miniaturizing them?” Kim said. “(Wit’s assertion) is simply an assumption by some private organization or experts, not substantiated by any evidence. We assess that (North Korea) has yet to secure the technology.”No signs of another underground blast have been detected from across the border, Kim noted, despite a news report that the communist country is gearing up to detonate an atomic device in May.“As we’ve repeatedly said, North Korea appears to be ready to go ahead with a fresh test whenever it wants.

They severed virtually all inter-Korean transactions and exchanges except those involved in the inter-Korean joint project, the Kaesong Industrial Complex.  ""We could review the issue of the May 24 measures in a positive way if there are North Korean steps that look plausible to South Korean people,"" Lee said in an interpellation session, alluding to the government's possible removal of the sanctions.  ""Above all, I think the government is ready to discuss this issue in depth if there are genuine talks and reconciliation between South and North Korea.,"" the prime minister noted.    Earlier this month, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae expressed a similar stance, saying in a local forum that ""if South and North Korea hold talks it could become an opportunity to lift the May 24 sanctions.""  Such an overture from Seoul came as the government is seeking to hold high-level talks with Pyongyang.  As strained relations with the North continued for years, the South proposed high-level talks with the North in late December and has frequently renewed its call on the North to accept the proposal.  The North has, however, neither accepted nor rejected the offer as the country continues to denounce the joint military exercises between South Korea and the U.S. set for March.

South Korea and the U.S. warned that the North's policy is a dead end for the country.  The six-nation talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program were last held in December 2008.

Tests could happen. They may never happen again.

The provocative nation has also carried out a series of long-range missile or rocket launches in an effort to develop nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the U.S.  Wit put forward three scenarios of the North's nuclear arsenal expansion, with the minimal growth scenario forecasting the stockpile to expand to 20 weapons and the moderate growth scenario predicting an arsenal of 50 weapons by 2020.  Should the North remain on its current trajectory, the moderate growth scenario would be the case, he said.  The worst case scenario of 100 weapons could happen when significant advances are made in weapons designs allowing the North to deploy battlefield and tactical weapons if it chooses to do so. The average stockpile yield in that case could increase to 20 or more kilotons, with an increasing number having yields of 50 kilotons, he said.  In addition, a one stage thermonuclear device with a yield of 100 kilotons can be tested, he said.  Nuclear proliferation is also a key concern, he said.  ""If their stockpile grows, both nuclear and missiles, the possibility is definitely going to increase that know-how and technology may go abroad for the right price,"" he said.  The expert called for the U.S., South Korea and Japan to ""wake up"" and focus on efforts to cope with the North's increasing nuclear stockpile. Wit said in particular that South Korea appears to be putting too much emphasis on preparations for unification.  ""Why does anyone think that a North Korea with 50 to 100 nuclear weapons is going to be interested in reunification with South Korea on any terms but its own? It's just not going to happen. So we need to purge our policies of fantasies and focus on reality,"" he said.  Meanwhile, the U.S think tank Heritage Foundation said it also believes the North ""has likely already achieved warhead miniaturization, the ability to place nuclear weapons on its medium-range missiles, and an ability to reach the continental United States with a missile.""  The assessment was included in the foundation's ""2015 Index of U.S. Military Strength"" report.  ""Enough information is available to conclude that North Korea has likely already achieved the ability to deliver nuclear weapons by means of its Nodong medium-range missile,"" the report said, adding that Pyongyang has pursued nuclear and missile programs for decades and could have won cooperation from Pakistan and Iran.  As to the North's missile capabilities, the report said the country has deployed about 800 Scud short-range ballistic missiles, 300 Nodong medium-range missiles and 50 Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missiles.   ""Pyongyang continues its development of the Taepo-dong series of ICBMs, at least some of which have a range sufficient to hit parts of the U.S.,"" the report said.

Hwang left for Russia Monday for a three-day visit.  North Korea has demanded the resumption of the six-party talks without preconditions, but Seoul and Washington have said that the North should first demonstrate its seriousness about denuclearization.  North Korea has increasingly grown closer to Russia in recent months, apparently because its relations with China, the North's long-time ally, have been strained following its nuclear test in 2013.  Russia's top diplomat Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 8 that Moscow's move to improve ties with North Korea will be made in a way not to hamper interests of other neighboring countries. Russia said it will do its part to lead the North to give up its nuclear program.   Hwang and his counterparts from Washington and Tokyo held talks in Japan last month and the Korean envoy also held talks with China's top nuke negotiator Wu Dawei earlier this month.  He told reporters in Beijing that the two sides have narrowed differences on conditions about restarting negotiations over the North's nuclear issue but added Pyongyang has yet to show its sincerity toward denuclearization.

The Foal Eagle field training drill, which will continue through April 24, is expected to mobilize about 200,000 South Korean soldiers and 3,700 U.S. troops, mostly from overseas, for a series of land, air, sea and special maneuvers. The two programs are designed to ensure robust defense readiness and a strong response to provocations from across the border, officials said. The USS Fort Worth, a 3,450-ton Freedom-class littoral combat ship, will join Key Resolve for the first time as part of its rotational deployment to the 7th Fleet. Designed for shallow water operations, the state-of-the-art vessel boasts surface warfare mission package capabilities, carrying an MH-60R helicopter, a MQ-8 vertical takeoff unmanned aerial vehicle, a Mark 110 57-millimeter gun and 21 surface-to-surface missiles. Five members of the U.N. Command ― Australia, Canada, Denmark, France and the U.K. ― will also participate. As part of the Neutral Supervisory Commission, Switzerland and Sweden are scheduled to observe and monitor the process in line with the armistice agreement that concluded the 1950-53 Korean War, U.S. Forces Korea said. “It is important to maintain our high level of proficiency in key tasks while exercising different scenarios,” Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the USFK, UNC and Combined Forces Command, said in a statement. “Exercising our multinational force is an important component of readiness and is fundamental to sustaining and strengthening the alliance.” With North Korea fiercely opposed to the annual exercises, the mood on the peninsula will likely freeze further and the prospects for cross-border rapprochement darken, with a high possibility of the North test-firing short-range missiles or engaging in other provocations. Last month, Pyongyang offered to place a moratorium on nuclear tests if Washington shelved its plans for the joint drills this year. The U.S. rebuffed the proposal, warning against making an “implicit threat” and reiterating calls for a sincere commitment to denuclearization.The UNC has already informed the North’s military about the programs’ timetable and defensive nature through their mission at the border village of Panmunjeom, USFK said.The Rodong Sinmun, a mouthpiece of the ruling Workers’ Party, dismissed the claim on Tuesday, calling the exercises a “rehearsal for aggressive war aimed at militarily killing” the country. “The chances for dialogue or a diplomatic resolution are already gone,” it said. “The only thing left is a military response while we maximize our war deterrence.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","annual joint military drills next ,joint military drills next month ,their annual joint military drills ,military drills next month ,tuesday calling the exercises rehearsal","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Key Resolve', 'south korean', 'american', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Key Resolve', 'mq-8', 'Mark', 'the U.N.

Others say the dissent appears designed to weaken the South Korea-U.S. alliance.Despite the fact that THAAD is a wholly defensive system capable of targeting only North Korean missiles directed at South Korea, top Chinese officials ― most recently China’s Defense Minister Gen. Chang Wanquan ― have repeatedly voiced opposition to THAAD.Military experts say that, contrary to lingering speculations, THAAD could not shoot down Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles headed for the U.S. mainland, or pose any missile threat to China, should it be based on the peninsula.“The THAAD interceptor has a range of 200 kilometers. Its range means that a THAAD interceptor ― if based at Osan Air Base, a likely U.S. option (for the potential deployment) ― could not reach as far north as Pyongyang ― it would fall about 65 kilometers short,” said Bruce Bennett, a senior analyst at the U.S. think tank RAND Corp.“Thus, the THAAD interceptor’s maximum range is only halfway to (China’s northeastern border city of) Dandong. It cannot reach Chinese missile fields.”THAAD is designed to intercept incoming missiles at altitudes of 40-150 km after detecting the missiles with land-based radar that has a maximum range of about 1,800 km. But China’s long-range missiles would travel far above THAAD’s maximum altitudes. On top of this, THAAD is aimed at intercepting missiles falling toward Earth during their “terminal phase,” not missiles flying far beyond the peninsula. Apart from the altitude issue, THAAD’s operational range is too short to intercept Chinese or Russian missiles.China may take issue with the radar system with the argument that THAAD could be used to gather intelligence about Chinese military activities. But China is already under the scrutiny of a host of U.S. intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets including military satellites, and vice versa.Then, what has been driving China’s complaints about the potential deployment of THAAD to Korea? There may be several answers to the question that involve China’s calculus of strategic national interests.Weakened A2/AD capabilities In recent years, China has been enhancing its military capabilities to keep any hostile forces ― potentially U.S. troops ― at bay with cruise and ballistic missile, bombers, and other advanced weapons with longer operational ranges, and greater lethality, survivability and accuracy.China’s coastal regions are now strewn with state-of-the-art weapons systems, which have apparently signaled that any external forces that attempt to encroach upon its territory and hamper its advance farther into the Pacific would likely face strong military responses.U.S. officials have described such capabilities to fend off hostile approaches and project power beyond its shores as “antiaccess/area denial” capabilities. China may think the deployment of THAAD to the peninsula could potentially weaken its A2/AD capabilities, observers noted.“China views the introduction of THAAD in South Korea as a new capability that could potentially, in the long term, offset China’s ballistic missiles that serve as power projecting platforms, while increasing Beijing’s strategic and political leverage,” said Michael Raska, research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, affiliated with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.“Both China and U.S. defense planners are currently conceptualizing long-term military hedging strategies that would mitigate each other’s strategic options. The deployment of THAAD, while important, is only a part of many strategic calculations that shape their threat perceptions.”Antiaccess, or A2, refers to action that prevents a hostile military force from moving toward a specific operational area, while area denial, or AD, means action aimed at obstructing any maneuvering within the area.To overcome the A2/AD challenges, the U.S. has been exploring and devising a set of “offsetting” concepts in recent years with the aim of creating an efficient joint force capable of handling evolving security threats in all domains ― air, land, sea, space and cyberspace. Washington’s offsetting concepts are aimed at countering military challenges not just from China, but from all potential adversaries including Iran and North Korea. Among the U.S.’ operational concepts, AirSea Battle is the most publicized. Since Washington revealed its work on the concept in the Quadrennial Defense Review in 2010, it has run an AirSea Battle office to advance the concept and sought to develop its assets and force structure in line with the concept.A crucial element of the operational concept is sturdy missile defense as the missile shield would help enable U.S. forces to block hostile missiles and ensure their ability to gain access to operational areas and maneuver within the areas. To weaken S. Korea-U.S. allianceSome experts speculate that China appears to have repeatedly voiced its opposition to THAAD as part of its campaign to weaken the long-standing alliance between Seoul and Washington.China may also attempt to probe South Korea to see what strategic choices it will make to avoid compromising its relations with Beijing, a crucial partner for Seoul in terms of trade, tourism and efforts to denuclearize North Korea, they noted.Bennett said that the “political rationale” of undercutting the alliance seems to be driving China’s complaints about the potential dispatch of THAAD here.“If the military justifications for China’s complaints do not make sense, it seems to me that the objectives behind China’s complaints are political; China is apparently trying to prevent South Korea and the U.S. from making our alliance even closer than it already is,” he said.“China has always been interested in its ability to influence its neighbors, to impose Chinese decisions on its neighbors. The stronger that the South Korea-U.S. alliance is, the weaker China’s ability to impose its will on South Korea.”Woo Jung-yeop, a research fellow with the think tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies, predicted that China’s attempts to hurt the Seoul-Washington alliance may continue, given that such attempts dovetail with China’s security goals.“Unlike the U.S., China has no (security) allies. Thus, weakening the U.S.’ alliance systems would be suited for its strategic goals. (I think) China intends to explore possibilities surrounding to what extent it can further pressure South Korea over alliance-related issues,” he wrote in a recent analysis published by the Jeju Peace Institute.Aside from the issue of THAAD, China has already pushed South Korea to make tough strategic choices on multiple fronts.Beijing has long objected to Seoul’s security collaboration with Washington and Tokyo. Seoul’s agreement last December to ink a trilateral military information-sharing arrangement with the two security partners has apparently unnerved Beijing.Beijing has also pressured Seoul to participate in the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank despite Washington’s objections. The AIIB is seen as a scheme by China to lead the regional financial order, which has long been dominated by the U.S. and Japan. China’s pressure on South Korea to take its side is expected to escalate as China seeks to build a “community of shared interests and common destiny” with neighboring countries amid its stepped-up peripheral diplomacy.Undermined nuclear deterrenceThe U.S.’ enhanced missile defense ― irrespective of its locations on the U.S. mainland or abroad ― has been a source of concern for China as it could undermine China’s capabilities to ensure deterrence through the threat of a retaliatory nuclear strike.Since its first nuclear test in 1964, China has maintained a limited nuclear arsenal apparently based on the belief that with a small number of nuclear arms it can ward off nuclear aggression and blackmail, and join the ranks of nuclear powers to foster national pride.But the U.S.’ fortified missile shield could complicate China’s nuclear strategy ― deterrence with the threat of massive damage to its adversary through assured retaliation ― and make the emergent Asian power more vulnerable to foreign attacks.Robust deterrence can be established when there is a clear prospect that an act of aggression will lead to unacceptable damage in return. But when a potential adversary believes it has a defense mechanism strong enough to counter a retaliatory strike, deterrence could crumble.During the Cold War, the prospects of nuclear retaliation ― or a second strike ― prevented the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union from initiating a war and helped manage the “balance of terror” stemming from the shared view that any war would result in “mutually assured destruction.”The two foes also refrained from strengthening missile defenses to maintain “strategic vulnerability” to nuclear retaliation, thinking that the other side would avoid making an irrational decision due to the risk of a nuclear counterstrike.Though it is still difficult to determine the true intensions behind China’s opposition to THAAD, China could think that setting up America’s beefed-up missile defense near its territory could further limit its retaliatory capability, or second-strike capability.By and large, China’s nuclear strategy has been seen as deterrence-oriented due to its relatively small number of nuclear warheads.China possesses some 250 nuclear warheads ― the lowest figure among the five officially recognized nuclear powers, according to the Global Nuclear Weapons Inventories in 2014, which was compiled by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. The U.S. has about 7,500 nuclear warheads including more than 1,920 deployed strategic warheads.Given the imbalances in the nuclear quantities, ensuring a reliable and sustainable second-strike capability is crucial for an ascendant China, particularly amid its intensifying strategic rivalry with the U.S. in the Asia-Pacific. At the core of a nuclear power’s second-strike capability is submarine-launched ballistic missiles as these can be fired from undetectable locations at any time, making the launches almost unpreventable. Although there also has been an imbalance in the nuclear-armed submarine forces between the U.S. and China, China has been pushing to bolster its sea-based nuclear deterrent to reduce the gap with other nuclear powers.Whatever methods a nuclear power utilizes to secure its second-strike capability, what is evident is that no nuclear power can defend itself against massive nuclear strikes ― a reason why the U.S. missile defense program aims to defend against “limited” ballistic missile attacks. But the controversy surrounding the deployment of THAAD is likely to remain a source of diplomatic and military friction between Beijing and Washington, and between Beijing and Seoul, as long as the distrust between the two major powers continues.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","complicate china nuclear strategy deterrence ,targeting only north korean missiles ,beijing has also pressured seoul ,weaken korea alliancesome experts speculate ,ward off nuclear aggression","['China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'China', 'Defense', 'Chang Wanquan', 'thaad.military', 'chinese', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'Bruce Bennett', 'U.S.', 'RAND Corp.', 'China', 'chinese', 'China', 'chinese', 'russian', 'China', 'chinese', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Korea', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'A2 / ad', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Michael Raska', 'the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies', 'Nanyang Technological University', 'Singapore', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'China', 'Iran', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'AirSea Battle', 'Washington', 'the Quadrennial Defense Review', 'U.S.', 'S.

(Yonhap)“Troops under the 4th Corps of the Korean People’s Army carried out the drills to strike and occupy the islands at a time when passionate troops were keen on achieving the goal of national reunification,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency reported on Saturday.Underscoring the deterioration in relations between Washington and Pyongyang, KCNA pointed out that the drills targeted the U.S. “Our troops in the units along the southwestern front were full of determination and resolve to retaliate against the U.S. imperialists and their sympathizers,” the KCNA said. “The drills were aimed at confirming the practicality of our combat plan that was drawn up to devastate and occupy the islands should a fight break out.The North’s 4th Corps, which participated in the drills, was thought to have masterminded the 2010 artillery attack on South Korea’s border island of Yeonpyeongdo, which killed two marines and two civilians.A Seoul official said that the North mobilized surface-to-ship Silkworm missiles, ground-to-air SA-2 missiles and 122-mm multiple rocket launchers for the live-fire drills. The Silkworm missile has a range of up to 95 kilometers and has been used to threaten South Korean patrol ships operating near the Northern Limit Line, a de facto inter-Korean maritime border that the North has long attempted to nullify.The SA-2 missile has a range of 48 km and has been deployed to shoot down hostile aircraft. The North is thought to have about 180 SA-2 missiles. The 122-mm multiple rocket launchers have a range of about 20 km and have been deployed to target the South’s border islands.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. (Yonhap)Meanwhile, the U.S. Internet media outlet, the Washington Free Beacon, reported last week, citing Washington officials, that the North had conducted the first flight test of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile last month. The report said that the flight test of the KN-11 missile took place on Jan. 23 off the coast of North Korea from a sea-based platform. It added the flight test followed a land-based ejection test of the missile last November from a static launcher located at the North’s Sinpo South Shipyard.Seoul officials, however, said the report was untrue. They said that the launch was just a test of a vertical missile launcher in a coastal area, and did not involve a sea-based platform.“The reports on a flight test of the SLBM were different from the truth. It was a test of a vertical launcher, not a flight test,” a Seoul official told media.Seoul and Washington have carefully monitored the North’s development of an SLBM, which could give Pyongyang the ability to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack. Along with the nuclear bomb and intercontinental ballistic missile, the SLBM completes the strategic nuclear arsenal, which experts call the “nuclear triad.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","drills last week to strike ,conducted military drills last week ,the drills were held friday ,military drills last week ,military drills last week to","['North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'the Korean People ’s Army', 'Seoul', 'Nampo', 'north korean', 'the 4th Corps of', 'Korean People ’s Army', 'the 4th Corps', 'the Korean People ’s Army', 'the North ’s Korean Central News Agency', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'KCNA', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'KCNA', '4th Corps', 'South Korea ’s', 'Yeonpyeongdo', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.', 'the Washington Free Beacon', 'Washington', 'kn-11', 'North Korea', 'the North ’s Sinpo South Shipyard', 'Seoul', 'SLBM', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'North ’s', 'SLBM', 'Pyongyang', 'SLBM', 'song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5269112   0.63039654

""It was a classic case of good intentions paving the way to hell,"" said Ievgen Vorobiov of the Polish Institute of International Affairs.""(German Chancellor Angela) Merkel saw the situation was deteriorating fast and that the United States was talking about supplying arms and escalating the conflict, and felt she needed to act.""But she didn't have a Plan B if the ceasefire failed, and she had nothing to enforce it -- neither military power nor more sanctions.""The West has struggled to formulate a response to the continued fighting. Merkel and French President Francois Hollande emerged from a meeting in Paris on Friday offering nothing but further calls for the truce to be respected. Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to deny he is directly backing the rebels, even as NATO remains adamant that his special forces, artillery and air defence units are still very much active in Ukraine. But some analysts argue the battle for Debaltseve was inevitable, with the rebels clearly seeking more territory and resources to make a viable mini-state out of their fiefdom in the east.It also had symbolic importance, having been a key focus of military campaigns during the 19th and 20th centuries.France and Germany may have decided to accept the fall of Debaltseve as the price for peace, said Jorg Forbrig of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank. ""They are not naive. Perhaps they think now this question is in a sense settled, it could contribute to a more durable ceasefire,"" he said. The question is whether the rebels will now pressure other areas, notably the port city of Mariupol. But Balazs Jarabik, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the rebels may be reluctant to attack a million-strong city of mostly Russian speakers.""The more bloody the rebel advance, the more it proves right those who say Russia must be stopped,"" said Jarabik. ""Putin has already achieved his main goals -- he's taken Crimea, he has a frozen conflict in the east. Now he needs the fighting to stop so that the international pressure on him falls.""Russia has encouraged ""frozen conflicts"" elsewhere in its neighbourhood, for instance in Georgia and Moldova where it has fuelled separatist movements just enough to keep the countries unstable and make them unattractive partners for the West.But even if the ceasefire holds, many see the deal as heavily weighted in Russia's favour. ""It puts all the cards in rebel and Russian hands,"" said Kadri Liik of the European Council on Foreign Relations.""The first Minsk accord (signed in September) prepared the ground for a frozen conflict, but the second has handed exactly the sort of leverage to Russia that it has been seeking.""She points to clauses that say Ukraine will only regain control of its border by the end of the year, and only after constitutional reforms that will leave Russia with a powerful say over affairs in the east. The other problem is whether Kiev -- with its economy in freefall and its politicians at each other's throats -- is ready for the difficult political negotiations to come. ""It's more and more clear that the West isn't able to mobilise the money that Ukraine needs, and that the government in Kiev can't pull its act together,"" said Jarabik. ""This needs to be the focus now. If there's no political progress, then there will be a return to fighting.""And then there's the wider geopolitical problem of whether Russia and the West can ever patch up their differences after a year in which relations have dive-bombed. The problem, said Liik, is a basic difference in how they view the world: the West sees a rules-based system, Russia sees great powers defending their spheres of interest. ""What the West wants is a profound change in Russia's behaviour, and that will not be easy, particularly since the West's track record has been chaotic and unimpressive,"" she said.","ukrainian military into humiliating retreat ,latest attempts to negotiate ceasefire ,russian speakers the more bloody ,some analysts argue the battle ,battle for debaltseve was inevitable","['PARIS', 'AFP', 'Ukraine', 'France', 'Germany', 'belarussian', 'Minsk', 'pro - russian', 'Debaltseve', 'ukrainian', 'Ievgen Vorobiov', 'the Polish Institute of International Affairs', 'Angela', 'the United States', 'french', 'Francois Hollande', 'Paris', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'NATO', 'Ukraine', 'France', 'Germany', 'Jorg Forbrig', 'the German Marshall Fund', 'the United States', 'Mariupol', 'Balazs Jarabik', 'the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace', 'russian', 'Russia', 'Jarabik', 'Putin', 'Crimea', 'Georgia', 'Moldova', 'Russia', 'russian', 'Kadri Liik', 'the European Council on Foreign Relations', 'Minsk', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Kiev', 'Ukraine', 'Kiev', 'Jarabik', 'Russia', 'Liik', 'Russia', 'Russia']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71121949  0.76395714

The president also asked the panel to prepare a road map to seek support and investment from neighboring countries for her vision of unified Koreas. ”Many countries and global firms are making massive investments in infrastructure projects in developing countries,” she said.“We have to come up with measures to attract both public and private funds from around the world to the Korean Peninsula, and make sure that the investment becomes seed money for global growth.”The remarks came amid escalating tension following Pyongyang’s intensified threat against Seoul over leaflets decrying the regime and its planned joint military drills with Washington.Park criticized the North for its continuation of threats, despite the South Korean government’s offer of high-level talks.

910,910,N.K. ‘most significant source’ of Asian instability,A senior U.S. official called North Korea “the most significant source of instability” in East Asia last week as military tensions continued to rise on the peninsula amid Pyongyang’s hardened rhetoric against South Korea and the U.S.“I believe the most significant source of instability in the region is North Korea and its reckless pursuit of a larger and larger nuclear program and the missiles to deliver those we...,"A senior U.S. official called North Korea “the most significant source of instability” in East Asia last week as military tensions continued to rise on the peninsula amid Pyongyang’s hardened rhetoric against South Korea and the U.S.“I believe the most significant source of instability in the region is North Korea and its reckless pursuit of a larger and larger nuclear program and the missiles to deliver those weapons around the world,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a press conference in Japan ― the last leg of his Northeast Asia tour ― on Friday.“And that’s why we’ve been trying to make common cause with Japan, with South Korea, with China, with Russia to convince North Korea that it needs to denuclearize.”His remarks came amid a freeze in relations between Washington and Pyongyang, and persistent military threats by the North, which escalated after its recent vow to step up its efforts to develop high-tech weapons.During a meeting of the politburo of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party last Tuesday, the North adopted a defense policy document in which it vowed to develop “accurate, lightened, unmanned, intelligent military equipment that correspond to the requirements for modern-day warfare.”Analysts said that this could point to nuclear arms that are small enough to mount on long-range ballistic missiles, or inexpensive yet highly efficient weapons systems such as drones and stealth weapons systems.Given the North’s vow to develop advanced military equipment, observers predicted that the reclusive state could showcase some of its weapons ― developed or under development ― during major events such as the 70th anniversary celebration of Korea’s liberation from Japan’s colonial rule on Aug. 15 or the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers’ Party on Oct. 10.Over the weekend, Pyongyang criticized a recent series of military exercises including South Korea-U.S. joint marine drills.“Should warmongers (in the South) continue to be on a road of military confrontation despite our repeated warnings, it would face merciless punishments,” said a commentary in the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the Workers’ Party, on Saturday.“Can the inter-Korean issues be resolved and can the two Koreas realize (the goals of) inter-Korean reconciliation and unity when we sit down for talks with these warmongers? The South should choose between facing a miserable end with the final confrontation with us, and resolving bilateral issues after stopping military provocations.”Cross-border tensions have remained high amid the continued deadlock in inter-Korean relations. Seoul has pushed for the unconditional resumption of inter-Korean talks, while Pyongyang demanded Seoul lift the so-called May 24 economic sanctions against it.Pyongyang has also demanded that Seoul and Washington cancel their upcoming annual drills, in return for a moratorium on its nuclear tests. But the allies rejected the proposal, saying the two issues were unrelated.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","northeast asia tour on friday ,last week as military tensions ,ruling workers party last tuesday ,asia tour on friday ,week as military tensions continued","['U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.“I', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Antony Blinken', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'the Workers ’ Party', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'the Workers ’ Party', 'inter - korean', 'Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 3.          1.          0.         ... -0.73197973  0.71705866

But some of those radionuclides have never been detected before in the history of the International Monitoring System, and the possible source became the subject of controversy, they said.    ""Seismic analysis published in January 2015 seems to support the idea that it was a nuclear test. But it's important to note that the radionuclide-noble gas component of the monitoring system detected something contemporaneously that the waveform detection methods missed at that time,"" they said.   It wasn't the first time that the North has been alleged to have conducted a nuclear test in 2010.   In November, Wen Lianxing, a professor of the Beijing-based University of Science and Technology of China, claimed that North Korea conducted a ""low-yield underground nuclear test"" in May 2010 and the test yielded a 2.9-ton blast with a margin of error of 0.8 ton.   In 2012, Lars-Erik De Geer, an atmospheric scientist with the Swedish Defense Research Agency, claimed in a military science journal that the North conducted two nuclear tests in April and May of 2010, citing analysis of atmospheric samples collected from over the Korean Peninsula.   But these claims have not been officially confirmed.   The official record is that the North has so far conducted three nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka is scheduled to arrive here on Feb. 24 and have talks with President Park Geun-hye two days later, her office said. His four-day visit will be the first prime ministerial trip from the European country since 2001, and includes a delegation of ranking officials and some 60 business executives. They are expected to swap views on the situation in Northeast Asia, Europe and around the globe and discuss ways to expand cooperation in economics, trade, energy, infrastructure, science and technology, culture, education and other areas. The two countries forged their diplomatic relations in 1990. Their trade volume topped $2.2 billion in 2013, with South Korean investment in the Czech Republic totaling nearly $1.5 billion. Park, for her part, will also introduce her vision for inter-Korean relations and reunification to request the premier’s support. Prague established diplomatic ties with Pyongyang in 1948 with embassies in each country. Lubomir Zaoralek, the Czech foreign minister who has traveled to both Koreas in 2005 as chief of the lower house, said the country is looking into how to contribute to the peninsular issues such as by returning to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, during a phone conversation with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se last March. Sobotka’s visit comes as Seoul strives to promote what it calls middle-power diplomacy aimed at raising its voice on regional and global conundrums by bridging the advanced and developing worlds.Last year, Yun launched consultations with the Visegrad Group ― an alliance of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia ― and sealed an agreement with the International Visegrad Fund to carry out development projects in Eastern European countries. The Czech Republic is set to take over the chairmanship of the coalition, also known as the V4, in July from Slovakia. “The upcoming summit will provide a good opportunity to consolidate the Visegrad Group’s support for a peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and expedite practical multilateral collaboration in such areas as energy, development and culture within the cooperation framework between South Korea and the V4,” the presidential office said in a statement.

The problem is nobody had any plastic sheets of glass to build them, or fuel to heat them,” he added.Some defector-run websites have run reports of how slogans have become the butt of private jokes among ordinary North Koreans who often amend them to reflect reality. (AFP)","korea unveiled thursday an exclamation ,north korea unveiled thursday ,north korea unveiled thursday an ,korea unveiled thursday ,kcna news agency on thursday","['North Korea', 'Kim', 'U.S.', 'North Koreans', 'KCNA news agency', 'Worker ’s Party', 'Korea', 'korean', 'japanese', 'grow', 'greenhouses!”Prominence', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'the United States', 'Lee Min - bok', 'North Korea', 'Lee', 'North Koreans', 'AFP']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23557279  0.77338809

Amb. Kwon Young-se was also cautious when talking about the possibility of a visit by Kim to Russia in May, saying it is too early to conclude that Kim's trip to Russia would take place. Kim took the helm of the authoritarian state in late 2011 after his father, Kim Jong-il, died. China is North Korea's ideological ally and economic lifeline, but their political ties remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013. Russia has said that Kim would be among those attending the May 9th ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.""I believe that a visit by Kim Jong-un to China is connected to the issue of denuclearization,"" Kwon told Yonhap News Agency in an interview. ""From the perspective of China, there is a clear aspect that it would be burdensome to conduct a highest-level exchange with North Korea at a time when North Korea shows no progress in the nuclear issue,"" Kwon said.Asked about the possibility of Kim's visit to Russia in May, Kwon replied, ""No one can speak conclusively."" Analysts say North Korea won't give up its nuclear weapons program because it would prolong the Kim regime and help obtain political and economic benefits from the international community. With China cold-shouldering the nuclear policy of North Korea, Pyongyang is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been under intense pressure over the conflict in Ukraine, is also eager to bolster ties with North Korea in an apparent effort against America's pivot to Asia.

Col. Jeff Pool, a Pentagon press officer, said Kirby's comments are not different from previous positions as officials from the two sides have often talked informally to each other about the issue because, for example, there have been frequent press reports about it in South Korean media.  He stressed that there are no serious or official talks under way currently.  ""It would be untruthful to say that we haven't informally discussed (it) because we already had a site survey in the ROK (South Korea) and Gen.

The U.S. has displayed its desire to install here the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, a key part of its missile defense scheme, to better counter North Korean threats. This poses a pressing dilemma for Seoul due to China’s opposition that the system appears to be targeting it as well, reiterated last week by its defense minister. “It’s a system that is purely defensive and it is aimed exclusively at dealing with the threat posed by North Korea, and it all happens to be a good system,” Blinken told reporters at the Foreign Ministry headquarters in Seoul.“But this is all premature because there is no decision on it, and if we are to move forward, there will be a full consultation with the government here.”  U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken speaks to reporters at the Foreign Ministry headquarters in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)His remarks are apparently aimed at watering down a rekindled controversy following a question-and-answer session on Twitter last week. Asked about Beijing’s resistance toward a potential THAAD deployment in South Korea, he wrote “missile defense on peninsula, including possibly THAAD, directed against DPRK: the greatest source of regional instability,” using North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The post stood out given that Seoul and Washington, wary of backlash at home and from neighbors, had been trying to coordinate their messages that they are not currently in talks on any deployment matters. Blinken touched down in Seoul on Sunday as the first leg of his weeklong Asia tour that will also take him to Beijing and Tokyo. Succeeding William Burns, the former lawyer took office last month after serving U.S. President Barack Obama as a deputy national security adviser and Vice President Joe Biden since his presidential campaign. The deputy secretary is the latest in a recent series of high-level U.S. officials to visit, including Wendy Sherman, U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, and Rose Gottemoeller, U.S. undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. This marks the allies’ efforts to step up policy coordination as Seoul seeks inter-Korean dialogue in the face of escalating tension between Pyongyang and Washington in the aftermath of the North’s suspected hack on Sony Pictures.During his three-day stay here, Blinken met with Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong and reviewed the situation on the peninsula and regional and global issues. Blinken was also scheduled for meetings with academics, university students and alumni of bilateral exchange programs, according to the department.In the wake of the cyberattack, the top diplomat stressed the significance of sanctions in reining in the communist regime’s nuclear development and bringing it back to the negotiating table with a commitment to denuclearization. “I think what we’ve seen working together is that the pressure the international community has exerted on North Korea has made a meaningful difference in its ability to acquire materials for its weapons and missile program,” Blinken said. While Washington remains open to dialogue, North Korea should express its sincerity toward denuclearization, he said, calling for the Kim Jong-un regime’s resolve. “It has to decide whether it is serious about getting back to denuclearization and have credible and authentic talks,” he added. “But until North Koreans demonstrate that they are serious, it’s important to sustain pressure on them and to sustain solidarity in the international community.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","better counter north korean threats ,down in seoul on sunday ,seoul due to china opposition ,korea he wrote missile defense ,headquarters in seoul on monday","['Washington', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Tony Blinken', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Blinken', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Tony Blinken', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Beijing ’s', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Blinken', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'William Burns', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Joe Biden', 'U.S.', 'Wendy Sherman', 'U.S.', 'Rose Gottemoeller', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Sony Pictures', 'Blinken', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'Blinken', 'North Korea', 'Blinken', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Koreans', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",18,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.46401995  0.35608503

In an op-ed published by the state-run Global Times newspaper, Li Kaisheng, research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, also publicly admitted that China opposes deploying the U.S. missile-defense system in South Korea because it could hurt China's own security interests. The U.S. has said it was considering deploying a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery in South Korea, home to about 28,500 American troops, to better cope with the growing threats of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities.The THAAD battery is ""nominally intended to counter North Korea, but insiders know, because its scope is about 2,000 kilometers, it far exceeds the defense needs of North Korean ballistic missiles,"" Li said. If South Korea agrees to deploy the THAAD battery, Li said, ""It will undermine the bottom line of the China-South Korea strategic partnership."" South Korea has officially disavowed its intention to join or host the THAAD battery, but South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo told a parliamentary audit in October that the possible deployment of the U.S. missile-defense system would help ensure the South's security posture.China's concerns over a possible deployment of the THAAD battery in South Korea have illustrated how difficult it is for South Korea and China to develop common security interests in Northeast Asia.South Korea and the U.S. urge China, the economic lifeline of North Korea, to do more in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but China's stance over its ideological ally, Pyongyang, has often been self-contradictory. Many analysts believe that China's Communist Party leadership won't put enough pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions because a sudden collapse of the North's regime could threaten China's own security interests.

Under a revised accord, South Korea is likely to secure some autonomy in dealing with spent nuclear fuel for R&D; purposes if doing so does not pose any risks of nuclear proliferation, they said.Currently, Seoul should seek consent from the United States case by case when tinkering with spent nuke fuel.""The two countries are in the last stage of fine-tuning some details after reaching agreement on major points of the nuke accord,"" a source said, asking not to be named.South Korea has been in talks with the aim of meeting its three goals for the negotiations -- winning the right to deal with spent nuke fuel, securing stable supply of nuclear fuels and promotion of exports of nuclear power plants.The main sticking point of the accord talks was whether Seoul would be able to win the right to enrich uranium and reprocess spent nuclear fuel to some extent to address the headache of growing nuclear waste.Despite Seoul's call, the U.S. has been reluctant to do so, apparently due to possible negative impact on its global nonproliferation campaign amid concerns over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.The new accord seems to allow Seoul leeway to deal with spent nuclear fuel in a limited way while still backing up the U.S. nonproliferation policy, the sources said.The Seoul-Washington accord is not likely to contain set of clauses called the ""Gold Standard"" that explicitly prohibit uranium enrichment and reprocessing, they said. In 2008, the U.S. clinched a nuke pact with the United Arab Emirates that includes such clauses.South Korea and the U.S. have agreed to do their best to hold final talks and conclude the nuclear deal ""within several weeks,"" saying that there has been much progress over the accord, according to a statement following a recent meeting of their foreign ministers in Germany.The two sides are expected to hold their final negotiation soon to initial the agreement.A draft of a new nuclear pact between Seoul and Washington would contain the wording of promoting ""strategic cooperation"" in the nuclear energy issues among the two sides, according to officials.South Korea has been seeking to upgrade its strategic cooperation with the U.S. by taking into account its enhanced status in the nuclear power industry.The nuke accord was supposed to expire in March last year, but the two countries agreed to extend it by two years to March 2016 in order to buy time for further negotiations.

The official said South Korea has reached the conclusion through an in-depth analysis of the photo.The North expected that the new anti-ship rocket will ""bring a great change in the navy's defense of territorial waters and strongly react to any attempt of the enemy's fleets of warships for military attack."" Kim was quoted as expressing satisfaction with the development and successful launch of the anti-ship rocket. He also called for production of ""more tactical guided weapons of high precision and intelligence"" based on the knowledge gained from the test-firing.

President Park Geun-hye addresses the members of the committee on aging society and low birthrate at Cheong Wa Dae on Friday. (Yonhap)South Korea’s birthrate stood at 1.18 children per woman last year ― the lowest among the OECD member countries. Almost 15 percent of the country’s population will be 65 or older by 2018, and 50 percent by 2100 at the current birth rate, according to a state-run research firm. Park described the next five years as the “golden time,” or the last chance to tackle the population crisis. “The government as well as every citizen must work together on this,” she said in her first meeting with nine population experts at Cheong Wa Dae. “We can turn this crisis into an opportunity for growth.”South Korea first implemented demographic policies to boost its fertility rate in 2006. Yet the nation’s birthrate that year was exactly the same as last year, proving the policies have failed.The government expects that the nation’s military would be short of 84,000 soldiers by 2030, and the health care cost for the elderly would result in a deficit of 47.7 trillion won ($44 billion) in the national health insurance fund in the same year. The number of South Korean students is expected to drop to 5.61 million by 2030 from the current 10 million. Such government predictions deepen concerns over the country’s fiscal stability and productivity. On top of the low birthrate, the country’s elderly poverty rate was close to 50 percent last year, which was 3.5 times higher than the national average.According to the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, the poverty rate of Koreans aged 65 or older was 48 percent in 2013, while the average rate for all Koreans was 13.7.President Park Geun-hye asked to introduce measures to reduce the cost of housing and raising children, as well as offer more work-life balance programs for the country’s working mothers and fathers. The government also plans to launch a campaign against the country’s “expensive wedding culture,” so more couples could get married without worrying about the cost of the ceremony. The government also plans to expand insurance coverage for infertility treatment.For the welfare of the growing number of senior citizens, the government plans to introduce more recreational and cultural programs. It also plans to support the local beauty and health industries to cater to the growing number of the elderly, by introducing products that specifically meet their needs ― in its attempt to boost the national economy.

However, this week's public remarks by Chinese officials, including the defense minister, again proved how it is difficult for South Korea and China to develop common security interests in Northeast Asia.  If the THAAD battery is deployed in South Korea, Chinese experts have said it would also allow the U.S. military to monitor long-range missile activity deep inside mainland China.   In spite of international sanctions, North Korea continues to pose security threats to Northeast Asia and beyond, by developing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.   North Korea, which has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006, has threatened to conduct a new nuclear test in response to a U.N. resolution condemning its human rights violations.   South Korea and the U.S. have called on China to play a greater role in leading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, but Beijing's diplomacy still appears to put its priority on stability, rather than the denuclearization of North Korea.

""No consultation (between Seoul and Washington) has been made, either.""  He also stressed that key U.S. officials, including Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and the top U.S. envoy to Seoul, Mark Lippert, also officially confirmed the fact.  ""To respond to North Korea's missiles threats, we will build our own Korea Air and Missile Defense suitable for the strategic circumstances of the Korean Peninsula,"" he said, adding that such a stance has been delivered to China through multiple channels.  A day earlier, Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan raised the issue during talks with his South Korean counterpart Han Min-koo in Seoul and voiced concern.  China and Russia view the THAAD deployment in South Korea as a potential threat to their security. Critics also say it is part of a broader U.S. attempt to get Seoul to join its air shield system, which could spark tensions with the neighbors.  Refusing to take part in the U.S.-led air defense system, also joined by Japan, South Korea has been working on developing the KAMD, a low-tier, multiple-interception program.

The tension flared up in October when the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the border after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets.  ""We should deter North Korea's provocations by maintaining a firm military readiness,"" Park said in a security meeting with top officials at the presidential office.Park accused North Korea of making threats while attaching conditions for talks with South Korea. North Korea has remained silent on South Korea's December offer to hold ministerial talks to discuss such bilateral issues.  She also said the security situation on the Korean Peninsula has become more unpredictable following a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures blamed on North Korea.  The U.S. has slapped sanctions on North Korea over its alleged cyber-attack on Sony Pictures for its comedy film ""The Interview,"" which depicts a plot to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-un. While the FBI has determined that North Korea was behind the hacking, North Korea has denied any responsibility, although it described the attack as a ""righteous deed.""  Park warned that South Korea could be susceptible to cyber-attacks unless thorough security measures are in place as everything is connected to the Internet.

The issue now was what they want to achieve.  ""The North Koreans have made it clear publicly and privately that they are a nuclear weapons state and that they intend to be a nuclear weapons state forever,"" he was quoted as saying.

Sung Kim, special representative for North Korea policy, wanted to meet with North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan, the former chief nuclear negotiator, and conveyed a meeting proposal via the North's mission to the United Nations, the source said.The proposal was made before the U.S. official embarked on a trip to Japan and China last week.But the proposed meeting did not take place because the North insisted on Kim visiting Pyongyang, instead of the two sides holding a meeting in a third country, the source said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.Wrapping up his Asia trip, Amb. Kim told reporters in Beijing on Friday that he was disappointed not to hold a meeting with the North, even though the North Koreans were aware he would be in the region and it would have been an opportunity for substantive dialogue on the nuclear issue.On Sunday, the North claimed the U.S. rejected its invitation for Kim to visit Pyongyang.If confirmed, the U.S. dialogue offer to the North would represent a shift in its long-standing stance that the communist nation must first take concrete steps demonstrating its commitment to give up its nuclear program before negotiations reopen.The State Department declined to confirm the proposal but said the U.S. is open to talks with the North.""We remain open to dialogue to discuss a path back to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization. We do not discuss the details of our private diplomatic communications with the DPRK (North Korea),"" a State Department representative said.Washington has been under criticism for taking too hard a stance on Pyongyang and refusing even to hold talks with the country. Supporters of engagement have called for the U.S. to hold at least unofficial or exploratory discussions with the North over how to reopen the formal six-party talks.The six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program have been stalled since late 2008. The communist nation has since carried out two more underground nuclear tests and a series of long-range missile and rocket launches.

Traditional maritime powers such as the U.S., Japan, France, Britain and India have run their submarine commands.One of South Korea’s 1,800-ton 214-class submarines takes part in a naval operation. (Navy)“The launch of the submarine force command is a clear display of our will to perfectly defend our East, West and South Seas through the enhanced quality and quantity of our submarine capabilities,” the Navy said in a press release.“With the command, we have secured capabilities to more proactively deter North Korean threats by effectively controlling and managing our submarine forces ― strategic weapons systems that could stealthily strike the heart of enemy forces.”Rear Adm. Upper Half Youn Jeong-sang, a former deputy naval operations commander, will head the new command tasked with maintaining deterrence against the North, conducting wartime missions to strike strategic enemy targets, and protecting sea lines of communication.Calls for strengthening South Korea’s submarine forces and other anti-submarine capabilities have persisted since a North Korean midget submarine torpedoed the South Korean corvette Cheonan in 2010, killing 46 sailors. The South Korean Navy currently has a total of 13 submarines: nine 1,200-ton 209-class submarines and four 1,800-ton 214-class submarines. By 2019, the Navy will have a total of 18 submarines with the addition of five 214-class submarines. In the 2020s, the Navy plans to add nine 3,000-ton submarines equipped with vertical launchers for submarine-to-ground missiles. The 209-class submarines, first introduced in 1992, will be decommissioned in the 2020s with the addition of the new submarines. According to South Korea’s 2014 defense white paper, North Korea has some 70 submarines including midget submarines, but many of them are old and small-scale. The U.S. has 72 including 58 strategic nuclear-powered submarines, while China has 70 including four nuclear submarines. Japan has 18 submarines, while Russia has 64 including 11 nuclear-powered ones.The ceremony to mark the launch of the command is to be held Monday in Jinhae, South Gyeongsang Province. It will be attended by Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Hwang Ki-chul and Hwang Jin-ha, chairman of the National Assembly’s committee on national defense. U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force Commander Phillip G. Sawyer is also to join the ceremony.South Korea’s efforts to secure submarine forces began in 1984 with the introduction of a midget submarine, named Dolgorae. In 1990, the Navy established the 57th Submarine Squadron headed by a Navy captain. It acquired its first 209-class Changbogo submarine in 1992 from Germany. Three years later, it founded the 9th Submarine Flotilla.In its decades long submarine operations, the Navy has reported no accidents.

Yongbyon, which has produced plutonium used for past nuclear test explosions, restarted in 2013 after being shuttered under a 2007 disarmament agreement. It has been offline since August. Possible signs in satellite imagery from Dec. 24 through Jan. 11 that the reactor is in the early stages of being restarted include hot water drainage from a pipe at a turbine building that indicates steam from the reactor and growing snow-melt on the roofs of the reactor and turbine buildings.The U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, however, said that since the recent observation period was only about two weeks, it’s too soon to reach a definitive conclusion about what’s happening and more monitoring is needed. The institute’s website, 38 North, published the findings. Yongbyon can likely produce about one bomb’s worth of plutonium per year. A uranium enrichment facility there could also give it a second method to produce fissile material for bombs. It is not clear if North Korea has yet mastered the technology needed to make warheads small enough to be mounted on missiles, but each nuclear test presumably moves its scientists closer toward that goal.North Korea has said it is willing to rejoin international nuclear disarmament talks last held in 2008, but Washington demands that it first take concrete steps to show it remains committed to past nuclear pledges.The United States also rejected a recent North Korean offer to impose a temporary moratorium on its nuclear tests if Washington scraps its annual military drills with Seoul; Pyongyang claims those drills are invasion preparation. The U.S. called the linking of the military drills, which it says are defensive and routine, with a possible nuclear test “an implicit threat.” Always rocky ties between Pyongyang and Washington dipped lower because of a recent Hollywood movie depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The U.S. blames the North for crippling hacking attacks on the movie’s producer, Sony, and subsequently imposed new sanctions on the country, inviting an angry response from Pyongyang, which has denied responsibility for the cyberattacks.

Washington imposed fresh sanctions on Pyongyang early this month for its alleged hacking of Sony Pictures over its comedy film ""The Interview,"" which depicts a plot to kill the North's leader Kim Jong-un.The meeting between Frank Rose, assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance, and Ryu Je-seung, Seoul's deputy minister for national defense policy, came hours after the vice foreign ministers of the allies held discussions on North Korea's denuclearization in Seoul.While the U.S. has gotten tough on the communist country, South Korea is awaiting a response from North Korea for its proposal to have high-level talks, causing some critics to call on the allies to fine-tune their policy toward Pyongyang.The U.S. State Department said earlier this week the two sides will discuss ""topics of mutual interest including extended deterrence, missile defense, arms control and outer space security,"" while the Seoul government dismissed some news reports, saying that the two sides will not touch upon the advanced U.S.missile-defense system, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery.Washington has said it is considering deploying the THAAD battery on Korean soil to better defend against missile threats from North Korea, while South Korea has officially disavowed its intention to join or host it.""The U.S. has yet to make a decision on the issue, and we've not received any request for cooperation regarding the THAAD,"" Kim said. ""The two sides will not discuss the matter (during the meeting).Rose's trip to Seoul is part of a four-nation trip that includes stops in Myanmar, China and Britain.On Tuesday, Rose was in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar, also known as Burma, for discussions on a range of arms control subjects, including ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention with foreign and defense ministry officials.The diplomat then will fly to Beijing on Monday for the U.S.-China Security Dialogue, together with Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Rose Gottemoeller, before visiting London to attend the sixth annual P5 Conference, according to the department.

However, since the facility has been recently observed over a period of only a few weeks, it remains too soon to reach a definitive conclusion on this,"" it said.The reactor had been shut down from late August until mid-December, it said.Indications of possible efforts to restart the facility include snow melting off the reactor's roof and steam coming from a probable pressure relief valve just before it enters the turbine building next to the reactor, the website said.The graphite-moderated reactor has been the source of weapons-grade plutonium for the communist nation. The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods which, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make one bomb a year.In addition to the 5-megawatt reactor, the North has also been building a larger-scale light water reactor at Yongbyon that experts say could give Pyongyang enough plutonium to make about five or six weapons a year.The North has conducted underground nuclear tests three times in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and also built a facility to enrich uranium, which gives the communist regime a second way of building nuclear bombs in addition to its plutonium program.Six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear program have been stalled since the last session in late 2008. North Korea has called for resuming negotiations without preconditions, but the U.S. has demanded Pyongyang first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.

She will leave for Tokyo later in the day.The visit came amid growing concerns here that Washington's tougher pressure on North Korea may conflict with Seoul's efforts to improve inter-Korean relations.Washington imposed fresh sanctions on Pyongyang early this month for its alleged hacking of Sony Pictures over a comedy film revolving around a plot to kill its leader Kim Jong-un.While Washington has taken a tougher stance on the North, South Korea is awaiting a response from North Korea for its proposal to have high-level talks.In a meeting with reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday, Hwang Joon-kook, Seoul's top nuke envoy, dismissed the view that Seoul and Washington are not on the same page.He said it is a misunderstanding to believe that Washington has shut its door for dialogue with the North.The six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programs -- involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia -- have been dormant since late 2008, when Pyongyang walked away from the bargaining table.Seoul and Washington have insisted that the North should first show its sincere commitment toward denuclearization before the six-party talks can be resumed, while North Korea has demanded they be restarted unconditionally.South Korea earlier said it will seek to have exploratory dialogue with North Korea to gauge Pyongyang's intention for the denuclearization talks.The North offered on Jan. 10 to temporarily halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends its annual military exercises with South Korea this year, a proposal flatly rejected by Seoul and Washington.

The ASEAN Plus Three summit was held in Naypyidaw last year.An ASEAN-Korea Center official said that the meeting would serve as a foundation for exchanging best practices and know-how for possible joint projects. “Each country has developed its own expertise and knowledge, therefore we expect synergy by working together and collectively engaging with our ASEAN partners,” he added.ASEAN and Korea have developed relations since 1989. In 2013, ASEAN was Korea’s top tourism destination, second-largest trade partner and third-largest investment destination. Korean firms have participated in an increasing number of construction and infrastructure development projects in a regionwide effort to facilitate connectivity.Bilateral trade volume is expected to reach $200 billion by 2020, bolstered by the ASEAN-Korea free trade agreement and the regional comprehensive economic partnership currently under negotiation ― which includes ASEAN, Korea, China, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand.In the run-up to the launch of AEC on Dec. 31 this year, the ASEAN-Korea Center will host cultural events, investment and trade seminars, youth networking venues, interagency consultations, vocational training and joint research projects.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","meeting in naypyidaw myanmar sunday ,myanmar on sunday to increase ,naypyidaw myanmar sunday asean korea ,on sunday to increase cooperation ,sunday asean korea center","['ASEAN', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Naypyidaw', 'Myanmar', 'southeast asian', 'ASEAN - Korea Center', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN - China Center', 'the ASEAN Economic Community', 'Chung hae - moon', 'ASEAN - Korea Center', 'Yoshikuni Ohnishi', 'ASEAN', 'Purnajaya Tri', 'ASEAN', 'Naypyidaw', 'Myanmar', 'ASEAN', 'AEC', 'Chung', 'the Korea Herald', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'ASEAN', 'Naypyidaw', 'ASEAN', 'Korea Center', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'korean', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'India', 'Australia', 'New Zealand', 'AEC', 'ASEAN', 'Joel Lee']",13,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.22471936  0.67316914

Last year, a new set of reforms, known as ""5.20 measures,"" were announced that call for increasing the farmers' portion to 60 percent.Ireson said the 6.28 measures now appear to be implemented in the North ""widely.""The reforms are believed to have contributed to the North's total food production in 2013 reaching an estimated 5.03 million tons, the highest level since the beginning of the country's economic collapse in the early 1990s, Ireson said.The increase came even though fertilizer availability was worse than the previous year and a period of heavy rain that damaged some crops. Increased production may reflect both increased motivation of farmers, and an increased ability to farm efficiently with limited resources, the expert said.Production in 2014 is believed to be at least similar to that of the previous year, Ireson said, citing data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that the North's rice production is estimated at 1.9 million tons and maze production at 2.3 million tons.The New Year's address by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un suggests that the destitute state would push ahead with implementation of the agricultural reforms, the expert said. But he cautioned against being overly optimistic.""Let's not be overly ebullient. The actions to date do not constitute a Chinese- or Vietnamese-style economic reform, and the DPRK (North Korea) will remain food-insecure for the immediate future. Rollbacks and opposition to other recent changes in farm policy argue for a wait-and-see approach,"" he said.""At the farm level, the coming year will be instructive, both in terms of whether the 6.28 and 5.30 policies are fully implemented, and whether farmers can take advantage of this new autonomy to increase production,"" he said.

Lee Wan-koo next month. But Lee’s fate appears already sealed, with senior lawmakers openly expressing their endorsement.The confirmation hearing will be held from Feb. 9 to 10, officials from the governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said after a meeting. They also agreed to a full parliamentary session on Feb. 12 to put the nomination to a final vote.Lee will face an array of allegations lodged by the NPAD. The main opposition party accuses the veteran politician’s son of dodging the nation’s mandatory military draft in 2006, by faking a ligament injury.The NPAD also alleged that Lee condoned an influence peddling scandal involving his brother, who was arrested in 2011 for receiving bribes from government contractors in South Chungcheong Province. Lee had served as the provincial governor there from 2006 to 2009.Other critics have raised suspicion that his in-laws speculated in real estate. His wife is accused of passing on 1,237 square meters of land to her brother in 2011, after the land price rose nearly tenfold according to some media reports citing land records.Lee has vowed to answer all the allegations.But statements made by senior Saenuri Party officials and even those from the main opposition suggest that Lee will likely pass his hearing.“I congratulate Rep. Lee’s nomination. I am sure that he will do a great job there if he does as before (at the parliament),” NPAD floor leader Rep. Woo Yoon-keun said on Monday, in reference to Lee’s reputation as a moderate compromiser on divisive partisan issues.Woo even presented a book to Lee at a meeting on Monday, entitled, “The Best Prime Minister, and the Worst Prime Minister.” He suggested Lee “skim through it” before his hearing next month, as the two colleagues shook hands in front of news cameras.The prime minister nominee earned a name as a deal-broker during his term as the Saenuri Party floor leader last year. He is credited with making a breakthrough with the NPAD over the divisive special Sewol bill, a legislation that had kept lawmaking paralyzed for months at the Assembly.Saenuri Party lawmakers have likewise expressed their endorsement of Lee, including Rep. Kim Jae-won, the deputy floor leader. They are also busy preparing for the party’s floor leader primary, to be held next Monday.Rep. Lee Ju-young, former minister of maritime affairs, and Rep. Yoo Seong-min are the leading contenders to succeed Lee as the Saenuri floor leader. Whoever’s elected though, the new leadership is highly expected to vote in favor of Lee’s appointment to show party unity.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","political parties agreed on tuesday ,tuesday to hold confirmation hearing ,full parliamentary session on feb ,held next monday rep lee ,mandatory military draft in 2006","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'NPAD', 'Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee', 'Kim Jae - won', 'Lee Ju - young', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Lee', 'Saenuri', 'Lee ’s', 'Jeong Hunny']",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.04482827 0.3586098  0.41238618]

""The military gave residents of the island prior notice of their plan earlier in the day, and was fully prepared for an emergency, including possible provocations by North Korea during the drill,"" he said, adding that the military has carried out live-fire drills of this scale on a regular basis.  Tensions remain high near the de facto inter-Korean maritime border, known as the Northern Limit Line (NLL). The North does not recognize the line, demanding it be drawn further south, making the region a flashpoint of military confrontation between the two Koreas.In November 2010, North Korea fired some 170 rounds of artillery at the front-line island of Yeonpyeong, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians, and wounding 16 others.The North Korean military has been carrying out firing drills as part of its winter drills since December in an ""unusually intensive"" way, mobilizing its self-propelled artilleries and 122-millimeter guns, according to military officers in Seoul.

Beijing, the host of the talks, and Pyongyang have called for the unconditional resumption of the talks, while Seoul and Washington have demanded that Pyongyang first show “sincerity” in its denuclearization commitments.With the absence of any effective tools to address Pyongyang’s nuclear adventurism, concerns have persisted that the North’s continued development of nuclear capabilities would pose a grave security challenge not only to South Korea and the U.S., but also the entire world through proliferation of nuclear material and technologies to nonnuclear states or terrorists.Seoul has long questioned Pyongyang’s sincerity about its desire for denuclearization, as the North has adopted a policy of simultaneously pursuing the development of nuclear arms and its economy.Touching on the strained relations between Washington and Pyongyang, the Seoul official said that the U.S. had not ruled out dialogue with the North, despite its recent criticism of Pyongyang.“Seoul and Washington have been employing a two-track strategy using both pressure and dialogue, and this is to lead the North to make the right choice,” he said. “It would be a mistake to judge that increasing pressure on the North means stopping dialogue or undermining the efforts for dialogue.”The bilateral relationship between the U.S. and the North has been deteriorating in recent months, triggering concerns that the efforts to resolve the North’s nuclear issue would further be hampered. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama mentioned the possibility of the North collapsing last week, calling it “the most isolated, the most sanctioned, the most cut-off nation on Earth.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","pyongyang nuclear capabilities resume dialogue ,to urgently tackle north korea ,senior seoul official said monday ,terrorists seoul has long questioned ,seoul foreign ministry also said","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Sony Pictures', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 2.          1.          0.         ... -0.66577268  0.89299828

It is inappropriate for the South to address those issues first before the talks begin … inappropriate in terms of the genuine, fundamental development of inter-Korean relations.” As for Seoul’s offer of dialogue with Pyongyang, Lim said that Seoul would not be bound by any timeframe. Seoul’s preparatory panel for national reunification initially proposed holding talks in January.“The panel’s proposal for dialogue also remains valid beyond January. We are not calling for Pyongyang’s response within any fixed timeframe,” he said.On the same day, the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, warned that should the South push ahead with the joint military drills with the U.S., it would bring cross-border ties to a new low. The North has said that it would put a moratorium on its nuclear tests in return for the cancellation of the Key Resolve/ Foal Eagle drills.“The inter-Korean relations are at a crossroads between improvement and disintegration,” a commentary in the paper warned. In a separate commentary, the daily repeated Pyongyang’s demand for Seoul to lift its economic sanctions against it, stressing that the sanctions have blocked inter-Korean cooperation and exchanges including the reunions of separated families.“It causes us to feel enraged that the South distorts the realities and argues that the reunions of separated families had not been held because of us,” the commentary said. “If the South is really interested in the family reunions, it should make decisions to clear fundamental barriers to the relationship including the sanctions and planned military drills.”The so-called May 24 sanctions were put in place in 2010 after the North was found to be responsible for a torpedo attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors. The North denies responsibility.Meanwhile, Seoul’s Defense Ministry said that the South Korean military remained ready to counter any provocations.

""South Korea and the U.S. are pursuing two-track strategies of pressure and dialogue.

Kim alluded to his intention to respond positively to Seoul's December talks offer.The spokesman also noted that the monthlong offer remains effective even after the end of January.

Don’t distort or make a fool of our sincerity and intentions.”Pyongyang resumed its harsh rhetoric after South Korean and U.S. activists launched balloons of anti-Pyongyang leaflets last Monday and Seoul rejected its calls to cancel the South Korea-U.S. military drills slated for next month. The North had refrained from slandering the South since its leader Kim Jong-un expressed his desire for inter-Korean dialogue in his New Year’s speech.The North has recently been seen to be striving to improve relations with the outside world through conditional offers for dialogue, moves that the international community has taken with a grain of salt due to the regime’s unpredictability and insincerity.The North has called on the U.S. to cancel its military drills with South Korea next month in return for a moratorium on nuclear tests. Its leader Kim has also stressed his desire for inter-Korean talks including at the highest level, namely a bilateral summit.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un observes a flight combat drill in his reclusive state.(Yonhap)But Pyongyang’s peace offensive was seen by the media to be part of its efforts to ease international isolation caused by its development of nuclear arms and long-range missiles, human rights violations, and cyberattacks, most recently against Sony Pictures Entertainment.The mood for inter-Korean dialogue has been dampened by the North, which demanded last Friday that Seoul lift its so-called May 24 economic sanctions should it want to hold talks to discuss a range of bilateral issues including the reunions of separated families.Seoul has expressed regrets, stressing that the issue of family reunions should not be linked to the sanctions, which were put in place after the North was found to have carried out a torpedo attack on a South Korean warship in March 2010 that killed 46 sailors.With the two Koreas failing to find a way to break the impasse, Seoul’s Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae maintained a cautious stance, saying that the government was waiting for Pyongyang’s reply to its initial offer of talks.“Rather than talking about what the Seoul government can do (for dialogue) ... I think it is North Korea’s turn to give us its reply (to our offer late last year for talks),” said the minister in an interview with Yonhap.During the interview, Ryoo hinted that Seoul could resume the long-stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan. But he stressed the first step was to fix the problems that caused them to be stopped. The tours were suspended after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier in July 2008 after she strayed into an off-limits area.The prospects of inter-Korean dialogue could be further darkened as South Korea and the U.S. are to begin their annual joint Key Resolve/Foal Eagle exercises next month. The North said the drills were a rehearsal of a “nuclear war of invasion” against it, while the allies stressed the drills were defensive in nature.Meanwhile, the tension between Washington and Pyongyang escalated after U.S. President Barack Obama mentioned the possibility of the North collapsing last week, calling it “the most isolated, the most sanctioned, the most cut-off nation on Earth.”“The kind of authoritarianism that exists there, you almost can’t duplicate anywhere else. It’s brutal and it’s oppressive and as a consequence, the country can’t really even feed its own people,” Obama said during an interview on YouTube. “Over time, you will see a regime like this collapse.”Pyongyang said in response that Obama’s remarks were “complaints of a defeatist who is cornered in a confrontation with North Korea.”“We cannot help but be shocked at Obama, (who is) full of hostility against a sovereign state,” said an unnamed spokesperson of the North’s Foreign Ministry in an interview with the KCNA on Sunday. “As the U.S. was defeated again and again in its efforts to militarily crush our republic (North Korea), it is now attempting to dismantle us through a flow of outside information via Internet. It is a foolish delusion.”A day earlier, the North called for a change in what it calls a U.S. hostile policy toward it.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","stern punishment on sunday accusing ,harsh rhetoric after south korean ,koreas were caught in war ,korea warned of stern punishment ,stern punishment on sunday","['North Korea', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Korea', 'National Defense Commission', 'the North ’s Korean Central News Agency', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Kim Jong - un', 'inter - korean', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'Seoul ’s Unification', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Ryoo', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Key Resolve / Foal Eagle', 'North', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Obama', 'YouTube', 'North Korea', 'the North ’s Foreign Ministry', 'KCNA', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.31863803  0.52766472

Following a legal revision, the ministry took over responsibility for drawing up the plan starting this year. Until last year, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration created the plan.“Defense Minister Han Min-koo ordered his staff to consider financial constraints as the ministry draws up the defense plan. Thus, some procurement plans could be delayed or dropped even though the Joint Chiefs of Staff has already decided to push for them,” a military official told media.Last year, the mid-term procurement plan for 2015-2019 was written on the premise that the state defense budget would increase 10.6 percent from a year earlier. But last year, the budget increased only 4.8 percent, making some of the acquisition plans unrealistic. Some observers say that dozens of projects for the Army, Air Force and Navy may need to be readjusted in consideration of budgetary limits. Some of the projects for which no contract has been signed are likely to be canceled, they say.“Budgetary pressure is quite considerable. Thus, there will be readjustments to defense projects and priorities. Obviously, uncertainty has increased over the prospect of some acquisition plans, though nothing has been confirmed as of yet,” said a defense official, declining to be named. Among the projects to be delayed is Seoul’s 1.4 trillion won ($1.2 billion) project to introduce four aerial refueling tankers between 2017 and 2019. Seoul initially planned to announce the winner for the project in December 2014, but the winner is now expected to be picked in April or May, sources said.Despite the pressing need to improve South Korea’s deterrence against North Korea’s evolving military threats, increasing defense spending for Seoul remains a tough task due to growing public calls to increase welfare. The Defense Ministry has recently vowed to use cutting-edge technologies for military operations to enhance efficiency in its management of resources and personnel and help address budgetary impediments.

It was eventually screened in select arthouse cinemas, and released on the Internet and via cable TV providers.Washington has blamed North Korea for the hack on Sony -- a claim Pyongyang has denied while still strongly condemning the film, which features a fictional plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un.""The Interview,"" which had a $44 million budget, has since become Sony's highest-grossing online film ever, reportedly making more than $40 million on the Internet and other small-screen formats.The cyberattack caused ""a serious disruption of SPE's network systems... including the destruction of network hardware and the compromise of a large amount of data,"" Sony said, adding that it was forced to shut down its entire network after the hack.It affected most of the subsidiary's ""financial and accounting applications and many other critical information technology applications,"" which will not be functional until early February, it added.The company said its film unit has since ""worked aggressively"" to restore those systems.While the film division has been one of the vast company's best-performing businesses, Sony announced a whopping $109.1 billion yen ($923 million) six-month loss in October and said it was on track to lose 230 billion yen in the fiscal year through March, more than four times its earlier forecast.Sony has struggled in the consumer electronics business that built its global brand, including losing billions of dollars in televisions over the past decade as fierce competition from lower-cost rivals pummelled the TV subsidiary's finances.The company is undergoing a huge restructuring, including job cuts and the sale of its Manhattan headquarters, is it tries to drag itself out of the red.As part of the shakeup, Sony sold its personal computer business, announced it would cut its smartphone unit's global staff by 15 percent -- about 1,000 jobs -- and said it won't pay dividends for the first time since its shares started trading in Tokyo in 1958.","release next month after cyberattack ,by hackers prompted sony to ,february said the hack attack ,it would cut its smartphone ,financial statements after the attack","['AFP', 'Sony', 'japanese', 'Hollywood', 'japanese', 'US', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Tokyo', 'Sony', 'US', 'Sony', 'Washington', 'North Korea', 'Sony', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Sony', 'SPE', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Manhattan', 'Sony', 'Tokyo']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38567761  0.52689105

""We continue to stand by his testimony,'' Darusman said in at a news conference in Tokyo. He added that he stands by calls for North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un to be held accountable for crimes against humanity.Shin's account of North Korean prison life, which gained worldwide attention when he was the subject of the bestselling 2012 book, ""Escape from Camp 14,'' helped put a human face on human rights abuses in the North and spurred international efforts to hold Pyongyang accountable.Details of his account, however, have come under increasing scrutiny.The book's author, Blaine Harden, said in a statement on his website over the weekend that Shin had changed the dates and places of some events described in the book, but not his shocking descriptions of torture and imprisonment.Shin, who is now 32, originally claimed he had lived in a high-security political prison camp from his birth until his escape over an electrified fence in 2005, when he was in his early 20s. He now says he was transferred around the age of 6 to a lighter-security prison camp with his mother and brother. It was there, not the harsher camp, where he informed authorities about an escape attempt by his mother and brother, which led to their execution.He also now says he was later transferred back to the higher security camp after he failed in an escape attempt.Darusman said such revisions do not undermine the validity of the U.N. report on its findings.""These facts came out clarifying his earlier testimony,'' Darusman said. ""What he referred to was a correction of the timeline of events, which do not in any way effect the integrity and credibility of the report.''The commission's report, released early last year, detailed abuses including mass starvation and forced abortions. It recommended that North Korea's human rights situation be referred to the International Criminal Court and sent a letter to Kim Jong Un warning that he could be held accountable.North Korea has tried to use the changes in Shin's account to discredit the entire U.N. report, which it claims was orchestrated by its enemies in an attempt to topple the North Korean ruling regime.Pyongyang denies the existence of the harsh political prison camps, and human rights groups and others rely on both information from defectors and satellite images for information. The North Korean government did not allow the U.N. commission to visit the country.Darusman acknowledged a trial of Kim may be ""quite elusive.''But he said the suggestion Kim could be culpable for the alleged abuses has touched off a defensive fury unusual even by Pyongyang standards, which he said might reflect a rift that is already forming between different factions. He said pressure must be maintained on Pyongyang to further change North Korea's internal political dynamic.","of north korean prison life ,hundreds of defectors interviewed ,north korean prison life ,north korean prison life which ,the harsh political prison camps","['AP', ""the United Nations '"", 'North Korea', 'U.N.', 'Marzuki Darusman', 'Shin Dong - hyuk', 'U.N.', 'Darusman', 'Tokyo', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong Un', 'Shin', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Blaine Harden', 'Shin', 'Shin', 'Darusman', 'U.N.', 'Darusman', ""North Korea 's"", 'the International Criminal Court', 'Kim Jong Un', 'North Korea', 'Shin', 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'U.N.', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's""]",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4599053   0.59067285

The demand by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which handles cross-border affairs, came after Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae proposed at the end of last year a fresh round of high-level talks to discuss the family reunion and other issues of mutual concern.Along with Seoul-Washington joint military drills and anti-Pyongyang leaflets, the sanctions are deemed by the regime as a major sticking point in inter-Korean ties. The measures were levied on May 24, 2010, in response to North Korea’s attacks months earlier on a Southern corvette and a border island. “The solemn reality is that without resolving the issue of the May 24 measures, no dialogue, contact or exchange is possible between the two Koreas,” the committee said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. “If the South is truly interested in humanitarian matters, it ought to remove the bans it put in place with the intention of inciting confrontation, rather than pay lip service to the separated families issue.” Seoul has been demanding an official apology as a prerequisite for any relaxing of the measures, which bar cross-border trade, investment, travel and other exchanges. While upholding the principle, it appears to have somewhat softened its line recently, displaying its willingness to “put any items on the agenda” including the sanctions and stalled tours to a North Korean mountain resort. “North Korea seems to be piling pressure on us to shift our position in a way that is more favorable to them by putting forward preconditions that are difficult for us to accept,” Unification Ministry spokesperson Lim Byeong-cheol told reporters early in the day. In Davos, President Park Geun-hye pledged to “patiently” pursue dialogue and beef up people-to-people exchanges and other cooperation with the North as Seoul seeks to reinvigorate its efforts to prepare for reunification. She pinned high hopes on the potential of an integrated Korea, which she said would bring fresh vigor to not just the economy of the peninsula but also Northeast Asia, Eurasia and the world.The message was delivered at a “Korea Night” reception hosted by the Federation of Korean Industries ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Some 400 policymakers, business executives and politicians took part in the one-day event, according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry. “I yearn for the day when South and North Korea are reunited. Then the Korean Peninsula can go from being a cockpit of geopolitical conflict to a gateway to peace and development in Northeast Asia,” Park said. As 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation and division, South Korea will work to spur progress in its ambitious projects, from “trustpolitik” to the Eurasia Initiative, she said. “Seoul will patiently seek dialogue and cooperation with the North. We will steadily prepare for unification,” the president said. “By doing so, we will seek to make the era of unification not some distant dream but a concrete reality.”In his own address, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said the peninsula had been paying an unjustifiably high price for the 70-year division, citing the agony of separated families, the abysmal human rights record in the North, unabated tension and instability stemming from the recalcitrant neighbor’s nuclear and missile programs. While calling for Pyongyang to do away with its atomic ambitions, Seoul’s top diplomat stressed the need to build a rapprochement “step by step” by gradually cultivating dialogue and cooperation. “Denuclearization is not a precondition, but we cannot talk about peaceful unification or durable peace without resolving this,” Yun said, vowing to establish a virtuous cycle of better inter-Korean ties and disarmament. “If history is any reminder for us, unification will come in an unexpected manner and moment rather than in a predicted fashion. That is why we are laying the solid groundwork for unification.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","seoul to lift its bilateral ,prepare for unification the president ,stalled tours to north korean ,seoul washington joint military drills ,the separated families issue seoul","['North Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae', 'Seoul', 'anti - pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea ’s', 'southern', 'Koreas', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Unification Ministry', 'Lim Byeong - cheol', 'Davos', 'Park Geun', 'North', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Eurasia', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'the World Economic Forum', 'Davos', 'Switzerland', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.66199589  0.53502762

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday that Moscow received a positive signal from Pyongyang after Russian President Vladimir Putin invited Kim to attend a May ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Asked about the Russian invitation and positive signal from North Korea, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying replied, ""North Korea and Russia are both friendly neighbors of China.""""We believe that such engagement between the two countries is conducive to regional peace and stability,"" Hua said. North Korea is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia at a time when its political relationship with China remains frosty amid international pressure over its nuclear ambition and dismal human rights record. Putin, who has been under intense pressure over the West's response over Ukraine, is also eager to bolster ties with North Korea in an apparent effort against America's pivot to Asia. Putin invited Kim to attend the May 9 ceremony during a meeting with Kim's special envoy in November. China is North Korea's main economic benefactor, but political ties between the allies remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013. In what many analysts believe was a message to North Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to South Korea last year, breaking a long-standing tradition by Chinese heads of state of visiting Pyongyang before Seoul.Xi was also invited to the May 9 ceremony in Russia.Russia also invited South Korean President Park Geun-hye for the May 9 ceremony and South Korea's presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters earlier in the day that no decision has been made yet over whether Park will accept the invitation.North Korea has made no official comments about the Russian invitation, but a South Korean diplomatic source in Beijing told Yonhap News Agency last week that Pyongyang ""gave a positive response to the Russian invitation for Kim Jong-un.""The North's positive stance over Russia's invitation of Kim, who has not made a visit to a foreign country since taking the helm of the reclusive country in late 2011, appears to have prompted China to try to move toward warmer relations with Pyongyang recently, the source said on the condition of anonymity. Chinese analysts say Xi may not hold a summit with Kim if North Korea continues to defy international calls to give up its nuclear weapons program. Asked whether China would invite Kim this year, Hua replied, ""I have no specifics to offer to you pertaining to the relationship between China and North Korea.""(Yonhap)","may ceremony in russia russia ,russia also invited south korean ,pyongyang after russian president ,the may ceremony in russia ,pivot to asia putin invited","['China', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Russia', 'Kim', 'Moscow', 'Beijing', 'russian', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'Moscow', 'Pyongyang', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Kim', 'soviet', 'Nazi', 'russian', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Hua Chunying', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'China', 'Hua', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'China', 'Putin', 'Ukraine', 'North Korea', 'America', 'Putin', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'China', ""North Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Xi', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', ""South Korea 's"", 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'russian', 'south korean', 'Beijing', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Pyongyang', 'russian', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Russia', 'Kim', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'Xi', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Kim', 'Hua', 'China', 'North Korea']",14,"[ 2.          8.          0.         ... -0.68964392  0.69851667

Washington has already turned down the North's demand, labeling it as an ""implicit threat.""Pyongyang also called on South Korea to deter ""anti-reunification figures from reckless behavior,"" apparently referring to the civic activists here who have sent balloons across the border carrying leaflets that criticize the North Korean regime.The message is the latest in a series of peace offensives from the North. Though the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a surprise proposal for an inter-Korean summit during his New Year message, Pyongyang remains silent on Seoul's offer to hold ministerial talks in January to discuss such bilateral issues as the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.During a surprise visit to South Korea by a high-powered North Korean delegation in September, the two Koreas had previously agreed to hold a high-level meeting in early November at the latest. But the North later backtracked on the deal in protest of the leaflet campaign.

South Korea keeps a small police detachment on the islets.South Korea has rejected Japan's claim to Dokdo as nonsense because the country regained its independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule and reclaimed sovereignty over its territories, including Dokdo and many other islands around the Korean Peninsula.Tokyo has asserted its claim to Dokdo in its defense report for the past 10 years, but this marks the first time that Japan has unveiled the Korean version of its white paper containing the claim.The summary for 2014 has a map showing the Dokdo islets marked as Japanese territory. In 2013, the report translated into the Korean language did not include such a territorial claim.A Japanese military attache delivered about 50 copies of the summary to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff last week, which passed them on to the defense ministry earlier this week, according to the ministry.  ""We returned the copies when summoning the Japanese envoy,"" the official said.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have reached their lowest ebb in recent years due to Japan's stance on historical grievances and its territorial claims to Dokdo. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties, but Japan's refusal to sincerely apologize for its wartime atrocities has impeded the improvement of the relations, clouding the possibility of a summit among the nations' political leaders.

Watchers said one of the possible government measures will be the revision of the National Security Law to ban any ""anti-state"" activities attempting to praise, encourage or propagandize North Korean political ideals. Currently, an amendment to the draconian law, which allows local courts to disband anti-state, pro-enemy organizations, is pending at the National Assembly.The government move comes a month after the Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of the Unified Progressive Party , a pro-North Korean minor opposition party, outlawing a political party here for the first time since the country adopted its first constitution in 1948.The ruling came more than a year after the justice ministry filed a petition with the court following the arrest of a number of UPP members on rebellion conspiracy charges. Several UPP members, including Rep. Lee Seok-ki, were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government in the event of a war with the communist North.They were found guilty of conspiring with members of a clandestine organization, called the Revolutionary Organization, to topple the South's government if a war broke out with North Korea.The justice ministry said it will enforce efforts to educate elementary school students about the principles of the Constitution.The ministry will join with the education ministry to reorganize the contents of textbooks so that the students could understand the Constitution and the law better, it said.The ministry said that suspects of sex crimes against minors, in principle, will be detained for an investigation, and heavier prison terms will be demanded as well. The government said it will introduce a so-called ""three-strike system,"" against those participating in illegal protests or strikes, as well those who commit violence against police officers.In a separate policy report, the public safety ministry said it will establish a special rescue team, which can respond to land disasters within 30 minutes of occurrence and to maritime accidents within an hour, in order to better cope with national disasters.The move comes after the government came under heavy criticism for its botched initial handling of a ferry sinking in April 2014 that claimed more than 300 lives.The government also plans to introduce a series of reform measures this year to root out corruption in officialdom and thus to raise national competitiveness. To that end, the government will introduce a code of conduct for minister-level officials and a work ethics education program for government employees, among other things.The envisioned code of conduct is designed to rein in possible corruption among government ministers. It will require ministers to take an oath of integrity and bar them from receiving honorariums for giving job-related lectures.All civil servants will be obliged to undergo an education program on work ethics and integrity, while the plan calls for limiting the employment of retired government workers at private companies.

""By ensuring those at the top pay their fair share in taxes, the president's plan responsibly pays for investments we need to help middle class families get ahead,"" the paper said.This would notably be used to lower college fees for poorer students, but it was laughed out of court by Republican budget hawks.""This is not a serious proposal,"" scoffed Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Congressman Paul Ryan, a former vice-presidential candidate and lead Republican budget negotiator.""We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending,"" Buck argued, in remarks echoed across his party.   - Poll bounce -   ===============So what hope is there for Obama's bold plan to spend the fruits of a rising economy -- and taxing the rich -- on free community colleges, help for first-time homeowners and subsidized, high-speed Internet?The latest opinion polls suggest that if Obama is not in a position to impose his plan, he can at least force Republicans to pay a political price for opposing him.Meanwhile, he has used his executive authority to the limit -- opponents would argue stretched it to the limit -- to impose or oppose some policies by decree.The new Congress has made one of its first priorities to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada, an idea Obama has said he will veto out of hand if experts says it will damage the environment.On the foreign policy front, he has announced moves to normalize relations with Cuba and pushed on with talks with Iran on its nuclear program, in defiance of conservative foreign policy foes.Polls suggest Americans support the Cuban outreach and Obama will hammer home his advantage by inviting newly freed US citizen Alan Gross, a former prisoner in Cuba, to the speech.Coincidentally -- or not -- the State of the Union falls on the same day as US envoys begin new talks in Havana on restoring ties, and Obama will push Congress to end the trade embargo.He won't get everything he wants, and much angry politicking lies ahead in the years before his next and last State of the Union, but Obama is already enjoying a popularity bounce.The latest ABC/Washington Post monthly poll published Sunday saw Obama's approval rating up nine to 50 percent, against 44 percent who thought he was doing a bad job, a 10-point drop in disapproval.Why? It's the economy... as ever. Just three months ago, only 27 percent of Americans thought the economy in good health. Now, 41 percent do.

While pushing for robust defense and the North’s denuclearization, it vowed to formulate a vision for an integrated Korea, build consensus at home and abroad and expand dialogue and economic exchanges with Pyongyang. The measures were submitted to President Park Geun-hye jointly by the ministries of unification, foreign affairs, national defense, and patriots and veterans affairs. “As this year marks our 70th anniversary of liberation (from Japan) as well as division into two countries, we’ve set it as the year to usher in an era of unification, and our goal is to make substantive progress in unification preparations,” Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae told a news conference. “For this, the government will intensify collaboration within and establish pan-governmental governance with the Unification Ministry being at the center, while partnering with the private sector and the international community.” The policy package is the latest in a series of North Korea-related measures that appear to adopt a dual-track approach of reengagement and deterrence ― from her “trustpolitik” and “unification bonanza” initiative to the Dresden proposal for greater humanitarian aid and economic exchanges across the border. It attested to Park’s resolve to carry on with last year’s unification campaign as the showpiece of her third year in office and tackle mounting pressure over her lack of diplomatic legacy. Concerns are also growing over increasing public apathy toward the reclusive neighbor and reunification especially among young generations, with some 92 percent of the South’s 50 million citizens born after the division. Under the plans, legislation will be introduced to institutionalize the drive, facilitating the cultivation and mobilization of related organizations and personnel across the central and local governments ― even in future administrations. The Unification Ministry would propose to North Korea to set up inter-Korean cultural institutes in both Seoul and Pyongyang and form a joint committee to devise and prepare for joint cultural, art, sports and religious events marking the 70th anniversary. It is also looking to test-run a railway departing from Seoul for the North Korean border cities of Sinuiju or Rajin, via Pyongyang, which if it materializes could create synergy with an envisioned transcontinental express reaching Europe under Park’s “Eurasia Initiative.”With Pyongyang remaining steadfast in its nuclear ambition, Seoul plans to beef up cooperation with the U.S., China and other core neighbors to settle down a “virtuous circle” of progress in denuclearization and then inter-Korean relations. The ministry pledged to continuously pursue talks with the Kim Jong-un regime to realize Park’s Dresden proposal, to build joint economic infrastructure and intensify cooperation in three areas ― the people’s livelihoods, environment and culture. In her opening remarks, the president reiterated calls for Pyongyang to accept her offer of “any form of dialogue,” discuss issues of mutual concern and work together toward unification. Yet the latest package still lacks steps to induce a breakthrough in tense inter-Korean relations, critics say, while failing to address Pyongyang’s key concerns such as security issues, stalled tours to a North Korean mountain resort and a bilateral ban on inter-Korean exchanges. “We’re calling for dialogue not just to discuss the various events I floated today but, more fundamentally, as a first step to take on distrust and military tension between the two Koreas, among other issues,” Ryoo added. The Foreign Ministry, for its part, is seeking to ramp up diplomatic efforts to prevent a fourth atomic blast or other potential provocations from the recalcitrant neighbor.It also vowed to help restart the stalled six-party talks ― including North Korea, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia ― and stimulate progress in the denuclearization issue on both bilateral and multilateral fronts. “We’re planning to invigorate various three-way channels within the six-party talks including the one between South Korea, the U.S. and China to tackle the current gridlock, while exploring direct consultations with the North regarding the nuclear issue,” Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told reporters. “We will make diplomatic efforts this year with the focus on mobilizing a meaningful denuclearization process.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","year marks our 70th anniversary ,president reiterated calls for pyongyang ,seoul plans to beef up ,year to bring about reunification ,in unification preparations unification minister","['South Korea', 'North ’s', 'Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae', 'the Unification Ministry', 'North Korea', 'Dresden', 'Park ’s', 'the Unification Ministry', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Sinuiju', 'Rajin', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'inter - korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Park', 'Dresden', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Koreas', 'Ryoo', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 2.          3.          0.         ... -0.55452639  0.67013222

Korea dialogue,"President Park Geun-hye urged officials on Monday to create an environment to allow North Korea to take part in proposed inter-Korean talks and start negotiations to improve ties.“To have any form of dialogue, I wish to come up with conditions that will make North Korea respond and begin negotiations,” Park said at a joint briefing by the ministries of defense, foreign affairs and unification.

Seoul and Pyongyang should start a dialogue as soon as possible to promote cooperation and exchanges aimed at laying the foundations for unification, Park said, stressing that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the division of Korea.North Korea has not yet responded to South Korea’s proposal to hold ministerial talks in January to discuss contentious issues including the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. Though North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was open to holding talks with the South in his New Year’s address, Pyongyang has refrained from giving a straight answer. The North has, instead, urged Seoul to stop defectors from sending anti-North Korean leaflets and halt a set of annual U.S.-Korea military drills. The two Koreas held high-level talks last February and had agreed to resume talks late last year. But the North reversed its decision, criticizing the leafleting campaign by groups of South Korean civilians and defectors.President Park Geun-hye attends a joint ministerial briefing session on 2015 policies on inter-Korean relations, foreign affairs and defense at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday. Participants included Prime Minister Chung Hong-won (left) and Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae (third from left). (Yonhap)Later in the afternoon, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae said that he understood Park’s call for creating an environment for North Korea to step forward to be an expression of her frustration that no progress was being made to bring about the talks.“I understand that it was delivered in a way to express that (the president) was feeling stuck since there has been no headway on the inter-Korean talks, and was urging officials to make more efforts (to resume talks),” he said.The minister at the briefing at Cheong Wa Dae said the government would establish a legal and institutional framework, and hold joint economic and cultural events with the North. The Defense Ministry said it would apply the nation’s information and communication technologies to effectively deal with evolving North Korean threats. On the diplomatic front, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs vowed to seek closer cooperation with the U.S., China, Russia and Japan to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.At the session, the South Korean president also urged North Korea to start negotiations to allow members of separated families to meet again by separating the issue from political and ideological matters.“The most important thing is to realize long-cherished dreams of old members of separated families,” Park said. “I hope (North Korea) sees this as a way to guarantee people’s basic rights apart from political and ideological views and works together to come up with solutions.”Park also urged the South Korean military to reinforce its defense capacity and firmly maintain its alliance with the United States in order to deal with North Korea’s asymmetric threats, including its cyberattacks.“I want to stress that we need to prepare for the unification of the two Koreas based on firm awareness of national security,” she said. “I hope for the South Korean military to maintain a strong military readiness to protect the people and the national security from any form of threat and provocation by North Korea,” she added.Park’s comment on North Korea’s cyberattacks came after the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions on it early this month over its alleged hacking of Sony Pictures for releasing the film “The Interview.” The movie is a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Though North Korea has denied its involvement, Park said last week that the sanctions against Pyongyang were “appropriate.”By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","president also urged north korea ,of annual korea military drills ,korean president also urged north ,annual korea military drills ,annual korea military drills the","['Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'anti - north korean', 'Koreas', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'inter - korean', 'Chung Hong - won', 'Unification', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae', 'Unification', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'the Defense Ministry', 'north korean', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'the United States', 'North Korea ’s', 'Koreas', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Park ’s', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Sony Pictures', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.84237701  0.42247829

""The state arms procurement agency will sign a contract with a private company for the project in October, and its development is to be led by Agency for Defense Development (ADD),"" said a military officer, adding some 1 trillion won (US$928.2 million) will be earmarked for its development and production.The spy satellite, which is capable of securing imagery intelligence on the Korean Peninsula and the surrounding regions, is the key detection asset for the country's preemptive strike apparatus of the Kill Chain and the Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system,"" he said on condition of anonymity.In a bid to ensure a stronger deterrence against the belligerent North, South Korea has been developing the KAMD, a low-tier air defense program, and the Kill Chain, which is designed to launch strikes right after signs are detected of imminent nuclear or missile provocations by Pyongyang. The satellites, powerful enough to identify objects as small as cars, will be equipped either with high-resolution synthetic aperture radar or an electrooptic-infrared (EO-IR) surveillance device, another officer said.""A total of five units will be put into service by 2022 starting 2020,"" he said. ""The satellites will allow us to detect North Korea's transporter erector launchers within some two to three hours of their deployment.""The Seoul government also plans to launch a project to develop its long-range, surface-to-air L-SAM missile with its indigenous technology in order to shield against the North's guided missiles, according to the officials.The development of the L-SAM system, which intercepts missiles at an altitude of 40 kilometers or above, aims to shoot down ballistic missiles from the communist North in their terminal phase.""The L-SAM development is expected to greatly increase the capacity of the KAMD by allowing us to secure a multi-layer system,"" an official of the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said, noting that low-flying missiles that are in their terminal phase can be destroyed by the Patriot PAC-3 and mid-range surface-to-air missiles, or M-SAM.The L-SAM system is compatible with the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery, which is an integral part of the U.S.-led missile defense system. Despite a growing push from Washington, the Seoul government has rebuffed a request to join the U.S. air defense system, which mainly aims to counter a rising China in the region.In order to effectively nullify North Korea's asymmetric threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear bombs, the ministry plans to develop laser beam-based, electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and high powered microwave (HMP) weapons, among others, by the early 2020s.In a move to beef up maritime defense particularly near the western sea border with North Korea of the Northern Limit Line, the ministry has been working on developing an unmanned battleship and earmark 20.2 billion won (US$18.7 million) this year. ""The integration of defense tasks with state-of-the-art scientific technology including information communication technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) is necessary to be fully prepared for the future where we should meet diversified security threats with limited financial and personnel resources,""Defense Minister Han Min-koo said.   ""We will strive to secure defense capabilities to counter enemies' asymmetric power and overwhelm them with a mid- to long-term goal,"" he added.

Details and schedules of the plans have yet to be determined through future discussion with the North, officials said.""The government has set this year as a starting point for widening discussion over unification and making progress in inter-Korean relations as it marks the 70th anniversary of independence from Japanese colonial rule, as well as the South-North division,"" a unification ministry official said.South Korea calls on North Korea to respond to an offer for the resumption of inter-Korean talks so the countries can have a chance to discuss these issues in detail, he said, referring to Seoul's overture in late December.Under the policy plan, Seoul will also push for a variety of joint inter-Korean commemorative events to mark the 70th anniversary of what are now the two Koreas' independence in 1945 from Japan's colonial rule.The South also plans to set up Korean cultural centers in Seoul and Pyongyang to induce better cultural exchanges. Besides that, Seoul will seek other joint projects with the North on the three non-political fields of humanitarian assistance, environment and culture as part of the unification preparatory efforts.Other envisioned joint plans include the opening of a logistics route that connects a South Korean port to the railway linking North Korea's Rajin port to the Russian border city of Khasan.   Despite the envisioned fence-mending measures, South Korea will go ahead with its annual joint military exercises with the United States this year, a high-ranking defense ministry official said on background, rejecting the North's recent calls for scrapping them.""(The government) maintains its stance that joint South Korea-U.S. exercises should be carried out continually and consistently ... because they are a core part of strong national defense capacity building,"" the defense official said, adding that ""for that reason, the defense ministry cannot accept North Korea's calls over joint South Korea-U.S. exercises.""Two major joint Seoul-Washington military drills -- Key Resolve and Foal Eagle -- are scheduled to kick off in South Korea in March.Joint Seoul-Washington military drills have been at the center of recent inter-Korean feuds with Pyongyang vehemently demanding the suspension of what it calls a war rehearsal targeting North Korea.Earlier this month, the North proposed that it would temporarily suspend further nuclear tests if the U.S. halts the joint military drills with the South this year. The U.S. squarely dismissed the proposal as an ""implicit threat.""On the diplomatic front, Seoul will pursue closer cooperation with neighbors, especially the U.S. and China, in order to expedite progress in the international efforts to denuclearize the communist country, the policy plan showed.The country will also make utmost efforts to resume the six-party talks, involving two Koreas, the U.S., China, Russia and Japan, to bring out meaningful progress in the denuclearization efforts. South Korea's foreign minister said that Seoul will consider holding direct consultations with Pyongyang over denuclearization in a bid to help revive the momentum for the long-stalled six-party talks.""Progress in the inter-Korean dialogue tends to have a positive effect in giving a boost to the denuclearization efforts including the six-party talks,"" Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told a press conference later Monday.""At the same time, once the process for North Korea's denuclearization revives, it will also positively affect inter-Korean talks. In that sense, Seoul plans to consider consultations with the North over denuclearization.""The 2015 policy plan by the South Korean ministries comes however as inter-Korean relations still remain mired in a long stalemate.In a bid for a breakthrough in inter-Korean tension, Seoul offered to hold high-level inter-Korean dialogue in late December to discuss pending issues, including the humanitarian event to allow the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.The North has not yet come up with an official response three weeks after the proposal was issued, despite North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's alluding to possible inter-Korean dialogue in his New Year's address.The North has repeatedly threatened a nuclear war against the joint Seoul-Washington military exercises and denounced South Korea's policy toward the communist country.Referring to the North's protracted silence over Seoul's talks offer, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae said in a separate news conference late Monday that ""Holding talks is the first step toward resolving distrust and military tension between the South and the North, but the North has not yet come forward to respond and (I am) forced into a situation where skepticism over the North's willingness to talk is inevitable."" Also touching on the trans-peninsula train project, Ryoo said the government hopes for and will work toward launching the project around the Aug. 15 National Liberation Day.

It was mid-December 1950, at the height of the Korean War.Thousands of beleaguered U.S. Army soldiers, marines, their South Korean counterparts and thousands more refugees fleeing the onrush of communist troops gathered at the port, to be evacuated by sea to Busan. Top Allied commanders feared disaster.But Hyun Bong-hak was determined to save the troops and the refugees. The 28-year-old medical doctor was the Civil Affairs deputy and a translator for Maj. Gen. Edward Almond, commanding officer of most of the encircled troops there.Hyun’s efforts, combined with those of sympathetic U.S. officers and the U.S. Navy, resulted in the Heungnam evacuation.From Dec. 19-24, 1950, approximately 105,000 troops and 98,000 civilians were rescued in what is remembered by some survivors as a “Christmas miracle.” The last ship to leave port, the Meredith Victory, took 14,000 refugees to safety.  Hyun Bong-hak. (Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs)The commanders had not initially dreamed of such a dashing escape. They considered merely taking all of their own troops a tall order in the minus-10 degree Celsius temperatures, never mind the refugees.But Hyun and U.S. Marine Corps Col. Edward H. Forney, among others, convinced Gen. Almond otherwise.They told the general that most of them would be executed by the communists if they left them behind.The refugees were mostly Korean Christians who had been repressed under communist rule in the five years following Korea’s liberation from Japanese rule in 1945, at the end of World War II. They had offered assistance to U.N. troops occupying the port and nearby towns in the weeks before the evacuation. Communist officials were likely to punish them for the actions once they returned.To Hyun, the refugees’ plight was also personal. The young physician had grown up in Hamheung, only about 16 kilometers from Heungnam. Most refugees weathering the subzero temperatures at the port were from Hamheung.“The (U.N. forces) had helped more people than I would ever have thought possible,” the war hero said in 1997. Hyun is sometimes likened to Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust.Hyun’s action was featured in the Korean blockbuster “Ode to My Father,” a film depicting the evacuation as its opening scene, and the tumultuous lives of those who reached South Korea, never to see their hometowns again.Hyun can be seen pleading with an unnamed U.N. officer in the scene to “please get the refugees on the ships.”Hyun’s daughters saw the film multiple times during their recent visit to Korea last year and upon their return to the U.S.“It kind of reminds me of what I read Holocaust survivors in the U.S. felt. ... They were unable to express their feelings and were constantly told, ‘The war is over, you’re safe now, let’s not talk about it and move on,’” Esther Hyun, the second daughter of the late war hero said in an email interview with The Korea Herald last week.Helen Hyun-Bowlin, Hyun’s third daughter, said she finally understood her father’s deeds during her recent visits to Korea.“I finally realize how important what he accomplished was,” she said. “I learned most about his accomplishments as a war hero through my last two trips (to Korea).

He said ``it's two ways of taking each other's temperature.''     The U.S. and North Korea have no formal diplomatic ties, but former U.S. officials occasionally meet the North's diplomats in a bid to settle the impasse over Pyongyang's pursuit of a long-range nuclear-armed missile that could hit the U.S. mainland.   North Korea's team was led by Ri Yong Ho, the chief negotiator for six-party denuclearization talks.   North Korea has indicated willingness to rejoin the long-stalled talks, but has balked at U.S. demands it first take concrete steps to show it remains committed to the denuclearization goal.   Earlier this month, North Korea told the United States that it was willing to impose a temporary moratorium on its nuclear tests if Washington scraps planned military drills with South Korea this year. Washington called the linking of the military drills with a possible nuclear test ``an implicit threat,'' but said it was open to dialogue with North Korea.   Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs and has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006. But experts are divided on how far the opaque government has come in the technology needed to miniaturize a warhead.   Asked whether the two sides would also discuss recent hacking attacks linked to the comedy flick ``The Interview,'' Sigal said, ``I don't think we will get into that very much.''   The U.S. blames the North for crippling cyberattacks on Sony Entertainment, which released the movie depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and subsequently imposed new sanctions on the country. Pyongyang has denied responsibility for the cyberattacks and accused the U.S. of engineering recent Internet disruptions in the country.   Others taking part in the Singapore talks, which go on until Monday, include former U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Bosworth, former deputy nuclear negotiator Joseph DeTrani and Tony Namkung, former deputy director at Berkeley's Institute for East Asian Studies.

""If the war rehearsals targeting North Korea continue, they will escalate distrust and animosity between the North and the South and increase the risk of a nuclear war ... and this will not be allowed,"" the newspaper said. The Friday warning against the joint Seoul-Washington military exercises is a continuation of the communist country's repeated calls on South Korea and the U.S. in recent weeks to halt their joint drills.Last week, the North suggested to the U.S. that it will temporarily suspend its nuclear tests if the U.S. halts the joint military exercises with South Korea this year. The U.S. immediately dismissed the proposal, labeling it as an ""implicit threat.""North Korea has long denounced any joint military drills between the allies, accusing them of conducting a war rehearsal targeting the communist nation.The war drills reflect the U.S.' scheme for nuclear war provocations on the peninsula and they will eventually result in the disaster of a nuclear war in the region, the Friday newspaper column also noted.""The chance for lessened tension and improved North-South relations does not come every day ... the fate of North-South relations totally depends on the attitude of the South Korean government,"" it added.  The commentary from the North's mouthpiece newspaper comes as Seoul is waiting for a response from Pyongyang over an official proposal for high-level talks.In late December, Seoul officially proposed that the two Koreas should hold high-level talks to discuss pending issues, including a reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.President Park Geun-hye renewed the proposal in her new year's press conference held earlier this week.The North, however, has yet to come up with a reply to the proposal.Following the North's repeated call for the suspension of the joint drills, a South Korean military source said earlier this week that the military plan to carry out one of its two major joint military exercises in early March as scheduled despite Pyongyang.Also on Friday, South Korea's point man on North Korea again prodded Pyongyang to come to the negotiating table, saying that any issues can be discussed there.""That's not a proper attitude (to avoid answering),"" Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae said in a special lecture to middle school chiefs. ""North Korea should come to the negotiating table without suspecting our government's sincerity,"" the minister said, adding that ""Seoul could discuss every issue.""

That it's an implicit threat linking something that is, by definition, defensive, annual in nature, with something that they would possibly do that is a violation of multiple U.N.

Washington has immediately rejected the proposal, and urged Pyongyang to live up to its denuclearization commitments.On Tuesday, the North's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, An Myong-hun, said the North is ready to meet with the U.S. face-to-face to provide additional explanations about the proposal, such as the intention behind the offer.""We've always said we're open to dialogue with the DPRK.

In a rare frank comment on China's relations with South and North Korea, Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of Contemporary International Relations of Tsinghua University, said Beijing's ties with Pyongyang ""are not as close as"" its ties with Seoul.  China's relationship with its only treaty ally, North Korea, has shown signs of self-contradiction as Beijing's leadership has often expressed frustration in dealings with the North since Pyongyang's third nuclear test in February 2013.South Korean and U.S. officials have pressed China to do more in bringing the necessary pressure to make North Korea realize that it has no choice but to give up its nuclear ambitions and abide by its international obligations. ""China's relations with North Korea are not as close as China's relations with South Korea,"" Yan told reporters at an event organized by the All-China Journalists' Association, an organization of China's ruling Communist Party. ""If North Korea continues to insist on developing nuclear weapons and didn't make any commitments on denuclearization, then China-North Korea relations will be very uncertain,"" Yan told the event on China's diplomatic outlook for 2015.Yan acknowledged that China is trying to develop ""normal, state-to-state"" relations with North Korea. The alliance between North Korea and China has been often described as being ""forged in blood"" as China fought alongside the North in the 1950-53 Korean War. ""With regard to China's relations with North Korea, I think that it is in the process of developing from not very normal stage to normal stage,"" he said. Despite strained political ties between North Korea and China, few analysts believe that China will exert enough pressure on the North to give up its nuclear weapons because it could lead to the collapse of the North's regime and hurt China's national interests.South and North Korea have been separated for 60 years and have yet to sign a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea as a deterrence against North Korea. Outside analysts say China's Communist Party may not welcome an eventual unification of the Korean Peninsula led by South Korea, because it would put a democratic government, backed by American forces, on China's doorstep.Yan said China would welcome a unified Korea only if American troops leave the Korean Peninsula after a unification. Asked about China's stance over a unified Korea, Yan replied, ""Who will be most afraid of a unified Korea? If North Korea and South Korea are unified, there will not be U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. According to this logic, it is non-sense that China is trying to prevent the two Koreas from being unified.""  (Yonhap)","north regime and hurt china ,strained political ties between north ,most afraid of unified korea ,hurt china national interests south ,self contradiction as beijing leadership","['North Korea', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Yan Xuetong', 'the Institute of Contemporary International Relations of Tsinghua University', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'North', 'Pyongyang', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Yan', ""the All - China Journalists ' Association"", 'China', 'Communist Party', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Yan', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Communist Party', 'South Korea', 'american', 'China', 'Yan', 'China', 'Korea', 'american', 'China', 'Korea', 'Yan', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Koreas']",14,"[ 5.         21.          0.         ... -0.94470763  0.10734544

1004,1004,Seoul vows retaliation against N.K. provocation over leaflets,"Seoul’s Defense Ministry warned of “stern retaliation” against any North Korean provocations Wednesday, amid reports that the North had completed drills to “devastate” South Korean border areas from which balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets were floated.“Should North Korea mount provocations on the pretext of our civic groups’ spreading of anti-North Korea leaflets, we will sternly retaliate against not ...","Seoul’s Defense Ministry warned of “stern retaliation” against any North Korean provocations Wednesday, amid reports that the North had completed drills to “devastate” South Korean border areas from which balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets were floated.“Should North Korea mount provocations on the pretext of our civic groups’ spreading of anti-North Korea leaflets, we will sternly retaliate against not only the origin of the provocation, but also forces supporting it and its commanders, as we have already warned repeatedly” said the ministry in a press release.The ministry refused to confirm whether the North had conducted the drills, saying, “We have no knowledge about it.” Earlier in the day, the local daily Dong-A Ilbo reported that under the directive of Kim Jong-un, the first secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, the North Korean troops had finished drills to devastate the regions from which the leaflets were flown.Citing a representative of a group of relatives of people abducted by Pyongyang, the daily said that a senior North Korean military official claimed that the “highest authority of the North’s powerful National Defense Commission” gave the directive to conduct the drills.Inter-Korean tension has remained high over the leaflets that South Korean civic groups, many of whom are North Korean defectors, have floated from border regions with an aim to awaken North Koreans to the brutality of the dictatorial regime.The issue of the leaflets has emerged as a key hurdle to improving the cross-border relations, as the two Koreas have moved an inch toward dialogue that has been shelved due to the North’s insistence on nuclear armament and its provocative behavior.The issue is a highly sensitive one for Pyongyang, as the leaflets condemn its highest authority, namely its leader, and allows its people to gradually realize how they have been mistreated by the regime. Last October, the North fired shots at balloons carrying anti-North Korea leaflets.Last Wednesday, the Rodong Sinmun, a daily newspaper run by the North’s ruling party, called on the Seoul government to block the civic groups from sending the leaflets, warning that the leaflets would dampen the mood for inter-Korean dialogue.“Had Seoul done what it should do to prevent the leaflets from being sent from the border areas, the leaflets would not have been scattered. Condoning the criminal acts is tantamount to collusion (with criminals),” said a commentary in the daily.Amid the angry response from the North, South Korean activists said they would send another set of balloons carrying even DVDs of “The Interview,” an American comedy about a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader.South Koreans have been divided over the leaflets. Some argued that the leaflets would further worsen cross-border relations and jeopardize the lives of people living near the tense border. Others say the leaflets should be sent to induce a gradual change in the reclusive state, and that their freedom of expression should not be restricted.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korean provocations wednesday amid reports ,carrying anti north korea leaflets ,drills to devastate south korean ,north korean provocations wednesday amid ,any north korean provocations wednesday","['Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'anti - north Korea', 'Dong - A', 'Ilbo', 'Kim Jong - un', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'National Defense Commission', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'anti - north Korea', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'american', 'north korean', 'South Koreans', 'Song Sang - ho']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47006446  0.56471539

He urged the Obama administration to reverse its rejection of the proposal and said his government “is ready to explain its intentions behind its proposal directly to the United States.”  An Myong-hunAn said North Korea sent the proposal to the U.S. on Friday through the “appropriate channel” used for communications between the two countries “in order to remove the danger of war and ease the tension and create (a) peaceful atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula.” North Korea and the United States do not have diplomatic relations.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki objected Saturday to linking a possible North Korean nuclear test ― which is banned by the U.N. Security Council ― to military exercises. She said this constituted “an implicit threat” and called on the North to immediately cease all threats and reduce tensions. The U.S. has previously refused to cancel military drills with South Korea.Psaki said the U.S. remains open to dialogue with North Korea, but only “with the aim of returning to credible and authentic negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” An made no mention of new nuclear talks.The North’s proposal comes at a time of animosity between North Korea and the U.S. over a comedy movie depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The U.S. blames the North for crippling hacking attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which An vehemently denied, demanding that the United States produce evidence.North Korea also is facing international condemnation over its human rights record, and the U.N. Security Council could refer the country to the International Criminal Court over its rights abuses. An said Washington’s refusal to accept the proposal for suspensions demonstrates again that the United States will continue to increase the capabilities of the South Korean military while trying to prevent North Korea from having its own national defense. The U.S. should now stop pushing its “hostile policy ... and should be bold enough to choose a different approach, to change its course ― that is, change its policy hostile to the DPRK,” An said, using the initials of his country’s name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.“If this proposal is put in practice this year, many things will be possible this year on the Korean Peninsula that has very meaningful implications, and that’s why we have put forward this proposal directly to the United States government,” An said.He refused to answer several questions on what could happen if the U.S. accepted ― or what might happen if it again said “no” to the proposal.

The U.S. government is not involved in the proposed event,” the official said.Other North Korean officials set to attend the Singapore meetings will include deputy nuclear envoy Choe Son-hui and Jang Il-hun, the North’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, according to the sources. Their American counterparts will also include former deputy nuclear negotiator Joseph DeTrani; Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council; and Tony Namkung, former deputy director of Berkeley’s Institute for East Asian Studies, they said.The envisioned meetings come after North Korea offered to temporarily suspend nuclear tests in exchange for a halt to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises. Washington rejected the proposal as an “implicit threat.”Relations between the U.S. and the North have worsened further recently following a cyberattack on Sony Pictures. The U.S. has blamed the North for carrying out the attacks and imposed fresh sanctions, but Pyongyang has categorically denied any involvement.Though the U.S. government will not be involved, the upcoming meetings could be a chance for the two sides to better understand each other’s position on how to resume the six-party talks that have been on hold since the last session in late 2008.

The war game used to take place in late February.The remark came after the local daily Hankook Ilbo reported Tuesday, citing a government official, that Seoul and Washington have agreed to delay the Key Resolve exercise by about a week, a move believed to factor in recent developments in inter-Korean ties.In a nationally televised news conference on Monday, South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed her hope for the two Koreas to hold a new round of reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War, around Lunar New Year's Day, which falls on Feb. 19.Seoul's defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok, however, denied the report, saying that the exercise schedule was fixed a long time ago.

As ties with Japan remain at their lowest ebb in decades, she called for Tokyo to tackle the issue of its sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II as a vital step toward a thaw and summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “I think the U.S. has made an appropriate response over the hack. North Korea should refrain from provocations and show credible behavior to the international community,” the president said at a news conference at Cheong Wa Dae. “But the current tension between them would not affect inter-Korean dialogue. We, for our part, are looking to resolve various issues with our own principles if North Korea agrees to a dialogue.”Her remarks reflect Seoul’s efforts to dilute concerns that the latest bout of sanctions may tip over the budding mood for a cross-border rapprochement since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un expressed his openness toward a summit with the South in his New Year speech.But the conference lacked any fresh proposal or message toward either Pyongyang or Tokyo, while failing to clearly address key sticking points such as suspended tours to a mountain resort across the border, anti-North Korea leaflets and sex slavery talks. With regard to a summit with the young ruler, Park ruled out setting any preconditions for talks but called for a “sincere attitude” in particular toward denuclearization. She also once again urged Pyongyang to accept Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae’s earlier offer of high-level consultations to discuss any topic, including even Seoul’s bans on economic and people-to-people exchanges with the communist neighbor. “I am willing to meet with anyone if it helps ease the pain of the national division and chart a path to a peaceful unification, including at the summit level,” she said. “But for the talks to work, there must be an open mind and sincere attitude. Denuclearization is not a prerequisite, but when there is no progress whatsoever we cannot talk about a peaceful unification.” As for relations with Japan, Park remained lukewarm about a one-on-one meeting with Abe, urging the former occupier to change course and come clean about its wartime atrocities. The Park administration has been seeking to reset the bilateral relationship marking the 50th anniversary of its normalization this year. But with a resolution of the sex slavery issue being a prerequisite for a reconciliation, it appears to be struggling with limited options while facing soaring criticism over a lack of major foreign policy achievements.The two countries launched director-general-level talks last April to resolve the issue but made little headway due to stark differences in their positions. Seoul has been demanding an official, sincere apology and compensation for the victims, while Tokyo claims the issue was settled in a 1965 agreement that normalized bilateral relations.“I really hope that this year will provide a chance for the two countries to make a fresh start toward a new future based on a correct understanding of history,” Park added. “There is no reason not to hold a summit. … But the summit ought to be one that takes place in a favorable environment, is successful and meaningful, and will bring us forward even if it’s just one single step, for which a shift in Japan’s attitude is essential.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","enslavement of korean women during ,new bilateral sanctions in retaliation ,border anti north korea leaflets ,korea leaflets and sex slavery ,sexual enslavement of korean women","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'Sony Pictures', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Shinzo Abe', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Tokyo', 'anti -', 'north Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae ’s', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34915122  0.49144417

The North’s state media reported Saturday the country has delivered the proposal through an unspecified relevant channel, saying it is “ready to sit with the U.S. anytime if the U.S. needs dialogue regarding this issue.”“The message proposed the U.S. to contribute to easing tension on the Korean Peninsula by temporarily suspending joint military exercises in South Korea and its vicinity this year, and said that in this case the DPRK (North Korea) is ready to take responsive steps such as temporarily suspending the nuclear test over which the U.S. is concerned,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. “The large-scale war games ceaselessly held every year in South Korea are the root cause of the escalating tension on the peninsula and the danger of nuclear war facing our nation.”While leaving open the possibility of dialogue, Washington criticized Pyongyang for making an “implicit threat” by “inappropriately linking” routine, defense-oriented exercises dating back about 40 years to a potential new underground blast that would constitute a breach of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visits a newly built mushroom farm in Pyongyang in this photo released by the Korean Central News Agency on Saturday. (Yonhap)North Korea has detonated atomic devices three times since 2006, the latest and most powerful one in February 2013. It has threatened to conduct a “new form” of experiment after the council condemned its test-firing of a ballistic missile last March. “We call on the DPRK to immediately cease all threats, reduce tensions, and take the necessary steps toward denuclearization needed to resume credible negotiations,” State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters later that day in Munich while accompanying Secretary John Kerry on his trip to India. “The United States remains open to dialogue with the DPRK, with the aim of returning to credible and authentic negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”With some 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, the allies’ joint military drills have since their 1976 launch been a source of paranoia for the communist state, which calls it a rehearsal for an invasion. Some of their major annual programs ― Key Resolve and Foal Eagle ― are expected to kick off late next month.The Minju Choson, another propaganda organ associated with the North Korean cabinet, on Sunday reiterated calls for Seoul to forsake the military exercises.“War games and dialogue cannot be compatible,” it said in a dispatch carried by the KCNA. “If the South is keen to truly improve inter-Korean relations through dialogue and negotiations and open a grand path to an independent unification, it has to stop all war schemes including reckless military drills with external forces.” The Kim Jong-un regime has been intensifying its peace offensive toward Seoul since he raised the possibility for “highest-level” bilateral talks in his New Year speech. In contrast, Pyongyang is snared in a spat with Washington due to its suspected hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. over a satirical film centering on an assassination plot against the young leader. A bill has since been introduced in U.S. House of Representative calling for the unruly country to be relisted as a state sponsor of terrorism. The Choson Sinbo, a pro-North newspaper based in Japan, once again refuted its involvement in the cyberattack on Sunday, pointing to a recent delivery of condolences by its Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong to his French counterpart over the Charlie Hebdo tragedy. “Our constant position is that we oppose all kinds of terrors and any support for them,” the paper said.Entering its critical third year, the Park Geun-hye government is seeking to secure a foreign policy legacy through a cross-border reconciliation ahead of the 70th anniversary of the territorial division this year. Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae recently proposed high-level inter-Korean dialogue. But a thaw appears far-off yet given a series of political hurdles. On top of the North Korea-U.S. tension, anti-North Korea leaflets has emerged as a key sticking point in particular since a court ruling last week made way for authorities to block their releases. Despite growing demands for action, Seoul remains hesitant about imposing any ban, citing freedom of expression. A watershed moment may come at Park’s news conference on Monday, experts say, where she is predicted to relay offers of humanitarian assistance or economic and people-to-people exchanges and other related messages toward Pyongyang. “The conference is forecast to be an extremely important opportunity that will likely determine inter-Korean relations this year,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute. “With the regime constantly suffering anxiety over a reunification by absorption by the South given economic inferiority and international isolation, it will be important for her to make it clear that her unification policy is not aimed at absorbing the North but bringing about a peaceful integration through expanding dialogue, exchanges and cooperation.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","moratorium on nuclear tests ,planned military drills with seoul ,suspending the nuclear test over ,of moratorium on nuclear tests ,north korea offer of moratorium","['U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'South Korea', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'U.N.

Washington squarely dismissed the proposal, saying it is an 'implicit threat' that inappropriately links routine U.S.-ROK drills to the possibility of a nuclear test. The two allies conduct rounds of joint military exercises every year around the peninsula, starting with Key Resolve in late February. The key war game involves tens of thousands of troops from both sides.The North made a similar call on the South last week to halt the joint drills.

Bush said.It was one of the recommendations that the George W. Bush Institute suggested to break down North Korea's information barriers, as it issued the ""Light through the Darkness"" report, calling for improvement in the North's human rights situation. The report called for the NGO community as well as governments to work with Silicon Valley to find and implement innovative ways to pierce the North Korean regime's information monopoly, such as ""advancing the balloon drop injections of information into North Korea, perhaps through use of drones.""North Korean defectors and other anti-Pyongyang activists in South Korea have used large balloons to send propaganda leaflets across the border in an effort to provide North Korean people with outside information and let them know how bad their leaders are.Pyongyang, which fears outside information would weaken the personality cult surrounding its leader, has reacted angrily to the leaflet campaign, even opening fire near the heavily armed border last year in an attempt to shoot down balloons.The Bush institute put forward other suggestions under four main goals: raising global awareness of the North's human rights situation; supporting and empowering refugees; making the issue a priority for governments; and breaking the North's information barriers.The report called on the U.S. government to integrate human rights into mainstream diplomacy in the six-party nuclear talks or the bilateral agenda with the North and to put pressure on Pyongyang by imposing sanctions specific to human rights abuses and considering putting the regime back to the list of state sponsors of terrorism.""Satellite images of the Korean Peninsula show a startling contrast between the North and the South.

China’s foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei made the comments in a statement, which also reconfirmed that Beijing sent a message of congratulations to North Korea on the birthday of its young leader Kim Jong-un. “In the new year, the Chinese side will push forward its traditional friendship and cooperation with the DPRK (North Korea) in keeping with the principles of carrying on the tradition, looking to the future, developing good-neighborly and friendly relations, and enhancing cooperation,” Hong said in the statement.During a regular press briefing Thursday, Hong told reporters that China had sent the congratulatory message to North Korea but did not comment on bilateral relations.His comments are widely seen as stressing the principle of North Korea-China relations, which was approved by North Korea’s late leader Kim Jong-il and then Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 2001. Over the past year, Chinese officials have not made comments to that effect.Political ties between China and its only treaty ally, North Korea, remain strained, particularly after the North’s third nuclear test in February 2013. In what many analysts believe was a message to North Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to South Korea last year, breaking a long-standing tradition by Chinese heads of state of visiting Pyongyang before Seoul.The congratulatory message by China on Kim’s birthday also came as North Korea is trying to deepen its ties with Russia. With international pressure mounting on North Korea for its nuclear program and dismal human rights record, the North’s young leader sent his special envoy to Moscow late last year and the envoy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has also said that it invited Kim to Moscow in May this year to attend a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.Kim, who inherited power after the death of his father in late 2011, has yet to visit China.

Experts have said that its ballistic missile, tested in December 2012, appeared to have a range of 10,000 kilometers ― far enough to strike the U.S. mainland.South Korean experts argue that given the size and technological capacity of North Korean submarines, Pyongyang has yet to reach a level to mount ballistic missiles on its submarines. But they said the South should be ready for any threats given the unpredictable, opaque nature of the regime.Fears about the SLBM stem from the North’s potential “second-strike capability” to launch an overwhelming nuclear retaliation if it suffers a first strike from enemy forces.The second-strike capability forms the basis of a condition referred to as “mutual assured destruction” that maintained the “balance of terror” during the Cold War era. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles are at the core of the capability as submarines can launch targeted stealthy attacks on enemy forces.Stephen Walt, an international relations theorist at Harvard University, expressed doubts whether the North’s SLBM would give the country second-strike capability.“I am not that concerned about this possibility, because a submarine-launched missile provides a second capability only if the submarine itself cannot be detected, tracked and attacked,” he told The Korea Herald. “That is unlikely to be true of any small submarine force that North Korea might develop.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","build new types of submarines ,of new north korean submarine ,submarine launched ballistic missiles will ,new north korean submarine ,on developing submarine based missiles","['North Korea', 'north korean', 'North', 'the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Musudan', 'Rodong', 'kn-02', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'North ’s', 'SLBM', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'SLBM', 'North ’s', 'Stephen Walt', 'Harvard University', 'the North ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'North Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26792222  0.09937665

Over the past year, Chinese officials have not made comments to that effect.Asked whether China would send high-level officials to North Korea this year, Hong replied, ""As for the high-level exchanges, I have no relevant information to offer at the current stage.""Political ties between North Korea and China remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test.In what many analysts believe was a message to North Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to South Korea last year, breaking a long-standing tradition by Chinese heads of state of visiting Pyongyang before Seoul.The congratulatory message by China on Kim's birthday also came as North Korea is trying to deepen its ties with Russia.With international pressure mounting on North Korea for its nuclear program and dismal human rights record, the North's young leader sent his special envoy to Moscow late last year and the envoy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Russia has also said that it invited Kim to Moscow in May this year to attend a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.Kim, who inherited power after the death of his father in late 2011, has yet to visit China.

It is the first time that Seoul’s whitepaper has mentioned North Korea’s capability to mount nuclear warheads atop ballistic missiles ― an indication that Seoul officially recognizes the North has made strides in developing its nuclear weapons capability through three nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.“If you look at the period of time taken for a nuclear-power state to secure miniaturization capability, it has been about six to seven years,” a senior Defense Ministry official told reporters, declining to be named. “Eight years have passed by since the North first carried out its nuclear test in 2006, and South Korea and the U.S. alike judge that the North’s miniaturization capability has reached a considerable level.”The official, however, stressed, “We don’t use any expression indicating that the North currently possesses nuclear weapons in the 2014 whitepaper, meaning that we still do not recognize the North as a nuclear-power state politically and technologically.”As to the amount of the North’s fissile material, the ministry maintained its previous judgment that the North had some 40 kg of plutonium. To produce one nuclear bomb, around 6 kg of plutonium is required.The whitepaper also described the North’s ballistic missile capability in greater detail, pointing out, “It is presumed that the North has secured a missile capability to threaten the U.S. mainland through a total of five long-range rocket tests.”The mention appears to acknowledge that the North’s rocket test in December 2012 was successful. Experts have said that the rocket tested appeared to have a range of some 10,000 km ― far enough to strike the U.S. mainland. In referring to the North Korean military, the whitepaper retained the term “enemy.” Amid heightened inter-Korean tension in 1995, the paper called the North the main enemy, while in times of relatively stable relations, the tough term was replaced by milder expressions such as “direct military threats.”According to the paper, the number of North Korean troops increased slightly to 1.2 million from 1.19 million recorded in the 2012 paper, due to an increase of 10,000 Air Force personnel. It has around 1.02 million Army, 120,000 Air Force and 60,000 Navy personnel.The number of South Korean troops decreased slightly, from 639,000 to 630,000.The whitepaper also offered a detailed description of the Northern Limit Line as an “effective inter-Korean maritime demarcation line.” “The Republic of Korea and the U.S. urge the North to recognize the effective value of the NLL as we note that it has been an effective means to prevent military tensions for the last 60 years,” the paper said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","three nuclear tests in 2006 ,nuclear weapons in the 2014 ,nuclear tests in 2006 2009 ,three nuclear tests in ,nuclear warheads has reached considerable","['North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'South Koreans', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Chagang', 'China', 'China', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'South Korea ’s', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Defense Ministry', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Air Force', 'Air Force', 'Navy', 'south korean', 'the Northern Limit Line', 'inter - korean', 'the Republic of Korea', 'U.S.', 'NLL', 'Song Sang - ho']",18,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.60799944  0.6717031

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un expressed wishes in his New Year address to hold high-level talks with the South. Top Seoul officials have welcomed Kim’s gesture.The resolution is expected to offer much-needed domestic political support to South Korean President Park Geun-hye’s efforts to thaw relations with the North as she enters her third year in office. South Korean presidents serve a nonrenewable five-year term and often become lame ducks sometime after their third year.The resolution also urged South Korean officials to “take necessary measures” against South Korean human rights activists sending balloon leaflets to the North, if the actions “harm inter-Korean relations” or cause “safety concerns.”The leaflets have sparked a public debate as the actions provoked the North to threaten artillery attacks on the South as a reprisal. The leaflets are usually filled with anti-North Korea newsletters and cash, to raise awareness about the differences between North and South Korea.“It provides the government a basis from which to block the activists,” said Rep. Kim Sung-gon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University Koh Yu-hwan agreed.“The resolution will prevent a few activists from having the power to sway inter-Korean relations by sending off their leaflets,” he said.Seoul’s main political parties had formerly disagreed on a clause in the “Resolution demanding the enforcement of past inter-Korean mutual-disparagement agreements.” “The National Assembly of South Korea urges officials from both sides of the border to enforce past mutual disparagement agreements,” the thorny clause reads.South Korean government officials and lawmakers from President Park’s governing Saenuri Party had expressed concern over the clause as it seemed to imply that the South Korean government had engaged in an aggressive anti-Pyongyang verbal attack policy.NPAD Rep. Shim Jae-kwon, a chief writer of the resolution, reassured the ruling party, saying the clause was meant to “enhance the spirit of past mutual agreements” between the North and South.But the resolution may have limited meaning, according to one expert.“It is difficult to define defamation and slandering in the South,” Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies of Seoul National University.The South can’t control nongovernment bodies from criticizing the North, Chang said, and could trigger mixed reactions from Pyongyang.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","resolution next week urging seoul ,south korea national assembly thursday ,legislature said tuesday the resolution ,support to south korean president ,thursday and receive final endorsement","['south korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea ’s', 'National Assembly', 'North and South Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'anti - north Korea', 'North and South Korea', 'Kim Sung - gon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'north korean', 'Dongguk University', 'Koh Yu - hwan', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'the National Assembly of South Korea', 'south korean', 'Saenuri Party', 'south korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Shim Jae - kwon', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'Chang', 'Pyongyang', 'Jeong Hunny']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39393029  0.44374818

Yet Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti stressed the need for “strong and credible” defense readiness in order for their talks to be effective, calling for U.S. and South Korean servicemen to maintain an airtight posture. “Discussion between North and South Korea is always a good thing and I hope that the talks can take place,” he said during a meeting at the Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, some 60 kilometers south of Seoul.“My priority is always, first of all to strengthen this alliance. We’ve got to maintain the readiness to fight tonight. ... Transforming the alliance is also important because as threats evolve, we have to change as well and improve as an alliance to deter the threats.”The session was held as part of a visit by Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se to cheer on the airmen and Seoul’s commitment to its alliance with Washington.The commander’s remarks came days after the U.S. imposed new sanctions in retaliation for North Korea’s purported hack on Sony Pictures over a film about a plot to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-un. The surprise announcement was feared to upend the mood for a cross-border reconciliation following Kim’s New Year speech, in which he expressed his willingness for a summit with South Korea. Also known as the K-55, the installation is home to the Pacific Air Forces’ 51st Fighter Wing and South Korea’s Air Force Operations Command. It is one of the two U.S. airfields here, along with the Kunsan base.During the one-day trip, the minister met with both countries’ commanders and servicemen, toured major facilities such as the Korea Air & Space Operations Center, and delivered funds to the 7th Air Force as scholarships for troops. He was also accompanied by senior officials including Lee Kyung-soo, the deputy foreign minister; and Moon Seoung-hyun, director-general for North American affairs at the ministry. Among the U.S. participants were U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert and Lt. Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, the new commander of the 7th Air Force.“Here I was briefed and learned that our military alliance is able to deter, defend and defeat any external provocations or threats,” Yun said, calling them “invincible.” “I believe it can also contribute to ending the armistice, the longest in world history, and bringing peace and reunification to the peninsula as we mark the 70th anniversary of the national division this year.” Lippert echoed Yun’s assessment, saying the military cooperation was “extremely strong” and the “bedrock” of the bilateral relationship, while praising its transformation into a “global, diversified partnership” through which the allies also work together on regional and international issues such as the Ebola outbreak, the surge of Islamic State fighters and climate change. The country’s foreign minister visits a military unit every year to encourage soldiers. In December 2013, Yun went to the Army’s 9th Infantry Division in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, while in 2012 his predecessor toured Camp Casey, the base of the U.S. Army’s 2nd Infantry Division, in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed here to help defend against North Korea. The peninsula remains technically at war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Kim also said North Korea could resume high-level talks and other forms of governmental dialogue with South Korea.Still, North Korea has yet to reply to South Korea's recent offer to hold talks this month.Park called on North Korea to demonstrate its commitment to improving ties with South Korea by actions.""North Korea should quickly come forward for inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation and substantially handle with us specific projects for the establishment of peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula,"" Park said in a Cabinet meeting.Still, questions linger whether the two Koreas could hold any sincere talks as Kim threatened in last week's message that North Korea will ""sternly react"" to any provocation and military drills in apparent reference to anti-Pyongyang leaflets and South Korea's annual joint military drills with the U.S.The two Koreas had agreed to hold high-level contact between late October and early November during a surprise visit to South Korea by a high-powered North Korean delegation. But the North later backtracked on the deal in protest of the leaflets that North Korean defectors in South Korea regularly send to their homeland to try to encourage North Koreans to rise up against Kim.The North has repeatedly urged South Korea to scrap its annual military exercises with the U.S., viewing them as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.South Korea has said it has no plan to make a change with regard to the schedule of its joint defense drills with the U.S.Seoul and Washington have repeatedly said such exercises are purely defensive in nature.Also Tuesday, Park reiterated her call to pass a bill meant to overhaul the pension system for civil servants before her single five-year term ends in early 2018. By law, Park cannot seek re-election.Park called on officials to cooperate with the parliament and hold dialogue with civil servants to ensure a reasonable bill wins parliamentary endorsement.The case for pension reform has gained urgency as the increasing average life expectancy for Koreans could further deepen the pension deficit, though the move has sparked outrage from civil servants who claim the proposed reform could endanger their livelihoods.

Korea has 'significant' technology for miniaturized nukes: Seoul,"North Korea appears to have achieved ""a significant level"" of technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads to fit on its ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the United States mainland, South Korea's defense ministry said Tuesday.The assessment was included in the 2014 edition of the ministry's biennial white paper released on the day, which highlights North Korea's evolving nuclear and missiles threats to t...","North Korea appears to have achieved ""a significant level"" of technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads to fit on its ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the United States mainland, South Korea's defense ministry said Tuesday.The assessment was included in the 2014 edition of the ministry's biennial white paper released on the day, which highlights North Korea's evolving nuclear and missiles threats to the region and beyond after its third and most recent nuclear test in 2013.It was the first time that the paper carried a technological analysis of the North's nuclear program, with the previous edition simply outlining the country's two underground detonation tests conducted in 2006 and 2009.""North Korea's capabilities of miniaturizing nuclear weapons appear to have reached a significant level,"" the paper said. ""North Korea is presumed to have secured some 40 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel roads multiple times, and it is evaluated to have been working on the highly enriched uranium program."" Pyongyang has yet to demonstrate the miniaturization capability, though officials and experts from South Korea and the U.S. have said the communist country is believed to have the technology to build nuclear-tipped missiles.""We don't have any intelligence that North Korea completed the miniaturization. In consideration of the fact that acquiring such technology takes around two to seven years in general and eight years have passed since the North conducted its first nuclear test, however, its capability for small nuclear warheads would have reached a significant level,"" a ministry official said, requesting anonymity.In the paper, South Korea also assessed that North Korea is ""presumed to have (missiles) capabilities that could threaten the U.S. mainland, having fired off long-range missiles five times.""The evaluation was based upon the North's successful sending of a satellite into orbit on an Unha-3 long-range rocket in December 2012, according to the official, noting that its Taepodong-2 long-range rocket is believed to have a range of 10,000 kilometers.Despite Pyongyang's push to develop long-range missiles, no signs have been detected that Pyongyang has put them into service, he added.  In an apparent move to strengthen defenses along the border and to better protect its military facilities, North Korea has set up a new corps-scale military unit in its North Hamkyong Province upon the instruction of its leader Kim Jong-un, according to the defense paper. The establishment has raised the total number of the North's regular corps to 10.As of October 2014, North Korea had 1.2 million regular service personnel, some 10,000 more than two years ago, while South Korea has around 630,000 service members, the paper said.  The communist country has also continued its military build-up by securing more armored vehicles, rocket launchers and battleships, and it is presumed to be building new types of submarines such as one capable of firing ballistic missiles.In the face of such growing threats from the bellicose regime, South Korea defined the North Korean regime and its military as South Korea's ""enemy"" in the paper as the communist country has posed ""serious threats to our national security.""South Korea had dropped the definition in 2004 after 10 years of use, but revived the expression in its 2012 white paper after the North carried out a series of military provocations in 2010 including torpedoing the South Korean naval corvette Cheonan, killing 46 sailors, and shelling the western sea border island of Yeonpyeong, killing four.The two Koreas are still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Meanwhile, South Korea vowed ""stern responses"" to Japan's claims to its own territory, reaffirming its commitment to the country's easternmost islets of Dokdo in the East Sea to protect its sovereignty.""The regressive historical conception by some Japanese political leaders and its unjustified territorial claims to Dokdo have served as a stumbling block for the future-oriented development of bilateral relations,"" the paper said.""The defense ministry will continue to sternly deal with Japan's unjustified claims to Dokdo, while cooperating further on major security issues such as North Korea's nuclear threats for peace and stability in Northeast Asia,"" it noted.South Korea sees Japan's territorial claim to Dokdo as tantamount to the denial of its independence. Seoul reclaimed sovereignty over all of its territory -- including Dokdo and many other islands around the Korean Peninsula -- upon its independence from Japan in 1945.The full version of the comprehensive white paper is available at the defense ministry's website (www.mnd.go.kr), with the English version due out around May, according to its officials.

Obama has since vowed to ""respond proportionally"" to the attacks.North Korea has denied any responsibility, though it lauded the Sony hack as a ""righteous deed.""""The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others,"" Obama said in a letter to House of Representatives and Senate leaders.The two other newly sanctioned North Korean entities are Korea Mining Development and Trading Corp. (KOMID) and Korea Tangun Trading Corp. Eight of the 10 sanctioned individuals were KOMID officials stationed in Iran, Syria, Russia and Namibia.KOMID is the North's primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons, according to the Treasury Department. The company was previously sanctioned by the U.S. and the United Nations, it said.Korea Tangun Trading Corp. is responsible for the procurement of commodities and technologies to support the North's defense research and development program. The company was also a target of U.S. and U.N. sanctions, the department said.The sanctioned individuals include KOMID officials Kil Jong-hun, Kim Kwang-yon, Jang Song-chol, Kim Yong-chol, Jang Yong-son, Kim Kyu, Ryu Jin and Kang Ryong, as well as Yu Kwang-ho, a North Korean government official, and Kim Kwang-chun, a Tangun Trading Corp. official.""Today's actions are driven by our commitment to hold North Korea accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct,"" Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew said in a statement. ""Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend U.S. businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States.""The new sanctions also underline the confidence the U.S. has in blaming the North for the Sony hack despite growing doubts about the FBI's finding among American cyber-security specialists.Last week, a cyber-security firm, Norse, was reported to have briefed the FBI on the result of its own investigation that it was not North Korea, but laid-off Sony staff members that disrupted Sony's computer network.On Friday, Scott Borg, director and chief economist of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, an independent, nonprofit research institute specializing on cyber-threats and risks, also said in a commentary on the CNBC website that the skills employed in the Sony hack were too sophisticated for the North.

(Yonhap)“There cannot be sincere dialogue and improvement in inter-Korean relations in a warlike atmosphere where rehearsals of war take place that deny the other side,” the radio station said. The intensified conciliatory signals reflect the communist country’s efforts to defuse mounting international pressure over its nuclear programs and more recently grave human rights situations and purported hacking of Sony Pictures over “The Interview,” a film about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un. President Park Geun-hye, for her part, vowed to make “substantive preparations” to help bring forward a unification ahead of the 70th anniversary of the peninsula’s liberation and division at a meeting with some 190 political leaders and top officials at Cheong Wa Dae. Earlier in the day, she was expected to swap related views during a phone conversation with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Ban expressed hopes for a recovery of the mood for inter-Korean dialogue and reconciliation in his own New Year address. Observers are raising cautious optimism as the conservative president pledged to step up efforts to help lay the foundation for unification this year. With her presidency entering its third year, the prospects appear to be more upbeat than last year, when Kim launched a similar peace offensive following his New Year speech but was met with aloofness from Seoul in the wake of the execution of Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s uncle and former vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission.Seoul welcomed the latest overture, which came just days after Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae proposed a high-level meeting this month to discuss a reunion of families displaced by the 1950-53 Korean War and other issues of “mutual concern.” “The focal point is how to resolve the separated families issues,” a ranking Seoul official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “It is important to meet and talk regardless of the formation of dialogue. … We’re willing to put anything on the agenda including political and military concerns.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","president pledged to step up ,kim launched similar peace offensive ,seoul welcomed the latest overture ,peace offensive following his new ,hold summit with south korea","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yong - il', 'the North ’s Committee for Peaceful Reunification of Korea', 'Ri Hyok - gwang', 'the Central Committee for Fatherland Reunification and Democracy Front', 'Koreas', '”Pyongyang Broadcasting Station', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'communist', 'Sony Pictures', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Ban', 'inter - korean', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Jang Song - thaek', 'Kim', 'National Defense Commission', 'Seoul', 'Unification', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae', 'Seoul', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",2,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.57031804  0.68367738

Kim Jong-il died of heart failure in 2011.Park has made repeated pitches for unification, calling it a ""bonanza"" for South Korea as well as a blessing for neighboring countries.However, North Korea has long suspected that Seoul could be plotting to absorb Pyongyang, a claim denied by South Korea.
