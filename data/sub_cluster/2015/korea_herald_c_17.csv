The sufferers are known to have been commonly exposed to the dust during their work.The students began to show symptoms after working at three laboratories at the College of Animal Bioscience and Technology building. The Health Ministry said it is thought that the patients developed pneumonia after inhaling the bacteria, which may have been contained in the dust and feedstuff for animals at the school. The bacteria was found in the patients’ clinical material and data. The investigation team also found that the building’s ventilation system was not working properly when the outbreak took place in October. Authorities said it is possible that dust containing the bacteria spread across the building because of the ventilation failure. It is the first time that a collective pneumonia outbreak linked with the particular bacteria has been reported in South Korea. To confirm that the bacteria was indeed the cause of the outbreak, the Health Ministry sent a sample of the microorganism from the labs to the U.S. for further epidemiological investigation.  All of the patients had fully recovered and been released from hospitals as of Nov. 6. The 55 students made up 21.7 percent of all 254 students who were placed to research in the particular building. The property was forced to shut down in October and is still being investigated for other safety violations.  By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","patients developed pneumonia after inhaling ,the patients developed pneumonia after ,pneumonia after inhaling the bacteria ,the patients developed pneumonia ,on tuesday identified the bacteria","['Konkuk University', 'Seoul', 'the Health Ministry', 'Saccharopolyspora', 'the College of Animal Bioscience', 'the Health Ministry', 'South Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'U.S.', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 1.          1.          3.         ... -0.69605172  0.53350258

The Health Ministry said on Friday a medical doctor of Dana Hyeondae Clinic in Seoul’s Yangcheon-gu claimed he suffered from brain injuries since 2012 while admitting to having resused disposable needles during blood donations that resulted in the massive hepatitis C infection. The Health Ministry is testing 2,268 more patients who have been treated at the clinic. The clinic has been shut down, and the doctor has been reported to the police by the health authorities. Dana Hyeondae Clinic, where 67 patients have been confirmed to have have been infected with hepatitis C after receiving intravenous injections. YonhapFor all of the 71 confirmed cases, the ministry has concluded after its investigation that the patients contracted the virus from repeated use of the disposable syringes used for transfusions. All of the 71 patients received intravenous injections, mostly vitamin C or vitamin B1 transfusions for physical fatigue. The 52-year-old doctor, whose name was withheld, told authorities that he reused syringes partly because of his essential tremor, a condition which involves a tremor of hands and fingers, saying it made it difficult for him to unwrap new ones. The doctor claimed that he suffered a brain injury from a car accident that resulted in minor speech disorder, impaired mobility and essential tremor. His wife is currently being investigated by the police on charges of illegally treating patients without a medical license on behalf of her husband. “The doctor is claiming that he had never reused old syringes prior to his injury in 2012, but we’ve heard from another source that this may not be true,” the Health Ministry said in a statement. “We’ve heard that the doctor used disposable syringes on a number of patients even before 2012.”According to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data, 98 percent of the patients who visited Dana Hyeondae Clinic received intravenous injections. The rate is dramatically higher than the average proportion of patients who receive the treatment nationwide at all clinics, which is 19.29 percent.Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting mostly the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis. The virus is known to spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact via intravenous drug injections or poorly sterilized medical equipment.Health authorities said all patients who received intravenous injections will be also tested for other bloodborne infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis B, malaria and syphilis.Those who have visited the clinic and wish to be tested for hepatitis C can call (02) 2620-4920~9.

Most of the birds culled were ducks, although some chickens have been destroyed.  The ministry, which set up a task force to handle the outbreaks, said local poultry wholesalers and middlemen seem to be inadvertently spreading the bird flu virus as they move from one farm to another.  ""People and vehicles seem to be the main cause of the spread,"" it said. Officials have hinted that the latest AI cases may have been sparked by a dormant virus from earlier outbreaks.   Tests conducted on the virulent AI strain found in the country have indicated that the latest outbreaks are similar to those that hit the country from Sept. 24, 2014, through June 10 of this year.   To handle the spread of the bird flu that can wreck havoc on the country's poutry stock, the government said it will conduct checks on all duck farms in the South Jeolla and Gwangju regions this month. It said besides conducting detailed tests, decontamination of farms, holding facilities and traditional markets that handle live birds will be carried out for the southwestern part of the country.  In addition, the ministry, which has been creating a database on the latest outbreaks, that include following the movement of wholesalers and the way birds reach consumers, identified other regions that may be vulnerable to AI.  ""All cases so far have occurred in South Jeolla Province and Gwangju, but this may spread north into North Jeolla Province and parts of North Chungcheong Province,"" it said.  The ministry said these areas have been placed under close observation, with farms being decontaminated as a precautionary measure.  The government, meanwhile, said that starting on Dec. 23, poultry farms where outbreaks have occurred more than once will be given less compensation for birds culled, while poultry companies that buy birds from farmers will be obliged to train their suppliers about how to prevent AI, and check to make certain they follow rules. These companies will be obliged to report their activities to local authorities with failure to do so leading to a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,760).

It plans to hire a total of 250 language interpreters for the specific service by 2018.According to the latest data by the Health and Welfare Ministry, the number of foreign patients increased more than four times from 2006 to last year, from 60,201 to 266,501. In 2014, Chinese patients accounted for the largest proportion, 29.8 percent, of all foreign patients, followed by those from the U.S. and Russia. The largest number of patients from China, 27.9 percent, received treatments at plastic surgery clinics. In recent years, the country has seen a rise in the number of complaints reported by foreign nationals over botched work and exorbitant billing at Korean plastic surgery clinics.The number of Chinese patients that have filed complaints with the Korea Medical Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Agency increased to 30 last year from 20 in 2013 and nine in 2012. There are currently 17 cases pending as of August this year. Of the total 76 cases between 2012 and August this year, 47 of them were filed by Chinese nationals.Sources have said tourists face difficulty in making the complaints as they usually receive treatment while visiting the country with a short tourism visa, as well as due to a language barrier.Earlier this month, five Chinese women who allegedly suffered botched plastic surgery operations in Korea held a protest against the clinics and the Korean government in Myeong-dong, a well-known tourist destination in Seoul. According to New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep.

However, the chance of them being infected by the virus from the particular patient is “very low,” according to medical professionals and the government.  “It seems like a very small amount of the virus particles that had been incubating inside the patient’s body has been detected,” said Dr. Kim Ik-joong from the Seoul National University Hospital.  Japanese tourists arrive in Korea through Gimpo Airport wearing face masks on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Following the Health Ministry’s announcement, a local news outlet accused the Samsung Medical Center, where the patient contracted the disease while staying at its emergency facility in May, of not recognizing the patient when he visited the hospital again Sunday after experiencing a high fever. According to the report, he was treated at the hospital’s emergency room, instead of a quarantine facility, and may have exposed the virus to other patients in the room. The 35-year-old patient was moved to Seoul National University Hospital’s special quarantine facility Sunday, the same day he visited the SMC, after showing signs of MERS. He tested positive for the virus while staying at the Seoul National University Hospital on Monday.The patient was South Korea’s 80th confirmed MERS case, and the last to recover and be released from the hospital. The patient, who has also been suffering from cancer, was first exposed to the virus while staying at the Samsung Medical Center in May. He was confirmed as a MERS patient on June 7, and received treatment at a quarantine facility until his release on Oct. 3. Before his release, he tested negative for the virus two consecutive times.In response to the accusations, SMC said while it is true that the patient was treated at its emergency room, he was placed in a special facility “located inside the emergency property.” “The patient has been visiting our hospital mostly for cancer treatment,” said Park Jung-eun from the hospital. “When he arrived (on Sunday), the only symptom he had was fever. We placed him in a special room, where only one patient can stay, inside the emergency facility regardless, and all of the medical professionals wore protective gear.”The hospital was the largest infection source of the MERS outbreak in South Korea, which has claimed 36 lives since May. A total of 91 Koreans were reported to have contracted the virus at the hospital in Seoul, accounting for 49 percent of all confirmed cases in the country. Last month, the hospital vowed to invest 100 billion won ($87 million) to revamp its emergency facilities and come up with vaccines for the virus as part of its post-MERS plan.

Such warmer, humid weather makes it easier for mosquitoes to breed, Kim added at a medical forum held in the U.S. on Saturday.From 2013-2014, two Koreans developed dengue fever in the country. Also, 415 individuals arrived in Korea after contracting the disease overseas in the same period.There is currently no specific medicine or antibiotic to treat dengue fever, which causes symptoms such as fever, muscle and joint pain, intense headache and vomiting. Last year, Japan battled its first outbreak of dengue fever in almost 70 years, with more than 70 people confirmed as being infected. The cases were believed to have been contracted among visitors to Tokyo’s popular Yoyogi Park. Kim said Korea is also seeing patients who have been infected with the Chikungunya virus, another viral disease transmitted to humans from mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Like dengue fever, there is no cure for the disease, and treatment is focused only on relieving the symptoms.The first Korean patient to have been infected with the Chikungunya virus on the peninsula was reported in 2013. Two people who contracted the virus overseas returned to Korea while suffering from the disease.

""The period is timed to coincide with the end of the Chuseok holiday and the arrival of migratory birds from the north.""Chuseok, or Korean Thanksgiving, which fell on Sunday this year, is a particularly difficult time for quarantine officials because there is a large movement of people across the country.October marks the start of the migratory season for wild birds that have been known to spread AI to domestic poultry farms.    Lee said that detailed tests on the strains showed that all outbreaks confirmed in the past few weeks were similar to those that hit the country from Sept. 24, 2014, through June 10 this year.""The latest outbreaks are not from a new outside source, but came from a virus that had stayed dormant for the past few months,"" the official said.Close inspections of the affected areas show that local poultry middlemen may have inadvertently spread the virus, he said.Authorities are in the process of checking some 270 facilities and bird farms these middlemen visited to check for AI, the official added. Seoul has ordered all poultry agents to register with authorities following past outbreaks.""It is likely that new bird flu cases will be reported in the future,"" Lee warned.Since 2003, South Korea has reported five outbreaks that have cost the country about 620 billion won ($518 million).Besides bird flu, the farm ministry said it will beef up inspections and vaccinations of cloven-hoofed animals like pigs and cows to prevent another outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.Since the last outbreak on April 28, there have been no new cases in the country, but the government said it is not taking any chances, especially since there have been numerous outbreaks reported in neighboring countries such as China.

Each baby stayed at the facility for about a week. The nurse, who reportedly infected the infants, was told by her doctor in July that she may be TB-positive after taking a chest X-ray but continued to show up at work regardless.At most postpartum care centers, considered unique to South Korea, newborns stay in a separate room with other babies away from their mothers, and are looked after by nurses in shifts. They are united with their mothers for breast-feeding and other bonding time. The schedule for the mothers, who often opt for the service for postpartum rest, includes body massages, facials, educational classes on child care and workout sessions. A mother (left) looks at her newborn at a hospital in Seoul. Many young mothers in Korea choose to go to postpartum centers right after they are discharged from hospitals. (File Photo/ The Korea Herald)This isn’t the first time safety concerns about the postpartum care facilities have been raised. According to Rep. In Jae-keun of the main opposition party New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the number of mothers and newborn children who developed infectious diseases while staying at such centers increased dramatically from 2013 to this year, from 49 to 270. The diseases included pneumonia, pertussis, respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus, which is one of the most common causes of severe diarrhea among infants and young children.Meanwhile, the number of postnatal care facilities also increased significantly since 2006, from 294 to 602 last year, buoyed by high demand from mothers here. As of this year, 68.8 percent of new Korean mothers opt to stay at such centers instead of home right after their deliveries. More than 60 percent of the centers are located in the Seoul and Gyeonggi regions. From 2013-2015, 122 centers -- about 20 percent of all facilities -- were reported to the authorities for hiring unqualified nurses, while 113 facilities faced disciplinary measures for not educating their staff on infectious disease control and prevention as required. Also, the number of complaints filed to the Korea Consumer Agency by those who stayed in postpartum care facilities also rose from 510 in 2010 to 1,200 last year. Some of the complaints were about unsanitary kitchen and poorly cooked meals. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is testing the 120 babies who stayed at Seoul’s Eunpyeong district-based center for possible infection. According to the parents who filed the damage suit, 26 babies out of 46 who have been tested turned out to be latent TB-positive.This means the TB bacteria is in the children’s bodies but inactive and therefore causing no symptoms. Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of infected persons with latent tuberculosis (LTB) develop TB disease at some time in their lives.Choi Myung-joo, one of the parents who are suing the center, claimed that the infected babies are now required to take Rifampicin, also known as Rifampin, an antibiotic to treat LTB for a maximum of nine months. All tuberculosis medications, including Rifampin, can be highly toxic to the liver, especially of children. “A lot of the infected children are less than 100 days old,” she wrote in her open letter to Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the NPAD. “It breaks our heart to see our babies having to take such strong medicine every morning at such a young age.” Some of the infants reportedly have been showing symptoms of side effects of the drug, including vomiting and sleeping too much. Worried about the possible liver damage, a number of mothers chose not to have their children take the medicine and wait until they are older to start the preventive TB treatment.Despite such increasing health scares at postpartum centers, they are considered efficient in helping new mothers recuperate and learn child care tips.Traditionally for Korean mothers, the first three weeks after birth have been strongly emphasized in postnatal care. Some of the traditional customs still being practiced to this day -- now mostly at postpartum care centers -- include eating seaweed soup and keeping their bodies warm by wearing long sleeves even in the summer season. One of the traditional Korean health beliefs is that if a woman does not stay warm after the delivery, her joints will ache when she gets older along with other health problems.Before the emergence of postpartum care facilities in the late 1990s, the care was usually provided by the mothers’ family members -- usually the maternal grandmother of the newborn -- at home. Today, the centers are considered useful especially among women whose mothers are not available to help with their postpartum care or those who don’t want to burden their parents after the delivery. The fees for the centers, however, differ dramatically according to regions. According to Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition NPAD, the most expensive facility was located in Seoul’s glitzy Gangnam district, which charged 20 million won ($17,046) for two weeks’ worth of service, while the cheapest center was in Gimje, North Jeolla Province, which charged 550,000 won for the same period. The most expensive facilities, mostly located in southern Seoul, are known to serve meals prescribed by nutritionists and made with only organic ingredients, while offering rooms that resemble five-star hotel suites. “I think postpartum care is a necessity than a luxury for most moms,” said Kim Yeon-soo, a mother of a 2-year-old. “A lot of people I know have no choice but to go to these centers because they have no family to look after them and their babies after delivery. I don’t think every woman needs a center that’s like a five-star hotel. But every women should have an access to at least clean and safe centers if they really need to utilize the service.”Seongnam City located South of Seoul, has been pushing to introduce fully-subsidized postpartum facilities as part of the efforts to increase low birthrate. However, the Health and Welfare Ministry disallowed the plan and urged the city reconsider it for infection and safety concerns.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","nine months all tuberculosis medications ,nurse who reportedly infected the ,hiring unqualified nurses while 113 ,months all tuberculosis medications including ,some 70 parents whose newborns","['Seoul', 'Eunpyeong', 'Seoul', 'TB', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'file photo/', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi', 'the Korea Consumer Agency', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Seoul', 'Eunpyeong', 'TB', 'LTB', 'Choi Myung - joo', 'Rifampin', 'LTB', 'Rifampin', 'Ahn Cheol', 'TB', 'korean', 'korean', 'Nam', 'NPAD', 'Seoul', 'Gimje', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yeon - soo', 'the Health and Welfare Ministry', 'Claire Lee']",12,"[ 0.          7.          0.         ... -0.37023044  0.32643646

The nation’s shortage of nursing staff and negative pressure rooms had been blamed for the MERS spread earlier this year, which claimed 36 lives. Many Koreans who contracted the virus did so while caring for their family members at MERS-affected hospital rooms. “Not sharing information with the public (in the early stages of MERS outbreak) and not having an emergency operations center and therefore not being fully informed of the virus (in advance) were some of the biggest problems the government had during the MERS crisis,” said Chung Chin-youb, the newly-appointed Health Minister. Health Minister Chung Chin-youb speaks at a press conference in Seoul on Tuesday. YonhapThe Health Ministry has been heavily criticized for its inept handling of the MERS outbreak, particularly for lacking public health specialists in its high-ranking posts. Former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, who was in charge of the MERS outbreak, was a former economist whose expertise was pension reform. President Park Geun-hye recently appointed medical doctor Chung as the new leader for the ministry. Chung also said he would hire more full-time epidemiologists whose main focus will be to investigate and identify risk factors and causes for disease and targets for preventive health care. The ministry is to hire a total of 64 disease detectives in the next three years, who will be the first responders to public health emergencies by investigating disease outbreaks and detecting new microbes. When there are no health emergencies, they will be in charge of coming up with preventive measures against infectious diseases. “We wanted to make sure the disease detectives have job security (even when there is no disease outbreaks or health emergencies,” said Minister Chung.The government’s plan to launch a new system of having two ministers -- in charge of health and welfare, respectively -- instead of having a separate office specializing in disease control in the wake of MERS outbreak has been criticized by the largest presentative body of medical doctors here. They claimed that the CDC will not be make its own, prompt decisions in health emergencies as it will have to consult with the Health and Welfare Minister. The government stressed that the head of the CDC will take charge of human resources and the budgetary right to manage the organization upon the change. “We’ll collaborate with and support the CDC. But we won’t interfere with what the CDC is in charge of,” said Minister Chung. The government also vowed to change the current system which involves family members staying with patients at medical facilities as main caretakers, by introducing fulltime nursing care in as many hospitals as possible. Also, in order to prevent general hospitals from becoming overcrowded -- which may make inpatients with serious conditions more vulnerable to infection -- the government said it would start charging fees for those who file request forms to see a doctor at tertiary hospitals. Up until now, patients who wished to see a doctor at a general hospital could do so with a referral from their doctors at smaller clinics, free of charge.“We are also requiring doctors to write down symptoms of patients who may have infectious diseases when writing their referrals,” said Kwon Deok-cheol, the assistant minister for health care policy at the Health Ministry. “This way, doctors at general hospitals as well as health authorities will be informed immediately when there is a patient with unusual symptoms.” Negative pressure rooms require using a special ventilation system that produces negative pressure to make sure air flows into the isolation room for infected patients, but does not escape from the room. The system is normally used to quarantine patients with airborne contagious diseases such as tuberculosis. The government plans to expand the number of such rooms to 1,500 nationwide by the year 2020. A total of 43 government-designated high-level general hospitals, including the Samsung Medical Center and Asan Medical Center in Seoul, as well as hospitals with 300 or more patient beds, will be required to establish and run the rooms. Meanwhile, a recent study showed that the government may need to spend 4.6 trillion won ($4.3 billion) to establish a new system that offers full nursing care including assistance usually provided by patients’ families. Korea currently has the lowest patient-to-nurse ratio among the OECD nations, at 0.28 nurses per patient.To increase the number of nurses, the Health Ministry has announced it will establish a two-year nursing program at universities. Currently, there are two types of nursing certificates in Korea. One can be obtained by attending a four-year university program, while the other only requires a yearlong certification program offered in non-university institutions. With the newly established program, there will be three types of nurses with different skills and responsibilities, including caring for inpatients,However, the plan has been fiercely opposed by the representative bodies of Korean nurses, who claim that nurses with degrees in four-year programs would likely be replaced by those with less prestigious degrees once the new system gets established.

Park Yoon-ock, the number of Koreans who developed the mental illness ― which is characterized by fluctuating periods of elevated mood and depression ― increased from 53,056 in 2010 to 75,616 in 2014.The increase was especially striking in Koreans aged 60 or older, who accounted for 25.2 percent of all patients with the disorder. The number of bipolar patients in their 80s, in particular, increased by 215 percent from 1,057 to 3,339 in the same time period. An elderly Korean woman receives a health check-up at a medical facility. (Yonhap)Meanwhile, the number of patients in their 60s increased from 5,953 to 8,992, while the number of those in their 70s surged dramatically from 3,754 to 6,735. Some of the factors that may increase the risk of developing the condition include periods of high stress, alcohol abuse and major life changes or traumatic experiences, such as the death of a loved one. People with bipolar disorder are also likely to have an anxiety disorder, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. According to a 2011 study by Stavanger University Hospital in Norway, bipolar disorder patients had lower social and occupational function than the general population. Also, a significantly higher proportion of patients with the mental disorder was single, had lower income and had physical disabilities than the general public.Korea’s elderly poverty rate marked 48 percent in 2013, which was 3.5 times higher than the national average at 13.7 percent, and the highest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development countries. The OECD average was 12.6 percent.Almost 90 percent of the elderly were suffering from at least one chronic illness such as diabetes and high blood pressure, while one-third were either depressed or obese as of last year. As of last year, 62.5 percent of all Koreans aged 65 or older either only attended elementary school or never received any education at all.“The statistics suggest that the elderly population may be under a lot of stress and there should be more government support for the health and quality of life of the elderly,” said lawmaker Park.

By nationality, the number Chinese dropped by 45 percent to some 310,000 and Japanese by 41.5 percent to about 100,000. China and Japan make up the largest share of visitors.  About 30,000 Philippine and 16,000 Thai visitors traveled to Korea, falling by 31 percent and 43 percent, respectively. The number of Americans decreased by 16.5 percent to about 63,000.The total number of overseas visitors this year to date has consequently reached 6.7 million, inching up just 0.8 percent compared to last year. Before the contagious disease hit the country, more than 5.9 million visited South Korea from January to May, showing a 10.7 percent rise over last year. “Foreign travelers apparently avoided traveling Korea because of MERS. If the current pace continues, it will be difficult to reach the initial aim of attracting 16.2 million foreign visitors,” the KTO said.  Meanwhile, MERS did not affect the outbound number, the state-run body said. Over 1.3 million from Korea left for trips abroad last month, up 8.1 percent on-year.

YonhapJoining the National Medical Center is the Samsung Medical Center, where 91 individuals were confirmed to have contracted the virus. The hospital said it is now fully operational as of Monday, as the Seoul Metropolitan Government lifted its temporary shutdown that lasted for about a month.The hospital, considered one of the top medical facilities in Seoul, was the largest infection source of MERS patients in Korea, accounting for 49 percent of confirmed cases.Most of the 91 patients contracted the disease at the hospital’s emergency room, where the 14th confirmed patient, who is considered a “super-spreader,” stayed from May 27-30.The MERS outbreak has killed 36 and infected 186 since the first case was confirmed on May 20. The spread has consistently showed signs of losing steam lately, with no additional cases confirmed since July 6. A total of 136 patients have fully recovered and been discharged from hospitals. If no cases are reported until Aug. 2 -- four weeks after the latest case was reported on July 5 -- it can be announced that the outbreak in the country is finally over.

A team of five ministry officials will be in charge of creating the manual on how to deal with contagion, as well as boosting cooperation with local medical facilities. The exact date of the operation launch will be decided later, the ministry officials said.MERS ― which was first spotted in 2012 in Saudi Arabia ― has infected 186 people and claimed 35 lives to date in Korea, making it the second most affected country in the world.The nationwide scare pushed over 2,500 schools, kindergartens and colleges across the country to cancel classes. Education authorities became subject to much criticism for the handling of the situation, particularly in providing information to the students, parents and schools about the level of threat the virus posed to classrooms.“As a manual for dealing with such situation did not exist, it took time for us to make the manual. The task force will allow us to act more promptly,” said a high-ranking official from the ministry.In case of an outbreak, the task force will continuously collect information regarding such diseases from both local medical centers and education offices to keep track of the situation. The team will also be in charge of creating teaching materials on dealing with infectious diseases while pushing for medical check-ups to find infectious disease at early stages.The five-member team will be aided by 10 local experts in infectious diseases including Lee Jong-koo, head of the Seoul National University Center for Global Medicine, and Kim Woo-joo, the head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases.Hwang added that the ministry also plans to add more school nurses, as the MERS outbreak revealed that many schools did not even have nurses. “The key idea (of the ministry’s plan) is to provide constant monitoring of student well-being, so that we can at least rein in infectious diseases, instead of cooking up measures every time there is an outbreak,” Hwang said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","schools officials said wednesday decision ,to add more school nurses ,of infectious diseases within schools ,university center for global medicine ,pushed over 500 schools kindergartens","['South Korea ’s', 'Education Ministry', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Korea', 'Lee Jong - koo', 'the Seoul National University Center for Global Medicine', 'Kim Woo - joo', 'the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15011397  0.66431016

The app doesn't require the rider to tell the driver the current location, since the app will automatically show it on the driver's app through the Global Positioning System.""While some people expect Daum Kako will charge commission to the users of KakaoTaxi in the future, this will not happen,"" an official from Daum Kakao said. ""Instead, we plan to launch another service later this year, targeting users seeking high-end taxi services.""   Daum Kakao's latest plan comes in line with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's bid to ease regulations on the operation of high-end taxis, which currently requires the use of automobiles with an engine capacity of 3,000 cc or larger.Due to the strict regulation, there have been no official providers of the taxi service in South Korea.The government's plan to lower the ceiling to around 2,800 cubic centimeters is expected to pave the way for taxi operators to jump into the business and allow KakaoTaxi to expand its service.High-end taxis are given more leeway compared with existing luxury taxis, as they do not require meters nor taxi signs, and are allowed to freely set prices.

Meanwhile, two more patients were discharged from hospitals. The recovered patients accounted for 53.3 percent of all 182 infected individuals as of Wednesday.Among the 97 recovered patients, the largest number of them -- 25.8 percent -- are in their 40s, followed by those in their 50s and 60s. Meanwhile, the largest number of the deceased patients were in their 60s and 70s, followed by those in their 80s and 50s. Seoul’s shopping district Myeongdong, once affected by the MERS outbreak, is filled with visitors on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Health authorities are still closely monitoring seven medical facilities as potential MERS patients remain in quarantine. Cases could still be identified at these facilities, they said. Since Tuesday, a number of news reports have claimed that Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, where 87 patients were infected, allegedly did not cooperate with the government’s request to investigate their facility on May 29, nine days after the index case was confirmed on May 20. The hospital is also where the index patient was diagnosed with MERS officially. Quoting an anonymous Health Ministry official, the reports claimed three government investigators were physically blocked by the hospitals’ security guards, despite their investigation being scheduled in advance. Samsung Medical Center, one of the top hospitals in Seoul, has denied all accusations. By Korean law, those who refuse to cooperate with or who interrupt the government’s investigation can face a fine of 2 million won ($1,800). Kwon Deok-cheol from the Health Ministry’s MERS response headquarters said there appeared to be some discrepancies in the reports and that the authorities would look further into the issue.“We believe that the officer who was quoted in the story was not one of the three investigators who visited the hospital on May 29, but an officer who knew the three investigators,” he said. “We will have to speak to the three officers to find out what exactly happened. Once we do that, we’ll share that information.”In the earlier stages of the outbreak, the Health Ministry had been accused of holding on to information about cases that occurred at Samsung Medical Center, owned by Samsung Group, in its effort to protect the facility and its business. The government had refused to share the list of MERS-affected hospitals for the first 18 days since the index case was confirmed on May 20.The ministry also did not confirm the nation’s 35th case, a health care worker who contracted the virus from the 14th patient at Samsung Medical Center, until three days after his official diagnosis.The MERS outbreak has also revealed the nation‘s poorly equipped medical facilities for infectious diseases. On Monday, the ministry announced that it is to expand the coverage of national health insurance for patients with contagious diseases, as well as the costs of building the negative room pressure system and safety gear for health care workers. As some of the current administration‘s key pledges were to introduce more welfare benefits especially for the large elderly population, the government has been putting less emphasis on the nation’s public health sector. The Ministry of Health and Welfare‘s budget for its welfare programs increased dramatically by 20 trillion won -- 82 percent -- from 2010 to this year, from 23.93 trillion won to 43.44 trillion won. However, its budget for the public health programs only increased by 1 trillion won in the same period.

While the outbreak is once again showing signs of slowing -- only three new cases were reported from June 24-27, while 13 cases were confirmed from June 20-23 -- authorities said it is possible that more cases may be identified in the future, especially from the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul. Some tourists wear masks to prevent themselves contracting MERS while walking at Myeongdong shopping district in central Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)The hospital is where the late 173rd patient had been hospitalized without knowing of her MERS infection. The 70-year-old stayed at the hospital from June 18-24. She died Wednesday, just two days after officially being diagnosed with MERS. Almost 5,000 people who either stayed at or visited the hospital during the particular period are currently being monitored for possible infection, said Jeong Eun-kyung from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry. Among them, 394 of them have been quarantined at home, while 137 have been isolated in medical facilities. The remaining 4,294 have been placed under special monitoring by the health authorities. “We believe most people were exposed to the 173rd patient from June 20-22,” said Jeong. “We have been consistently monitoring those who may have been infected, but so far no one has been diagnosed yet.”Concerns have been rising about the particular 173rd case, the late patient, as she had developed pneumonia on top of MERS while staying at the hospital. Pneumonia, a disease that can seriously deteriorate a MERS patient’s condition, had also afflicted the nation’s five other “super-spreaders” -- those who spread the virus to more than two individuals.“Those five patients are the index, sixth, 14th, 15th and 16th patients,” said Dr. Lee Jae-gab from Hallym University Medical Center, who last week studied 98 MERS cases occurring in Korea. Dr. Lee also discovered that the five super-spreaders were diagnosed with MERS relatively late. While they were diagnosed an average of 8.2 days after they experienced their first symptoms, the non-spreaders were diagnosed an average of 4.6 days after developing MERS symptoms. The 173rd patient also visited a number of medical facilities in the Gangdong district of Seoul while showing MERS symptoms from June 10-18, before she was hospitalized at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul. She had not been informed about her exposure to MERS by the authorities, and died just two days after her official diagnosis. The authorities also confirmed the 182nd patient, who was previously said to be the first to be diagnosed with MERS while showing no symptoms, in fact had experienced mild MERS-like symptoms prior to her diagnosis.The 27-year-old nurse, who was exposed to the virus while working at the Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, had been quarantined at home from June 7-24. She was diagnosed Friday, two days after the quarantine had ended. “We interviewed the patient and it turned out that she did have some symptoms while being quarantined at home,” said Kwon Deok-cheol from the Health Ministry, revoking his previous statement from the day before. The Health Ministry had announced Saturday that the patient could be the first to be diagnosed with MERS while being asymptomatic.“We learned that she experienced mild indigestion on June 14. She also said she coughed whenever she was in cold air.” Meanwhile, the newly confirmed death turned out to be the nation’s 104th patient, who was infected by the 14th patient at the emergency room of the Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul. The 55-year-old was diagnosed with the virus on June 9 and died Saturday. He was also diabetic.As of Sunday, 2,562 individuals remained in isolation. The number increased from 2,467 the day before.

(Yonhap)Out of 32 MERS-related deaths, 29, or 90.6 percent, involved people of old age or those with existing health conditions, such as diabetes or cancer, that were apparently worsened by MERS.With the latest MERS death, the fatality rate of the disease in the country climbed to 17.6 percent, still lower than the over 40 percent tallied globally until the outbreak here.Out of the 182 people diagnosed with the disease so far, 59 still remained hospitalized with 15 of them currently in unstable conditions, the ministry said.So far 91 people previously diagnosed with MERS have been discharged from the hospital following complete recoveries.Since the country confirmed its first or index case on May 20, over 15,500 other people have been subject to isolation for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients.As of Sunday, 2,562 people still remained in isolation, mostly at their own homes, as suspected cases, according to the ministry.The number slightly increased from 2,467 on the previous day.MERS is a viral respiratory disease first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There currently exists no vaccine or treatment for the disease, apparently one of reasons for such a high fatality rate of the disease, at least until the outbreak here.In South Korea, hospitals have been a major, if not the only, source of infection with two possible exceptions involving an ambulance driver and a paramedic who helped transport MERS patients.Some 90 hospitals have been affected by the disease with some of them having to shut down parts or most of their operations temporarily.A list of the MERS-affected hospitals is daily updated and available at the Health Ministry's Web site at www.mw.go.kr.While hospitals have been blamed as a major source of infection, the country's tradition of family members staying with their loved ones in hospital rooms has been pointed out, also by the World Health Organization, as a major factor driving the outcome here.Most of the 182 diagnosed with MERS are either friends or family members of those diagnosed earlier or those who had shared the same hospital rooms with MERS patients.

Children wear masks to school. (Yonhap)The new patient reportedly caught the disease while sharing the same hospital room with a MERS patient at a hospital in Busan, prior to the latter's diagnosis.Out of the 180 diagnosed, 77 patients remain hospitalized while 62 of them are currently in stable condition, according to ministry officials.So far, 74 people previously diagnosed with MERS have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.In addition to those diagnosed, 2,642 others are in isolation for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients.The number dropped from 3,103 on the previous day.Since the country reported its first case on May 20, some 14,500 people have been subject to isolation as suspected cases while 11,936 of them have been released after showing no symptoms of the disease for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days.Nearly all infections here so far have occurred at hospitals with the World Health Organization also pointing to the country's tradition of family members staying with their loved ones in hospital rooms as a major factor driving the outbreak of MERS here.Some 90 hospitals throughout the country have been affected by the disease, while only 19 of them still remain on the watchlist as it has been less than 14 days since they last reported a MERS case or were visited by a known patient.The list is daily updated and available at the ministry's Web site.To help locate easily those exposed to MERS and other infectious diseases in the future, the government said it will begin requiring hospitals to keep a record of all visitors, including anyone accompanying a patient, to their emergency rooms.""Currently, it is not a requirement, but the government will seek to revise the medical law to make it a requirement,"" an official from the disease control center said.Shortly after the country's first case was confirmed on May 20, a South Korean man left for China after being exposed to the MERS coronavirus. He has since been diagnosed in China and still remains hospitalized there.In another case, another man from Seoul traveled to the South Korean resort island of Jeju prior to diagnosis.Ministry officials believe a record of visitors to emergency rooms will help track down those exposed to any infectious disease, also enabling them to notify and order such persons into isolation as quickly as possible.MERS is a viral respiratory disease first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease that had a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent until the outbreak here.

The Health Ministry also reported the nation’s first MERS case that occurred outside of hospitals, which may be a sign that community transmissions of the disease have taken place in the country.As of Wednesday afternoon, the virus has killed 27 people and infected 179. No deaths were reported on the same day, although 16 patients are currently in unstable condition. Meanwhile, 13 more patients have been discharged from hospitals, raising the total number of recovered individuals to 67.A total of 3,103 people -- an increase from 2,805 the day before -- were under quarantine Wednesday, while the fatality rate of the disease remained at 15 percent. Concerns have been rising as it was revealed on Tuesday that the 173rd patient, a 70-year-old caregiver, visited three different medical clinics before being hospitalized at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul, where she was eventually diagnosed with MERS. “We thought the MERS spread was showing signs of slowing until Sunday,” Kwon Deok-cheol from the Health Ministry. “But right now we can’t say we are still thinking the same way as more clinics have been newly infected by the virus.”  Medical staff walk in front of Konkuk University Medical Center, which has been partially shut down due to MERS, in eastern Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The nation’s first MERS case that occurred outside of hospitals has been also reported. According to health authorities, the 175th patient is believed to have been infected by his late wife, the 118th patient, who died from MERS on June 13, before she was admitted to the hospital. His late wife was infected by the 14th patient while caring for her husband, who had been hospitalized for pneumonia at the Good Morning Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, from May 23-29. After being discharged, he and his 67-year-old wife were placed under quarantine together at home until June 10, the day the wife was officially diagnosed with MERS. She died three days later. The 175th patient, 75, had been asymptomatic even after his wife’s death, but started experiencing a fever on June 21. He was officially diagnosed with MERS earlier this week. Considering the maximum incubation period of MERS is 14 days, the Health Ministry said it is most likely that the 175th patient was infected by his late wife at home, not at the hospital in Pyeongtaek.While fears have been escalating over the possibility of community-transmission of MERS, the World Health Organization assured on Friday that the risk to the general public was low.“Even if transmission spills over into the general community, such cases are not likely to sustain further transmission,” Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of WHO, told reporters in Seoul last week. The Health Ministry also announced on Wednesday that the Samsung Medical Center, where 48 percent of all confirmed patients were exposed to the virus, will continue to be partially shut down indefinitely. The Seoul-based facility, which was initially shut down on June 13, had been scheduled to resume its services on Wednesday. Since June 13, the hospital has been banned from performing any surgical procedures except for in an emergency, as well as receiving new patients and visitors. Its emergency room has been completely shut down. “It’s a joint decision made by the government and civil medical experts,” said Kwon from the Health Ministry. “We’ve decided that it would be safer to keep the hospital closed especially after we learned that the 137th patient, an ambulance worker, continued to work in and out of the hospital while showing MERS symptoms from June 2-10.”Health authorities have also decided to temporarily shut down Konkuk University Medical Center in Seoul, where the 76th MERS patient stayed from June 16-19 and infected four others so far.Authorities are urging those who visited the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul from May 17-22, Mok Cha-su internal medicine clinic (223 Sangil-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul) from June 10-11, Bon otolaryngology clinic (391 Godeok-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul) on June 15 and Gangdong neurosurgery clinic (45-24 Myeongil-dong Gangdong-gu, Seoul) on June 16 to let their doctors know that they may have been exposed to the virus should they seek medical help for any symptoms or diseases.They are also asked to report to the authorities immediately should they experience MERS-like symptoms, including a high fever, coughing and shortness of breath, by calling 120 or contacting the nearest public health center.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","afternoon the virus has killed ,of wednesday afternoon the virus ,virus has killed 27 people ,wednesday afternoon the virus ,started experiencing fever on june","['South Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Hallym University Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the Health Ministry', 'Konkuk University Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the Good Morning Hospital', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Health Ministry', 'Pyeongtaek', 'the World Health Organization', 'Margaret Chan', 'WHO', 'Seoul', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Kwon', 'the Health Ministry', 'Konkuk University Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the Hallym University Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Mok Cha', 'sangil - dong', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Myeongil - dong Gangdong - gu ,', 'Seoul', 'Claire Lee']",4,"[ 0.         10.          5.         ... -0.58099043  0.61599314

The on-year increase was the highest gain for the month of April since the 5.3 percent growth tallied in 2011. The rise comes after the number of childbirths shot up 6.3 percent on-year in March with 40,400 babies being born in the country. For the first four months of 2015, 155,800 babies were born in the country, up 1.7 percent from 153,200 tallied for the same period a year earlier.""The number of women in their mid to late 30s having babies played a part in the rise of newborn numbers last month,"" an official from the statistical office said. She said this is a natural development as the average age of women getting married has risen over the years.South Korea, whose population is expected to peak in 2030, has been trying to push up its birthrate to prevent a decline in the national workforce. Such a development can result in more welfare expenses and damage the country's growth potential. In 2014, 435,300 babies were born in Asia's fourth-largest economy, down 0.3 percent on-year. In the previous year, childbirths plunged 9.9 percent to 436,500 causing alarm bells to go off.The report also showed that about 24,700 couples tied the knot in April, a 3.8 percent increase from the year before. The monthly number, however, represents a drop from 27,200 people who were married in the third month of 2015.The number of newlyweds is a good indicator of childbirths down the line in South Korea because very few children are born to single-parent families.The number of divorces, meanwhile, fell 8.3 percent on-year to 8,800.From January through April, the number of people who got married reached 101,200, a gain of 0.4 percent on-year, with that of divorces falling by 6,100 to 35,100.In April, there were 23,600 deaths, up 8.3 percent from a year earlier.In a separate report, the agency said that the number of people changing their residency dipped 1.2 percent on-year to 606,000 in May. It was also down from the 613,000 in April and the lowest figure for May in 40 years. (Yonhap)","previous year childbirths plunged percent ,march with 40 400 babies ,korea about 38 100 babies ,knot in april percent increase ,of 2015 155 800 babies","['South Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92640907  0.62178534

As of Monday afternoon, the virus has killed 27 people in Korea.Meanwhile, the number of hospitalized MERS patients decreased to 95 from 101 the day before. Seven more individuals have been discharged from medical facilities, raising the number of recovered patients to 50. The number of people in quarantine has dropped consistently since last week, from 5,930 on Thursday to 3,833 on Monday.With the number of hospitalized patients declining, the Health Ministry last week said the outbreak was showing signs of losing steam. Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, also assured in Seoul on Friday that the outbreak of MERS in Korea could be stopped.However, concerns are still being raised as all the three newly confirmed patients were diagnosed many days after the disease’s maximum incubation period, which the Health Ministry says is 14 days. This indicates that additional cases may still be confirmed in the future, including among contacts who were not identified in the earlier stages of the outbreak. (Yonhap)The nation’s 171st patient was exposed to the virus while staying at Samsung Medical Center’s emergency room from May 27-29. It’s been more than 20 days since she stayed at the facility, where 83 others were infected previously.The hospital, considered one of the top medical facilities in Seoul, is the largest infection source of MERS patients in Korea, accounting for 48.8 percent of confirmed cases. Most of the 84 patents contracted the disease at the hospital’s emergency room, where the 14th confirmed patient, who is considered a “superspreader,” stayed from May 27-30.The 170th patient, on the other hand, stayed with the 76th patient at Konkuk University Medical Center in Seoul on June 6. He was officially diagnosed with MERS on Sunday, more than 14 days after being exposed to the virus.The 172nd patient was exposed to the virus while working as a caregiver at Dae-Chung hospital in Daejeon, a facility that specifically serves elderly patients with chronic conditions. The last day her facility received a MERS patient ― he left on the same day ― was June 1, and therefore the incubation period should have been over on June 15. However, the 61-year-old caregiver was diagnosed with the virus on Sunday.In the case of 171st patient, Jeong Eun-kyung from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry said she started showing symptoms on June 9, about 10 days after she was initially exposed to the virus at Samsung Medical Center, but her initial test was negative. She was tested again after developing a high fever on June 17, Jeong said.Dr. Chan of the WHO last Friday stressed that much about MERS was still unknown and Korea needed to strengthen quarantine efforts continuously.“There are huge gaps in our knowledge about the MERS coronavirus and the disease it causes,” she said.“Scientists are not sure where the virus hides in nature, how it spreads, whether asymptomatic carriers play a role in transmission, or even why some patients die and others recover.”Until we know we have broken the last chain of transmission, we must maintain our vigilance.”To establish a better system to tackle infectious diseases in future, Cheong Wa Dae invited five experts from WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S., including Sylvie Briand, Director of Pandemic & Epidemic Diseases Department of WHO, and Steve Redd, Director of Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response of the CDC. The experts will offer their opinions and advices on the current MERS situation as well as preventive measures for other infectious diseases starting this week in Seoul. Meanwhile, with 19.2 percent of all confirmed South Korean MERS patients turning out to be health care workers as of Monday, a study last year by Dong-a University showed that more than 40 percent of nurses have been infected with diseases at least once while serving at emergency rooms, with some even contracting HIV.As of Monday, 33 health care workers, including doctors and nurses, had been infected with MERS-CoV. They account for 19.2 percent of all 172 confirmed patients in the country.

In South Korea, the fatality rate remained at around 15.7 percent.  The latest MERS-related deaths included a 97-year-old man who had existing health conditions, including cancer.  The health ministry earlier said over 90 percent of all fatalities here involved people of old age or those with existing health problems that were apparently worsened by MERS.  As of Monday, 50 people previously diagnosed with the disease have been discharged from hospital following complete recoveries, according to the ministry.  MERS is a viral respiratory disease that was first found in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Until the outbreak here, only about 1,100 cases had been reported in some 20 countries throughout the world, while the fatality rate of the disease had been tallied at over 40 percent.

The decline indicates that the worst is over for arguably the country’s most serious outbreak since the swine flu outbreak of 2009.Outside of Saudi Arabia, where the disease was first reported in 2012, Korea has the highest number of MERS cases in the world. A total of 169 cases of occurred within its boundaries to date, with 25 people losing their lives. Korean authorities have started to discuss the criteria for when the outbreak can be considered officially over.“(The government) started discussing the criteria for the official declaration, taking into account input from local experts and officials from the World Health Organization,” said Jeong Eun-gyeong, an official from the MERS response team. She added that talk of an actual declaration may be premature, as authorities are still discovering new MERS cases across the country. Jeong previously said the MERS outbreak would be considered over only when no new cases are reported for about double the disease’s incubation period. Considering that the maximum incubation period for MERS is 14 days, it implies the government will announce the outbreak over if no new case is reported for at least 28 days. As of Sunday morning, 43 MERS patients had made a full recovery and were discharged from their hospitals.The number of those in quarantine for possible infection also dropped by over 1,000 overnight to 4,035. At one point, nearly 7,000 were isolated for containment purposes. The government has been keeping track of hospitals affected by the disease, whether an actual infection occurred or a confirmed MERS patient visited the institutions. The most severely hit facility is Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, accounting for nearly half of cases nationwide.Authorities have stressed that all the infections took place within hospital walls, although it has yet to determine exactly when and how some patients ― such as a policeman from Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province ― contracted the virus.The list of affected hospitals can be found on the Health Ministry’s website, both in Korean and English.After a joint investigation with the Korean government, the World Health Organization concluded last week that the outbreak in Korea was not a health crisis that called for a coordinated international response. In addition to the WHO, experts in infectious diseases from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will visit Korea Monday for a “technical cooperation” with local experts on the MERS situation, the Health Ministry said.To date, 101 MERS patients are still being treated, 14 of whom are in unstable condition. As the disease attacks the respiratory system, local medical staff have been using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ― a type of life support ― on some patients to ensure they take in enough oxygen. ECMO has been used on eight patients so far, three of whom are still on it. Two have made recovery on the device, while three have died despite using it. Of the 25 lives claimed by MERS, 18 were men. Nine were in their 60s, while eight were in their 70s. The youngest MERS death was aged 49.About 18.9 percent of the 169 MERS patients were local medical staff, while the rest were either patients already at a hospital ― 46.2 percent ― or their visitors or family members. The virus has infected more men than women ― 61.5 percent to 38.5 percent ― and 50-somethings were the most severely hit age group with 20.7 percent.

But the daily number of new cases remained in the low single-digit range for several days in a row. There was no additional death from MERS, with the total death toll remaining at 25.   The number of people in isolation for suspected infections also dropped to 4,035 from 5,197 the previous day. Seven more people were discharged from the hospital after complete recoveries, raising the number of recovered patients to 43.  (Yonhap)In one of the latest signs of the MERS scare on the wane, growth in foreigners' cancellations of trips to South Korea slowed sharply last week, according to data by the state-run Korea Tourism Organization.  A total of 1,760 foreigners canceled their trips to South Korea on Friday, up a mere 1.43 percent from the previous day. The number of trip cancellations by foreign tourists fell from 4,470 Tuesday to 3,710 Wednesday and to 1,879 a day later.  Between June 1, when the first MERS death was reported here, and Thursday, 123,390 foreigners canceled their trips to South Korea, with people from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong taking up the bulk, or 92,975, according to the data.  Concerns over MERS are especially high among the Chinese after a South Korean man who tested positive for the virus flew to Hong Kong on May 26 and subsequently went to southern China, which was widely reported in local media, according to experts.   Hit hard by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, the Chinese are more cautious over the development of the contagious disease in South Korea.  The Chinese are South Korea's biggest tourist group, with the number of travelers from the nation surpassing 6 million for the first time in 2014.   The MERS outbreak has dealt a harsh blow to the local tourism and retail industries, which have been scrambling to attract more Chinese travelers this year amid tepid domestic consumption.  Industry sources, meanwhile, said Sunday the local business community is going all-out to tide over the fallout of the MERS outbreak on Asia's fourth-largest economy struggling with flaccid consumer spending and sagging exports.     The Federation of Korean Industries, the country's largest business lobby group, has urged its member companies to go ahead with their key events and operations as planned, as MERS-related panic has been excessive, leading to sharper than expected damage to business activities.  ""Amid a protracted slump in the global economy and domestic demand, the local economy could be hit hard by MERS,"" said Lim Sang-hyuck, a senior official at the FKI.   The FKI has decided to go ahead with its key committee meetings slated this week in a show of its strong will to overcome MERS-related fears spreading in the local business community.  Local companies are also chiming in by pushing ahead with product-launching events as scheduled. Hyundai Motor Co., the country's No. 1 automaker, and its smaller affiliate Kia Motors Corp. are planning to organize events next month for their release of new car models.  The country's airlines, hit by massive trip cancellations, are also ramping up their efforts.  Both Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., the country's two largest full-service carriers, had reported a sharp drop in passenger traffic, announcing plans to reduce flights to China.  But Asiana Airlines has decided to launch its Incheon-Rome route on June 30 as scheduled, and Korean Air has announced a deal to purchase 100 new passenger jets, which will cost the airline some $12.23 billion won, the largest purchase deal recorded in airline history here.  ""What's most important is to regain psychological stability,"" said the FKI official. ""We also hope that the government will take measures such as tax cuts, in order to boost private spending.""

The list of MERS-affected hospitals is daily updated and is available at the ministry's Web site.  As of Sunday, the number of people in isolation for suspected cases came to 4,035, down from 5,197 on the previous day. So far, some 8,800 people have been released from isolation after they showed no symptoms of MERS for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days for the disease.  Currently, the country's death toll from the disease remains at 25 with the latest fatality confirmed late Saturday.  The latest MERS-related death involved a 63-year-old male who had existing health conditions, including diabetes and a heart disease.  The health ministry earlier said over 90 percent of all fatalities here involved people of old age or those with existing health problems that are apparently worsened by MERS.  Out of the 169 people diagnosed so far, 43 have been discharged from the hospital following complete recoveries as of Sunday, according to the ministry. The number increased by seven from the day before.  MERS is a viral respiratory disease that was first found in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

The fatality rate remained 14.5 percent of as of Friday afternoon. More than 90 percent of the deceased either had preexisting medical conditions, especially lung or kidney diseases, or were aged 50 or older.Medical workers check visitors’ temperature at a hospital in Seoul on Friday. (Yonhap)Among the 166 confirmed cases, 112 of them are currently being treated at medical facilities, while 16 are in unstable condition. A total of 30 patients have fully recovered and been discharged.Also among all confirmed patients, 98.8 percent were infected at health care facilities. The largest number of them -- 49 percent -- were exposed to the virus at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul. The newly confirmed patient is also believed to have been infected at Samsung Medical Center, where 81 others were exposed to the virus previously. Most of the 81 patients were infected at the facility’s emergency room, where the 14th confirmed patient -- considered a “superspreader” -- stayed from May 27-30.The 166th patient, however, stayed at the hospital’s non-emergency unit, from May 25 to June 5 to nurse his wife who had been receiving treatment there as an inpatient. The 62-year-old is the fifth to be confirmed as a MERS patient infected at the Samsung Medical Center’s non-emergency facility. A radiation therapist and a nurse, who were serving at the hospital but not at its emergency room, have also been confirmed as MERS patients. An outpatient who visited the hospital’s orthopedics clinic, as well as a man who accompanied another outpatient to see a urologist at the hospital, have also been infected by the virus in the past.  The nation’s 137th confirmed patient was an ambulance worker at the hospital, who was working on a contract basis and therefore hadn’t been provided with safety gear. These cases, along with the 166th, indicate that Samsung Medical Center’s inpatients and visitors may have been exposed to the virus even if they were not staying at the hospital’s emergency room, and it is possible that additional cases will be identified as having been infected there. To tackle the situation, the Health Ministry said it would contact a total of 41,930 individuals who either stayed or visited the hospital from May 27 to early this month to conduct a survey for further research.“We are currently investigating how the 166th patient was exposed to the virus while staying at Samsung Medical Center,” said Jeong Eun-kyung from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry. ""One of the possibilities is that he was infected by the 137th patient, who was the ambulance worker, but nothing can be confirmed at this moment.”Health authorities also announced that they were banning another Seoul-based hospital, where one of the confirmed MERS patients was staying along with other patients with kidney diseases, from receiving any more inpatients starting Friday. The medical facility, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, is where more than 100 patients may have been exposed to MERS while receiving kidney dialysis -- a blood treatment for patients with kidney failure -- along with the 165th confirmed patient from June 9-18. Health authorities also announced that a total of 17 patients, currently quarantined at Asan Chungmu Hospital in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, will be moved to another facility to be isolated more safely. The hospital was shut down and all of its inpatients were quarantined in the same property on Thursday, after one of its nurses was diagnosed with MERS the day before. The remaining 48 patients will each be placed in single patient rooms to be away from each other, authorities said.The ministry also announced on Friday that families of MERS patients will now be allowed to visit their sick relatives at the hospital, should their condition become critical and unrecoverable. All visitors, however, will be required to wear full safety gear, authorities said. The announcement came after a number of quarantined family members could not stand by their spouses or parents at their deathbeds to say goodbye and share their last words.The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said it would support health authorities by dispatching some 100 military surgeons and nurses, as well as some 200 medical officers and emergency relief agents from the Army Special Warfare Command, to help medical professionals currently in the workforce to control the outbreak at civilian hospitals. On Thursday, Dr. Margaret Chan, the director-general of World Health Organization, stressed that the public cooperation is critical in handling of the MERS situation, while assuring that the outbreak in Korea can be stopped. Her comments in Seoul came after a number of quarantined individuals did not follow the guidelines by leaving their houses and facilities. On Monday, the nation’s 141st patient escaped quarantine at a Seoul-based hospital while waiting for his test results, by forcibly breaking the lock on the door. He took a cab and went home, and was eventually diagnosed with MERS and quarantined at another facility the next day.“When individuals do not follow the advice and guidelines of the government, it is unfair to blame the government,” Chan from WHO said.While Chan praised the Korean government’s current efforts to combat the disease, the Journal of the American Medical Association pointed out that Seoul’s inept response in the early stages of the outbreak, especially withholding the names of MERS-affected hospitals, may have contributed to public fear.It also stated that such fear and public mistrust in government can damage the process of handling such an infectious disease.“Transparency builds public trust,” wrote authors Lawrence O. Gostin and Daniel Lucey in their article “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Global Health Challenge” published online in the JAMA. “Given inevitable scientific uncertainty, health authorities should fully disclose what is and is not known about the MERS-CoV outbreak.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","friday korea marked the lowest ,more inpatients starting friday ,mers cases friday since june ,hospital in seoul on friday ,nation 141st patient escaped quarantine","['South Korea', 'Korea', 'Health Ministry', 'Seoul', 'yonhap)among', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'the Samsung Medical Center ’s', 'Samsung Medical Center ’s', 'the Health Ministry', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Jeong Eun - kyung', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at', 'the Health Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Kyung Hee University Hospital', 'Asan Chungmu Hospital', 'Cheonan', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'the Defense Ministry', 'the Army Special Warfare Command', 'Margaret Chan', 'World Health Organization', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'WHO', 'Chan', 'korean', 'the Journal of the American Medical Association', 'Seoul', 'Lawrence O.

(Yonhap)The latest fatality marked the 24th MERS-related death in the country.The country also reported an additional infection case that put the number of people diagnosed with the disease at 166.The new patient is believed to have caught the disease while caring for a family member hospitalized in Seoul's Samsung Medical Center.The World Health Organization has noted the country's tradition of family members staying with sick ones in hospital rooms may have helped further drive the spread of MERS in South Korea.Samsung Medical Center and some 80 other hospitals have been the source of nearly all infections here.The Samsung hospital has voluntarily shut down most of its operations at least until Wednesday.Still, it marked the lowest daily increase in the number of patients since the outbreak here was first confirmed on May 20, the ministry noted.An official from the ministry's emergency control center said this led them to believe ""the spread of the disease is now on the decline.""As of Friday, 30 people previously diagnosed with MERS have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.The remaining 112 patients are in hospitals while 16 of them are currently in unstable condition, the ministry said.The country is also isolating people suspected of having the disease after coming in close contact with MERS patients.The number of people in isolation came to 5,930 as of Friday, down nearly 800 from the previous day, according to the ministry.However, the ministry noted the number could rise significantly as some 41,900 others may have been exposed to the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by visiting Samsung Medical Center since the hospital became affected by the potentially deadly disease.Also a MERS patient was found Thursday to have traveled to the country's southern resort island of Jeju prior to diagnosis but possibly after being infected with the MERS-CoV.Already, at least 22 people, including 14 cabin crewmembers of the patient's flight, have been ordered into isolation for possible infection.MERS is an infectious disease that is fairly new to humans.Since the first case in Saudi Arabia in 2012, some 1,100 cases had been reported globally before the outbreak here.In South Korea, the fatality rate of the disease currently is 14.5 percent, compared with over 40 percent tallied before the outbreak here.

Public health officials are also monitoring others who were in contact with the man, including nearby passengers on the airplane.Rajata said the man didn't have any symptoms while traveling on the plane, but began to have fatigue and difficulty breathing after he was admitted to a private hospital for treatment of his heart condition. People from the Middle East frequently come to Thailand for medical care.``We advise the public not to panic because the patient and his family members were separated since the beginning,'' Rajata said. ``Our system is ready and we are monitoring the cases closely.''Thanarath Phalipat, director of the Bureau of Epidemiology, said 59 people who were in contact with the patient have been identified so far by the ministry, including health personnel, hotel employees, passengers who sat two rows in front and behind the patient on the plane, and two taxi drivers.Middle East respiratory syndrome has killed 23 people and sickened more than 160 in the past month in South Korea, in the biggest outbreak outside the region where it was first seen in 2012. More than 6,700 people are isolated at home or in medical facilities there, according to South Korea's Health Ministry.

Early contact tracing was not sufficiently intense. The names of (affected) hospitals were initially not made public,” she told reporters during a press conference in Seoul. “Our current assessment is this. The government is now on a very firm footing. The response of health authorities has been exemplary. The response has been strengthened, quickly, systematically and significantly. Few other countries in the world can do this.” Fire fighters engage in an anti-infection campaign at a commnity center for senior citizens in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)However, more than 100 patients may have been exposed to MERS while receiving kidney dialysis -- a blood treatment for patients with kidney failure -- at a Seoul-based hospital from June 9-18, the Korean government said prior to Chan‘s meeting with the press on Thursday.Those with a chronic kidney disease are known to be the most vulnerable to the virus, which often triggers organ failure especially of the kidneys and lungs. As of Thursday afternoon, the virus had killed 23 people, infected 165 and pushed public health officials to quarantine 6,729 others. Almost a month after the first MERS case in Korea was confirmed on May 20, fears continue to spread with continuous reports of confirmed patients and deaths. The outbreak has also dramatically affected the everyday lives of Koreans, who have started to avoid crowded and public spaces including movie theaters and public transportation.According to the Health Ministry, the 165th confirmed patient had been receiving dialysis treatments regularly while showing MERS-like symptoms at Kyung Hee University Hospital in Gangdong district, southern Seoul, from June 9-18. The 79-year-old, who was officially diagnosed with MERS on Thursday, is believed to have been exposed to the virus on June 5, while staying in the same hospital with the nation’s 76th confirmed patient. “We are not exactly sure where the 165th patient contacted the 76th patient in the hospital,” said Jeong Eun-kyung from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry. “We are currently studying CCTV footage to find that out.”Another 110 patients with kidney conditions received dialysis treatments in the same room where the 165th patient received the regular therapy at the particular time period. “These are patients who are required to receive dialysis treatments regularly,” said Jeong from the CDC. “We are considering ways to isolate them while ensuring they have the access to necessary medical treatments.”Korea’s MERS fatality rate reached nearly 14 percent as of Thursday, the highest since the nation’s index case was confirmed last month. Heartbreaking stories have been reported as isolated family members could not stand by their spouse or parent’s deathbeds to say goodbye. Among the three deceased patients confirmed Thursday is the nation’s 82nd patient, who had lost her husband to MERS on June 3. The 83-year-old reportedly was infected by the 16th patient at Konyang University Hospital in Daejeon while nursing her husband, the 36th MERS patient who had been initially hospitalized at the same facility for chronic pneumonia and was later diagnosed with the deadly virus. It is the first case in Korea of a married couple both dying of the disease. On Tuesday, a 65-year-old MERS patient, who had been suffering from cerebral infarction prior to her MERS diagnosis, died in the intensive care unit at Eulji University Hospital in Daejeon, without being able to see her family members for the last time. As the medical facility banned visitors from entering the property to prevent possible infection, her family instead wrote letters to her to share their last words. The letters were read to her by the nursing staff five hours before her death.The Health Ministry also reported on Thursday that a newly confirmed MERS patient was found to have visited the country’s southernmost Jejudo Island prior to his diagnosis. Jejudo Island officials said they were notified by the central countermeasures headquarters Wednesday that the patient had toured around the island with eight companions including his wife, son and other family friends before returning to Seoul on June 8. The man returned work on June 9, but after he started showing symptoms of fever and coughing, he did not return to work the next couple days. He was first tested for MERS on June 12 and was later confirmed infected.The patient had reportedly accompanied his father for a regular checkup at Samsung Medical Center on May 27.The health authorities are monitoring those who came in close contact with the patient, but none have reported any symptoms so far.The outbreak has triggered many Koreans to avoid public spaces, as fears grow over community-transmitted infection. According to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the number of amusement park visitors in the first week of June decreased by 60 percent compared to the same period last year, while the number of moviegoers dropped by 54.9 percent.The number of Seoul residents using public transportation has decreased by 21.9 percent in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, sales of the online shopping mall of E-mart -- the largest retailer in Korea -- from June 1-11 increased by 63.1 percent from the same period last year.On Wednesday, the WHO had announced that it did not recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions to South Korea. It pointed out the Korean practice of seeking care at multiple hospitals, known as “doctor shopping,” as well as a lack of awareness among health care workers and general public about MERS as main factors contributing to the spread of the disease in the country. Dr. Chan of the WHO stressed that the public cooperation is critical in handling of the outbreak, and those who are quarantined should never leave his or her house against the guidelines. “When individuals do not follow the advisement and guidelines of the government, it is unfair to blame the government,” she said.

Jeong Jin-hoo from the minor Justice Party.The categories include its infection monitoring program, risk elements in case of an outbreak within the facility and adherence to infection-related regulations. ”The assessment on medical institutions is constituted by law to enhance the quality of services and protect patients’ well-being. Yet Samsung Medical Center, which got top grades, was neutralized so easily (by the MERS outbreak),” he said. Jeong added that the ministry’s assessment itself may have been just a formality.The hospital’s management of MERS outbreak was subject to further criticism Thursday when two members of the hospital’s medical staff were found to have been infected with MERS while not wearing Level D protective gear during their work at a ward exposed to the virus. Level D consists of coveralls or other work-type garments along with chemical-resistant footwear with steel toes and shanks, such as those worn by firefighters.Despite the government’s recommendation of Level D protective gear for those involved in the treatment of MERS, Samsung Medical Center only supplied the gear Wednesday. As a “radical measure,” the ministry plans to test all the hospital’s employees for the disease.The hospital’s infection control prowess had already been under fire after it was revealed last week that one of its ambulance workers worked for nine days despite showing MERS-like symptoms. The ambulance worker was ultimately confirmed of having MERS, but a subsequent probe showed that he had not been on the hospital’s watch list because he was employed under a subcontractor.

(Yonhap)The ministry said two of the three deceased, both in their 60s, had existing health conditions, including tuberculosis and high blood pressure, which were apparently worsened by MERS, eventually leading to their deaths.The other was an 82-year-old woman who was infected while tending to a patient at a hospital in Daejeon, 160 kilometers south of Seoul.Out of 23 MERS-related deaths, 91 percent, or 21, involved people with existing health problems or who were elderly, according to the ministry.Nearly 80 percent of the deceased were aged 60 years or older.The country also confirmed three new cases of the viral respiratory disease that brought the total number of people diagnosed with the disease to 165.The three new cases included two nurses at two local hospitals who helped treat MERS patients.So far, nearly all transmissions occurred at hospitals, a reason the government continues to claim there is no reason to fear the disease too much.In a statement released Wednesday, the World Health Organization, also noted there has been no community transmission of the disease in South Korea.The South Korean government belatedly began releasing the names of hospitals affected by MERS, which reached 84 as of Tuesday.However, an alarm was raised Thursday after one MERS patients was found to have traveled to the country's southern resort island of Jeju prior to diagnosis, but possibly after being infected with the potentially deadly disease.The health ministry said it was tracing all those who have come in close contact with the patient.Along with those diagnosed, 6,729 other people are currently in isolation for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients, according to the health ministry.Since the first case, 24 people diagnosed with the disease have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries, it added.Out of the 118 still in treatment, 17 were in serious condition as of Thursday, the ministry said.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is new to humans with the first case reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.The WHO has acknowledged there are ""still many gaps in knowledge regarding the transmission of this virus,"" also noting the current lack of vaccine or treatment for the disease may have contributed to the outbreak and spread of the disease in South Korea.

Only Saudi Arabia ― where MERS was first reported in 2012 ― is home to more cases than South Korea.”Our primary goal is to make sure that the MERS situation would subside by late June, and that the mass outbreak not occur outside the ‘intensively managed medical institutions,’” said Kwon Jun-wook, a senior Health Ministry official leading the MERS special response team. To date, 11 hospitals caring for most of the MERS patients have been designated as “intensively managed medical institutions,” on which the government’s anti-MERS efforts will be focused.The list of MERS-affected hospitals can be found on the home page of the Health Ministry, both in Korean and English.A hospital official in charge of measuring visitors' temperature wipes the sweat off his brow at the entrance of a hospital in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)”A sporadic outbreak of MERS is possible of course, but we are monitoring the patients ― especially patient No.137 ― to ensure that no more large-scale infections happen,” Kwon added. Patient No.137 refers to an ambulance worker at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul that worked for nine days and came in contact with over 200 people after showing MERS symptoms.In addition to causing further health concerns, the incident sparked public furor on the apparently poor monitoring of the outbreak by both the authorities and the hospital. The infections that have occurred in Samsung Medical Center alone reached 80 as of Wednesday, singlehandedly outnumbering the United Arab Emirates, the world’s No. 3 country in cases of MERS. In light of the rampant spread of MERS at one of country’s top hospitals, the ministry announced it will collect information related to everyone who visited Samsung Medical Center between June 2 and June 10, during which exposure to the virus could have occurred.The MERS response team also urged people who visited the MERS-affected hospitals to alert authorities to the fact. The government is currently running a 109 MERS hotline in 19 languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French and Vietnamese.Officials added that quarantined people who are unable to cater to needs of children, the elderly or physically challenged can ask for the government-provided services by dialing 129, the ministry’s call center. The government’s struggle to keep track of MERS is already behind the eight ball for not being able to determine when exactly a 35-year-old MERS patient from Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province had caught the virus. Identifying the exact location from which he had acquired the contagious disease is considered crucial to ruling out the possibility of the virus having already spread to the general public.Seongnam Metropolitan Government in the same province also revealed Wednesday that one of its confirmed patients ― a 50-year-old man ― was not put on the government’s MERS watch list despite visiting Samsung Medical Center’s emergency room. His mother, who visited the hospital with him, was put on the monitoring list.As of Wednesday, 6,508 people are quarantined for possible infection, having jumped by nearly 1,000 overnight. A total of 123 are receiving treatment, 17 of whom are in an unstable condition. Nineteen have made a full recovery and were discharged from their respective medical facilities.Of the newly affected, two were members of medical staff at hospitals in Seoul ― one at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong and the other from Samsung Medical Center, the source of 80 confirmed cases.The WHO reiterated that there was no evidence of sustained community transmission of the virus in Korea and that it does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions for the country. It urged vigilance, however, from other member states.“This outbreak is a wake-up call, and (demonstrates) that in a highly mobile world, all countries should always be prepared for the unanticipated possibility of outbreaks of this, and other serious infectious diseases.”The organization had convened an emergency meeting in Geneva the previous day to review the MERS outbreak, which garnered international attention due to its rapid spread and unanticipated traits.Based on findings from the Saudi Arabian situation, the MERS response team in Korea initially said infection could only occur when a person has been in a confined area within 2 meters of a MERS patient. But several cases have demonstrated that the infection can occur when a MERS patient is not in the vicinity.WHO Director-General Margaret Chan will visit Korea on Thursday and offer the organization’s evaluation of the MERS outbreak.Amid the MERS outbreak, other countries are keeping their eyes peeled for anyone who has been to Korea.A 25-year-old Czech man was recently quarantined and tested for MERS in his home country after showing fever and flu-like symptoms typical of the disease. The test showed that he did not have the virus, leaving the country MERS-free.The man ― who returned from Korea on May 30 ― had applied for medical services after suspecting MERS.

(Yonhap)The number of patients receiving treatment for MERS reached a new high since the outbreak at 124, 18 of whom are were in unstable condition. Two more were discharged from the hospital, the ministry said, bringing the fully recovered former MERS patients to 19.Of the newly affected, two were members of medical staff at hospitals in southern Seoul -- one at Kyung Hee University Hospital and the other from Samsung Medical Center, the source of 80 confirmed cases.South Korea has the second-highest number of MERS cases behind Saudi Arabia, where the disease was first reported in 2012. The World Health Organization convened an emergency meeting Tuesday to review the MERS situation in Korea, and to assess if a special countermeasure is required for the disease, such as revising the criteria for possible infection. Based on findings from the Saudi Arabian situation, the MERS response team in Korea initially said infection could only occur when a person has been in a confined area within 2 meters of a MERS patient. But several cases have demonstrated that the infection can occur when a MERS patient is not in the vicinity.In a press conference held Tuesday in Geneva, the WHO reiterated that the MERS outbreak in Korea had not yet spread to the general public and was being limited to within hospitals.WHO director general Margaret Chan will also visit Korea on Thursday and offer the organization’s evaluation on the MERS outbreak.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","eight more confirmed cases wednesday ,convened an emergency meeting tuesday ,reporting eight more confirmed cases ,an emergency meeting tuesday ,000 overnight to 508 wednesday","['South Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Kyung Hee University Hospital', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'South Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'the World Health Organization', 'Korea', 'saudi arabian', 'Korea', 'Geneva', 'who', 'Korea', 'Margaret Chan', 'Korea', 'Yoon Min - sik']",9,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.22373889  0.36509073

(Yonhap)The latest person to die from the disease also had an existing respiratory problem, as well as high blood pressure, prior to infection, a ministry official said.So far, 19 others who were diagnosed with MERS have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.Four of the eight new cases were again linked to the emergency room of Seoul's Samsung Medical Hospital, which has voluntarily shut down most of its operations after it was blamed for nearly half of all transmissions.As of Tuesday, 83 other hospitals have been affected by the disease, mostly by unknowingly treating a MERS patient or a carrier.Currently, 124 MERS patients remained in hospital care while 18 of them were in unstable conditions, according to the ministry.Some 6,500 others were in isolation as of Wednesday for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients. The number jumped from 5,586 on the previous day.MERS is a viral respiratory disease first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It has since been reported in some 20 other countries though nearly all cases have been linked to the Middle East, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The disease had a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent until the outbreak here. In South Korea, the fatality rate remains at around 12 percent.Amid a continued spread of the disease here, the World Health Organization convened a meeting of its emergency committee concerning MERS coronavirus in Geneva on Tuesday to review the outbreak here and see if it requires a special alarm for the rest of the world, known as public health emergency of international concern.The outcome of the meeting was expected later Wednesday.A joint response team of WHO officials and South Korean experts earlier pointed out the country's traditional culture of family members tending to their loved ones in hospitals as a major factor driving the spread of the disease here.Out of 162 people diagnosed with the disease here, 83 percent, or 134, are family members or friends of MERS patients, according to the health ministry.So far, nearly all infections occurred at hospitals with the only known exception involving an ambulance driver and a rescue worker who helped transport MERS patients.

Four additional patients were also confirmed, bringing the total number of cases to 154.One of the deceased, a 49-year-old man, marked the youngest MERS-related death in the country, according to the MERS special response team at the Health ministry. The other two, 58-year-old and 65-year-old men, had no underlying diseases.As of now, four of Korea’s 19 MERS-related deaths did not have preexisting conditions. The ministry did not comment on the specific details of their deaths, saying they needed to be reviewed by experts.Three of the four new MERS patients were infected at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, which is now the source of 75 infections.  (Yonhap)A potential Korean MERS patient in Slovakia reported earlier turned out to be a false alarm, the ministry said. The patient, in his 30s, tested negative, meaning Slovakia remains free of MERS.Seventeen patients have made full recoveries and have been discharged. Of the 118 still receiving treatment, 16 are in unstable condition. As of Tuesday morning, 5,586 people were quarantined for possible MERS infection.With the MERS outbreak in Korea entering its fifth week, the government has stepped up countermeasures. The Cabinet approved the use of reserve funds to cover medical expenses caused by MERS. The government will allocate 50.5 billion won ($45.2 million) for equipment and supplies, along with support for medical institutions and medical staff.Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea also vowed to provide an additional 6 billion won in subsidies for schools to cover MERS-related costs in a briefing held at the Seoul Government Complex. He added students missing classes due to MERS would not be penalized.Acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan warned officials of the possible “excessive” fears of MERS spreading among the public.“I urge all ministries to carry out their respective events as scheduled ― if possible ― and invite ministers and vice ministers to visit (MERS-affected) regions,” he said in a Cabinet meeting held early Tuesday. Local medical staff have even started turning to experimental measures to cure MERS, the Health Ministry said. Two medical institutions ― Seoul National University Hospital and Dankuk University Hospital ― have started convalescent plasma therapy using the blood of patients that recovered from the disease. There has not been a clinical trial on such treatments for MERS coronavirus, so it is not clear whether the treatment is beneficial or harmful overall. Health authorities said this was being used in the absence of any known treatments for MERS.With tertiary infections already having been reported, preventing the outbreak from turning into an epidemic remains among the government’s biggest concerns. Saturday, an ambulance worker at Samsung Medical Center was found to have worked for nine days after showing MERS symptoms. During the time, he came in contact with roughly 200 patients and medical staff, sparking more doubts about the hospital’s ability to handle contagious diseases.Last week, a policeman from Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province was confirmed as a MERS patient, but authorities have yet to figure out exactly how and when he caught the virus.Monday, the government’s MERS response team said the possibility of him having been infected at a hospital was low, sparking concerns that the virus is already spreading among the general public.“The reason we said he was unlikely to have been infected at a hospital was because we needed to conduct further analysis on his movements. We did not conclude that it has spread to the general public. It is still possible that he may have been infected at a hospital, which is what we’re trying to find out,” said Jeong Eun-gyeong, an official from the MERS response team.Upgrading the alert level from the current “caution” ― the second-lowest of a four-phase alert system for national crises ― is not being considered as of now, although authorities did not rule out the possibility.“If there is a possibility of rapid nationwide infection, as in the case of swine flu, and the (MERS) virus is spread to the general public, I think we have to upgrade the status. But as of now, we are not discussing the upgrade on the basis of further proliferation of MERS,” said Kwon Deok-cheol, the general director of the response team.Margaret Chan, the director-general of WHO, will visit Korea on Thursday and offer the organization’s evaluation on the MERS outbreak, the Health Ministry said. She will also offer suggestions on the MERS situation to the government.

(Yonhap)One of the deceased was a 49-year-old patient who became the youngest person here to die from the viral respiratory illness, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.Medical experts had maintained the disease was mostly critical to the elderly and those with existing health problems.However, the latest fatalities included two people who had no known medical conditions prior to their diagnosis. So far, four out of the 19 who died from MERS had no medical issues before they were infected with MERS.Three of the four new patients were infected while visiting Seoul's Samsung Medical Center, which has been a major source of infections, according to the health ministry.The hospital, run by the country's largest conglomerate Samsung Group, has voluntarily shut down most of its operations until June 24, at the earliest.At least three other hospitals, including Seoul's Boramae Medical Center and the Korea Cancer Center Hospital, have temporarily shut down their emergency rooms, which is where most transmissions occurred after they had unknowingly treated MERS patients or carriers.Out of 154 people diagnosed with the disease so far, 17 have been discharged following complete recoveries as of Tuesday, the ministry said.Some 5,580 others are currently in isolation for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients.A ministry official said up to 30 foreign visitors were also subject to mandatory quarantine and isolation, but some of them have already left the country.The Seoul government is imposing a temporary exit ban on all people, including foreigners, subject to quarantine for MERS, but some have apparently slipped away before they were told to stay in isolation.Those who have left the country despite being subject to quarantine included two Japanese tourists who returned home Monday, shortly before they were determined suspected cases, according to the official.MERS is a viral disease that is fairly new to humans with its first outbreak reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Partly due to the short history of the disease, there currently exists no vaccine or treatment.Some 1,100 cases had been reported globally prior the outbreak here, while the disease carried a very high fatality rate of ove 40 percent. In South Korea, the fatality rate remains at around 12 percent as of Tuesday.The disease is also beginning to take a toll on the South Korean economy as people have become more concerned and afraid, apparently refusing to visit hospitals or other public places, such as markets and restaurants, if possible.Earlier reports said both online orders and their value for the country's three major discount outlet chains have jumped by two-digit figures since the outbreak of MERS was confirmed on May 20.To help businesses and hospitals affected by MERS, the government has promised to provide more than 400 billion won ($358 million) in emergency relief funds.On Tuesday, the Cabinet approved the use of 50.5 billion won from the government reserve to help eliminate the disease.The money is earmarked for special equipment and other materials needed to fight the disease, as well as support for medical personnel and emergency service workers, the finance ministry said.In an apparent appeal to people to avoid what the government has called ""groundless fears,"" President Park Geun-hye took a special trip to an elementary school in Gangnam district, which, along with all other elementary schools in Gangnam and nearby Seocho district, had been closed until the start of this week.""The daily lives of people and businesses must return to normal. I hope schools that are currently closed will also return to their normal schedules while intensifying their preventive measures,"" she said in a meeting with her top aides on Monday, according to the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae.As of Monday, 475 schools were temporarily closed throughout the country. The number had reached over 2,600 last week.

Of the new cases, a nurse was found to have been infected while performing CPR on a MERS-infected patient at Konyang University Hospital. The Prime Minister’s Office said the special inspection team composed of 13 quarantine officials will supervise and monitor quarantine measures at Samsung Medical Center.The decision came a day after Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon called on the government to take charge of the hospital that has seen more than 70 people catch the virus, including three doctors, after the 14th confirmed patient visited the hospital late last month.The special inspection team will also support the epidemiological investigations which are being conducted at the hospital, officials said. Since Sunday, Samsung Medical Center has suspended operations, stopped receiving outpatients and restricted the visitors of hospitalized patients in an attempt to prevent the virus from further spreading. The partial closure measures will be effective until June 24. Employees of Konkuk University Medical Center in Seoul check visitors for potential fever on Monday after the hospital confirmed its first MERS patient. (Yonhap)After the hospital’s announcement, about 5,300 patients who had been either hospitalized or made appointments at Samsung Medical Center started their “exodus” to other hospitals. Numerous calls have been made to other large hospitals to see if appointments are available, medical facilities said. In order to ensure the safety of the original patients, some neighboring hospitals vowed to take health screening measures on the incoming patients.“Because we have set the rule that those from Samsung Medical Center will receive treatment under isolation, the number of patients we can accommodate will be limited,” said an official from Gangnam Severance Hospital in Seoul. Those having serious illnesses or anticancer treatment will be allowed to stay in Samsung Medical Center, medical staff said.Earlier in the day, President Park Geun-hye pledged to build a stronger governmental response agency for containing contagious diseases. “(The government) will institutionalize the disease response team so that it can work permanently as a key agency against contagious illnesses,” Park said. So far, 17 percent of the MERS patients in Korea have been found to be medical staff at the MERS-hit hospitals, the Health and Welfare Ministry said. Of the total patients, about half were exposed to the virus as patients receiving other treatments in the medical facilities. The remaining were family members of the patients, it added. Among the medical staff, nine were nurses, followed by seven caregivers and four doctors. Six emergency workers also caught the virus. Of the total MERS patients, men accounted for 61 percent. By age, those in their 50s took up 21 percent, followed by those in their 60s and 40s with 19 percent each. Of the death toll, those in their 70s accounted for the most with 44 percent, followed by those in their 60s with 31 percent. Nearly 90 percent of the dead had chronic respiratory diseases or cardio-cerebrovascular problems, officials said.Meanwhile, some hospitals have voluntarily shut down the facilities over MERS concerns. SMG-SNU Boramae Hospital in the capital temporarily closed the facility for a half day and conducted disinfections measures. It was found that the 137th confirmed patient, the emergency worker who transferred a number of MERS patients to the hospital, stayed in the emergency room for more than an hour earlier this month. The hospital officials immediately isolated a dozen medical staff members who had come into contact with the emergency worker.Public fears escalated after it was confirmed Sunday that the 137th patient continued to work as usual for nine days despite showing some symptoms. Korea Cancer Center Hospital in northern Seoul also shut down after a Samsung Medical Center patient visited the facility.Although the visitor was not a MERS-confirmed patient, KCCH temporarily closed as part of its preventive measures, the medical officials said, citing the large number of cancer patients with low immunity level. The reopening date has not been decided, they said. Currently, more than 5,200 individuals are under monitoring, the health authorities said.

Meanwhile, the death toll across the country reached 15 and the number of those infected 145. Hospital officials said they would stop receiving outpatients, suspend operations and restrict the visitors of hospitalized patients until June 24 as part of its efforts to contain the virus. As of Sunday afternoon, 19 new cases were reported, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Of them, 11 occurred at Samsung Medical Center, putting the total number of MERS patients from the hospital at 72.The hospital’s move to temporarily close came after the authorities confirmed that an emergency worker who transferred patients to the hospital was infected with MERS. The 55-year-old was suspected of having been infected by the 14th patient, who is considered the “super spreader” for spreading the virus to more than 70 people.  Officials disinfect a cafeteria of a school in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. (Yonhap)Health authorities also found that the ambulance worker came into contact with over 400 people in nine days, despite having some symptoms, and immediately isolated 160 people who came in close contact with him. Others are being tracked, the officials said. They said the worker was also found to have worn a mask only and did not wear protective gloves while transferring the patients.Although he had come into contact with the 14th patient, he was not put on the monitoring list, the authorities added, saying that the watch list was limited to those working inside the emergency room.Meanwhile, another doctor at Samsung Medical Center was confirmed infected, after being exposed to the 14th patient late last month. He became the second medical professional of the hospital to be infected with the virus after the 35th patient. Despite the exposure to the “super spreader,” the new infected doctor was not isolated and continued his work at the hospital, the ministry said.The doctor has been isolated since Wednesday, when he showed a fever. The ministry is attempting to track those who were exposed by the doctor. As MERS fear continued to persist, President Park Geun-hye visited Seoul National Hospital University on Sunday in a bid to pacify the public concerns. Park had originally planned to leave for the U.S. on Sunday for a summit with President Barack Obama, but postponed it due to the MERS crisis. “The medical staff gives hope to patients. There must be lots of challenges, but please put in the utmost efforts for the public,” Park told the doctors. “As you all dedicate your efforts, the number of fully recovered patients is also rising, which I believe is good evidence that (the country) can overcome the disease.” Five patients are currently receiving treatment at the hospital, with one cured, medical staff said.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization warned that Korea may have ready itself for a drawn-out battle against the disease spreading.“Because the outbreak has been large and is complex, more cases can be expected,” said Keiji Fukuda, the WHO’s assistant director-general for heath security at a news conference Saturday.A group of WHO officials conducted a five-day on-site review with Seoul officials over the MERS crisis starting June 9. The agency pointed out that the lack of information flow and failure at first response contributed to the worsening of the disease outbreak. “One of the things South Korea failed to do was a transparent and rapid distribution of information, which is the most important thing to do,” said Lee Jong-koo, who headed the Korean side of the joint team. “The failure to establish the governance in controlling the crisis in the early stages also caused public confusion.” The Korean culture of “doctor shopping” and having patients and visitors at overcrowded emergency rooms also affected the rapid rise in the number of victims, the mission said. It also added there was no indication of any mutation of the virus here.No evidence was found to indicate there is an ongoing transmission in the community, officials added.As part of the efforts to better treat the patients, the Korean health authorities have tried injecting the blood plasma of a soldier who fully recovered from MERS to two other patients. Injecting blood plasma, which provides antibodies against the virus, is considered a traditional treatment to cure contagious diseases. The two patients ― the Samsung doctor and a police officer ― however, have shown little improvement, officials said. Despite being relatively young in age, in their 30s, both have been in critical condition as they may have experienced a “cytokine cascade” before receiving the blood plasma, they added. Cytokine cascade refers to the immune reaction of overly releasing cytokine proteins working against the virus in the body. Of the confirmed patients, a total of 16 patients are currently in critical condition and more than 4,800 individuals are being monitored, the authorities said.The first confirmed patient in Busan died Sunday afternoon after suffering from pneumonia and difficulty in breathing, the ministry said. The 61-year-old female had been under quarantine treatment for eight days after she caught the virus at Samsung Medical Center. She did not have any chronic diseases, but had shown a low level of immunity, city officials said.

A 61-year-old man died on Sunday afternoon while receiving treatment at a hospital in the southern port city of Busan, according to a city official.  (Yonhap)The latest victim is believed to have come down with the virus after visiting a relative at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, who had been sharing the same hospital ward with a MERS patient at the time.Busan city officials said the man did not have any other special health conditions, aside from having weak liver function. The latest fatality has pushed up the number of MERS-related deaths to 15 since the respiratory illness was first confirmed in the country on May 20.Of the seven new patients confirmed earlier on Sunday, four were infected while visiting or being treated at Samsung Medical Center, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry.The hospital has been identified as a major source of infection as nearly half of those diagnosed with the respiratory illness are believed to have been infected while visiting the hospital in the capital.On late Saturday, the hospital announced its decision to partially shut down its operations. A hospital official later said the temporary shutdown will be effective at least until June 24.Following a mass number of infections at the Seoul hospital, some hospitals reportedly have refused to treat or accept patients who have been to Samsung Medical Center.Health ministry officials said refusing to provide treatment to those who have been to Samsung hospital may be punishable under the medical law that prohibits unauthorized rejections to treat those in need of medical attention.Out of the seven new cases, two were believed to have been infected at two different hospitals while one is believed to have caught the disease while accompanying a MERS patient in an ambulance.The government had maintained all transmissions had occurred at hospitals that had housed a MERS patient, mostly unknowingly.This had given some assurance that people outside of hospitals may still be safe from the potentially deadly disease.Ministry officials noted, however, that no longer may be the case after an ambulance driver who had transported two MERS patients last week was diagnosed Saturday.The World Health Organization also warned the country to brace for a drawn-out battle against MERS.""Because the outbreak has been large and is complex, more cases should be anticipated,"" Keiji Fukuda, an assistant director-general of WHO, told a press conference on Saturday.The WHO official had led a joint response team of WHO and South Korean officials to identify the source and factors driving the outbreak here. The team's four-day investigation came to an end Friday.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, some 1,100 cases had been confirmed throughout the world until the outbreak here was confirmed on May 20.Some 4,850 people were in isolation as of Sunday for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients, according to the ministry.Out of those diagnosed, 10 have been released from the hospital following complete recoveries with another patient expected to be discharged later in the day, ministry officials said.What the government has labeled groundless fears against MERS were apparently taking a toll on the local economy as many people were beginning to avoid visiting not only hospitals but any public places.The Finance Ministry earlier said it will provide up to 400 billion won ($358 million) in emergency relief funds to businesses, including hospitals, and communities affected by MERS.On Sunday, the ministry said it will form a special task force to check the economic impact of MERS on a daily basis and come up with countermeasures.

WHO and South Korean health authorities have conducted a joint mission to review the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the largest outside Saudi Arabia.Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general of health security, and Lee Jong-koo, head of the Center for Global Medicine, at Seoul National University, speak at a press conference on the results of their joint study about the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Korea in the administrative town of Sejong, some 130 kilometers south of Seoul.The outbreak in South Korea has been spreading at an unusually fast pace, with 138 confirmed infections as of Saturday, with the country's first case diagnosed on May 20.South Korea on Saturday reported the 14th death from the disease and 12 new cases, including that of an ambulance driver who transported a patient infected with the deadly virus.""Now the outbreak has been large and is complex, more cases should be anticipated"", WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Security Keiji Fukuda told journalists.""And because of this, the government should remain vigilant and should continue its intensified disease surveillance and prevention measures until the outbreak is clearly over"".But he praised South Korean authorities for their strong tracing, monitoring and quarantine measures, backed by expanded laboratory diagnostic testing. Fukuda said there was a ""great deal of anxiety"" among Koreans over the outbreak, particularly over whether the virus has mutated to make human-to-human transmission easier.""Based on available sequencing studies of the genetics of the virus, we do not see any changes that appear to have made the virus itself more transmissible"", Fukuda said.The outbreak is showing epidemiological patterns similar to the one occurring in hospitals in the Middle East, he said.At present, the mission has found no evidence to indicate that there are ongoing transmissions of the virus in communities outside hospitals in South Korea, he added. The joint mission has identified some reasons to explain why the virus has infected a ""large number of people in a relatively short period of time"" in this country, Fukuda said. The virus was unfamiliar to most Koreans, making doctors less likely to suspect the MERS virus as a potential cause of infection when diagnosing respiratory illnesses.""Infection prevention and control measures were not optimal"" in some hospitals, with overcrowded emergency rooms and many patients sharing a single hospital room, thus creating an environment for the virus to spread easily, he said.South Koreans' habit of ""doctor shopping"" -- seeking care at many different medical facilities -- and the custom of having many friends and family members visit hospitalised patients may have contributed to the secondary spread of the infection, he added.He recommended the continued enforcement of basic public health measures to stop further cases from spreading and urged infected people or those who have had contact with them not to travel.The Health Ministry said on Saturday all the 14 killed by the virus had pre-existing health conditions, with the most recent fatality suffering from hypertension and hypothyroidism.The latest fatality was a 68-year-old woman who contracted the virus at a hospital in Pyeongtaek City, 65 kilometres (40 miles) south of Seoul.The new confirmed cases included an ambulance driver who fell ill after transporting a 75-year-old infected woman to Samsung Medical Centre in southern Seoul on June 7, where she died three days later.Out of 133 people whose contact with infected patients have been traced, the largest single group of 60 contracted the disease at Samsung Medical Centre, one of the largest hospitals in Seoul. Five other cases are being investigated to find out how and where the patients were infected. The first infected patient in South Korea was diagnosed on May 20 after a trip to Saudi Arabia.The 68-year-old man visited four medical facilities, infecting other patients and medics, before he was finally diagnosed.

She suffered from severe pneumonia, acute renal failure and multiple organ failures. She died at 11:50 a.m.Fear of an epidemic grew across the country as authorities remained uncertain about where a 36-year-old policeman ― confirmed as a MERS patient Thursday ― had caught the virus. They said there was a possibility he caught the virus from Korea’s 52nd MERS patient while visiting Pyeongtaek Bagae Hospital on May 31. But the authorities’ speculation was rebuffed later by the hospital, which said that patient No. 52 and the policeman never crossed paths at the hospital. The hospital surveillance records showed that the former had visited the hospital 17 minutes after the policeman left the facility. Experts are raising the possibility of the virus having been already released among the general public, with the policeman having been infected via some other unknown source. As of Friday afternoon, the authorities have said all infections occurred within hospital walls.A medical staff member wipes the sweat off her brow during a break after treating patients placed in quarantine at Daecheong Hospital in Daejeon on Friday. (Yonhap)The patient had originally been quarantined on June 2 after being identified as a suspected case. He was released from the hospital on June 4, but was readmitted to another hospital on June 5 after showing MERS symptoms. If the authorities are right about the policeman being infected on May 31, it means he roamed through the general public for at least a full day. “We cannot rule out the possibility of MERS being spread to the general public,” said Lee Jae-gap, an infectious disease expert at the Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital. But Lee, a civilian expert who is part of the government’s response team, said the possibility of a wide-scale infection remains slim. The special response team also confirmed four more MERS cases, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 126.Three of the newly infected patients appear to have caught the virus at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, while another patient ― a 70-year-old woman ― appears to have been infected at Pyeongtaek Goodmorning Hospital, according to the MERS special response team at the Health Ministry.As of Thursday, 3,680 people were quarantined for possible infection. With the country struggling with the MERS scare, the country’s top officials made moves to alleviate the nationwide tension. President Park Geun-hye visited the headquarters of the MERS response team in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province to inspect the progress of its efforts to contain the outbreak and provide moral support for the officials. The move came two days after Park postponed her planned visit to the U.S. in light of public concern over MERS.In a meeting with foreign diplomats and business leaders in Seoul, Acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan also said the country was fully capable of containing the MERS outbreak. He asked the diplomats to relay Korea’s effort to contain the outbreak to their respective countries, as to prevent “excessive reaction or preemptive measures” by them.Seoul‘s top educator also said he would lift the shutdown order on kindergartens and elementary schools in Gangnam and Seocho districts and give school principals authority to decide whether to suspend classes or not.Cho Hi-yeon, superintendent of Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, said the decision came as parents appeared less anxious about MERS. In the face of parents’ demands, Cho ordered the suspension of classes in the two districts in southern Seoul after it was revealed that a MERS-infected doctor spent four days in the area before being quarantined.

She had been in a coma for the past five days, according to ministry officials.  The total number of people diagnosed with the potentially deadly disease came to 126 as the country reported an additional four cases.  The four new patients were infected while visiting hospitals affected by MERS.  All 126 confirmed cases so far have occurred in hospitals, meaning the disease has not infiltrated into the daily lives of people, the ministry said.  Still, over 3,800 people were in isolation as of Thursday for possible infection after coming in close contact with a MERS patient or visiting one of the hospitals affected by the viral respiratory illness.  The number, however, dropped to 3,680 on Friday, marking the first drop since the outbreak was initially confirmed on May 20.  The fall came as a growing number of people previously isolated for possible infection are being released after testing negative for MERS or developing no symptoms over the maximum incubation period of 14 days, according to ministry officials.  As of Friday, 1,249 people have been released from isolation.  The officials said the drop may also be a sign that the spread of the disease is now on the wane.  They said the upcoming weekend may become a turning point in the battle against MERS as the rise in the number of newly infected people has also slowed to four on Friday from 14 on the previous day.  South Korea's Acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan sought to keep the foreign community here calm and well-informed.  ""Taking into account South Korea's advanced medical service sector and high level of expertise of its health professions, there is no doubt that the current MERS situation will be contained,"" he said in a meeting with foreign diplomats and business leaders in Seoul.  Signs that the outbreak is being brought under control include the lifting of a mandatory shutdown on schools in two affluent districts of Seoul.  The order for a temporary shutdown was issued at the start of this week after a MERS-infected doctor was found to have crisscrossed the two -- Seocho and Gangnam -- districts before his diagnosis.  The order had affected 69 kindergartens and 57 elementary schools.  Starting next week, the schools' own principals will be allowed to decide whether to cancel classes, Seoul's Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon said.  The move apparently came as hospitals have been identified as the only source of infection so far. The government has been updating daily a list of hospitals and clinics affected by MERS, which was at 55 facilities as of Thursday.  To help small and medium-sized hospitals suffering from a shutdown or loss of patients, the government said it will provide emergency relief funds.  The government earlier said it will provide up to 400 billion won ($360 million) in such funds for businesses and communities affected by MERS.  MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans with the first case reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Some 1,100 cases have since been reported in about 20 countries, mostly in and around the Middle East.

He had also been suffering from late-stage cancer.As of Thursday, 3,680 have been quarantined for possible infection. Of the 14 new patients, eight were infected at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul ― now the nation’s most severely hit hospital with 55 patients ― while another caught the virus at Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital.Authorities, however, have yet to determine where five of the patients contracted the virus.Students attending medical departments at Konyang University in Daejeon write messages of support for medical staff across the country battling the recent MERS outbreak. (Yonhap)Of particular concern was the case of a 35-year-old policeman who was initially released after he tested negative for MERS on June 3. He was readmitted on June 5 after his conditions worsened, and a retest Tuesday finally confirmed that he had the disease. His case raised the possibility that MERS has been exposed to the general public, depending on when he caught the virus. According to the health authorities and Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency, he roamed around Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and South Chungcheong Province since May 31, when he first started showing symptoms. Just a day before he was readmitted, he used public transportation to travel from Seoul to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. As of now, all infections are thought to have occurred within hospital walls, according to the government. If he caught the virus outside the hospital, it will be the first such case in Korea. Another patient whose infection route was unconfirmed was a 77-year-old outpatient of Samsung Medical Center. All other patients at the hospital who had caught the virus did so while staying in an emergency room, which sparked concern of an unprecedented airborne infection of MERS.But health authorities and experts said there was “no possibility” of the virus being transmitted via air, saying a lot more people would have been infected if that were the case.“About 8,000 outpatients visit the Samsung Medical Center every day. If MERS was transmittable by air, at least 400 would have been infected,” said professor Eom Joong-sik, a bacteriologist with the government’s MERS special response team. “If airborne infection was possible, families would be the most likely victims. But data implies that the likelihood of family infection ranges from five to 10 percent,” he said.Also, among the newly confirmed were a 39-year-old pregnant woman who was initially reported as the country’s first pregnant patient, but tested negative in the second test. Kwon Deok-cheol of the special response team said she is stable as of now, and the ministry would provide support for her labor.No deaths from the disease were reported Thursday, though 13 patients are in unstable condition, he added.The MERS outbreak is expected to peak around Saturday and start to gradually decline afterward, said Yang Byung-kook, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a briefing to the National Assembly, Yang said there is a possibility three patients ― including one who has died ― may have sparked a large-scale outbreak like one at Samsung Medical Center. After being infected at the Samsung medical Center, they visited several hospitals in Seoul, Daejeon and Changwon in South Gyeongsang Province. With the MERS scare sweeping the country, people are using less public transportation than before to avoid being in contact with a large number of people. According to the Korea Railroad Corporation, 1.91 million people used the railroads in early June, marking a 12 percent drop from the year before.To date, nine people have died in Korea from MERS, which is known to particularly affect those with preexisting conditions.

He was readmitted on June 5 after his conditions worsened, and a re-test on Tuesday finally confirmed that he had the disease. His case raises the possibility of the MERS being exposed to the general public depending on when he caught the virus.

Some 1,100 cases have since been reported in about 20 countries, mostly in and around the Middle East.  The disease had a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent before the outbreak here.  In South Korea, the fatality rate of the disease has remained below 10 percent.  To help prevent the disease from spreading further, the government is isolating all MERS patients and those who have come in close contact with them.  As of Thursday, the number of people in isolation reached 3,805, up from 3,439 the previous day.  So far, four people previously diagnosed with the viral disease have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.  The government is also daily updating the list of hospitals affected by MERS, meaning they either have been identified as a source of infection or a person diagnosed with the disease has visited them.  The number of MERS-affected hospitals reached 55 as of Thursday, up from 29 on Monday.  The ministry said it will also release a list of those unaffected by the disease, a move aimed at allowing the people who need medical attention to visit hospitals that are safe from MERS.

The former had a history of liver cancer and liver cirrhosis while the latter had been suffering from multiple myeloma.MERS is thought to particularly affect those with preexisting medical conditions. All MERS-related deaths in Korea to date have been patients aged over 55. Of the 13 new infections, 10 were at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, now one of the nation’s two hardest hit medical facilities in the MERS outbreak. As of Wednesday, 29 hospitals were affected by the disease.A medical professional tends to a patient infected with MERS at an isolated ward at Seoul Medical Center on Wednesday. (Yonhap)As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of people quarantined for possible infection rose to 3,439. Another 229 are waiting on their test results, including a pregnant woman who was initially reported to be the nation’s first pregnant MERS patient, but tested negative in the second test.According to authorities, 11 patients are in unstable condition, including a doctor from Samsung Medical Center who requires breathing assistance.Four people have fully recovered from the disease, including a 25-year-old woman who was released from the hospital Wednesday. In a public statement, acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the government has designated medical institutions in each municipality for intensive treatment of MERS. The 16 institutions include Boramae medical center in Seoul, Chungnam National University Hospital in Daejeon and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province.The government also designated 32 separate hospitals to treat suspected MERS patients. Choi advised people to refrain from visiting hospitals, as all infections to date have occurred at hospitals. Health authorities reiterated that the possibility of an epidemic was slim, saying that confirmed patients have not come into contact with the general public. But with many in the public questioning the effectiveness of government measures and the number of cases climbing, the MERS scare showed little signs of slowing down. To date, 1,547 educational institutes in Korea have canceled classes. The Seoul education office extended the cancellation of classes for the MERS-stricken Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu regions and strongly advised schools in Gangdong-gu and Songpa-gu to suspend classes as well.Speculations by the health authorities also turned slightly grimmer Wednesday. The MERS special response team Tuesday had speculated that the outbreak would start to gradually decrease. But in Wednesday’s briefing, it said more cases may emerge for the next two or three days. As part of its effort to rein in MERS, the government turned to more drastic measures. It conducted an inspection on all patients diagnosed with pneumonia in over 3,000 medical institutions across the country, as part of the “preemptive” measures against MERS.Patients subject to inspection were banned from leaving the hospitals.The wide-scale inspection was in response to calls made by the Korea Society of Infectious Diseases, which suspected that MERS patients being wrongly diagnosed with pneumonia had led to the disease’s rapid spread. As MERS symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia, many patients were initially labeled as pneumonia patients and not quarantined, including the nation’s first MERS patient. This appears to have subsequently led to the large-scale infection within the hospital.A joint team of officials from the government and the World Health Organization were conducting an investigation to determine the reason for the infection’s rapid spread in such a short time. The first patient was diagnosed on May 20. “The evidence presented thus far suggests that the pattern of the outbreak in the Republic of Korea may be similar to MERS outbreaks that have taken place in health care facilities in the Middle East. However, the situation is rapidly evolving and investigations are ongoing,” the joint team said in its message to the Korean public.Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO, suspected that South Korea’s culture of taking care of family members’ illnesses may have contributed to the rapid spreading of the disease.But the joint team advised authorities to reopen schools, as they are not linked to the transmission of MERS. The government’s concern is now on preventing massive infections from reoccurring after Samsung Medical Center and Pyeongtaek St. Mary’s Hospital each reported 37 cases.“As of now, all MERS infections occurred via close contact. We are closely monitoring to ensure that we do not lose track of anyone who has had close contact with a MERS patient,” said Kwon Deok-cheol from the MERS special response team. South Korea is second only to Saudi Arabia ― where the illness was first reported in 2012 and which hosts over 90 percent of total confirmed cases ― in the number of MERS cases. As such, other countries have stepped up monitoring tourists from Korea.Hong Kong’s health authorities reported Wednesday that 16 tourists from Korea have been quarantined and tested for MERS since Monday.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","diagnosed with pneumonia in over ,infections from reoccurring after samsung ,wednesday 29 hospitals were affected ,the 13 new infections 10 ,all patients diagnosed with pneumonia","['South Koreans', 'the Health Ministry ’s', 'Korea', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Medical Center', 'Yonhap)As', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Seoul', 'Chungnam National University Hospital', 'Daejeon', 'Seoul National University Bundang Hospital', 'Bundang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Choi', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam - gu and', 'the Korea Society of Infectious Diseases', 'the World Health Organization', 'the Republic of Korea', 'korean', 'Margaret Chan', 'WHO', 'South Korea ’s', 'Samsung Medical Center and Pyeongtaek St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'Kwon Deok - cheol', 'South Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Korea', 'Hong Kong ’s', 'Korea', 'Yoon Min - sik']",9,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.35698566  0.24409144

The disease had a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent before the outbreak in South Korea, according to the health ministry.  The latest MERS-related deaths here put the fatality rate of the disease in South Korea at around 8 percent.  A joint team of officials from the Seoul government and the World Health Organization is currently trying to find out what factors are fueling the outbreak here. MERS has been spreading unusually fast and wide in South Korea compared to previous cases.  Until the outbreak in South Korea, only some 1,100 cases of infections had been reported globally with over 90 percent of the total confirmed in Saudi Arabia.  Noting the spread of infections has nothing to do with schools, the WHO team advised the country to reopen schools closed as a precautionary measure.  ""All transmissions have been limited to hospitals so far and all evidence points to a similarity between South Korea and the Middle East,"" the team said.  The team's advice comes as more than 1,800 kindergartens and schools have been temporarily shut down, some since last week.  The joint investigation of WHO officials and South Korean experts is expected to announce the outcome of their study Saturday.  In addition to its efforts to quickly eliminate the disease, the government was also struggling to prevent the disease from putting a dent in the local economy.  In an earlier meeting with economy-related ministers, Acting Prime Minister Choi said the government plans to provide more than 400 billion won ($356 million) in emergency relief funds to areas and businesses affected by the disease.  Choi, who is also the finance minister, said the government will also provide emergency funds to MERS patients and those in isolation for possible infection while also paying for their cost of diagnosis and treatment.  ""The government will mobilize all its power and resources as if it were trying to eliminate the disease this very week,"" he told the meeting, according to the finance ministry.

This has raised questions about the government’s lack of safety measures for those who are most vulnerable to the virus, especially the elderly with pre-existing health conditions such as lung or kidney disease. As of Tuesday afternoon, the virus had killed seven people, infected 95 ― including a pregnant woman and a teenager ― and pushed public health officials to quarantine almost 3,000 others.Also on Tuesday, 10 Koreans who had been quarantined in Hong Kong and China since May 26 were released. They had been isolated after taking the same flight with Korea’s 10th confirmed MERS patient from Incheon to Hong Kong on May 26. They never showed symptoms during the incubation period and are currently healthy, said the Healthy Ministry. The 10th patient, however, still requires additional treatment in China, authorities said. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director general for health security at WHO, meets with officials of the Health Ministry. (Yonhap)As the number of infected patients continued to soar against hopes that the virus will start to abate this week, the 16-member joint mission team from the Korean government and World Health Organization started its investigation Tuesday. “I want to thank the government (of Korea) for being very active in inviting WHO to come and work with your experts,” said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director general for health security at WHO.“We know when new outbreaks of new viruses appear in any country it often causes tremendous amounts of difficulties. So we again congratulate the government for making such strong efforts to deal with the situation.”With the newly confirmed cases, three more facilities, including one of the biggest hospitals in the country, have been reported as MERS-affected hospitals. Health authorities also confirmed that the 94th patient, who was diagnosed on Tuesday, left the Hallym University Medical Center in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, on May 28, and moved to a residential medical facility for senior citizens. It is believed that the 71-year-old was exposed to the virus on May 27, when the 15th patient stayed at the same hospital. The 15th patient was diagnosed with MERS on May 29, a day after the 94th patient had already left the hospital, so the authorities weren’t aware of the possibility of infection for the 95th patient. He was eventually discovered by the Health Ministry and was quarantined at another facility. At the time of being quarantined, he had been asymptomatic, said Jeong Eun-kyung, an official from the Health Ministry. Jeong didn’t reveal the name of the residential facility for the elderly. Concerns have been rising about the government’s lack of protective measures for the most vulnerable, especially the elderly with pre-existing health conditions. When asked Monday if the Centers for Disease Prevention had any additional plans to help the elderly avoid the virus, Jeong from the agency said it is “unclear whether those who died of MERS in fact died because of the virus or because of their pre-existing medical conditions.”All of the seven deceased were aged 50 or older, and had been suffering from other diseases prior to their MERS diagnosis, including cancer, kidney and lung conditions.“I don’t think much is being done to protect those who are vulnerable,” said a Seoul-based doctor who wanted to remain anonymous. “I think there should be a special task force team just to prevent the spread of the virus among the elderly, pregnant women, and those with fragile health conditions. They are the ones who need the attention and extra care the most, who need safe access to health services the most.”Seoul also confirmed the first MERS case of a pregnant woman Tuesday. The woman in her 40s appeared to have been infected with the virus while briefly staying at an emergency room at the Samsung Medical Center, where the 14th confirmed patient was staying.The woman is due to give birth this month and was staying in the hospital’s maternity ward.However, health officials said the number of new cases may begin to dwindle this week. This week is very crucial to combat the disease,“ acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said in a meeting with officials over the spread of the virus.“We will mobilize all available resources and required budget to help tackle the disease as soon as possible.” Another newly confirmed patient on Tuesday is a 27-year-old who was infected by the sixth patient while staying at the emergency room of the Asan Medical Center, one of the largest hospitals in the country, in Seoul on May 26. The sixth patient, who was diagnosed on May 28, died on June 1.The seventh MERS death was confirmed Tuesday morning. The deceased was diagnosed with the virus on June 6. The 68-year-old had a chronic heart disease and was admitted to the Samsung Medical Center’s emergency room for dyspnea on May 27, where she was exposed to the 14th patient. Her condition deteriorated following the diagnosis and she died Monday.In addition, two other hospitals were confirmed as MERS-affected facilities. Two newly confirmed patients, aged 64 and 71, respectively, were infected at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul by the 15th confirmed patient. Meanwhile, a 47-year-old man was infected by the deceased sixth patient ― his father-in-law ― while caring for him at Yeouido St. Mary’s Hospital on May 28.Among the 95 confirmed patients, three people have been discharged, while nine are reported to be unstable.

If mutated, it would make the virus more contagious than any other MERS virus in the Middle East, he added.Seo Jeong-wook, pathology professor at Seoul National University, pointed out that the mortality rate of the disease is lower than other diseases and that it passes away like influenza.In his essay posted online, the professor urged the authorities to expand the national budget on quarantine instruments and procedures in order to prepare for another outbreak of the disease in the near future.“Even if we stop MERS, chances are high that the disease could spread around this time next year,” he said.“MERS won’t be exterminated, other similar forms of the disease could appear.”Last week, Nature also said in its article that experts don’t consider MERS outbreak in South Korea to have pandemic potential or expect it to be transmitted to general communities.The U.S. magazine stressed that MERS mainly spreads in hospitals, and can be controlled by traditional quarantine measures because it spreads “very poorly between people,” unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome. “The coronavirus that caused SARS had evolved the ability to spread easily between people. MERS CoV by contrast has not,” it said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","south korea to have pandemic ,urged south koreans and health ,wook pathology professor at seoul ,korea to have pandemic ,pathology professor at seoul","['South Koreans', 'Korea', 'Daniel Lucey', 'Georgetown University Medical Center', 'the Center for Strategic and', 'korean', 'Seo Jeong - wook', 'Seoul National University', 'Nature', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Cho Chung - un']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4512153   0.13467552

One example is the apparent inability of the Education Ministry and local education offices to share and procure proper information about the student-related MERS case. On Monday, the Health Ministry confirmed South Korea’s first teenage MERS patient a 16-year-old boy. But the subsequent media briefings were prolific only in words and contained little facts. Numerous variations of “We don’t know” or “It has not been confirmed yet” spewed out from officials of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, whose job includes taking care of students’ well-being. The Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education on Tuesday said the student in question was in fact from Gyeonggi Province, contrary to an earlier announcement that the teen was from Seoul. The office said it obtained the information from its own sources, not the health authorities, and urged them to release all relevant information. Putting aside their excuse that the Health Ministry was monopolizing information, the SMOE appeared to be making only minimal efforts on its own.In perhaps one of the most bizarre ways to address queries from the media, the SMOE gathered information from news outlets and relayed it back to the reporters. As a result, very little information could be confirmed ― none of which included critical knowledge such as the school’s name and location, where the boy lived and if he met other students since catching the virus.Likewise, the Education Ministry seemed only a little less oblivious to the situation. After the initial report of the teen infection, a ministry official confirmed that the boy had attended a Seoul-based high school in the morning. But his colleague contradicted him, saying that they were not certain about the location of the boy’s school.Later, the officials were not shy in admitting that their flip-flopping statements derived from the fact that they were not being given accurate information from the higher-ups.The laughable situation exposed two important problems. One was the lack of coordination between government bodies. The second, perhaps more critical, was the seemingly complacent attitude of the authorities.“Unifying the outlet for all relevant information is more efficient. What would happen if all government bodies started providing their own versions of the situation?” said a high-ranking official from the Education Ministry.Brushing past the central government that had been taking low-profile measures against MERS until earlier this week, local municipalities including Seoul, Seongnam and Bucheon started debriefing on the outbreak status on their own.The move, while praised by many hungry for official information on the virus, also drew criticism for unveiling unconfirmed or inconsistent facts. Cheong Wa Dae, for its part, shot back that their “excessive” information-sharing escalated panic and confusion. Some also accused the local heads of being politically motivated.All of this underlined the policymakers’ inability to work in seamless tandem at the cost of the public’s confusion and further aggravating the sense of chaos.Last week, the Health Ministry said that a little under 300 students and teachers had been quarantined for MERS risks. But it turned out, according to Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo from the minor Justice Party, the Education Ministry’s figure was only 32.While Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea advised schools to cancel classes Friday, the Health Ministry announced the same day that there was no need to do so. “I think (the Health Ministry) did not know that Hwang had already advised schools to cancel classes, since their announcement came before his,” said an Education Ministry official on a MERS special response team. (Not) surprisingly, even this excuse proved incongruous, as Hwang’s announcement had actually preceded the Health Ministry’s. And yet, the government still claims the public has no reason to panic.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","students since catching the virus ,nationwide fears over the outbreak ,swine flu in 2009 closer ,schools to cancel classes friday ,classes friday the health ministry","['the Education Ministry', 'Health Ministry', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'the Health Ministry', 'SMOE', 'smoe', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Seongnam', 'Bucheon', 'Dae', 'the Health Ministry', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Justice Party', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Health Ministry', 'Education Ministry', 'Hwang', 'the Health Ministry ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",9,"[ 0.          3.          4.         ... -0.46429801  0.45188808

Asked whether mainland China would follow suit, China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei replied the Chinese ministry and the Chinese embassy in South Korea ""have already reminded Chinese citizens planning to visit South Korea or already in South Korea to take precautions."" ""The Chinese side has enhanced border protection measures as well as screening measures to properly deal with the epidemic,""Hong said during a regular press briefing. A total of 14 South Korean citizens have been quarantined in Hong Kong and China after coming in contact with a 44-year-old South Korean man who flew to Hong Kong on May 26, a day after his father was diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea.The Korean man, who subsequently went to Guangdong by bus, has been treated under isolation at the Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital in Guangdong. An official at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing said 10 Korean citizens who had been under quarantine in Hong Kong and Guangdong were discharged from medical facilities there on Tuesday after completing their quarantine periods. The remaining four Korean citizens who came in contact with the Korean MERS patient in Huizhou are expected to be discharged from hospitals on Wednesday, the embassy official said on the condition of anonymity.South Korea reported its first MERS case on May 20.MERS is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the World Health Organization.

(Yonhap)All eight new patients were infected after coming in close contact with those previously diagnosed at five hospitals, including Asan Medical Center, one of the largest hospitals in the capital.  The number of MERS patients was expected to rise by at least one after the health ministry said that a pregnant woman has tested positive for the potentially deadly disease in an initial test.  The woman, in her 40s, may have been infected while visiting her mother at the emergency room of Samsung Medical Center in Seoul late last month, the ministry said.  As of Tuesday morning, 2,892 people, including family members of those diagnosed, were in isolation for possible infection from coming into close contact with a MERS patient, according to the ministry.  The health ministry said it will fully fund the cost of diagnosis and treatment for those who have contracted the disease, as well as those in quarantine as suspected cases.  The ministry again warned against groundless fears, noting nearly two-thirds of those diagnosed with the disease had existing health conditions while all of those who have died from the disease had existing illnesses or other health problems.  Out of the 95 people diagnosed so far, nine are in unstable condition, the health ministry said.   Two people diagnosed with the disease have been released after making complete recoveries.  The number will soon reach three as another patient was set to be discharged from the hospital later in the day, the ministry said.  So far, all infections have occurred at hospitals where at least one MERS patient had visited or stayed for treatment -- the reason the government believes the disease can still be contained.  To help prevent the disease from spreading further, the government has released the names of all hospitals affected by the disease, which stood at 29 as of late Monday.

118,118,Top hospital new source of MERS outbreak,"Samsung Medical Center, one of South Korea’s top hospitals, was identified as a source of infection of the Middle East respiratory syndrome as health authorities revealed Sunday that 17 patients contracted the deadly virus while staying at the facility.The 17 confirmed cases, which includes doctors, patients and visitors, caught the virus from the 14th confirmed MERS patient while sharing the hospital’s emergency r...","Samsung Medical Center, one of South Korea’s top hospitals, was identified as a source of infection of the Middle East respiratory syndrome as health authorities revealed Sunday that 17 patients contracted the deadly virus while staying at the facility.The 17 confirmed cases, which includes doctors, patients and visitors, caught the virus from the 14th confirmed MERS patient while sharing the hospital’s emergency room from May 27 to 29, according to the Samsung Medical Center. The hospital said it has placed more than 890 patients and medical staff possibly exposed to MERS by the 14th patient in quarantine.“After reviewing medical records and CCTV footage to trace it, we found that 675 patients and 218 medical staff members were exposed to the virus by the 14th confirmed MERS patient,” said Song Jae-hoon, the director of the Samsung Medical Center, in a news briefing Sunday. Medical staff members enter an emergency room at Samsung Medical Center in southeastern Seoul, where visitor access was restricted due to the MERS risk on Sunday. (Yonhap)“We immediately informed the 893 people of the possible infection and placed them in quarantine,” Song said, after expressing a deep regret for causing concerns. The explanation came some hours after the government reported the fifth death from MERS and confirmed 14 more cases of the disease, pushing the number of confirmed patients to 64. Of the newly confirmed patients, 10 caught the virus while staying at the Seoul-based hospital. One of the confirmed patients placed in isolation is a doctor affiliated with Samsung Medical Center, who exposed over 1,500 Seoul residents to the deadly virus by attending large-scale events in southern Seoul on May 30 despite showing symptoms of the virus. The doctor, also identified as the 35th patient confirmed of MERS infection, then was treating an embolism patient who later was quarantined after being placed near the 14th patient at the facility.While St. Mary’s Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, has been cited as the first source of infection of MERS, with 36 confirmed patients originating from the facility, Samsung Medical Center comes second in terms of the number of the confirmed MERS cases as of Sunday afternoon. Given that the 14th confirmed MERS patient checked in to the hospital on May 29 and the virus has an incubation period of two to 14 days, the number of patients confirmed of MERS is likely to further grow, experts said. Samsung Medical Center is the nation’s first medical facility that detected a confirmed MERS case in Korea on May 20. It reported a 68-year-old patient, who traveled around the Middle East and showed symptoms for flu, to health authorities. He was later diagnosed with MERS. The hospital’s initial response to the first confirmed MERS case was seen as successful, with no other patients from the hospital contracting the virus at the time. “By promptly notifying those possibly exposed to the virus of possible infection, putting them in quarantine and monitoring their conditions, no patients at our hospital were infected by the first confirmed MERS patient,” Song said, stressing its proactive measures to combat the spread of the virus. All 17 MERS cases that recently occurred at the Samsung Medical Center were infected by the 14th patient, who moved to the hospital on May 27 from Pyeongtaek-based medical facilities. He stayed at the hospital’s emergency room for three days until he was confirmed of the virus and transferred to the government-run facilities to be quarantined on May 30. The announcement of new confirmed cases at Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, equipped with the nation’s best-trained medical staff, sparked fear that the deadly virus might have spread into the nation’s capital, a city of 10 million. Dismissing the speculation, the chief doctor assured that MERS had not spread outside the hospital’s emergency room. Meanwhile, an official at the hospital said it has no plans to transfer Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee to his residence or another hospital. Lee, chairman of the nation’s largest conglomerate, has been receiving in-house treatment at the hospital since he suffered a heart attack about a year ago. As of Sunday afternoon, some 2,361 people were under quarantine, with the Seoul Metropolitan Government separately monitoring more than 1,500 Seoul residents for possible infection.

The announcement followed intensifying calls for transparent information from the public with the number of MERS patients climbing to 64 as of Sunday morning, less than a month since the initial outbreak. Samsung Medical Center, Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital and Seoul Asan Hospital, three of the five largest hospitals in Seoul, were among those named. The list also included St. Mary’s Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, which has seen 37 cases of MERS; Asan Seoul Clinic in South Chungcheong Province; and Dae Cheong Hospital and KonYang University Hospital in Daejeon. “(The announcement) represents shifting the government’s strategy, toward ‘all-out’ efforts to end the MERS situation in its early stages,” said acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan in an emergency briefing at Seoul Government Complex. Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo speaks at a press conference held at the Prime Minister’s Office in Seoul with acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan attending Sunday. (Yonhap)“We are revealing the names of hospitals to show that the government is accurately keeping track of confirmed patients. We will continue to disclose hospital names to actively find infected individuals within the hospital and prevent the spread of the disease,” Choi said.But the authorities said they would not upgrade the alert level for MERS from its current “caution” status, he said, despite ongoing calls to change it. Nor was the government considering creating a new budget to handle MERS, as it would use funds reserved for national emergencies instead, he added.The acting premier explained that the government had refrained from revealing the information out of fear that it may spark nationwide panic and create a vacuum in medical treatment in hospitals involved. But the authorities, including President Park Geun-hye, have decided that the benefits of disclosing information outweigh the possible side effects, he added.Earlier in the day, the Health Ministry said the MERS outbreak had infected 64 people and claimed five, fueling public fear that the situation was en route to an epidemic. The ministry confirmed the death of a 75-year-old man who was exposed to the virus from May 27 to 29, when he shared an emergency room at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul with Korea’s 14th MERS patient. He died Friday, and a postmortem test confirmed the disease Sunday.He was one of the 14 cases confirmed early in the day. Among them, 10 were infected at Samsung Medical Center. With 17 cases to date, the facility is the source of the most MERS cases behind St. Mary’s Hospital in Pyeongtaek. Song Jae-hoon, head of Samsung Medical Center (Yonhap)According to an emergency briefing by the Samsung Medical Center, 893 people came in contact with MERS patients at the facility and are being monitored, for whom the hospital expressed “deep regret.”Both the government and the hospital, however, emphasized that all MERS infections reported so far have occurred within the hospital walls, and that the disease has not yet spread to the general public.The government’s response to handling the outbreak has been subject to condemnation from rival political parties, heads of regional governments and the general public. Such criticism intensified after the list of hospital names it revealed Sunday had erroneously marked the location of St. Mary’s Family Medicine Clinic Center in Seoul as Gunpo, Gyeonggi Province.Moon Jae-in, head of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, blasted the Park administration for failing to provide proper countermeasures in light of the emergency.“We no longer believe that the country will protect the lives and safety of our citizens. People are anxious and frustrated, and left wondering what they should and should not do,” he said. Ruling Saenuri’s chief Kim Moo-sung defined the MERS situation as a “national crisis” and urged bipartisan cooperation from the lawmakers. The two party leaders unveiled a series of demands on the government including: a comprehensive countermeasure involving the regional government, education offices and the civilian factor, the government’s sharing of necessary information related to MERS, upgrading the alert status and providing subsidies for possible financial damages inflicted upon medical facilities.Just 18 days after the country’s patient zero was confirmed of MERS, Korea now has the third-highest number of MERS patients in the world behind Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As of Sunday, the MERS scare led 1,276 schools and kindergartens across the country to cancel classes.But there has been nationwide concern that the situation will escalate even further. On Saturday, a 61-year-old man tested positive for the infection in an initial test in the country’s southernmost city of Busan. He was demonstrating some symptoms of the disease such as vomiting, but did not show signs of fever or respiratory problems. The patient had attended his cousin’s funeral in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, where a confirmed MERS patient had also been present. Authorities said they were conducting an investigation on who came into contact with him since the funeral.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","five largest hospitals in seoul ,test confirmed the disease sunday ,south korea on sunday disclosed ,10 were infected at samsung ,six hospitals with confirmed cases","['South Korea', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul Asan Hospital', 'Seoul', 'St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Asan Seoul Clinic', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Dae Cheong Hospital', 'KonYang University Hospital', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Seoul Government Complex', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Seoul', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Choi', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Health Ministry', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'Pyeongtaek', 'Song jae - hoon', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'the Samsung Medical Center', 'St. Mary ’s Family Medicine Clinic Center', 'Seoul', 'Gunpo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Busan', 'Bucheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Yoon Min - sik']",9,"[ 0.          4.          1.         ... -0.20364803  0.5046382

(Yonhap)The full list included five more hospitals in Pyeongtaek and six more in the nation's capital.The government had earlier misidentified one of the Seoul clinics as being located in Gunpo, Gyeonggi Province.""We're disclosing the hospitals where patients have been diagnosed with MERS, so that we can ensure the people's safety,"" Choi said. ""MERS has been spreading across these hospitals, and it forces us to impose strict control on them. Hospitals with confirmed MERS cases in the future will be identified as well.""The government had been under fire for its refusal to share the names of affected hospitals. It'd reasoned that it didn't want to generate unnecessary fear, though critics said the government had been doing just that by withholding the information.Of the 24 hospitals, six have had confirmed cases of MERS, while 18 others had MERS patients pass through them.The six hospitals with the confirmed cases are Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province; Samsung Medical Center in Seoul; 365 Open Clinic in Seoul; Asan Seoul Clinic in Asan, South Chungcheong Province; Dae Cheong Hospital in Daejeon; and Konyang University Hospital in Daejeon.Choi said the government will be ""as open as possible"" in releasing MERS-related information.""The Health Ministry will be the single source of all relevant information,"" the acting prime minister added.

We will also encourage the participation of civilian experts in announcing medical information.""Choi also said the government will step up its ""all-out efforts"" to help fight MERS, involving the regional authorities, the civilian sector and the military.The official unveiled the government's plans to strengthen its monitoring of patients quarantined in their homes. They will each be matched up with a public servant from their respective regional government. Following discussions with relevant bodies, the government may also begin tracking the patients' locations using their mobile phones.Choi, who is the finance minister, said the government is prepared to provide all necessary support to soften MERS' blow to the economy.""We ask the people to maintain good personal hygiene,"" Choi added. ""MERS is not transmitted through the air. With proper quarantine and hygiene, it won't be so widespread. We ask for your cooperation in keeping unnecessary confusion from spreading.""Choi said there's no immediate plan to upgrade the MERS alert level from the current ""watch"" to ""warning.""""The government has determined that MERS has not yet spread through communities,"" he said.

The other four got infected after coming in close contact with MERS patients at other hospitals.""All of the additional cases were infected at hospitals,"" a government official said. ""More cases are likely to be found at Samsung Medical Center, but the rate of fresh infections may be at a standstill or decline after this weekend.""Out of 64 South Korean MERS patients, 17 have been infected with the virus at Samsung Medical Center, the highest rate of contraction at any hospital in Seoul. The hospital, affiliated with South Korea's top family-controlled conglomerate Samsung Group, said it has placed under isolation about 900 patients and medical staff who may have come in contact with an infected patient at its emergency room in late May.Concerns about the disease have been growing here since South Korea first reported the disease on May 20 as a 68-year-old man, the South Korean ""index patient,"" contracted the virus after returning from a trip to the Middle East.More than 2,300 people with suspected symptoms have been isolated or ordered to remain in self-quarantine in South Korea.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that had a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent globally before the outbreak in South Korea, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In South Korea, the death rate from the virus has reached 7.8 percent.Most people infected with MERS develop severe acute respiratory illness, including a fever, a cough and shortness of breath. There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.The government has come under fire for its bungled initial response to the disease. President Park Geun-hye called a meeting of relevant government officials to cope with the issue as late as 14 days after the first case was reported. Acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who is also the finance minister, unveiled measures Sunday to prevent the further spread of MERS in order to quell public fears.The government identified all 24 hospitals affected by MERS to ensure the public's safety with transparent information.It also announced a plan to beef up monitoring those placed in self-quarantine by tracking their locations via mobile phones, vowing to make all-out efforts to contain the virus by mid-June.The health ministry said Sunday that it and other four provincial governments agreed to set up a working-level channel to jointly cope with the disease.They also plan to allow 17 health-related institutes to have authority to identify whether suspected patients are infected with the virus through gene tests, it added.The move comes as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon blamed the central government on Thursday for its failed attempt to curb the virus.Controversy erupted as the Seoul government said last week that a doctor from Samsung Medical Center came in contact with more than a thousand citizens at large-scale events while infected with MERS.The doctor claimed that he did not suffer from symptoms of the virus when he joined the events.Meanwhile, a Navy petty officer, who was isolated at a military hospital for suspected infection, was found to have tested negative for the virus on Sunday, according to the defense ministry. An Air Force chief master sergeant was confirmed to have contracted the virus and some 100 military service members are being placed under quarantine, it added.Also Sunday, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education announced a plan to temporarily shut down kindergartens and primary schools located in two posh southern districts in Seoul from Monday to Wednesday.The education office in Gyeonggi Province also joined the move, saying that it will close down all kindergartens and schools this week in seven areas, including those in Pyeongtaek, where the first infection was confirmed.On Thursday, more than 900 schools were temporarily closed down across the country as a precaution against the virus.The World Health Organization said Friday it will send a team of experts to South Korea to work with local authorities to investigate the largest outbreak of the disease outside Saudi Arabia.

Four patients have died, while more than 1,800 people with suspected symptoms have been isolated or ordered to remain in self-quarantine.""I'd like to express regret over causing huge concerns to the people over a continued increase in the numbers of confirmed cases and those quarantined,"" Choi said while presiding over a meeting of relevant Cabinet ministers to devise government measures against MERS.The government has come under intense public and media fire for its poor initial responses to the disease. President Park Geun-hye called a meeting of relevant government officials to discuss the situation as late as 14 days after the first patient was reported.""Keeping in mind the fact that priority is to contain the spread of the virus and eradicate it as soon as possible, each ministry should employ every possible means,"" Choi said, vowing that the government would provide extra budgets, if necessary.Choi also called for close cooperation among relevant ministries as well as between the central and local authorities, a thinly-veiled accusation against Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon who openly criticized the central government on Thursday for not doing enough to contain the virus. Choi cut short his overseas trip and returned home earlier in the day. He, as the finance minister, visited France and Britain and attended a ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, of which South Korea is a member.He became the acting prime minister after former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo resigned in late April under pressure for alleged involvement in a corruption scandal.

There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.The health ministry said it agreed with local governments to disclose other MERS-affected hospitals in order to take preemptive measures to tackle the fast-spreading respiratory illness.The South Korean authorities identified Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital on Friday on rising public demand for sharing facilities'names. They had refused to share the names of hospitals for more than two weeks, citing ""unnecessary fear and stigmatization.""The move came after Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon held a midnight press conference to complain of the authorities' lax disease management and said he would now take charge of efforts to deal with MERS in Seoul.Park disclosed that a Samsung Medical Center doctor who has since been diagnosed with MERS allegedly had direct and indirect contact with over 1,500 people before his infection was confirmed.Meanwhile, the health ministry said that the MERS virus spreading in South Korea has not mutated and showed similar genomic sequences with the contagion discovered in Middle Eastern countries.The fast pace of MERS proliferation in South Korea has raised questions among foreign experts about whether the virus has undergone changes that could make it more infectious.""The Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH) brought in such results after doing a culture test on the MERS virus gathered from a local patient and analyzing its full genomic sequence,"" said the ministry in a press briefing.The KNIH did the joint research with a local virology society, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other foreign institutions to find out whether a gene mutation happened in South Korea.The ministry said the virus from the South Korean patient had a99.55 percent similarity with a virus sample from a Saudi Arabian stored by the U.S. National Institute of Health in 2012.""South Korea's weather is more favorable for the survival of the MERS virus than in the Middle East,"" said an official from the ministry.

Since the first outbreak on May 21, South Korea has reported its fourth death and confirmed that 41 people have been infected with the MERS virus as of Friday, the largest outbreak outside Saudi Arabia. The nation's first patient was a 68-year-old man who traveled to the Middle Eastern country. Vincent Munster, the virus unit chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Maryland, played down the possibility of MERS escalating into a pandemic in South Korea and around the globe. ""I think the chance for this to happen is still fairly small.The (South Korean) government is taking appropriate measures to prevent further spread,"" Munster said in an email interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""In order for the MERS-coronavirus to become a pandemic, it has to acquire the ability to spread more efficiently from human-to-human in the general population and not only in a health care setting.""The expert of emerging viruses said that the latest sequence data of the MERS virus from Saudi Arabia does not suggest any ""adaptive mutations"" toward more enhanced human-to-human transmission, though further monitoring is needed to look into whether the virus has changed en route to South Korea from the Middle Eastern country. The virus is considered deadlier but less infectious compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed hundreds of people when it spread across Asia in 2003. MERS has now infected more than 1,100 people globally, with 437 deaths. More than 20 countries have been affected, with most cases in Saudi Arabia.While the MERS virus mostly spread in hospitals in Saudi Arabia and South Korea through direct contact with patients, travel-related cases in Europe, North America, Africa didn't involve additional transmission of the virus, he said. Munster said the death rate is directly related with the health status of the patient, with mild cases going unnoticed and patients with such health problems as obesity, diabetes and cardiac disease more likely to test positive for the virus. ""So you only see the severe cases of the disease and do not detect any mild or asymptomatic cases,"" Munster noted.As there are currently no treatments for the new virus, he said health authorities should quarantine people infected with the virus and use protective equipment when treating the patients and trace their contact with them.Growing fears over the infectious disease has forced more than 900 schools to shut down and more than 1,600 people have been quarantined in South Korea. The health ministry said it will form a joint team with the World Health Organization to make concerted efforts to contain the disease. Albeit a small chance, Munster did not rule out the possibility of the virus developing the ability to spread through the air, advising medical staff to avoid transmission by aerosol- and droplet-generating procedures, including lavages and intubation.More importantly, health authorities should step up efforts to communicate the current situation and educate the general public by using social media to allay panic, he added. (Yonhap)","friday the largest outbreak outside ,pandemic in south korea ,the largest outbreak outside saudi ,respiratory syndrome which killed hundreds ,korea has reported its fourth","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Vincent Munster', 'the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', 'Maryland', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Munster', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Korea', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Korea', 'Munster', 'Munster', 'South Korea', 'the World Health Organization', 'Munster']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36522958  0.7520718

Some 68 cited a lack of measures they could provide to counter an outbreak, while 24 said they wished to avert the danger of being infected.The survey shows a widespread complacency against the spread of infectious diseases among the health authorities as the country struggles to fight the surging number of people infected by MERS since last month.Thirty percent of the respondents said monitoring system to detect new infections was insufficient. Some 112 said there was a lack of cooperation among relevant departments, while 110 said they needed a wider pool of specialists to handle crises.On its website, the CDCP describes itself as having led the country’s management of infectious diseases in the past decade, after various changes to its roles since its inception in 1963 as a national health care center. Among its roles are diagnosis, research and patient management of various infectious diseases as well as vaccination projects, tuberculosis management, rare and incurable disease management and organ donation and transplantation projects.(khnews@heraldcorp.com)","disease outbreak the 299 surveyed ,novel influenza avian influenza ebola ,outbreak in korea nearly half ,infected by mers since last ,avian influenza ebola virus","['the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Korea', 'Kangwon National University', 'KCDC', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'CDCP', 'projects.(khnews@heraldcorp.com']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44757345  0.44249636

Earlier in the day, South Korea reported five additional cases of MERS, raising to 35 the number of people diagnosed with the potentially deadly disease.Every patient is now isolated and being treated at state-designated hospitals.Kim Moo-sung, the ruling party chief, said the government bungled its initial response to the virus outbreak but widespread fear and rumors about the virus are to blame for the public overreaction.""The people overreacted way too much,"" Choo Moo-jin, head of Korean Medical Association, said at the meeting.Experts say the virus cannot be spread to people unless they come in contact with infected patients or medical staff who treated the patients.""There is almost no possibility that ordinary people, who have no contact with MERS patients, can be infected with MERS,"" said the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, adding there is no need for excessive fear.Still, more than 700 schools have canceled classes across the country as a precaution. The vast majority of the total, or 588 schools, are in Gyeonggi Province, where the first case of MERS in South Korea was reported.The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases described the move by some schools as ""too much of an emotional measure.""It said the virus' fatality rate could be about 10 percent, which is not higher than that of pneumonia in South Korea.Kim called on the government to release all information on the virus in real time to ensure that rumors will not spread on the Internet, though he stopped short of asking the government to release the names of hospitals where people infected with the virus have been placed in quarantine.Some South Koreans asked the government to release the names of the hospitals in question, citing their right to know. But experts warned side effects of naming the hospitals would far outweigh any benefits.""If hospitals' names are made public, it could scare away people due to a sense of fear and ordinary patients could suffer if they don't receive emergency measures in emergency rooms,"" said Lee Jae-gap, an infectious disease expert at Hallym University Medical Center near Seoul.

Two of them were patients in the hospital, while the other person is a son of another patient who had visited the hospital to care for his parent, the Health Ministry said.They had not been monitored by the authorities as they had shown no symptoms of the disease when they were dismissed from the hospital, according to the ministry.The total number of MERS infections reached 18 in 12 days since the first outbreak on May 20.Still, the ministry said the country has yet to report any tertiary infections, meaning all 17 people diagnosed since the first case became infected after coming in close contact with the first patient.A confirmed tertiary infection will make any of the 18 people who have been diagnosed a carrier.So far, the country is isolating only the people who have come in close contact with the first patient, who reportedly caught the disease while traveling to the Middle East in mid-April.Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said the government is mobilizing all-out efforts to prevent further infection.""This week will become a critical crossroads over whether MERS will continue to spread or subside,"" Moon said in a policy coordination meeting with the ruling Saenuri Party officials in Seoul. ""I am very sorry for worrying citizens and causing them anxiety.""MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans.

A U.S. military laboratory in Utah inadvertently delivered samples to labs at Osan Base and in nine states in the U.S., according to the Pentagon.   Taking into account the gravity of the issue, Seoul and Washington have kicked off a joint committee channel in accordance with the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), according to the diplomatic source.   The SOFA governs the legal status of about 28,500 U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.   ""Given the incident's seriousness and gravity, the South Korean and U.S. militaries have started to run the SOFA joint committee for close cooperation,"" the source said. The two sides are in consultations on an array of issues such as determining the incident's cause and follow-up measures, the source added.   The USFK did not inform the South Korean government of the arrival of the anthrax sample in advance as it believed the sample contained an inactive bacterium which does not pose any health threat, according to a government official.   On Wednesday, the U.S. military notified the Seoul government of the situation surrounding the incident and its plans to prevent future mishaps.The Korean government said that given the available information, it may be difficult to label the USFK's move a violation of the SOFA, according to a separate source.The USFK said it was the first time the training has been conducted, curbing concerns that it may have carried out similar moves before.""This was the first time the training has been conducted,"" the USFK said, adding its intention was to ""defend the Korean people by testing currently fielded equipment and new systems that could better identify toxins and pathogens in the environment.""The USFK again highlighted that it has confirmed there was no risk to the public.""To destroy the sample, sanitize the facility and certify it as safe, the team followed protocols recommended by the U.S. National Response Team and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" it said. Seoul's Defense Minister Han Min-koo, who is scheduled to meet U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter Saturday at the 14th Asia Security Summit that kicked off in Singapore, also plans to discuss the matter during their bilateral talks.The two are expected to exchange ideas on precautionary measures and ways to improve supplies transportation procedures.

Sugar, for example, is known to generate aldehydes when pyrolyzed. The combination of aldehyde and nicotine is known to be more addictive than nicotine alone. Ammonia in tobacco, on the other hand, can boost the availability of nicotine from the cigarette up to 100 times, according to a 1997 study by the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology in the U.S. The establishment of the think tank is closely linked to the National Health Insurance Service’s lawsuit against leading tobacco companies. The agency filed a suit against three domestic and foreign tobacco makers ― KT&G;, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris ― last year, seeking damages of 53.7 billion won ($52 million) for payouts over tobacco-related diseases including lung cancer. Prior to the suit, a state-run research institute in 2012 announced that it discovered ammonia, sugar and cocoa beans in tobacco cigarettes manufactured by KT&G;, the biggest tobacco company in Korea. In response to the research findings, KT&G; at the time stated it added sugar and cocoa beans to its products only to give them a better taste, not to increase their addictiveness. The company also claimed that ammonia naturally occurs in tobacco, and it did not artificially add the compound to its products.The lack of government research on the damage of tobacco use has been raised as a problem in Korea. Last year, the Supreme Court rejected a damage suit filed by 30 lung cancer patients and their families against KT&G.; The court said there was a “lack of proof” that the patients contracted lung cancer solely because of smoking. It also stated that smoking, ultimately, is a choice, not a compulsion.Bae Geum-ja, a lawyer who represented the lung cancer patients last year, said the court’s decision had been partially affected by the tobacco firms’ refusal to submit documents that listed all the ingredients used in their products for “confidentiality reasons.” There was no local scientific data that could prove the harmful effect of additives contained in tobacco cigarettes manufactured by the KT&G;, she added. “The think tank’s researchers will conduct studies to determine if the products contain any harmful additives (to enhance the addictiveness of nicotine),” an official from the Health Ministry said. “Any findings that prove the harmful effects of tobacco will be submitted to the court as evidence.”Aside from the establishment of the think tank, the NHIS is using U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler’s 2006 ruling that tobacco companies engaged in racketeering by misleading the public for years about the health hazards of smoking.She ordered tobacco companies to stop using terms such as “low tar” and “light” on their products, as a number of studies suggested that low-tar cigarettes were no less harmful than regular cigarettes, and no difference was found in lung cancer rates between smokers of high-tar and low-tar products. The judge also ordered companies to advertise that they had been deceiving the public about the health dangers of tobacco.According to the World Health Organization, cigarettes kill 5.4 million smokers from direct use and another 600,000 nonsmokers through secondhand smoke each year.In Korea, home to almost 10 million smokers, an estimated 57,000 die every year due to smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer.Last year, the parliament approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes, from 2,500 won ($2.30) per pack to 4,500 won, in an effort to curb smoking.

Months before, most of the 25 patients entered the clinic feeling disgraced by their disease, obstetric fistula, and the resulting cold shoulder given by their family and community. Some were deserted by their husbands, and though the illness is treatable with a brief surgery, many hid it for years out of shame or due to a lack of money or knowledge. Thanks to the support of the U.N. Population Fund and Korea International Cooperation Agency, they have received an operation and are now gearing up to start a fresh life.  A general hospital is run by the Woroba provincial government in Seguela, Ivory Coast, where KOICA and the U.N. Population Fund provide treatment to obstetric fistula patients. (Shin Hyon-hee/The Korea Herald)“I contracted a fistula while giving birth at home 18 years ago. But I had no idea where else to get it treated than Abidjan because I needed to work,” said Bamba Djeneba, a 32-year-old woman from Worofla, a town in the same Woroba district. “I endured enormous hardship especially after my husband left me and I had to return home. My clothes needed to be washed every day but the pain kept me from doing everything; I felt so sorry for my mom, who bore all the burden.” Fistula is a symptom in which patients are incontinent of urine and feces due to a hole between the vagina and bladder, chiefly caused by prolonged intensive labor. Poor delivery conditions at home and their young age make the Ivorian women more vulnerable.Primarily due to the stench, they grow more isolated and demonized in communities where people believe in sorcery, which often aggravates their mental health, said Kouame Bile, a UNFPA doctor who performed the surgery for Djeneba. “The patients are nearly considered criminals and even their families try to conceal it. They get frightened to eat food because they would instantly excrete it,” he said. “They are alive but no different to the dead.” KOICA, which opened an office in the West African country last August, joined forces with the multilateral agency in 2010, pledging $1.7 million until June this year. It plans to scale up its aid to more than $6 million between 2016 and 2018, according to Kim Sang-chul, representative of the Abidjan unit. Launched in 2007, the project is aimed at reducing not only obstetric fistula but also the overall maternal mortality. In the poorer northwest region, only 9 percent of the population have access to basic emergency delivery services, and the cesarean section rate stands at a mere 1.5 percent of births. “As Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) has set a goal of becoming an ‘emerging country’ by 2020, reinforcing human resources, education and public health is key,” Ivorian Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said in an interview with visiting Korean reporters in Abidjan. “Women, in particular, play a very significant role in nurturing future generations and many women are benefiting from Korea’s support. I hope the two countries will strengthen cooperation in not only fistula but also breast cancer, where treatment is also in urgent need.” KOICA and the FPA, in partnership with the Ivorian health ministry, provide treatment free of charge in eight regions across the country, targeting almost 1.4 million potential mothers and 700 fistula carriers. Altogether they have treated more than 780 people and expect the number to reach 1,200 by the end of this year. Given the social bias, they are carrying out a “caravan” campaign in which they travel around the country every month to brief residents on their services, bring over fistula patients and raise awareness about the disease, family planning and sexual violence. “They don’t come to us automatically; we should go look for them. We mobilize everything we can to spread our drive, including tribal and religious leaders, nongovernmental groups and former patients who are the best ambassadors,” Bile said. “As we operate 13 caravans, people from Guinea and Burkina Faso heard about it and come to us.” To help the women rebuild their lives, the organizations offer some funds after their recovery and train them in sewing, cooking or other useful skills at an academy. Konan Monique Gifty, a 33-year-old mother of two daughters, opened a small clothing store in the vicinity of the clinic with the 85,000 CFA francs ($140) assistance following her surgery two years ago. “It was so sad that I was this young but could not move freely and lost a lot of weight,” she said. “Now that I’ve recovered my health, I bought a bunch of garments and other materials to start this shop.” By Shin Hyon-hee, Korea Herald correspondent (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","with brief surgery many hid ,following her surgery two years ,140 assistance following her surgery ,disgraced by their disease obstetric ,potential mothers and 700 fistula","['seguela / ABIDJAN', 'Ivory Coast ―', 'Seguela', 'Abidjan', 'the U.N.

Starting from July, they will be officially classed as cosmetic products and will be regulated by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.All cosmetic products in Korea are banned from containing xylene and optical brighteners. The same regulations will apply to wet-wipes. Foreign-made wet-wipe products containing the two chemicals will also be banned from being imported and sold, the ministry added.Optical brighteners are commonly added to laundry detergents to replace whitening agents removed during washing to make clothes appear cleaner. Meanwhile, xylene is colorless, sweet-smelling and highly flammable and is often used by art conservators and the printing and leather industries.Those with sensitive skin can experience irritation and develop skin rashes from both optical brighteners and xylene. Some research has shown that overexposure to optical brighteners may cause cancer. However, not all wet-wipes will be banned from containing the chemicals. “Wet-wipes produced for the sole purposes of cleaning corpses and for use in restaurants to clean hands will be categorized as public hygiene products instead of cosmetics, and therefore will be exempt from the ban of the two chemicals,” said an official from the drug ministry.

South Korea has dispatched a total of 24 doctors and nurses in three batches to the treatment facility since mid-December. Each team worked for about one month, helping test and treat patients of the highly contagious epidemic.It was the first time the South Korean government has sent an emergency relief team to fight the outbreak of an epidemic overseas.""This emergency relief team had been on a mission for the longest period of time in South Korea's foreign relief assistance history to deal with a new type of a disaster,"" the ministry said in a statement. No case of contagion has been reported among all the South Korean medical workers although the returning team will undergo the necessary three-week quarantine at a local facility after entering the country later in the day, according to the ministry.A group of foreign and defense ministry officials, who were in Sierra Leone to support the relief mission, also returned home on Monday with the medical team, the ministry noted. Wrapping up the Ebola relief mission, the government plans to devise various bilateral and multilateral projects to further help the Ebola-hit country. It also plans to publish a white paper based on the latest relief assistance as well as ways to deal with similar disasters in the future.

In South Korea, only 10 to 15 percent of women are known to have the infection.The study, led by professor Lee Im-soon at Soonchunhyang University’s medical school, involved health checks on 138 female North Korean defectors from 2012 to 2013.There are more than 100 types of HPV, of which at least 13 high-risk types may cause cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Among the 13 high-risk varieties of the sexually transmitted virus, types 16 and 18 are known to cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions.Lee said it was unlikely that medical facilities in North Korea offered Pap tests ― which examine a cell sample collected from the cervix under a microscope ― mostly for financial reasons. The test is crucial for detecting HPV. A few years ago at an international medical conference, Lee also had a chance to examine a public poster that had been used in North Korea to encourage women to get colposcopies to prevent cervical cancer. The equipment used in the procedure, a colposcope, provides an enlarged and illuminated view of the cervix. The machine is usually used after a vinegar-like solution is applied to the cervix, which causes abnormal cells to turn white ― and therefore become more visible. However, Lee and other medical experts at the conference concluded that colposcopies in North Korea did not use a colposcope, based on the descriptions on the poster. “Instead of a colposcope, it seemed they were just using an ordinary magnifying glass, ones that anyone would use to read newspapers, to see if any tissues turned white,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “Detecting HPV or other abnormalities can be difficult without Pap tests and proper colposcopes.”Lee’s study also showed that 11.8 percent of the women tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which means they are susceptible to hepatitis B, a serious infectious disease of the liver. Only 3.7 percent of all South Koreans, both men and women, are HBsAg-positive. Lee said the high rate of HBsAg-positive defectors may be due to inadequate vaccinations in North Korea. Those who have not been vaccinated or have not developed antibodies after a hepatitis B infection may develop liver failure or liver cancer.“We need to take proactive measures to protect these women from hepatitis B, because not only does it cause all kinds of liver failure, but it can also affect their newborn babies,” the gynecologist said.“If a pregnant woman is a hepatitis B carrier and is also HBeAg-positive, her baby has a 90 percent likelihood of being infected and becoming a carrier.”According to the WHO, 25 percent of children born to mothers who are hepatitis B carriers die from liver cancer or chronic liver diseases.Also, 6.3 percent of the women who defected from North Korea had osteoporosis, a bone disease that can lead to an increased risk of fractures, and 42.3 percent had osteopenia, a condition in which bone mineral density is lower than normal, the study showed. As the two conditions usually develop during or after menopause, the rate was unusual, as 82 percent of the women were aged 49 or under, Lee said. “I would assume that it mostly has to do with malnutrition,” Lee said. Only 0.5 percent of premenopausal South Korean women develop osteoporosis.Lee stressed that there should be more support from the South Korean government for women’s health, in consideration of their unique background and situation. “I found that many of them are not very familiar with and are even intimidated by the health care system in South Korea, as well as the national health insurance system here,” she said.“Some are just too busy settling down and don’t think of medical examinations as a priority. But regular checkups and vaccinations are crucial for prevention and early detection of any diseases. The authorities somehow have to persuade the women to get the necessary health services.”Lee’s study, which also surveyed 81 women who immigrated to Korea by marriage, found that they are more prone to the three diseases than South Korean women. Twenty-two percent of them were HPV-positive, while 6.7 percent were HBeAg-positive and 9 percent had osteoporosis.A total of 18,776 female North Korean defectors and 206,369 of female marriage migrants were living in South Korea as of last year.

North Korea is half a world away from Ebola-hit West Africa, but the reclusive regime closed its doors to foreign tourists last October. The ban, which took a toll on Chinese travel firms specializing in tours to the North, was lifted earlier last week. A rail tour between Dandong, a border city in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning, and the North Korean border town of Sinuiju resumed on Monday. Two days later, a group of 97 Chinese tourists took part in a one-day bus tour to Sinuiju from Dandong. ""We have received bookings from about 20 Chinese nationals for a four-day tour to North Korea that departs on March 19,"" said an official at a Dandong-based travel agency, who asked not to be named. ""The number of customers is expected to grow ahead of the Labor Day holiday season,"" he added. Another tour route linking Hunchun, a border city in the Chinese province of Jilin, to North Korea's Rason special economic zone is set to be restarted, Chinese travel agents in Hunchun said. About 60,000 Chinese people are estimated to travel to North Korea via Dandong a year, with another 10,000 Chinese making tours to the North a year via Hunchun, according to Chinese industry estimates. North Korea is one of the world's most secretive and isolated nations, but Pyongyang has stepped up efforts to attract foreign tourists, mostly Chinese, since last year by offering more tour routes.Hit by decades of economic mismanagement and international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, North Korea is desperately poor. The North appears to be promoting its tourism sector to earn much-needed hard currency to prop up its regime.

The wounds required more than 80 stitches.Yoon Do-heum, head of Yonsei University's Severance Hospital, said there appeared to be few problems in Lippert's recovery and expected him to be released as early as Tuesday afternoon.""Doctors plan to visit Lippert's home on Saturday (for a follow-up),"" Yoon said. ""He's trying his best to get back to work as soon as possible.""Hospital officials said Lippert was ""deeply moved"" by South Koreans who brought him carnations, the official flower of his home state Ohio.Meanwhile, authorities said they are investigating the possibility that Kim may have violated South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly supporting the North's government.The 55-year-old was already detained Friday on charges of attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of business.Yoon Myeong-seong, head of Jongno Police Station in Seoul, said investigators have discovered more than 10 books from Kim's home and office suspected of being dangerously pro-North Korea in nature. These books include ""On the Art of Cinema,"" written by late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, and printed materials explaining the North's founding ideology of ""juche,"" or self-reliance.""We're going to find out why Kim owned these books and whether we can charge him with violating the National Security Law,"" Kim Doo-hyeon, a security section chief at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, told reporters.Kim was interrogated a day earlier and reportedly endorsed North Korea in front of the officers.""South Korea doesn't have a leader that compares with North Korean founder Kim Il-sung,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Kim was a great leader of the 20th century.""Kim was also quoted as describing the North's regime as ""autonomous"" while South Korea was dubbed a ""half-colonized"" country. He was presumably referring to the U.S. troops' presence in South Korea.Police have already discovered that Kim visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. Kim was also found to have tried to erect an altar in the heart of Seoul in memory of late leader Kim Jong-il in 2011.Police were also working with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain records on Kim's Facebook and Twitter accounts.Authorities are convinced that Kim had the intent to kill. Kim told officers he brought a knife ""because he thought it would be more threatening than a piece of concrete"" he hurled at a Japanese ambassador in 2010. Kim has denied the allegations.Police said they will refer this case to the prosecution by Friday after wrapping up their investigation.Lippert, 42, took office as the youngest U.S. ambassador to South Korea last year. His wife gave birth to a son in Seoul and the couple bestowed him with a Korean middle name.

Last year's numbers also mark the second year of contraction in a row.  The office that started compiling childbirth data in 1970 said 2005 was the only year that the number was lower. There were 435,031 babies born that year. More than 1 million babies were born in South Korea every year in the early 1970s.  ""The drop is directly related to the decreased population of women in their 20s and 30s, as well as women putting off marriage,"" said Yoon Yean-ok, director of population statistics at the agency.  Data showed that the average age that a mother had her first born was 32.04 last year, up from 30.73 a year earlier. It also showed that 21.6 percent of these mothers were over 35 years of age.  ""There is a steady drop in mothers in their 20s, with the slack being taken up by those in their 30s,"" Yoon said. She pointed out that with women getting married later in life and having their first child when they are older, the number of women having more children is falling. As of 2013, the average age of a bride in the country was 29.6 and was predicted to have hit 30 last year.  The latest data showed that the number of second children reached 165,400 last year, down 0.2 percent from the year before and the lowest since 1981. Statistics for a third child were down 3.1 percent on-year to 43,800.  The report, on the other hand, showed the total fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, reached 1.21 last year from the previous year's 1.19. The slight improvement is mainly the result of women in their late 30s having babies.  This is a positive step, although 1.21 is way below the 2.1 needed to prevent a drop in population. Predictions have indicated that South Korea's population will peak in 2030.  South Korea has one of the lowest fertility rates among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Last year, the country's natural population increase rate fell to 3.3 percent, the lowest ever reported.  The latest annual report will further fuel concerns that the country's chronically low birthrate will result in a smaller working population down the road, eventually hurting the country's economic growth and undermining its growth potential. An aging population can result in greater welfare outlays. For the month of December, the statistical office said there were 32,700 newborns in the country, up 2.2 percent from the year before. There were 24,400 deaths, up 4.7 percent.  The number of people tying the knot reached 34,300, and the number of divorces reached 9,900.  In a separate report on population mobility, the statistics agency said that the number of people changing their official residence in January rose 6 percent on-year to about 620,000. The increase follows data that showed a steady rise in sales of houses in the country.   The administrative city of Sejong saw the sharpest rise in population, followed by Gyeonggi Province and the port city of Incheon. Seoul lost the most people, with Busan trailing in second place.

This year’s first yellow dust warnings swept the capital and a dozen surrounding areas after the advisories were issued and elevated Sunday, the Korea Meteorological Administration said. It was the capital’s fifth yellow dust warning since 2002. A man with a protective mask walks along the Hangang River, where visibility remained low due to high levels of yellow dust in central Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)At 4 a.m. Monday, the dust concentration in Seoul reached 1,044 micrograms per cubic meter, the fourth-highest since 2002, when the government started to collect such measurements.Ganghwado Island in Incheon coast recorded 707 micrograms per cubic meter, followed by Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, with 696 micrograms per cubic meter, the weather agency said. Yellow dust advisories are issued when an hourly average dust concentration of more than 400 micrograms per cubic meter is expected to continue for more than two hours. More than 800 micrograms per cubic meter for over two hours triggers a warning. “The yellow dust, which originated from deserts in southern Mongolia and northern China, flew to the peninsula on a strong northwesterly wind, leading to thick yellow dust,” the KMA said. At 4 p.m., the weather agency eased the warnings to advisories in Seoul and surrounding cities as the concentration of the dust gradually dropped. But some areas will still likely see light yellow dust Tuesday, the weather agency added. Citizens were advised to stay indoors and wear protective glasses and masks in case of outdoor activities, health authorities said. They also advised people to frequently wash their noses with running water to prevent respiratory problems. Along with yellow dust warnings, Seoul Metropolitan Government also issued the year’s first ultrafine dust advisories as of 1 a.m. Monday as the hourly average level of the ultrafine particles or PM-2.5 continued to stay over 120 micrograms per cubic meter for more than two hours, officials said.The concentration of PM-2.5 once reached 196 micrograms per cubic meter in Gangseo-gu, the highest regional level, they added. Ultrafine dust advisories were also issued in Gyeonggi Province.

(Yonhap)A highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of avian influenza was confirmed from the feces of migratory birds at Jungnangcheon Stream in the western part of the capital, officials said. The stream is a habitat for more than 4,200 wild birds including mallard ducks. About 600 birds also reside in a national park located near the stream, raising concerns that the virus may further spread.The Seoul Metropolitan Government immediately blocked public access to the stream and strengthened quarantine measures. The municipality also vowed to enhance the preventive measures at other streams and Hangang River as part of containment efforts, the city said. All bird exhibitions at public zoos are closed temporarily, the city government said, and disinfection measures and monitoring systems will be tightened. But Seoul shrugged off the possibility of the virus affecting humans. “There have been no cases of avian-to-human transmission. Therefore, there is no need to be worried,” a Seoul city government official said. “But we would like all citizens to refrain from visiting the streams or the Hangang River where the disinfection measures are underway.” As of Sunday, more than 1.8 million birds, mostly ducks and chickens, have been culled since the disease broke out in December, the Agriculture said. Of the 19 cases confirmed across the country, nine were detected in feces, it added. The government has tightened its preventive measures since late last year. It enforced a 36-hour halt in the movement of all poultry and farmers last month to stem the spread of the virus.

The dog ― one of three at a duck farm in Goseong-gun, South Gyeongsang Province ― had antigens for the highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of bird flu, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said. The farm was affected by the disease on Jan. 23. This is the first time bird flu has been found in a dog in Korea through the detection of antigens, but antibodies for the virus were found in a dozen dogs at virus-affected farms in March last year. The detection of antibodies suggests an immune response to the virus, the ministry said. “None of these dogs had shown symptoms. No antigens or antibodies for the virus were found in the two other dogs, which means that dog-to-dog transmission is unlikely to have happened,” quarantine officials said. The ministry suspected that the dog may have eaten infected animals at the farm. All poultry and dogs at the concerned farm were slaughtered as part of the preventive measures right after the farm was reported to have been infected with the disease, officials said. Meanwhile, quarantine officials rejected the possibility of viral transmission to humans. According to the ministry’s report, about 450 workers at infected farms across the country had been given an antigen test, with none showing signs of infection. None of Korea’s 20,000 farm workers have reported any symptoms so far, officials added. “It is thought that infected dogs do not show symptoms of the disease as they are naturally resistant to bird flu,” the ministry said. Meanwhile, the Agriculture Ministry has toughened the quarantine measures in Goseong-gun. The region is a frequented by migratory birds, which are suspected to have spread the viral disease. As of Monday, more than 1.8 million poultry had been slaughtered since the first outbreak in September last year in South Jeolla Province.

The team, comprised of two army doctors and three nurses, will leave for the U.K. on Saturday for a weeklong training course before heading to the West African country later this month. They are scheduled to receive three days of related education at home until Wednesday. “With Freetown seeking to stamp out its last case by March 1, our third team will be able to stay on until the epidemic stabilizes later that month,” a senior ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. Korea’s second group of nine personnel has been serving since Jan. 26 at a 100-bed treatment center in Goderich in the suburbs of capital Freetown, which was built by the British government and is operated by Emergency, an Italy-based relief organization. The 10-strong first batch will complete its mandatory 21-day quarantine program on Feb. 20. The scale of the workforce was reduced in line with the continuous drop in new confirmed cases, which prompted the NGO to request a downsizing, the official said. As of the third week of January, the Sierra Leone government reported 65 newly confirmed patients, a more than 80 percent fall from 357 three weeks earlier. The outbreak is believed to have killed at least 8,000 people worldwide since last March.To facilitate the work of the international staff at Goderich, Seoul has also provided five tablet computers and two electronic stethoscopes made in Korea, the official said. Officials from the foreign, defense and health ministries plan to depart for Sierra Leone on Feb. 11 to support the medical workers and wrap up their months-long activities. “Now we need to think about how to capitalize on the results and experiences that our emergency relief team will have made,” the official added. “For humanitarian aid to be sustainable, it ought to be packaged with development assistance, which could serve as a stepping-stone to reconstruction. Given the U.N.

The ministry said the vehicles were used to ferry animals to and from the four areas cited.""It is unlikely that FMD will spread all across the country as in 2010, but newer cases are still possible,"" an official source said.He said that in order to counter such threats, the country plans to import enough vaccine for about 1.6 million animals this month.Besides such measures, the ministry said it will keep data on all farms reporting outbreaks and take action against those that have been affected by the animal disease time and again.It said quarantine inspections at airports and port terminals will be strengthened, and more will be done to develop FMD vaccines in the country.Since Dec. 3, 50 cases of FMD have been reported in 13 cities and counties across the country, resulting in the culling of 44,313 animals so far.

It was the fourth-largest quake to hit the Korean Peninsula since seismic monitoring began in 1978. The temblor shook homes and other structures in Taean and Seosan and was felt even in Seoul, Incheon and its adjacent areas, but there were no reports of serious damage.Of the total quakes, 23 hit inland regions with the remainder occurring beneath the sea. By region, 10 quakes were detected in the southeastern city of Daegu and its surrounding North Gyeongsang Province, and seven in North Korea. South Korea is deemed relatively safe from major earthquakes as it is situated deep inside the Eurasian tectonic plate, with the closest major fault line a thousand kilometers away.

But the patient requires further monitoring since test results only become conclusive six to 10 days after exposure to the virus, they said.The worker is one of a 10-member South Korean medical team dispatched to an Ebola clinic operated by Britain in Goderich, near Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. The worker was flown to Berlin on Saturday in a U.S. air ambulance after the index finger came into contact with a needle through a partly ripped glove while collecting blood from an Ebola patient on Dec. 30. The worker sustained no external injuries, but will be monitored for three weeks, officials at the Berlin hospital said.An initial blood test came back negative for Ebola, they said.South Korea has agreements with European countries and the United States to evacuate its health care workers from West Africa to Europe for treatment if any of them contract the virus.Seoul's foreign ministry said it plans to closely cooperate with the German government and the hospital to follow the medical condition of the worker.South Korea will send 20 other medical workers in the coming months to the West African country as initially planned, it said.South Korea has joined global efforts to fight Ebola by sending medical workers and offering a combined US$12.6 million in assistance.
