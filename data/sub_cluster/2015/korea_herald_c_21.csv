K-Water said it will draw up detailed plans by the first half of next year to open a global theme park in Hwaseong, about 60 kilometers south of Seoul, by 2020, estimating that around 5 trillion won ($4.24 billion) will be invested into the project. The park envisioned on a plot spanning 4.2 square kilometers will include a Universal Studio theme park and Korean pop concert arena, as well as accommodations, a golf resort, a water park and a shopping center. The site is located about an hour drive from Seoul and close to Incheon International Airport. ""The global theme park is expected to help draw Chinese travelers as Chinese investors joined the project,"" K-Water said in a release, noting the project will be on track this time with government support.   Plans for the theme park were originally announced in 2007 amid hopes it would be up and running in 2012, but the project was delayed by the global financial crisis and put on hold in 2012 over land and infrastructure issues.

Companies within 500 meters of the stations will get priority in being able to apply for the name change. The qualification will be expanded to those within 1 kilometer if there are no applicants. The name will be determined by bidding, the city said.Two subway operators -- Seoul Metro and Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corp. -- will set up their own name review committee to screen the name candidates. Companies with a problematic reputation or a likeliness to tarnish the public image of the subway will be excluded, they said. The dual name contract will be valid for three years. Stations that already have dual names will also be ruled out from the new project, they added. As of now, 61 of the 307 Seoul City subway stations have dual names that include titles of nearby universities or district offices. Some cities have run similar projects according to the officials. Incheon and Daegu have allowed dual names for 18 and 10 stations, respectively, and both have earned more than 15 million won ($12,700) a year per station.

About 300 million won has been put aside for various domestic and overseas campaigns. Another 300 million won will be spent for the hallyu concert slated to be held next year on Oct. 28 in celebration of Seoul Citizens Day. Some 300 million won will also be used for overseas performances in such cities as Beijing and Paris.Seoul City officials explained that the budget is lower than originally planned and that they are planning to make up for the shortage by working with businesses and related organizations.The largest portion, 768 million won, will be used for online activities, such as to activate websites and social media awareness. The city currently runs the website in six different languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Japanese, Spanish and French. The city said that the largest portion of the budget and human resources are needed to remodel these websites using the new logo.

The detective Do-cheol (played by Hwang Jeong-min), as reflected in the above famous quote, is fierce, righteous, capable and, most of all, ethical. He does not exchange his dignity for his own safety, comfort or more money.Among many jobs in the world, some require more social responsibility than others. Theoretically, all police officers should strive to be like Do-cheol. But the portrayal of cops in Korean cinema hasn’t always been favorable, reflecting the nation’s modern history heavily influenced by military authoritarianism and frequent abuse of governmental authority. In many significant cinematic works, Korean cops are often linked with corruption, injustice, incompetence and even violation of human rights. A scene from “Memories of Murder” (Cydus)In the 2012 film “National Security,” which recounts torture suffered by late democracy activist Kim Geun-tae, one of its police officers is dubbed the “torture expert.” The character (played by Lee Gyung-young) was based on real-life police officer Lee Geun-an, who is notorious for torturing student activists during Chun Doo-hwan’s military regime in the 1980s. With Lee’s performance, the film successfully serves its obvious purpose -- to let its viewers witness the horrors experienced by democracy activists under Chun’s regime. The cop character is portrayed as ruthless and sadistic to victims, while being extremely loyal and obedient to his superiors. Starting with waterboarding, Lee administers electric shocks and forces Kim to swallow chili powder with water, while making sure Kim does not get any external scars and does not die. Then, in 2013 film “The Attorney,” viewers witnessed police officers who were similar to Lee in “National Security.” The film is inspired by late President Roh Moo-hyun’s earlier years as a lawyer in Busan. In it, the protagonist (based on Roh), who is enjoying a comfortable life as a tax lawyer, decides to devote himself to human rights after witnessing a university student brutally tortured by the police who accuse him of being a North Korean sympathizer. The officer who tortured the student shamelessly testifies in court that he followed the state’s order to torture the student, which enrages the protagonist. In the particular scene, the attorney famously shouts back at the officer, reciting Article 1 of the Korean Constitution: The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea shall reside in the people, and all state authority shall emanate from the people. A scene from “New World” (NEW)“Films don’t portray reality, but they certainly reflect how people view reality,” columnist Jeong Deok-hyeon wrote last year. “In ‘The Attorney,’ it is the government that destroys the young university student. It’s the government’s arrogance that even ignores its constitution. “In the 2008 crime thriller ‘The Chaser,’” he continued, “it is police incompetence that lets the serial killer run away and murder more victims. These films show how the Korean public perceives the public authority. The government is not trustworthy and therefore we have to protect ourselves.”In the 2000s, detective characters in films were more likeable -- although “old-fashioned.”Film critics Lee Jong-do and Kim Hyeon-jeong wrote in their 2005 piece that most of cop movies at the time -- “Memories of Murder” (2003), “Nowhere to Hide” (1999) -- feature detective characters who are “old fashioned” but “somehow favored by the viewers” -- “they curse all the time, seek fortune-tellers for advice, and feel there is nothing wrong with torturing their suspects” -- while introducing white-collar criminals, such as fund managers or former gangsters who illicitly established a successful business (“Public Enemy” (2002), “Beast” (2006)).“Korean films (in the 2000s) made old-fashioned and likable cops chase white-collar criminals who benefited from the neoliberal economy,” the critics wrote in the piece. “This reflects the collective feelings of loss among Koreans, after undergoing the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s including massive layoffs.”In the 2010s, Korea has arguably been welcoming more diverse police films. The 2013 film “Cold Eyes,” for example, featured detectives from the surveillance team of a special crime unit who work together to take down a bank-robbing organization. Another 2013 film, “New World,” featured a detective who is assigned by his selfish, manipulative boss to spy on one of the biggest crime organizations in the country. The detective’s undercover investigation goes on for eight years, and he eventually finds himself caught between the gang’s second-in-command who genuinely trusts and cares for him and his senior detective who only uses him while refusing to protect him when he is in need or in danger. The film blurred the boundaries between good and bad, legal and illegal -- and offered the question that many Koreans today are faced with in the aftermath of the 2014 Sewol disaster, a ferry that sank and killed 304 on board: What do we do when those who are supposed to protect us -- such as the public authority -- betray us?By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","significant cinematic works korean cops ,hit veteran cathartic action thriller ,positive portrayals of korean cops ,cinematic works korean cops ,cops chase white collar criminals","['korean', 'Hwang Jeong - min', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kim Geun - tae', 'Lee Gyung - young', 'Lee Geun - an', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Lee', 'Chun', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Roh Moo - hyun ’s', 'Busan', 'Roh', 'north korean', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Jeong Deok - hyeon', 'Chaser', 'korean', 'Lee Jong - do', 'Kim Hyeon', 'Koreans', 'asian', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66585368  0.28567201

Students who do not fulfill the 10-year duty after graduation must pay back their tuition to the government. The ministry plans to announce a more detailed proposal later this month.The proposal is based on a bill introduced by ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Lee Jung-hyun in May to establish a state-funded medical school to train professionals who will work in public health in remote regions upon graduation. The Health Ministry plans to support the bill, which is currently pending at the National Assembly, so it can be approved as soon as possible.Korea has struggled to fulfill the medical care needs in small, remote regions, with the number of health care workers at clinics in such areas declining from 4,000 in 2012 to 3,793 last year, according to the Health Ministry. Due to the low desire to work in rural areas, most of the doctors are young, inexperienced male professionals who are merely substituting their military duty with medical service. But as the proportion of female students enrolled in medical schools has increased in recent years, the number of male medical doctors available for the substitute military duty has declined, the ministry explained. Men aged 18-35 must serve for almost two years, while women are exempt from duty.South Jeolla Province is one of the country’s most vulnerable regions for health care access. It has 138 islands that lack medical facilities, pharmacies or resident health care workers. For residents of such islands, seeing a doctor means having to travel to Mokpo, or wait for the “floating hospital” ― a state-run ship that functions as a medical facility ― that visits about five times a year. “We believe that more doctors are needed to tackle this issue and really improve the health care services in remote regions across the country,” said Hwang Eui-su from the Health Ministry. “We need more doctors who are specialists in the field of public health.”However, the plan is fiercely opposed by the nation’s largest group of physicians, who claim that the Health Ministry does not understand why doctors do not want to be placed in remote regions in the first place. “Some of the reasons why medical professionals don’t want to be placed in remote regions include housing, fewer career opportunities and lack of (government) support for quality health care services,” the Korea Medical Association said in a statement. “Once those problems are solved, we believe more doctors from private medical institutions would volunteer to work in the field of public health. By establishing a separate school, the government is wasting a lot of tax money to avoid solving the actual problems.”The KMA suggested the Health Ministry work with existing universities to create plans to train some of its matriculated students as future specialists in public health, as the current system already produces a surplus of doctors and is triggering severe competition in the industry.The KMA has also opposed the government’s push to introduce telemedicine ― the use of information technology through smart devices to remotely provide clinical health care to improve services to isolated regions ― claiming it would only lower the quality of services and jeopardize the operations of small local clinics and regional hospitals.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The conference is set to run through Dec. 11 to try to produce a deal that will be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.More than 160 countries -- which account for about 90 percent of global emissions -- have put forward climate targets for post-2020.Park has said responses to climate change should be as viewed as ""an opportunity to secure a new growth engine, not a burden.""In June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it lets business run as usual.Earlier this month, Park and other leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum said they are ""firmly committed to achieving a fair, balanced, ambitious, durable, and dynamic agreement on climate change"" during the conference to be held in Paris.Also in Paris, Park is set to meet with the head of UNESCO, the U.N. cultural agency, according to Kim Kyou-hyun, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs.The trip will also take Park to Prague for a summit with the leaders of the so-called Visegrad Group countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.Park also plans to hold separate summits with the leaders of the four countries in Prague where she will make an official visit for the 25th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations.Park plans to hold in-depth discussions with the leaders on South Korean companies' possible participation in major infrastructure projects being pursued by the four countries.

The Seoul Turkish Film Festival at Arirang Cine Center from Nov. 25-28 was a collaboration between the municipalities of Beyoglu in Istanbul and Seongbuk-gu in Seoul, the Turkish Cinema and Audiovisual Culture Foundation, the Turkish Prime Ministry and the Turkish embassy. Internationally recognized films “The Goal of My Life” (2008), “Night of Silence” (2012), “Once upon a Time” (2015), “Mix Tape” (2014) and “But Muzeyyen, That’s the Deepest Desire” (2014) were shown, along with “The Extremely Tragic Story of Celal Tan and his Family” (2011), which was showcased at the opening ceremony on Wednesday. The event was attended by film directors and cast members Reyis Celik, Muge Ulusoy, Ali Aksoz and Selcuk Yontem. (From left) The Turkish Ambassador’s spouse Pinar Okcal, Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal, actor Selcuk Yontem and actress Muge Ulusoy pose at the Seoul Turkish Film Festival at Arirang Cine Center on Wednesday. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald.“The Turkish cinema industry, which celebrated its centennial anniversary last year, has been critically acclaimed around the world in recent decades,” Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal said in a speech. “It is remarkable that the Beyoglu municipality in Istanbul has organized this event, as it has been the heart of our 100-year-old national cinema as well as the city’s cultural center.” The first Turkish film was a documentary titled “Demolition of the Russian Monument at San Stefano,” directed by Fuat Uzkinay in 1914. Making use of the postwar cultural space, Turkey’s cinema boomed along the narrow Yesilcam Street in Beyoglu, where actors, directors, technical workers and studios congregated. During its heydays from the 1950s to ’70s, Yesilcam, meaning the “Green Pine,” came to represent the national industry, producing between 250 and 350 movies a year. From the 1960s to the early 1970s, Turkey became the world’s fifth-largest producer with around 300 movies generated annually. The industry saw a decline in the 1980s with the rise of television, but Yesilcam has been on a path of revitalization since 2002, with renewed global interest in Turkish culture through films such as “Uzak,” “Babam ve Oglum” and “Propaganda.” (From left) A Korean translator, Beyoglu Municipality project manager Derya Can, Prime Ministry representative Yusuf Sogutdelen, Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal and Seongbuk-gu Municipality Mayor Kim Young-bae. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldOkcal also highlighted that the six showcased films achieved “remarkable” box office success in Turkey, also mentioning other international hits, such as the director Metin Erksan’s “Dry Summer,” which won the Golden Bear Award at the 1964 Berlin Film Festival and Yilmaz Guney’s “The Road,” which won the Palm d’Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Building on these successes, later generations of filmmakers, such as Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Fatih Akin and Ferzan Ozpetek, have triumphed at prominent international festivals, including Cannes, the Oscars, the Berlin festival, the Venice festival and the Montreal festival.In recent years, Turkish cinema has found popular audiences also in Europe, the Middle East, the United States and Asia. “A nation’s history does not exist without culture. Culture and the arts produce a nation,” said film director Reyis Celik, who participated in the opening ceremony. “Korea is famous for its high-tech products, but as artists, we are not interested in that. We developed curiosity about Korea through your deep films.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","the seoul turkish film festival ,seoul featuring six representative turkish ,festival last week in seoul ,seoul turkish film festival at ,seoul turkish film festival","['Turkey', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'turkish', 'Beyoglu', 'Istanbul', 'Seoul', 'turkish', 'Reyis Celik', 'Ali Aksoz', 'Selcuk Yontem', 'turkish', 'Pinar Okcal', 'turkish', 'Arslan Hakan Okcal', 'Selcuk Yontem', 'Muge Ulusoy', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'turkish', 'turkish', 'Arslan Hakan Okcal', 'Beyoglu', 'Istanbul', 'turkish', 'Fuat Uzkinay', 'Turkey', 'Beyoglu', 'Yesilcam', 'Turkey', 'yesilcam', 'turkish', 'uzak', 'Propaganda', 'korean', 'Beyoglu Municipality', 'Derya can', 'Prime Ministry', 'Yusuf Sogutdelen', 'turkish', 'Arslan Hakan', 'Kim Young', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea HeraldOkcal', 'Turkey', 'Metin Erksan ’s', 'Yilmaz Guney ’s', 'Nuri Bilge Ceylan', 'Berlin', 'Venice', 'Montreal', 'turkish', 'the United States', 'Reyis Celik', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18701538  0.47651541

To create a mingling spot where artists and people share their stories, she opened a small eatery with an investment of over 100 million won ($86,300). Despite many regular customers, she has faced a dilemma as to whether she should continue the business, mainly due to an increase in her rent.“The two-year-long contract will terminate next summer and the building owner will definitely raise the rent. I always have that anxiety that I can be pushed out anytime soon,” Kim told The Korea Herald. Kim is one of many small business owners who face the impact of gentrification, the phenomenon of old urban neighborhoods being purchased and renovated by wealthier individuals, often leaving small businesses displaced. A street in Hongdae, Seoul. (The Korea Herald)Public concerns have recently surged over excessive gentrification in regions like Hongdae that gained popularity over time with a unique culture and history of their own. The more hip the locations became, the higher the property value rose, leading to an ouster of those who helped create the region’s identity and diversity. Some argue it is inevitable for urban development. As part of efforts to sustain the uniqueness of cultural communities and secure the home of original residents and business owners in the neighborhoods, Seoul City on Monday vowed to take a set of antigentrification measures. Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would inject nearly 20 billion won to six areas and construct an “anchor facility” at each area to offer low-cost spaces for small entrepreneurs. They are: areas spanning from Daehangno to Insa-dong, Sinchon areas including Hongdae and Hapjeong, a region encompassing Bukchon and Seochon, Haebangchon and Sewoon plaza, a street downtown occupied by lines of electric and lighting shops.For example, a play mall of 20 theaters will be constructed in the theater district of Daehangno in Jongno. The space, for which construction will kick off in 2017, will be rented at low cost, officials said. The city said it would dissuade building owners in the six regions from increasing rental fees by mediating negotiations between them and small entrepreneurs.To encourage building owners to do so, the city will offer incentives of up to 30 million won to remodel or reinforce the facility in return for fixing the rental fee for a certain amount of time for small businesses. The city will also offer a low-interest loan program for small businesses to support them in purchasing the buildings on their own. To support those facing conflicts with building owners, the city will provide free legal counseling services. A group of volunteer experts, comprised of 33 lawyers and 27 tax accountants, will be mobilized. The municipality’s initiatives against gentrification can draw a meaningful impact, experts said. “This can serve as an ‘invitation’ to landlords to participate in the move to prevent gentrification and sustain the region’s identity. Once the area loses its unique identity and visitors, the building owners will also be the ones facing damages. The landlords’ efforts are crucial,” said urban planning and design professor Jeong Seok from the University of Seoul. Giving financial incentive, however, can also invite those with ulterior motives, he said.“It could backfire and escalate gentrification with those attempting to abuse the benefits. Therefore, the city must meticulously design the measures and make sure the benefits go to small business owners rather than landlords or conglomerates,” he added.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","30 million won to remodel ,neighborhoods seoul city on monday ,since last summer in seochon ,summer in seochon jongno seoul ,businesses displaced street in hongdae","['Kim', 'Seochon', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Hongdae', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Daehangno', 'Hongdae', 'Hapjeong', 'Bukchon', 'Seochon', 'Daehangno', 'Jongno', 'Jeong Seok', 'the University of Seoul', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.89090377  0.2082603

Noting that 3.7 million Koreans traveled to Southeast Asia out of the 14.6 million touring abroad last year, Ramli said that many of them revisited “because they miss our food.”Last year, Korea’s trade with ASEAN was $138 billion, second only to China. For the food industry, bilateral trade reached $4.3 billion and $3 billion through September this year, evidence of the increasing number of Koreans craving exotic international flavors.

If one end of the ship begins to take water, we are all at risk. We swim or sink together in the long term, particularly when it comes to climate change,” he said. Kofi Annan (One Young World)The Nobel Peace Prize laureate stressed the necessity of a binding agreement from the 21st Conference of Parties slated in Paris on Nov. 30-Dec. 11. He also urged developed countries to shoulder more responsibilities and take more actions in responding to climate change. Annan’s resolve was echoed by other councilors and 1,300 delegates from 196 countries between ages 18 and 30, who shared their efforts to reduce waste, manage resources and contain the irreversible effects of climate change. Gary White, summit councilor and founder of Water.org, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to providing sanitation and safe water, also discussed destructive effects of climate change that can occur through water such as droughts and rising sea levels.Bryant Zebedy, a youth delegate from the Marshall Islands, delivered a speech calling for measures to ensure that his country and other Pacific islands would not perish under the rising sea levels caused by climate change. “Now that global warming is in process, human activities are just there to rush the threat (of rising sea levels). We need to change the way we treat our ocean. I will not sit around and watch my nation fall apart from the impacts of global warming,” he said in an emotional speech that received a standing ovation.Kim Min-woo, a delegate from South Korea, called on President Park Geun-hye to make more contributions in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent climate change. He said the South Korean government should implement policies that provide incentives for low-carbon emission products while taking on a greater role in environmental goods agreements that eliminate trade barriers on environmentally focused goods and services.In addition, he has started a campaign called #lickitclean inviting consumers to help reduce food waste in a two-track effort coupled with governmental policies. “Responsibility shows ability, more responsibility for the environment and to show South Korea’s ability to make a change,” Kim said.By Yoon Min-sik, Korea Herald correspondent (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","climate change gary white summit ,climate change speaking to prominent ,thursday urged world leaders ,climate change now that global ,tackle climate change speaking to","['U.N.', 'Kofi Annan', 'Young World', 'Bangkok', 'Annan', 'Paris', 'Annan ’s', 'Gary White', 'Water.org', 'Bryant Zebedy', 'the Marshall Islands', 'Kim Min - woo', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'south korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim', 'Yoon Min - sik', 'Korea Herald']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.64367336  0.43594569

She proposed revitalizing the service industry that already accounts for two-thirds of the region’s combined gross domestic product.The annual summit brought together leaders of the 21 member states, which account for nearly 60 percent of global gross domestic product and almost half of world trade.Park also exchanged views with APEC leaders on ways to maximize the benefits produced by the regional economic bloc amid focus shifting to a new, Washington-led regional trade bloc. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a free trade pact signed by 12 Pacific Rim economies including Japan, but neither South Korea nor China.Experts have raised concerns that the APEC will face challenges by the TPP as the new trade deal goal resembles the regional pact launched in 1989 to promote free trade. Non-TPP members could be excluded from benefits expected from the new trade deal, they said.The rivalry between Beijing and Washington was palpable as TPP members celebrated their new trade pact on the sidelines of the APEC summit with U.S. President Obama attending, while Chinese President Xi Jinping urged creating alternatives including the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.Park was seen playing both cards, as she said at the summit that South Korea plans to actively participate in the new trade blocs led by Beijing ― a remark that came after she expressed her keen interest in the TPP.“I expect the region to secure inclusive growth and open regionalism in the course of various economic integration process,” she said.During her trip to Washington last month, Park said the TPP will bring benefits for South Korean businesses, amid widespread criticism of the country’s hesitance to participate in the U.S.-led trade bloc.Also taking center stage at the APEC summit were last week’s Paris terror attacks and the members’ pledge to fight against terrorism.The leaders wrapped up their summit later in the day adopting a joint statement that included a condemnation of Islamic State, the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks.On the sidelines of the APEC summit, Park also met with her Peruvian counterpart Ollanta Humala to discuss ways to expand bilateral cooperation.Park told Humala that the South Korean government has been making efforts to intensify the bilateral ties by implementing agreements reached during a summit held in Peru in April.Under a 2012 deal, sole Korean aircraft manufacturer Korea Aerospace Industries is helping Peru assemble 16 turboprop planes called KT-1P for the Peruvian Air Force. Separately, KAI has already built and delivered four trainers to Peru.Humala said he expects to have more Korean businesses participating in Peru’s infrastructure building projects. Park was sitting next to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the first session of the APEC summit and stood next to him for a group photo. The two had held their first-ever summit in Seoul earlier this month.Meanwhile, Abe and his wife sat next to U.S. President Obama during a banquet held on Wednesday while Park sat next to Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, drawing media attention for illustrating the closer ties between Japan and the U.S.By Cho Chung-un, news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","president obama during banquet held ,more korean businesses participating ,manila park also suggested smes ,thursday urged leaders participating ,summit with president obama attending","['Park Geun - hye', 'Manila', 'Park', 'APEC', 'Washington', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'China', 'APEC', 'TPP', 'Non - TPP', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'TPP', 'APEC', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'the Free Trade Area', 'the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'Park', 'TPP', 'south korean', 'APEC', 'Paris', 'Islamic', 'APEC', 'Park', 'peruvian', 'Ollanta Humala', 'Humala', 'south korean', 'Peru', 'korean', 'Korea Aerospace Industries', 'Peru', 'KAI', 'Peru', 'Humala', 'korean', 'Peru', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'APEC', 'Seoul', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'russian', 'Dmitry Medvedev', 'Japan', 'Cho Chung - un']",11,"[ 2.          1.          0.         ... -0.16750826  0.78393716

How foolish.”These remarks were all made during the church’s annual speech contest on patriotism in June. ""The church did not organize the event. The kindergarten class autonomously made decision to hold it,"" an official at the church said in response to the controversy. According to local online news outlet Media Today, the church-organized speech contest began in 2007, with contestants ranging from kindergarten children to elementary school students and middle school students across the country. Military officers and soldiers in active service were reportedly included in the contest's judge panel.

It aims to be an annual festivity from next year by engaging public-private partnerships on both sides. The Drums of India, led by Gilles Chuen (center), performs at the inauguralreception for the Festival of India in Korea at Millennium Seoul Hilton on Nov. 9. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“We have chosen the word ‘Sarang,’ which means ‘love’ in Korean and ‘colorful’ in Indian, to celebrate our friendship across ancient and modern times,” Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami told guests at an opening reception at Millennium Seoul Hilton on Nov. 9. “After all, our relationship was established 2,000 years ago when Indian Queen Suriratna married Korean King Gim Suro, the founder of Geumgwan Gaya Dynasty (A.D. 43-532) in southeastern Korea.” “Sarang” also depicts “the vibrant tapestry of colors” that represents the Indian culture, the envoy noted, adding that the two countries are working to identify common grounds for future collaboration. At the inaugural ceremony, the Drums of India, an ensemble of percussion instruments from across the South Asian country, staged an energetic live performance, with performer Gilles Chuen dancing in the center. “In today’s frenetic modern age, we find a greater need to connect ourselves through traditions that bind us civilizationally,” Doraiswami told The Korea Herald. “This festival is an appetizer for the larger repast that is India’s diverse and unique culture,” he added. “We want to energize two-way flows of ideas, commerce and people, and recapture the spirit of enterprise and creativity that bound our ancestors together.”The ambassador thanked and awarded the event’s main sponsor Hyundai Motors, and associate sponsors Mahindra Ssangyong, Tata Daewoo and Aditya Birla Novelis. (From left) Teamwork Arts managing director Sanjoy Roy, Teamwork Arts senior executive producer Vasundhara Mehta, Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami and his spouse Sangeeta Doraiswami, and Hyundai Motor Group vice president Kim Dong-wook. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldTeamwork Arts managing director Sanjoy Roy said: “India lives in many centuries at the same time. We have great wealth and poverty. But unlike many other nations, both sides live together in harmony through democracy.”Every 100 meters in India, everything changes, from the way people think and speak to how they dress and eat, the artistic director said. “The festival is an attempt to reach out to the Korean people and capture their minds, so that we can become long-term partners in our journey toward progress and prosperity,” he said.While expressing appreciation to Hyundai Motors, which has operated in India for over 20 years, Roy highlighted that India’s growth aided Korea’s own progress in myriad ways. He also stressed the importance of understanding other cultures, histories, philosophies and traditions in becoming an effective partner in a global economy. Teamwork Arts has been introducing India’s culture to the world since it was established by Roy in 1989. The versatile cultural production agency covers various performing and visual arts, literature, film, television and charity, and has organized over 25 festivals in more than 40 cities around the world.

25,25,[Herald Interview] Looking for silver lining in climate change,"When it comes to curbing climate change, Norwegian scientist Jorgen Randers is a disbeliever. “I’m a pessimist because I do not think humanity will go the extra lengths to stop the earth from degenerating,” the coauthor of influential book “The Limits to Growth” (1972) told The Korea Herald on Thursday. “But I’m working hard and hoping that it will.

Humanity is capable of preventing such scenarios. The question is whether they will decide to do so.”The 70-year-old professor at the BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo has been warning of an impending global environmental crisis for more than four decades. As the clock ticked toward the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Paris from Nov. 30-Dec. 11, with the goal to forge a legally binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, Randers offered a stern prognosis devoid of efforts to look politically correct. He visited Korea to participate in the Seoul International Energy Conference 2015 on Wednesday, where he advised Mayor Park Won-soon on making Seoul a people-oriented city using sustainable energies and policies.  Jorgen Randers, professor at the BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo and author of 1972 influential book “The Limits to Growth,” speaks to The Korea Herald about the impending environmental catastrophes and urgent steps needed to tackle them. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)For the last several decades, climate scientists around the world have been drumming up gloomy forecasts of floods, droughts, hurricanes, rising seas, devastated agriculture and disappearing wildlife. Randers, who followed his 1972 seminal book with “2052 - A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years,” in 2012 said he was convinced that over the next forty years the arc of history would tilt toward his grim predictions. His new book describes in detail the consequences and implications of the current path of global development “in the vacuum of extraordinary actions,” covering population, economy, energy, environment and climate. The academic claimed that the world temperature would rise above 2 degrees Celsius by 2052, and 3 degrees Celsius by 2080, where it would stay for roughly a thousand years, the half-life of CO2. “Is it bad?” he asked, quickly answering: “Yes, it is. Dramatic action is required, such as capturing and storing the carbon released into the atmosphere.”Having served as the former director-general of the World Wide Fund for Nature in Switzerland, Randers projected that the low-lying Bangladesh, parts of the Mediterranean and islands in the Pacific were going to be hit particularly hard as seawaters rise about 30 centimeters. “Summer will get longer and hotter, the dry areas will become drier and life will be over for most polar bears, except those living north of Canada,” he underscored. “For us, these will be more inconveniences than catastrophes. Life will be unnecessarily complicated and unpleasant.”The key problem, according to the intellectual, lies in the short-sighted nature of democracy, which caters to immediate populist demands rather than longer-term public interests. Global institutions such as the United Nations had “very limited ability” to administer the critically needed cures, he asserted, as the representative negotiators were constrained by their national parliaments. “The parliaments themselves, full of wise politicians, are checked by the voters, who don’t want higher taxes, more regulations or expensive energies. As a result, they can’t commit to dramatic cuts and changes.”Unlike the democracies, Randers argued that China’s authoritative style of government was actually better at solving the world’s problems. “The only real mover in the world today is China,” he said. “Its unique governance based on an ‘enlightened dictatorship’ allows the Chinese Communist Party to rule above the popular mandate.”Highlighting China’s rapid ascendance since the market-oriented reforms were put into effect in the late 1970s, the scholar explained that the Chinese government was “delicately balancing” its interests between wealth creation and growth management. China, which has added a great deal to climate change, is now moving briskly to improve energy efficiency, switching to renewables and limiting CO2 emissions by 2030, under the auspices of five-year plans, he pointed out. “They are doing this because in the long run, China itself benefits from a better climate,” the scholar said. “Rainfall has moved from the populous northeastern China to the southwest, where there is excess water. Deserts are creeping in from the northwest.”For the rest of the world, a brighter future could be obtained by shifting 2 percent of the world’s capital and labor from the “dirty” coal, oil and gas industries to the “clean” wind, solar and hydro energies, he indicated. As necessary steps, he added, population growth must be curtailed worldwide, particularly in advanced countries, to reduce ecological footprints; carbon emissions must be trimmed by taxing polluters and subsidizing renewables; and poverty must be eliminated and renewable energy capacity must be strengthened in poor countries. Randers also suggested promoting a higher environmental awareness and diverse well-being away from materialism. Nuclear power must be phased out, he emphasized. “It is ‘immoral’ to pass onto the later generations our own nuclear wastes and associated costs.”Korea was “rich and civilized enough” to depart from nuclear and adopt renewables, he said, which were becoming cheaper around the world. The professor praised the Seoul government for its sustainable urban policies under the banner “One Less Nuclear Power Plant Policy,” introduced at the ICLEI World Congress in Seoul in April.Declared as the “Promise of Seoul: Taking Actions against Climate Change,” the plans include: cutting CO2 emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 40 percent by 2030; sharing energy with underprivileged communities; clipping greenhouse gas and air pollutants in an integrated system; encouraging recycling and slashing food waste; saving water; harnessing biodiversity; expanding urban farming; protecting public health from infectious diseases and heat waves; preventing climate disasters; and bolstering related international coalitions. “What’s lacking is the popular will to implement it,” Randers said. “Mayor Park will have to collect more taxes to translate these plans into actions.” Noting Korea’s world-class expertise in information technology, National Strategy for Green Growth (2009-50) and hosting of international institutions such as the Green Climate Fund in the Songdo district of Incheon, the professor said Korea had the potential to lead the world in sustainable development. “You are now a laboratory for an embryonic green economy,” he said. “After developing your competence, you will be able to sell it around the world.” By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","curbing climate change norwegian scientist ,climate change norwegian scientist ,climate change norwegian scientist jorgen ,against climate change the plans ,to curbing climate change norwegian","['norwegian', 'Jorgen Randers', 'the Korea Herald', 'the BI Norwegian Business School', 'Oslo', 'United Nations Climate Change Conference', 'Paris', 'Korea', 'the Seoul International Energy Conference', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Jorgen Randers', 'the BI Norwegian Business School', 'Oslo', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'the World Wide Fund for Nature', 'Switzerland', 'Bangladesh', 'Canada', 'the United Nations', 'Randers', 'China', 'China', 'the Chinese Communist Party', 'China', 'chinese', 'China', 'China', 'rainfall', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'note Korea ’s', 'National Strategy for', 'the Green Climate Fund', 'Incheon', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.6067608   0.70982742

Personally though, after having spent most of my advertising career trying to avoid puns, it was a little too familiar and had connotations with dating websites.‘Seouling’ ticked the boxes when it came to being different and active. But it made me feel that Seoul was a very busy place that, perhaps, didn’t have time to stop to get to know me.So of three choices given to me, I chose ‘I.Seoul.U’, which also turned out be the unanimous choice of the eight other people on the panel.Beyond its strategic friendly intent -- I felt that it was a fresh, modern and flexible brand. Especially as you could put all the delights of Seoul in between the ‘I and you’ of the logo. (Luke Ashton)To me, Seoul (and Korea) represents a dynamic person that is not afraid to give things a go and the new positioning reflects that.Since its adoption, I’ve noticed it has received plenty of attention, both positive and negative, which is to be expected with a new city brand.Words, symbols and pictures take on new meanings as you live with them and they develop their own personality. So, I’d like to think that this great experiment is rewarded by the world looking at Seoul as a friendly, vibrant and free-thinking city that is prepared to step away from the familiar city brands we see around the world -- to deliver new ideas.For what it’s worth, in the U.K., the London 2012 Olympic logo more than polarized opinion when it was launched, with many people disliking the almost childlike design and typography.But as everyone in London lived with it for a while and the logo was exploded into the graphic design across the marketing materials and the venues themselves - it really did look and feel fantastic, and most visitors from around the world were not even aware that it had been a controversial choice.So, let’s all see in a few months time how it feels. After all, the two young designers who came up with the idea and the team who helped them bring it to life, deserve for their creation to be given some breathing space to grow in our hearts and minds.By Luke AshtonThe writer is the global creative director of Cheil Worldwide and one of the nine people on the Seoul city branding panel.

Of those surveyed, more than half choose to work to pay for housing. About 33 percent of dual-income newlyweds said they were working to save money to buy a house, while some 17 percent said they needed two incomes to pay off their mortgage. About 15 percent of couples said they needed to work to afford living expenses in Seoul, while some 14 percent said they both work jobs to enjoy an affluent lifestyle. Only about 10 percent cited career reasons for both of them working.Consequently, the majority of newlyweds in Seoul were most interested in improving their financial condition. About 34 percent said they most wanted to increase their income or wealth, while 9.9 percent and 10.3 percent said their priorities were to purchase a house and pay off the debts, respectively. While young couples nationwide cited “nurturing kids” as the prime interest in their marriage, the issue ranked second among Seoul’s newlyweds’ priorities in married life -- about 30 percent said raising kids was the major interest in their marriage.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","in newlywed couples in seoul ,newlywed couples in seoul with ,newlywed couples in seoul ,ranked second among seoul newlyweds ,majority of newlyweds in seoul","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Institute ’s', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82226342  0.45614547

Under the name of “Seoul Station 7017 Project,” the city aims to boost the neighboring markets while preserving the historic heritage.  A one-day public event is held at the overpass in central Seoul as part of the city’s efforts to promote the “Seoul High Line Park” scheme on May 10. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)The plan faced resistance due to budget concerns and protests by local shopkeepers who were worried about the effect on sales. The police have also hampered the park scheme, citing traffic problems it would cause. The flyover, which is 17 meters above ground, has connected the city center to the western region since the 1970s. As decades passed, however, it was assessed to be too old to sustain. It received a “D” grade in a safety test in 2006 and was recommended to be demolished in a few years, prompting the mayor to pledge to remodel it rather than tear it down due to its historical significance.To open the park in early 2017 as scheduled, the city planned to start restricting the flyover traffic, demolish the old sections of the road and initiate the reinforcement operation from this month. By law, the city government can discretionally tear down construction or control and restrict the traffic if there are public safety risks. In order to minimize the potential traffic congestion near the flyover, Seoul City sought approval from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency more than six months ago for installing five new traffic signals around the flyover. The police, however, put the proposal on hold twice -- in July and August -- citing insufficient backup plans, which Seoul City has said is “regretful.” “The city cannot help but raise ‘reasonable’ suspicion that the police made the decision with a political motive,” said Seoul City spokesperson Kim In-cheol in early September. “While the city has actively discussed the traffic measures with the police at the working level since October last year, the police suspended the review over practically trivial matters that can be easily improved.”Some raised speculation that the police action was influenced by the central government to contain Park who is considered a potential presidential candidate from the main opposition party. “The overpass was graded D again in 2012, with only two to three years of time left. It’s necessary to tear it down no later than this year,” said a Seoul City official said. The police flatly denied the claim, claiming that it was merely the city’s interpretation. Safety concerns arose in January last year after one of the flyover’s concrete floor plates fell to the ground. Over 93 percent of the 220 supporting structures of the flyover were graded the lowest level “E” last year, officials said. The police then asked the city in September to get the opinion of the Transport Ministry, saying that the decision to change the traffic routes is under its discretion.The ministry, however, referred back to the police, refusing to get involved. The police on Tuesday reiterated that they would review the new traffic signal plan once the city receives the ministry’s approval. Regardless of the “Seoul High Line Park” plan, Seoul City said it would restrict the overpass traffic and partially tear down the structure from next month on its own authority, citing safety concerns. The potential traffic congestion problem is expected to remain until the tug-of-war between the city and the police is resolved.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","last year seoul mayor park ,mayor to pledge to remodel ,congestion near the flyover seoul ,year seoul mayor park won ,september last year seoul mayor","['Seoul', 'Seoul Station', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Korea', 'New York ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul City', 'Kim In - cheol', 'Park', 'Seoul City', 'the Transport Ministry', 'Seoul City', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60686755  0.61125618

The law schools officially do not have an age restriction for applicants.  (Yonhap)“Only a single-digit percentage of the students at Korea’s top law schools including Seoul National University, Yonsei University and Korea University are in their 30s or older,” Yim Je-hyuk, spokesperson for the Seoul Bar Association told The Korea Herald. “There seems to be some sort of discrimination in the admissions process against older applicants. The schools should remove the section requiring age-related information in the application forms.” According to data submitted to Rep. Kim Jin-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party by the Education Ministry, 82.4 percent of the 10,439 newly enrolled students at law schools nationwide from 2011 to 2015 were 20-somethings. The tendency was especially pronounced at the nation’s most prominent law schools. Nearly 98 percent of new students at Seoul National University during the period were in their 20s, with Korea University and Yonsei University having 99.5 percent and 96.2 percent, respectively.The universities’ preference for 20-something applicants, however, could erode the purpose of the introduction of the law school system, Yim noted.“Law schools were established to nurture legal professionals equipped with various experiences and backgrounds. But age discrimination goes against the purpose,” he said. The lawyers’ group also pointed out that such discrimination could lower the chances for poor students to enter the legal sector, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor. “The law schools are open to only students from wealthy families who can graduate from undergraduate schools within four years without having to worry about tuition fees and living expenses,” Yim said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","old applicants the seoul bar ,students at korea top law ,students at law schools nationwide ,top law schools including seoul ,watchdog on friday accusing the","['South Korea ’s', 'the Seoul Bar Association', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Seoul National University', 'Yonsei University', 'Korea University', 'Yim Je - hyuk', 'the Seoul Bar Association', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Jin - tae', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul National University', 'Korea University', 'Yonsei University', 'Yim', 'Yim']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44519064  0.28171411

Seoul Metropolitan Government said that it would offer 500,000 won ($440) a month starting from next year for unemployed young people aged between 19 and 29 who are in the low-income bracket. The city will provide the subsidy to 3,000 individuals on a trial basis for up to six months and expand the number to 15,000 over the next five years. A total of 9 billion won will be injected in the first year, officials said. This is part of the city’s five-year youth support plan that will be pushed from next year. It encompasses support for housing, work and activities for the youth. “It is aimed at providing a stepping-stone with minimum financial support for the unemployed youth who have failed in entering the labor market or in getting work opportunities due to low self-esteem,” said Seoul City official Jun Hyo-kwan, who heads the youth support project. About 35 percent of those in their 20s in the capital, or 500,000 individuals, are part-time workers, those postponing school graduation for job hunting or those not in education, employment or training, officials said. Concerns, however, remain over the efficacy of the plan and potential cases where the measures could be abused. While the city said it would select the 3,000 individuals based on the application review which would ask about their future career plans, it has not been determined so far how the city will evaluate and screen the applicants. Planning is still underway, the city added.“I’m optimistic of the city’s attempt and efforts to support the unemployed youth, but it will be crucial for the city to come up with specific plans over how to raise the efficacy of the project, including the screening process of the beneficiaries,” social welfare professor Han Chang-keun at Sungkyunkwan University told The Korea Herald.The city may also face obstacles in implementing the project as the Welfare Ministry considers the city’s scheme requires discussion with the central government over its relevance to various welfare laws. The city, however, claimed the project can be pushed under the city’s independent ordinance.

Even for older children and teenagers aged 10-19, the mortality rate was much higher among those disabled than the non-disabled. While 308.3 per 100,000 disabled children died in 2012, 18.8 per 100,000 nondisabled children died in the same year.As of this year, there are only 16 medical institutions that specialize in rehabilitation treatments for the physically disabled nationwide. The National Rehabilitation Center, many children with disabilities require rehabilitation services. For instance, children in need of rehabilitation may have aphasia, developmental delays or motor impairments due to cerebral palsy. By not receiving rehabilitation on time, children with disabilities may miss opportunities to gain physical independence, increase functional abilities and improve their quality of life. It can also severely affect their general health condition, especially if they have a severe form of physical disability, reports said.“Attention to early childhood development is important for all children, but it is particularly important for children with disabilities,” said a UNICEF report released in 2013. “Early identification and assessment of a child’s disability helps identify causes and provide a diagnosis, such as cognitive delay, cerebral palsy or deafness, that allow parents, health care providers, teachers and others to better understand and plan for the needs of children.”According to UNICEF, there is a lack of significant services for children with disabilities in fields such as speech therapy, physiotherapy and sign language instruction, as well as basic medications, such as those for epilepsy, worldwide. The Health Ministry said it is planning to increase the number of medical institutions that specialize in rehabilitation for people with disabilities. “We are thinking about coming up with a separate insurance system just for such institutions, so more people can benefit from the services while more facilities can make a profit out of providing rehabilitation treatments,” a Health Ministry official said.

On Oct. 28, “I.Seoul.U” was picked as the capital’s new logo by a public vote, beating two other candidates -- “Seouling” and “Seoulmate.” The new slogan will replace “Hi Seoul,” which has been used for 13 years.  Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon (center) and guests hold up a placard with the city’s new brand, “I.SEOUL.U,” at a ceremony held at Seoul Plaza on Oct. 28. (Yonhap)“I wanted to deliver the message of ‘let’s make Seoul City together that is ever-changing vibrant and dynamic even at this moment’,” said Korean undergraduate Lee Ha-rin, who came up with the slogan idea. The slogan aimed at emphasizing the city where “you and I” coexist, with the red and blue dots symbolizing passion and relaxation, respectively, she added. Many, however, raised eyebrows at the slogan, calling it nonsensical “Konglish” with an ambiguous meaning. “As a Korean designer, I’m embarrassed, to be frank. Despite the simple words, the forced listing of them confuses the meaning,” said Sohn Hye-won, the public relations chief of main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The branding guru, renowned for making catchy commercial phrases, participated in the first round of the logo candidate screening. The city, however, defended the slogan, stressing that wordplay was a new trend in city branding. In the past, most city branding tended to focus on symbolizing representative architecture or animals in an aim to better identify and promote the image of cities like Melbourne. The selection process was also led by the city authorities or marketing experts.Cities then gradually moved toward linguistic expressions to better attract tourists, such as “Uniquely Singapore,” “Definitely Dubai” or “Yes! Tokyo.” Seoul’s decadelong logo “Hi, Seoul” along with “Dynamic Korea” are in this category, officials said. These days, however, cities are turning to a new slogan type that focuses on wordplay and leaves the interpretation open to the public rather than defining the meaning. “Be Berlin,” “I amsterdam” and “& Tokyo” are examples that do not make perfect linguistic sense but leave the interpretation open to the public. The slogans of Berlin and Amsterdam reportedly drew similar concerns in the initial stages over the grammar problems, city sources said. “What we wanted for the new slogan was an open-ended platform that leaves room for the public to freely share and modify it just like ‘be Berlin’ and ‘I amsterdam,’” said Soongsil University journalism professor Kim Min-ki, who led Seoul City’s branding team. Unlike the two previous slogan trends, another characteristic of the new city branding trend is that the ideas are crowdsourced. Since July, Seoul City gathered over 16,000 slogan ideas from the public, the largest number in history. Of them, the city selected the three finalists through six rounds. A number of ideas were discussed in the screening stage, including “Feel Seoul Good,” “Find your Seoul” and “Do Re Mi Fa Seoul.” The decision was handed over to three votes with different weightings, with 50 percent going to an online vote participated in by 130,000 Seoul residents, 25 percent on an onsite vote by over 1,000 selected individuals, and 25 percent based on a vote by a panel of experts. More than 20,000 of the voters were foreign, including one foreign expert among nine professional voters, officials said. Interestingly, “Seoulmate” topped the ranking in the online vote, with nearly 40 percent, followed by “I.Seoul.U” with 36.5 percent. The experts and the majority of the onsite voters, however, picked “I.Seoul.U” after seeing the presentations held for each candidate before the vote. Over 58 percent overall favored “I.Seoul.U,” with a unanimous vote from the experts. “Experts’ opinions were not unified before the vote. But after the fierce debate over which suits Seoul City’s image better, the experts unanimously made a decision. To be honest, I was surprised,” Kim added. The experts pointed out that “Seouling” lacked identity while “Seoulmate,” which sounds similar to word “soulmate,” could connote a sexual nuance. “It was impressive to see citizens make the final decision from slogan nominations that were also brought by the public,” said Sungshin Women’s University professor Seo Kyoung-duk, who participated in the professional panel. In terms of defining the city’s identity, the city government held several rounds of public discussion earlier this month to decide the key words that represent the city. Upon over a dozen public discussions and surveys, the city summed up the city’s image in three words – coexistence, passion and relaxation. But critics point out that building a city’s identity requires more than a slogan or brainstorming.“The identity issue is not the slogan’s problem. It’s the problem of the capital itself. Seoul City needs to keep building a concrete image of the city. For now, any slogans will likely draw identity concerns because the city lacks its own unique colors,” a public relations expert told The Korea Herald, who wished only to be identified by the surname Kwon.Some also questioned why the city would replace the current slogan of “Hi, Seoul” when it has been actively used for years, raising a suspicion that Mayor Park Won-soon might have pushed for the slogan change to clear the remnants of the previous city government. The “Hi, Seoul” slogan was determined by the city government and branding experts in 2002 under then-Mayor Lee Myung-bak, who was later elected president. According to the city-run Seoul Business Agency, the “Hi, Seoul” slogan’s asset value was estimated to be around 29 billion won ($26 million) as of last year. Despite this asset value, the city said it needed to replace it, citing a tourism marketing strategy dilemma. “The phrase of ‘Soul of Asia’ below ‘Hi, Seoul’ was not allowed to be used in China by the authorities, posing challenges to carrying out the tourism marketing plans,” said Hwang Bo-youn, the director general of Seoul City’s public communications bureau. “As the cities evolve and global trends change, the city brand also needs to evolve,” Hwang added. In the survey last year, about 80 percent of over 2,000 online panels and experts agreed to change the slogan, city officials said.“‘Hi, Seoul’ was merely the one that was used for long. It wasn’t also a brand that helped improve the Seoul City’s competitiveness or had depth,” design expert Sohn added. In an apparent move to deny any political motivation, Mayor Park Won-soon remained distant from the slogan project so far. He participated in the vote as an ordinary resident.“I personally prefer ‘Seouling’ as it sounds active and cool,” Park said in a press conference two days before the new slogan was selected. The authorities stressed that “I.Seoul.U” is not the city’s exclusive literary property but an open-platform logo that is free to use under the “creative commons license” rule. “As long as it follows certain criteria, anyone can use the slogan. It’s not only Seoul City’s brand but the world’s brand that be shared and developed by others,” the officials said. While criticisms prevail, Seoul appears set on sticking with its new brand name and trying to improve public opinion of it.Seoul City will soon launch “Seoul Partners,” which will be in charge of managing the free commercial use of the brand. Once a private company signs a memorandum of understanding with Seoul Partners, it will be allowed to use the logo for commercial use, they added.The idea was brought from Amsterdam’s “Amsterdam Partners,” which was launched in in September 2004 along with the new slogan to manage the business of the city brand. In December, the city will mobilize a sculpture of the new slogan to display around the city center, including Seoul Plaza, to raise the brand awareness, officials said. The capital will inject about 1.5 billion won into replacing the logo and implementing the marketing plans, they added.

Participants included former Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.  Park did not give further details.  In September, Park announced at the U.N. that South Korea will donate US$200 million in aid to 15 poor countries under the ""Better Life for Girls"" initiative over the next five years.  The 15 countries are Nepal, Laos, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Tanzania, Jordan, Morocco, Bolivia and Ecuador.  The initiative aims to tackle gender inequality in education and help girls in developing countries unlock their full potential. It also calls for strengthening health services for girls in those countries.  ""I believe that the strong power to overcome challenges facing mankind and to blaze new trails for prosperity for co-existence comes from education,"" Park said at the forum.  South Koreans' education fervor helped transform the country into Asia's fourth-largest economy from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War.  Still, critics say South Korea's education system relies on simple memorization and rote learning, and lacks critical thinking.

Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldNorway, which has 40 percent of its territory north of the Arctic Circle, has proactively protected the region’s environment, resources and inhabitants, while optimizing commerce. The Arctic has been Norway’s foreign policy priority. The Nordic nation has strived to build an inclusive international partnership dedicated to a “stable, predictable and peaceful Arctic” through the Arctic Council. Korea became a permanent Artic Council Observer in 2013, and has taken part in research expeditions with Norwegian partners. Korea’s Dasan Scientific Research Station has been operating on the Svalbard archipelago since 2002, with the participation of the Korea Polar Research Institute and the Korean icebreaker vessel Araon.Tromso city in northern Norway is home to the Arctic Council Secretariat as well as the Arctic Economic Council Secretariat. The city will host the Indigenous Peoples Secretariat next year. “The greatest feat in life is not so much where we stand, but which direction we are taking,” the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs State Secretary Morten Hoglund said in a speech at the opening ceremony Wednesday, borrowing the words of Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930), whose biography was displayed alongside his contemporary Roald Amundsen (1872-1928).In an interview with The Korea Herald and other media, Hoglund said that Norway believed it was possible to combine economic development and environmental preservation in the Arctic, by pursing a holistic approach enmeshed with stringent regulations. (From left) Fram Museum director Geir Klover, Norwegian State Secretary Morten Hoglund, Korea Polar Research Institute president Kim Yea-dong, the Norwegian embassy Charge d‘Affaires Marianne Damhaug, Korea Foundation executive vice president Yoon Keum-jin and Korean Arctic Affairs Ambassador Kim Chan-woo. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldAs climate change increasingly melts away the polar ice cap and opens new sea routes, Norway expressed the desire to use the Northeast Passage between Europe and Asia, which would significantly reduce freight time across the Arctic. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg wrote in a foreign affairs report in November 2014: “There is great potential for value creation in the interplay between the traditional industries and modern technologies in the Arctic.”Solberg added that the Norwegian government aimed to assist business communities by drawing on extensive knowledge from education and research and sound regulations geared toward the region’s sustainable development. Hoglund stressed that some environmentally sensitive areas were off-limits to commercial ventures, as development would further threaten the endangered wildlife and ecology. Noting the discovery of oil and gas in the North Sea that has economically benefited Norway for the last five decades, he said that his country had decided not to develop the untapped oil and gas fields in the northern oceans, including the Barents Sea, out of environmental concerns.  Fram Museum director Geir Klover(right) speaks at an exhibition titled “Explore the Arctic -- Past, Present and Future” at the Korea Foundation Gallery on Wednesday. Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“We also have very strict regulations concerning technologies used,” he said. “Norway has pushed technological innovations in offshore oil and gas exploration with very low oil spills and accidents.”Using its bountiful waterfalls and rivers, from its furrowed valleys and fjords, Norway meets close to 100 percent of its domestic energy needs through hydropower. Oil and gas are primarily exported in the global market, he said. Norway plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030, adhering to a collective agreement with the European Union. “Development has to be balanced. Things cannot be done the same way as 30 years ago,” the Deputy Foreign Minister said. “We need much higher standards and this requires a combined effort of the industries, peoples and governments worldwide.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","museum the korea polar research ,exhibition titled explore the arctic ,fram museum the korea polar ,expeditions with norwegian partners korea ,korea foundation gallery on wednesday","['the Northern Lights', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Foundation Gallery', 'the Norwegian Embassy', 'the Fram Museum', 'the Korea Polar Research Institute', 'Korea Foundation', 'Norwegian', 'State', 'Morten Hoglund', 'the Korea Foundation Gallery', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea HeraldNorway', 'Norway', 'nordic', 'the Arctic Council', 'Artic Council Observer', 'norwegian', 'Korea', 'Dasan Scientific Research Station', 'Svalbard', 'the Korea Polar Research Institute', 'korean', 'Araon', 'Norway', 'the Arctic Council Secretariat', 'the Arctic Economic Council Secretariat', 'the Indigenous Peoples Secretariat', 'the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs State', 'Morten Hoglund', 'norwegian', 'Fridtjof Nansen', 'Roald Amundsen', 'the Korea Herald', 'Hoglund', 'Norway', 'Fram Museum', 'Geir Klover', 'Norwegian', 'State', 'Morten Hoglund', 'Korea Polar Research Institute', 'Kim Yea - dong', 'norwegian', 'Charge d‘Affaires Marianne Damhaug', 'Korea Foundation', 'Yoon Keum - jin', 'Korean Arctic Affairs', 'Kim Chan - woo', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea HeraldAs', 'Norway', 'norwegian', 'Erna Solberg', 'norwegian', 'Hoglund', 'Norway', 'Fram Museum', 'Geir Klover(right', 'the Korea Foundation Gallery', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea Herald“We', 'Norway', 'Norway', 'Norway', 'the European Union', 'Joel Lee']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17024228  0.62606013

The deputy director of the Citizens’ Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, Joanna Hosaniak, was given the “Bene Merito” honor from the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and composer Ryu Jea-joon received the “Gloria Artis” badge from the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. Ryu is a graduate of the Academy of Music in Krakow, where he studied under the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. He has introduced Polish music to Korea through various events, including a music festival he conducted at the Seoul Arts Center in 2013.Hosaniak for the last 11 years has worked at the civil rights organization, playing a vital role in the U.N. Human Rights Council’s decision to launch the Special Commission of Inquiry into North Korea in 2013. She told The Korea Herald that she developed a passion for North Korea at Warsaw University, where she was taught by a North Korean professor between 1993 and 1999. Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka (right) awards human rights activist Joanna Hosaniak (center) and composer Ryu Jea-joon for their contributions to promoting Poland in Korea at his residence in Seoul on Thursday. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“When he was called back to North Korea, he told us that he didn’t want to go back,” she said. “He disappeared one day, and the North Korean Ambassador to Poland, Kim Pyong-il, who was the late Kim Jong-il’s half-brother, came to our department (to investigate) his whereabouts.” The incident prompted Hosaniak to research into North Korea, which was then cloaked in secrecy to an even greater degree than today. “I suspected similar problems would exist there,” she said, referring to the infamous Nazi concentration camps and Soviet gulags that had darkened Poland’s past. She started her work at the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, a Warsaw-based nongovernmental agency, and came to Korea in 2004 on the invitation of her current office. At the Citizens’ Alliance, Hosaniak focuses on global and domestic advocacy, settlement programs for newly defected youths and assistance to refugees hiding in other countries. Founded in 1996, NKHR is the world’s oldest group dedicated solely to North Korean human rights causes. Hosaniak met the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay in 2012, and succeeded in putting the issue on the U.N. Security Council last year. Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka (right) awards composer Ryu Jea-joon (left). Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“It’s important that the world does not forget the public executions, concentration camps and children dying from starvation in North Korea,” she stressed. “Twenty-eight thousand defectors live in South Korea, but there are many more who did not make it here, being captured and tortured.”Those responsible for the crimes against humanity must be brought to justice, she emphasized, contending that the totalitarian regime must be put on trial at the International Criminal Court. According to the Associated Press, a draft resolution by the European Union and Japan was submitted to the Security Council last week to refer the regime to the ICC. A General Assembly of 193 countries will likely vote on the resolution in December. Under the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who took power in December 2011, the atrocities have exacerbated, Hosaniak claimed. The Chinese border has been aggressively fortified with guard controls, and the refugees entering the South roughly halved to 1,400 last year, compared to the previous five years. Refugees usually receive assistance from brokers, nongovernmental organizations and church groups, in their treacherous journey through China and Southeast Asia before reaching South Korea. Many are caught in China and sent back to be punished savagely, and women are often entrapped in sex trafficking. Regarding South Korean politics, dichotomized between the conservatives staunchly advocating the issue and progressives generally refraining out of apparent fear of provoking Pyongyang, Hosaniak asserted, “There is no ‘left’ or ‘right’ in human rights. It is a universal issue. We cannot pick and choose.”North Koreans should decide their own fate, she noted, pointing out that the world should continue pressuring the North and documenting transgressions, as West Germany did through the Salzgitter Archives.(From left) Human rights activist Joanna Hosaniak, National Endowment for Democracy president Carl Gershman, Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka and his spouse Zofia Majka. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldAccording to Hosniak, Poland, which was a communist country between 1945 and 1989, fared better than some other Eastern Bloc nations due to its Western European foundations. “A big part of our society never accepted communism,” she said. “Poland’s catholic nationalism was essentially anticommunist and anti-Russian.”Highlighting the term “the kidnapped West,” coined by the Czech writer Milan Lundera, Hosaniak said that communism did not take root in Polish society and had to negotiate politically. Transitioning to democracy and a market economy after 1989 disenfranchised many, particularly the elders, as it required upending their mind and habits. “We had to be entrepreneurial, learn new languages and take care of ourselves, instead of depending on the state.”Unlike the Czech Republic and Germany, which carried through their historical justice, Hosaniak argued that Poland did not properly prosecute ex-apparatchiks for misdeeds. “The first government of Wojciech Jaruzelski said it didn’t want to draw a ‘thick line between the past and future,’” she said. “By urging everyone to simply carry on, our society has become very divided, very much.” The Pole, who visits her country annually, said she saw sweeping changes each year, particularly after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. “Poland still has a long way to go on social and legal reforms and modernization, but it’s amazing how freedom and basic rights, when protected, can change a country so much,” she underscored. “From what I remember from my childhood to what I see now in my early 40s, it’s like a dream come true.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","korea heraldaccording to hosniak poland ,council last year polish ambassador ,polish music to korea through ,polish embassy on thursday awarded ,introduced polish music to korea","['the Polish Embassy', 'Poland', 'Korea', 'the Citizens ’ Alliance for North Korean Human Rights', 'Joanna Hosaniak', 'Bene Merito', 'the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Ryu Jea - joon', 'Gloria Artis', 'the Polish Ministry of Culture', 'National Heritage', 'Ryu', 'the Academy of Music', 'Krakow', 'polish', 'Krzysztof Penderecki', 'polish', 'Korea', 'the Seoul Arts Center', 'the U.N.

Defense & Security 2015 will kick off Monday in the Southeast Asian country’s capital for a four-day run, bringing together about 25 defense agencies and 400 military service providers from about 50 countries. The biennial event is the largest military exhibition in the region, organizers said, having grown more than 30 percent since its inception in 2003. South Korea will run a pavilion in a 424-square-meter space, the fourth-largest among participant nations after the U.S., Turkey and China. It will house the booths of major ship and aircraft builders and other weapons makers, such as Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, Korea Aerospace Industries, Poongsan, S&T; Motiv and Hanwha, as well as 13 smaller contractors and partner companies. “While helping enhance the image of our defense industry, we will look into potential partnerships with other countries and companies and gather information on their technological progress and future contracts,” an official at the Korea Defense Industry Association said. Lockheed Martin, Thales, SAAB, NIMR Automotive and other global manufacturers are also expected to display their cutting-edge products at the exhibition. One of the most striking features will be Japan’s first-ever participation with a national pavilion, following a recent overturn of its strictly defensive postwar security law, which will allow its military to play a greater role and expedite overseas sales of weapons. In April 2014, the Shinzo Abe administration unveiled an easing of its near-50-year ban on arms exports. Last month, it officially launched a defense procurement agency. “This year’s exhibition will feature the latest defense and internal security equipment including high-tech weapons systems, guns, missiles, tanks, (unmanned) aerial vehicles, transport vehicles, vessels, satellites, plus a wide range of the latest military technology,” the organizers said in a statement. “Manufacturers of fire control systems, launchers and other important systems and hardware will also be featured.” Powered by technological prowess and partnerships with major companies, South Korea has been pushing to shore up its charge into the international arms market, but a series of scandals involving top military executives and substandard parts has marred the industry’s standing at home. Last year, its exports hit a record high of around $3.6 billion, with the number of exporters reaching 124, more than 2.6 times that in 2006, according to the association. The country aims to become the world’s seventh-largest arms exporter by 2020. “The product lineup has also grown more diverse. If ammunition and maintenance parts were our primary trade items in the past, the list expanded in virtually all areas, including maneuvering, ammunition and vessels, and now we have won large deals, such as for a submarine and jets,” the official added. “Given the limits of our domestic market, exports are no longer an option but a must.” By Shin Hyon-hee, Korea Herald correspondent (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","largest arms exporter by 2020 ,fair in thailand this week ,defense security 2015 will kick ,in thailand this week defense ,at trade fair in thailand","['Thailand', 'Defense & Security 2015', 'southeast asian', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Turkey', 'China', 'Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering', 'Korea Aerospace Industries', 'Poongsan', 'S&T', 'Motiv', 'Hanwha', 'the Korea Defense Industry Association', 'Lockheed Martin', 'Thales', 'Japan', 'Shinzo Abe', 'South Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Korea Herald']",11,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.59978688  0.40033245

But this time, what made the headlines the next morning was not her looks or acting skills, but her costume that was made of old dress shirts and parachutes. The maker of Moon’s dress, Kolon Industries, is one of the rising number of businesses that have in recent years been jumping on the green bandwagon here, transforming waste materials into products that are affordable, stylish and easy to use.  Kolon redesigns and reforms unsold fasion items for its upcycle fashion brand Re;Code. (Re;Code)Corporate cost-cutting efforts, consumers’ calls for unique, cool yet less polluting goods and a global drive to curb ecological footprints have come together to give rise to the upcycling industry. While large fashion houses are joining the trend as a strategy to diversify their product lineups and help clear inventories, small and midsize firms and start-ups are betting on novel ideas to entice eco-conscious shoppers. Re;Code is Kolon’s upcycled fashion line launched in March 2012. It was born out of the Seoul-based firm’s struggle with inventory, company officials say. Brand new clothes are usually transferred to outlets and discount stores after the season ends, and then incinerated if not sold after three years. Kolon burns 4 billion won ($3.6 million) worth of never-worn items every year. The brand uses not just out-of-date clothing but also unwanted military uniforms, tents and other equipment, as well as industrial materials like automobile air bags, seats and linings. All products are handmade, and no more than five items are available in the same design. To boost its social responsibility activities and harness more out-of-the-box ideas, Kolon works with Goodwill Industries, a social enterprise run by disabled people, in disassembling clothing, while cooperating with independent designers. “Re;Code puts top priority in our fashionwide social participation and has meaning in that the company actively embraces the capabilities of independent promising designers through collaboration with them,” says Han Kyung-ae, a managing director of Kolon FnC, the subsidiary in charge of the project. “Given the growing need for ethical consumption among customers, we’re hoping to contribute to their valuable buying.” In Samcheong-dong at the center of Seoul, Cheil Industries, a textile affiliate of Samsung Group, introduced what it says is the country’s first-of-its-kind fashion corporate social responsibility store called the Heartist House in September 2014, marking the 60th anniversary of its clothing business. The shop sells not only products donated by Bean Pole, Rogatis, Galaxy, Kuho and other Cheil brands, but also upcycled items and eco-friendly objects crafted by up-and-coming designers. Customers can also donate their items. With the area being a tourist hotspot, about 30 percent of the visitors are from overseas, largely Chinese and then Americans and Japanese. Transformed from a warehouse in the 1940s, the five-story structure was built with old bricks and other components and 50 percent of the interior items are from the firm’s inventory. Workers reuse water from air conditioners and rain for the flowers and plants on display on each floor. Cheil also runs a contemporary multishop named Beaker in Hannam-dong, which boasts a collection of upcycled furniture and other articles and allows visitors to donate old clothes, bottles and other things and receive a cosmetics sample or coffee coupon in return. All the proceeds from the two stores are spent to help children with disabilities and other underprivileged people, the company says. Smaller companies, too, are turning upcycling into a lucrative business.Some old banners and car seat belts become chic yet durable clothes and purses, while outdated denim, buckles and hooks are put together to build “it” bags. Used coffee grounds, which would otherwise get dumped in the trash, are transformed into mushroom compost, mugs and even lamp shades. Ecojun Company’s “original green cup” smells like coffee. Made of biodegradable cornstarch and used coffee grounds, it is lighter than porcelain mugs or glasses. It releases no hormones even when filled with hot water, and emits no noxious gases when it is incinerated after use, the firm says. CEO Lee Jun-seo claims his brainchild marks the first coffee grounds cup in Korea, which imports more than 120,000 tons of coffee beans and uses some 12 billion paper cups every year. “While used coffee grounds (usually) just get thrown away, this cup contains 100 percent biodegradable corn plastic and helps lessen waste while smelling so good,” he said in an interview with the Korea Green Foundation. Zenny Closet is one of the high-flying upcycling labels, offering purses and accessories chiefly made of discarded denim. Its sophisticated designs lured young female consumers, pushing its revenues to surge tenfold six months after launch. In addition to an online mall, the company now operates seven stores across Seoul and one in Daejeon. Other eco-design products similarly showcase their beauty and eco-friendliness. They include Touch4Good’s dishmats made of computer components, placards turned into bags and blankets with PET bottle ingredients, as well as construction materials produced from seashells and other marine debris by YNG Tech, a Seoul-based heavy equipment parts manufacturer.To help the small businesses and start-ups expand their sales channels, promote networking and establish related infrastructure, some front-runners established an association in 2013, called the Korea Upcycle Design. Its members often join hands to purchase rare materials such as waste parachutes or military gear. In Korea, upcycling was brought on to the scene in 2007 by some designers and kicked into high gear in 2013, with around 100 teams now working in the sector that face more challenges, the organization said. “Even after a firm comes up with good products, there are no or very few sales outlets. And many people still think of upcycled goods as things made with unique ingredients, rather than a brand,” it said on its website. The central and local governments, meanwhile, also seek to act as a catalyst to the budding industry.The Environment Ministry provides financial support for local upcycling facilities such as in Gyeonggi Province, while holding idea contests and public exhibitions. In April, Seoul City broke ground for the country’s first-ever upcycling center, to open in 2017. Sitting on a 16,500-square-meter area, the five-story building will house workspaces for related social enterprises and artists, a marketplace for upcycled goods, processed waste materials and secondhand items, an exhibition hall and experience center.The city is seeking to jack up the number of recycling companies from the existing 30 to 1,000 and generate some 20,000 new jobs by 2017 including positions for upcycling material planners and eco-designers.

In a ceremony held at the city’s public square Seoul Plaza, the city announced that “I. SEOUL. U” won the logo contest, beating two other candidates -- “Seoulmate” and “SEOULing” -- to replace “Hi Seoul,” the current slogan that had been used for 13 years. Some 58 percent of voters supported “I. SEOUL. U” in a poll that consisted of online votes by citizens and an on-the-spot vote by a panel of residents and experts. In the on-the-spot poll, all nine experts and 682 out of 1,140 residents supported the new logo. “With the new logo, I wanted to show the ever-changing vibrant and dynamic image of Seoul that we need to build,” said Lee Ha-rin, a Korean undergraduate who won the slogan contest in which 16,000 participated. Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon (center) and guests hold up a placard with the city’s new brand, “I.SEOUL.U,” at a ceremony held at Seoul Plaza on Wednesday evening.  YonhapSince late 2014, the city has launched a crowdsourced campaign for a new slogan to replace the current one -- “Hi Seoul, Soul of Asia,” -- which the city administration considered to be difficult to use in China, the country accounting for the highest number of tourists to Seoul. In 2006, China banned the use of the expression “Soul of Asia.” But some public relations experts and expats pointed out that the new slogan might not communicate well with those who reside in English-speaking countries, suggesting that the brand fails to capture the sophisticated image the city is trying to promote. “I am not sure what they are trying to convey. It sounds like ‘I saw you’ or ‘I sold you.’ If they were trying to say that Seoul connects me and you, it might make sense a little, but not much really,” said a 30-year-old American English teacher. Faced with mounting criticism, the panel that spearheaded the campaign to adopt a new slogan said in a statement Monday that the new slogan would grow on the public over time and would be understood by foreigners.“It is quite natural to feel it’s awkward when the city introduces a new brand. It is quite common to see such awkwardness in other global cities that tried to build their own brand. The public will embrace the new slogan over time,” the statement said. “Also, considering that the slogan is a brand, we need to look at it outside of grammar rules. We have already collected the opinion of experts in English and they said the logo is communicable in modern English,” said the statement. By Yeo Jun-suk(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","seoul won the logo contest ,at seoul plaza on wednesday ,beating two other candidates seoulmate ,voters supported seoul in poll ,new brand seoul at ceremony","['the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'I.

This installment looks into China’s vision for a regional order and the ongoing Sino-U.S. rivalry. -- Ed. China and the U.S. have been envisioning different regional orders with the former seeking one that encompasses Asians’ unique cultural aspects and the latter pursuing a strictly rule-based approach anchored in its alliance network, according to Chinese foreign policy professor Choo Jae-woo.Choo Jae-woo (Song Sang-ho/ The Korea Herald)Choo, a professor at Kyung Hee University, told The Korea Herald that their divergent visions for the security order in East Asia had long fueled geopolitical tensions, particularly amid the reemergence of the Asian power. “China has been pursuing a multilateral architecture that meshes with Asian cultural traits, whereas the U.S. is pursuing a regionalism strictly based upon institutionalism and the rule of law,” he said during a recent interview. “Asians hate being constrained or fettered by anything or being led to behave based on strict rules or legal procedures. That is not in our Asian culture, which is characterized by a sort of flexibility and pliability.” The professor also said that China has regarded “foreign elements,” namely the U.S., as a destabilizing factor and thus sought to drive it out of the region to build a security architecture that excludes the U.S. Touching on the maritime disputes in the South China Sea involving China, Choo noted the country’s “traumatic experiences” regarding foreign elements’ control of the sea on the basis of their right to the “freedom of navigation.” “From China’s point of view, the foreign elements with the right to the freedom of navigation committed crimes or got into accidents with impunity in the past, as they exercised their extraterritoriality,” he said. “So, China has such a historical background that has made it highly sensitive to the ongoing maritime disputes. As for China’s relations with Japan, Choo said that the two neighbors know each other “too well” and might refrain from crossing the “threshold” that could result in the devastation of either of them. The following is the interview with the professor.Korea Herald: Do you think China is attempting to challenge the existing order and build a new order favorable to its own interests?Choo Jae-woo: I think we should look at the economic and noneconomic domains separately. In terms of the economic order, it would be difficult for China to tear down the existing institutions and order, and create new ones. If you look at the governance structure of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, it is the same as those of the Asia Development Bank and other existing bodies, meaning that China might have found it difficult to create a new financial order. If you also look at the international trade order, the WTO (World Trade Organization) system has been so deeply and firmly entrenched that it can hardly be supplanted by a new one.The noneconomic front is about security and the military. I think China, based on my long-term forecast, is likely to challenge or alter the existing security order. Speaking of China’s security, we need to fully grasp the perspectives of a continental state. Although China now calls itself a maritime power, it has traditionally been a continental power. For a continental power, the security order and environment in its neighborhood is of great importance. For it to rise stably, its peripheral areas should be stable.Chinese President Xi Jinping has talked of the Chinese dream and that means China regaining its past glory, in other words, the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” That sounds very comprehensive, but that is exactly about the order China envisions. China wants to revive the past regional order. What China talked about right after the Korean War (1950-53), was that “foreign elements” should not remain in its surrounding area. In the past, the foreign elements referred to Japan, but now it is the U.S. China has long sought to pursue stability in the regional security landscape, and to achieve that, the priority has been placed on eliminating the foreign elements.The U.S. has maintained its presence in the region through its alliance network, which of course involves Japan and South Korea. China has wanted to drive out U.S. forces from the region in line with its efforts to remove foreign elements. China has long perceived America’s alliance network negatively, thinking that the alliances are a key destabilizing factor in the region.In a nutshell, China envisions a 21st-century East Asian security order that excludes the “foreign elements” and can be led by China. In the economic realm, it would take a considerable amount of time for it to change the existing order and do anything to that effect, although shifts could emerge if the yuan is fully internationalized. KH: What would be the external policy principles for China in the process of seeking a stable security environment?Choo: There is something China has constantly talked about with regard to the regional security environment since it founded its nation, the People’s Republic of China, in 1949. I believe that is still valid up until now. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai underscored that a “zone of peace” should be built in its neighborhood and states surrounding it should be neutralized. This is why China actively participated in the Bandung Conference (in 1955), and that is how the “Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence” were formulated at the conference.The five principles are mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty; mutual nonaggression; mutual noninterference in each other’s internal affairs; equality and cooperation for mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence.China as a continental power thought that a foreign element would become a destabilizing factor should it enter its zone of peace or a group of neutralized states in its neighborhood. That is why Mao Zedong once said, “Asian issues should be dealt with by Asians themselves.” Last year, China called for a new Asia security concept in the CICA (Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia), and this concept is actually in line with what Mao said. Having said this, a series of China’s ongoing projects such as the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, the AIIB and Shanghai Cooperation Organization have apparently been pushed for to reflect China’s such security vision and objectives.KH: Is the goal of building a peace zone really valid now after it emerged in the 1950s?Choo: Yes, it is. Both China and the U.S. have continued to reflect their initial security visions, which were mapped out in the 1950s, still in their current respective strategies. As for China, it could not actively push for its security vision decades ago because China could not exert its leadership to realize the vision (as its national power wasn’t strong enough back then). So its vision remained merely rhetorical and declaratory. But now, it is pushing for it with practical actions and leadership, as was witnessed in its calls for the establishment of a regional security architecture -- part of a move to build the peace zone.The U.S. also began pushing for its security vision in the 1950s. It sought to build a “hub-and-spoke” bilateral alliance system to build an Asian version of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). For this to materialize, the U.S. needed to build an intra-alliance system by connecting the allies with one another. But this has not worked out well. The U.S. has pushed its allies to get together, but its allies have not moved as the U.S. has wished. Even Japan wasn’t helpful as it was fettered by the pacifist constitution, one that the U.S. itself imposed. Thus, the hub-and-spoke system, or the bilateral alliance system has persisted over the last six decades. But now, Japan is moving to jettison the constitution as the U.S. has encouraged Japan to do so behind the scenes -- of course, not too obviously. KH: The U.S. and China seem to be envisioning a different type of regional security architecture or order. What is your take on this?Choo: I think we should look at what kind of regionalism they are advocating. China favors one that is characterized by openness and inclusiveness, while the U.S. is pursuing a regionalism strictly based upon institutionalism and the rule of law. What China pursues is thus one that is rather loose and not legally binding. Also, the decisions are made through consensus, and there are no serious penalties when violations occur. Its membership is also inclusive and comprehensive. Here, inclusiveness only applies to Asians, as China seeks to eliminate “foreign elements.” This is sort of an “Asian way.”The U.S. has a diametrically different approach. Its regionalism should be strictly a rule-based one. What matters more is that the regional architecture should consist of states that share the same values such as freedom and human rights. The decision-making process is also strict and penalties are meted out when anybody contravenes rules. As the U.S. envisions a regional architecture involving its allies, their commitments would remain strong, while in the Chinese approach, participants’ commitments are somewhat weak. KH: What do you think each wants to achieve through the architecture that it has pursued?Choo: Let me talk about the U.S. first. Though many may disagree with me, I think that the U.S. wants to contain China. If the U.S. just tries to “manage” its relations with China rather than containing it, China would become too big to handle. Thus, the U.S. appears to be seeking to contain China first, then manage the relations, and engage with China. While containing China, the U.S. appears to be seeking to turn the current hub-and-spoke structure into an intra-alliance system, and ultimately create a collective security architecture here based on the commitments from its allies.As for China, it is pursuing a multilateral architecture that meshes with Asian cultural trais. Asians hate being constrained or fettered by anything or being led to behave based on strict rules or legal procedures. That is not in our Asian culture, which is characterized by a sort of flexibility and pliability. KH: China has focused on the so-called peripheral diplomacy or neighborhood diplomacy. It even mentioned its vision to build a “community sharing the common destiny.” What would be China’s intentions?Choo: I believe the idea of establishing the community is in sync with China’s pursuit of a peace zone and neutralism under the five principles of peaceful coexistence (adopted in the 1955 Bandung Conference). The five principles have served as the crucial ideological foundation that undergirded China’s vision for the regional order. In addition to the principles, there are three additional ones China has put forward. China says the world is a diverse, pluralistic society in terms of the development status, cultures and political systems. So, China stresses that diversity and pluralism should be respected. Another thing is that China says core interests should be respected. And the other is that the world should seek common interests to foster codevelopment and coprosperity with an aim to build a community of the shared destiny. These new additions came as China seeks to reflect changes in the 21st century, including the new post-Cold War international structure. Back to China’s intentions behind its pursuit of the community, this is exactly about the security perspective of a continental state, which would prioritize stabilizing its neighborhood before expanding its sphere of influence beyond the region. The Confucian axiom actually well depicts China’s intentions and that is “Cultivate your morals, then manage the family and then rule a nation and the world.”KH: How do you think China would handle territorial disputes in the South China Sea?Choo: If you look at media reports on the South China Sea disputes, they mostly talk of China’s territorial ambitions, their challenge to the sea lines of communication or what the U.S. calls “freedom of navigation,” or rich energy resources in the disputed sea. But they are all superficial stories and they don’t really delve deeper into the fundamental motives behind China’s push to secure the sea. To put it simply, China has some traumatic experiences regarding the South China Sea, as foreign elements persistently intervened to control the sea in the past, and called for the right to the freedom of navigation. Since the Opium War (1840-42), foreign elements including the U.S. have demanded the right as they moved into China’s territory, and this history has been repeated from China’s perspective. After the 1950-53 Korean War, the U.S. also set up a maritime blockade and maintained it for some two decades when China was in the state reconstruction process, which required the use of sea routes for a stable supply of energy and raw materials. So China was once a victim. For the Chinese, the traumatic memories about the foreign elements intervening in its waters still remain potent. The foreign elements with the right to freedom of navigation committed crimes or got involved in accidents with impunity, as they exercised their extraterritoriality. So, China has such a historical background that has made it highly sensitive to the ongoing maritime disputes.KH: What do you think about Japan’s role as a variable in the process of China pushing for a regional structure that it favors?Choo: China and Japan know each other very well, meaning they both are well cognizant of each other’s strengths and weaknesses. It is like they are looking at each other entirely naked. What is interesting is that China seems to have some sort of inferiority complex vis-a-vis Japan, and vice versa. Although China upheld the nonalignment policy, it officially had alliance treaties three times -- interestingly all with Russia (and its precursors). Two of the treaties were aimed at keeping Japan in check. Japan has also some kind of inferiority complex over China due to historical experiences including the suzerain-tributary relationship during the Sino-centric order and Japan’s perception that it was defeated by China’s anti-Japanese campaign, etc. What is also interesting is that it was Japanese scholars who first initiated the talk of the “China threat” in the early 1990s, and that it was also the Chinese who started the discourse about the “Japan threat” in the 1970s. Chinese warned then that Japan would rise militarily based on its growing economic clout. Two decades later, Japan fueled the discourse against China with the same logic that China used to corroborate its claim about the Japan threat.This shows that the two know each other too well, and recognize each other as security threats. So, I think the two sides might set some threshold that they would not want to cross. They can’t cross it as they know what it means to cross it and what would happen should it be crossed. History showed that when the two were caught in an armed conflict, one of them was annihilated. After the Sino-Japanese War (1894-94), China saw its downfall, while Japan suffered huge damages after China’s anti-Japanese campaign from 1937. Thus, they would try to keep the line, but their conflicts would persist due to their long-running rivalry.Song Sang-ho(sshluck@heraldcorp.com)*Choo Jae-wooChoo Jae-woo, professor of Chinese foreign policy in the Department of Chinese Studies at Kyung Hee University, specializes in Chinese foreign policy, multilateral security cooperation and China-North Korea relations.He served as a visiting fellow at the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at Brookings Institution and a visiting professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Institute of Technology, where he taught inter-Korean relations and North Korean politics and foreign policy. Prior to his teaching at Kyung Hee, he worked as a researcher at a number of think tanks in Korea, including the National Security Policy Institute and Institute for International Trade at Korea International Trade Association.

Once inside, everyone must hand over their phones to the authorities. There is no Wi-Fi service. What’s waiting for them is group physical exercise sessions, guitar lessons and art therapy classes. The center was established last year with the support of the Gender Equality Ministry after an increasing number of teenagers were reported to be addicted to the Internet and smartphones. As of last year, 29 percent of all teenagers were at risk of smartphone addiction, while 12.5 percent were at risk of Internet addiction disorder, according to government data.  Teenagers participate in a play therapy program at the Internet Dream Village, a state-run institution for teens addicted to smartphones and the Internet located in Muju, North Jeolla Province. (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family)Data also showed that children of double-income families and single-parent households were more likely to develop media addiction than those with stay-at-home moms. Since its opening, some 312 teens were treated at the center for their addiction. The duration of the programs ranges from two to five weeks. Earlier this month, when The Korea Herald visited the institution, about 12 teenagers were participating in an art class, which is part of the therapy program. The assignment of the day was simple: Completely fill a blank piece of paper with whatever pattern or color they wanted.“People with addiction tend to have repetitive behaviors without being conscious,” said Kim Ji-hye, a therapist who was working at the center. “This particular assignment -- filling the paper -- requires children to make choices. They have to choose what color to use, what shape they want to draw, and so on. It distracts them from forming a repetitive behavior. “Those with serious addiction find this assignment very difficult. They either can’t stand the idea of filling the paper with something, or draw extremely small and complicated patterns.”Kim said she has witnessed that many addicted teenagers frequently using primary colors, especially red and blue. “The color of red reflects anger and aggressiveness, while blue represents one’s yearning for security and stability,” she said.In their play therapy class, the students were given two questions: What would you be like if you spent the next 10,000 hours playing with your smartphone? The other was: What would you be like if you spent the next 10,000 hours trying to achieve your dream? For the first question, a 15-year-old Jeong Seong-su performed to his own script, where his muscles get paralyzed after sitting down for such long hours with his phone. “I’m dying!” he cried, while comically collapsing to the floor.For the second question, another student wrote a script where his future self, a renowned chef, was being interviewed by a group of journalists who admired him. “You can achieve anything if you try hard!” he said to reporters as the character in the play. “I want to say that anything is possible.”Although the students seemed to be genuinely enjoying their time at the center, it hasn’t been always easy, said Shim Yong-chul from the institution. So far, two students have dropped out of the program and gone home. “The first three days are the most difficult part of the program for most kids, as many experience withdrawal symptoms,” he said. “Many become depressed. Some become aggressive and angry, asking to have their phones back.”Symptoms of Internet addiction can have extremely negative effects on teenagers and their lives, according to experts. Signs of addiction include difficulty waking up for school, feelings of anxiousness when they are not online including shakiness and moodiness, sleep disturbance and having trouble completing tasks at school and home. The addiction may also lead to isolation from family and friends.Student Jeong, who used to spend about five hours a day playing online games and using his smartphone, said one of the most memorable experiences at the center was doing physical activities with his friends. “I just didn’t really have the time or chance to play sports outdoors. We’d mostly just hang out at Internet cafes,” he said. “What I realized is that you can still live a happy life without your phone. I didn’t think that was possible.”According to a number of studies, the opposite of addiction is human connection, not sobriety. “Human beings are bonding animals. We need to connect and love,” writes British journalist Johann Hari in his book “Chasing the Scream: the First and Last Days of the War on Drugs.” “But we have created an environment and a culture that cut us off from connection, or offer only the parody of it offered by the Internet. The rise of addiction is a symptom of a deeper sickness in the way we live.”Kim Mi-jeong, who is in charge of teen addiction at Korea Youth Counseling and Welfare Institute, said statistics show that children with neglectful parents have a higher chance of developing addition and depression. “Many teen addiction cases are related to family problems. Addiction happens when you want to avoid your reality,” she said. “That is why we invite parents of the students who come here to participate in the therapy programs.”According to Kim, who works for the center, children who received treatment at the institution tend to have a better relationship with their family members, as well as better self-control. “The most important thing is the realizing that you have a problem,” said Park Gil-soo, the director of the center. “Many students, especially those who were forced by their parents to attend this program, come here thinking they are not addicted at all. Most of them change once they acknowledge that they in fact are addicted. That’s when they take the initiative to make changes in their lives for the better.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","south korea only state run ,of teen addiction at korea ,korea only state run institution ,korea only state run ,teen addiction at korea","['North Jeolla Province', 'Muju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Gender Equality Ministry', 'the internet Dream Village', 'Muju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Ministry of Gender Equality', 'Family)Data', 'Kim Ji - hye', 'Jeong Seong - su', 'Shim Yong - chul', 'Student Jeong', 'british', 'Johann Hari', 'Mi - jeong', 'Korea Youth Counseling', 'Welfare Institute', 'Kim', 'Park Gil - soo', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43835548  0.2425689

But there has been no groundbreaking progress due to sluggish progress in the science business belt project,"" Daejeon Mayor Kwon Sun-taik told Yonhap News Agency.The city, which emerged as the hub of the country's science research, especially after hosting the world exposition in 1993, was tapped as the key region for the science business belt in 2009.The International Science and Business Belt project calls for a 5.7 trillion-won (US$4.4 billion) investment by 2021, and plans to create massive research complexes of world-class institutes and facilities, such as the Institute for Basic Science.But the process also faced hurdles over previous months surrounding the budget issues, with the project resuming its development only recently.""Daejeon can rise as the true science hub only after the establishment of the Institute for Basic Science and the accelerator,"" Kwon said, adding the government should promptly make full-fledged efforts.The rare isotope accelerator that can be utilized for various areas, including medical and atomic power generation, will also be built in Daejeon.The mayor, meanwhile, hoped that the latest meeting of science ministers around the globe in Daejeon will beef up the city's efforts to rise as the hub of research and development.""Basic science has been isolated from the country's industrial policies. But the event has suggested there is a connection between basic science and the creative economy,"" Kwon said. ""It showed that basic science can contribute to the local economy.""During the event, representatives of the OECD and ASEAN members shared ideas on the role of science in overcoming common global issues, with South Korea promoting the creative economy policy as a solution to achieve the vision.The creative economy calls for generating new growth opportunities through merging different industries, especially through science technology.The city added it will provide foreign investors with business support, including tax cuts, and continue opening various events to promote Daejeon overseas.It will also continue fostering the Daejeon-led World Technopolis Association, which brings together different cities with a similar nature around the globe to promote science development.""It marked the first time for the OECD science ministerial meeting to be held outside Paris. And more significantly, it was not held in the capital but in Daejeon. We will continue efforts to lead the global science policies,"" Kwon added.

According to Seoul City’s data, those living in temporary single-room units spend 45 percent of their average monthly wage of 510,000 won ($450) on their housing. Shelter residents are required to purchase their own hygiene goods and socks when they are admitted to the facilities. Many of those living in public rental houses also do not have basic household electronic items such as a refrigerator or TV, it added. “This is a civil cooperation project that does not need additional budget.

Since Oct. 15, Seoul Metropolitan Government has offered a total of 1,200 public bikes called “Ddaleungee” at 140 docking stations in five major regions including Yeouido, Sinchon, Seongsu and central Seoul near Gwanghwamun. Ddaleungee bikes are parked at a docking station near Mangwon Subway Station in Mapo, Seoul. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)For only 1,000 won ($0.90) a day, anyone aged 15 or older can ride a bike around the clock. The rental process is simple as the bike booking is available online or by a mobile application. Those with a membership can use the service for much cheaper and accumulate mileage points when they transfer from the bike to public transportation within 30 minutes. The points can be used as cash when renting the bike. The service is also available in foreign languages -- English, Chinese and Japanese. Foreigners can subscribe to the service by registering their M-pass number or T card number on the website. They must pay a deposit of 50,000 won for the bike sharing membership. The city is planning to gradually increase the bike fleet to 20,000 by 2020 with more transportation transfer benefits. The push for the public bike sharing has been one of Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon’s key green initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. The current city administration has strived to change the public perception toward bicycles in order to promote it as a basic means of public daily life.As part of the efforts to boost bike use, the city has in recent years constructed bike-only roads spanning 180 kilometers between the five Ddaleungee service locations as well as a 70-kilometer stretch along the Hangang River for leisure purposes. As of this year, 724 kilometers of bike-only roads are installed in the capital, officials said. Along with the bike-friendly infrastructure, the city government has put efforts into improving public perceptions toward the bike through various measures. It has run free bike schools for bike beginners and provided bike safety classes for children at schools while holding various bike-related festivals and events across the city. Some city districts also offer free insurance packages for bike riders. “The mayor has considered raising public perception as important as constructing enough bike infrastructure,” a city official told The Korea Herald. Running a public bike-sharing service has long been a staple green project in metropolitan cities around the world, with about 530 municipalities having launched such projects. In Paris, about 24,000 bikes are running in the city’s program, attracting more than 286,000 annual subscriptions since 2007. This is equivalent to 1 in 8 Parisians.New York’s Citi Bike, the largest public bike share in the U.S., has drawn over 90,000 subscribers with 6,000 bikes across the city since 2013. The average day last year saw about 34,000 rides. The city is planning to increase the number of both bikes and docking stations by 2017. While other cities have successfully led public bike sharing systems, questions linger over Seoul City’s scheme as a similar attempt in the past resulted in a disappointing outcome.In 2010, the former Seoul City government led by Oh Se-hoon ran a bike project with 440 public bikes in Yeouido and Sangam. Facing the high cost and low public participation, however, the city soon scrapped it.Expensive and heavy bikes posed challenges to the city as one bike, weighing 23 kilograms, cost 6.4 million won. In order to lower the cost, the current city government led by Park Won-soon halved the bike cost by recycling and reassembling the existing bikes with lighter components. It also eliminated the kiosks that were installed at docking stations for bike rental and instead introduced an online and mobile kiosk application service to save money. Installing one kiosk used to cost 20 million won, adding to the financial burden, officials said. “While the system is much improved, it’s still uncertain how the public will respond to the new scheme. It’s optimistic, however, that the city at least attempted to ‘invite’ the public to ride bikes in downtown Seoul,” said urban planning and design professor Jeong Seok at University of Seoul. “The use of transportation means depends on the public psychology. Making that very first attempt of riding a bike along the roads for cars may be challenging as bikers are the minority among the traffic. But they may gradually rise to become a major part of the traffic once the number of bike riders increases, consequently influencing the transportation measures.” In order to successfully run Ddaleungee, civic groups stress that raising public awareness is crucial. “Car drivers must acknowledge first that the roads are made for both automobiles and bikes. Some prevalent misperceptions that roads are only for car owners often leads to bike accidents on roads, stirring safety concerns for cyclists,” said civic group Green Transport manager Ko Moon-soo, who is in charge of bike issues. The current transportation rule legally allows bike riders to use one-third of the right-most lane of the road, but many car drivers are not aware of the regulation, he added. According to Rep. Byun Jae-ill of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the bike accident rate surged to some 4,100 cases in the capital last year, up 70 percent from 2010. This has led to 37 deaths and over 4,200 injured riders. Of these cases, collisions with cars accounted for the most with 81 percent, followed by those with pedestrians with 10 percent, and accidents with other bikes at 8 percent.

SHARE a vision that science, technology and innovation: - improve the quality of life for all our citizens as they increase employment, productivity and economic growth in a sustainable manner over the long term; - provide new opportunities for investment, both for start-ups and established firms, in developed and developing countries; and, - are essential to meeting global and societal challenges, such as environmental sustainability, climate change, developing new sources of energy, food security and healthy ageing, hence achieving the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations. Moreover, science enlarges our understanding of Nature and society: science advances thanks to the curiosity and creativity of researchers which needs to be encouraged. AGREE that science, technology and innovation are being revolutionised by the rapid evolution of digital technologies, which are changing the way scientists work, collaborate and publish; increasing the reliance on access to scientific data and publications (""open science""); opening new avenues for public engagement and participation in science and innovation (""citizen science""); facilitating the development of research co-operation between businesses and the public sector; contributing to the transformation of how innovation occurs (""open innovation""). RECOGNISE that an array of new production technologies heralding the ""next production revolution"" is potentially transformative for our economies and can support sustainable growth and well-being. ACKNOWLEDGE that innovation is essential to address new health challenges that arise from ageing (e.g. Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases), globalisation (possibly facilitating pandemics) and rapidly shifting income and dietary patterns: Advanced health technologies and approaches, such as genomics and precision medicine, will offer promising contributions for responding to these and other health challenges.AGREE that science, technology and innovation have become more global, with emerging countries becoming major actors and many issues reaching global scale, like climate change, food security, neglected diseases, global health issues (e.g. dementia) and pandemics (as illustrated in the recent Ebola outbreak).RECOGNISE that science is increasingly important to inform policies and decision making across a broad range of areas, from long-term environmental and public welfare issues to emergency disease outbreaks and natural disasters. RECOGNISE the unique role of the OECD as an international forum for science, technology and innovation policy analysis and for peer learning among governments.ACKNOWLEDGE the importance of the OECD’s enhanced multi-stakeholder approach that directly involves the key societal actors in science, technology and innovation, from university associations to business representatives, while collaborating actively with relevant international and regional organisations.DECLARE that our countries need policies that promote excellence and relevance in public research and encourage stronger links between academia, industry and society in order to strengthen the impact of science and technology. To that effect:a) Basic and applied research need adequate long-term funding, even in a context of budgetary constraint.b) A market-friendly, competitive environment is required for businesses to invest in research and innovation, and for entrepreneurship to flourish.c) The innovation capacity of the public sector needs to be strengthened, as it is a major source of economic activity in itself.d) The education and training systems should nurture talent and supply the workforce with the broad range of skills required for generating and using innovations.e) Monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened, making full use of opportunities raised by information technology and new sources of data. The results of measurement and evaluation should be used in subsequent policy development and appropriate steps should be taken to make evaluation data accessible for analysis.f) Public understanding of science, as well as public engagement and trust in key science and technology institutions, are necessary for society to fully exploit the opportunities created by innovation.g) Policies are needed that support the positive transformational impact of digital technologies on research and innovation (and limit any anticipated risks), so as to promote ""open science"".h) The policy frameworks need to be strengthened to enable the next production revolution and maximise its positive impact on productivity and areas such as health and the environment.i) The scientific and technological advances required to address new health challenges would be facilitated by collaboration among governments, academia, patients, and industry throughout the R&D; and regulatory processes (for instance through data sharing, citizen science, crowdsourcing, virtual platforms for encouraging peer-to-peer networks and other collaborative research).j) Greater international co-operation is critical for addressing global challenges, but new co-ordination, funding and governance mechanisms are also required, notably to better exploit open science, invest in global research infrastructures and accelerate collective responses to crises.k) The governance of international science and technology co-operation should be made more inclusive vis-a-vis developing and emerging economies; the innovation capacities of these countries should be strengthened, they should be more involved in agenda and priority setting for research co-operation, as well as have a stronger role in global policy coordination and rule setting.ENCOURAGE the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, as well as other global efforts for sustainability, to take into consideration the critical roles of science, technology and innovation in explaining and responding to climate change.WELCOME the 2015 update of the OECD Innovation Strategy, which provides a highly valuable framework for designing, orienting and implementing national innovation strategies and addressing international issues of common interest relating to science, technology and innovation.REQUEST that the OECD, going forward, continue advising on the future development of science, technology and innovation policies, notably as regards: i) building scientific excellence and increasing the impact of public research, ii) strengthening the contribution of science, technology and innovation to sustainable economic growth, a cleaner environment and a more inclusive society; and iii) improving international co-ordination in science and technology.INVITE the OECD to:a) Support the improvement of policies for ""open science"", notably by:i) continuing to explore key policy actions to promote open access to the results of publicly funded research, and to investigate ways to develop internationally coordinated approaches to data and information infrastructures;ii) assessing the need for revising the Recommendation of the Council concerning Access to Research Data from Public Funding, and identifying common principles for the development of open science and big data (in conjunction with parallel efforts addressing the broader issue of data access on the Internet);iii) working with key actors to bring the lessons learned from information- and data-sharing initiatives led by the scientific community to the attention of policy makers and bring policy lessons to the attention of the scientific community.b) Continue to develop methods and indicators for assessing the impact of research and innovation policies, notably by:i) preparing analyses of policies and their impact across countries;ii) facilitating the exchange of good practices on impact assessment;iii) conducting co-ordinated impact assessments of comparable policies across countries when appropriate.c) Continue improving statistics and measurement systems to better capture the key features of science, technology and innovation, including by ensuring a successful 2016 OECD Blue Sky conference on the Future of STI Indicators, which can make a major contribution to this goal.d) Explore the innovation policy frameworks needed for sustainable development and the ""next production revolution"", specifically by:i) analysing the expected economic, social and environmental impact of emerging technologies including the impact on productivity and inclusive growth;ii) examining the innovation policy issues raised by environmental challenges;iii) developing better evidence on the effectiveness of specific policy instruments (e.g. prizes) that could advance technologies for sustainable development, as well as better evidence on the coordinated use of these instruments (""systems innovation"");iv) assessing the policies needed to accelerate development of a bio-based economy, including the design of guidelines for measuring the sustainability of biomass production and utilisation, while exploring the associated ethical, social and political implications;v) analysing the role of research and innovation in the sustainable development of the ocean economy.e) Investigate how best to support basic research in the health area and its translation into applications, notably with regards to omics technologies and precision medicine;

The second prize went to Charles Richard-Hamelin of Canada and the third to Kate Liu of the United States, according to the jury's verdict.Along with the first prize that gave him 30,000 euros ($34,065) and a gold medal, he won the Fryderyk Chopin Society Prize for best performance of a polonaise that earned him 3,000 euros, according to the organizer. The winner is also entitled to have concerts in some of the world's best-known halls and recording contracts.Of 78 pianists from 20 countries, including Poland, the U.S. and China, he was one of the top 10 pianists from eight countries, and turned out to be the best person who performed one of Chopin's piano concerti with the Warsaw Philharmonic. His choice was the Concerto in E minor, Op. 11.It was the first time in 10 years that a South Korean player made the top 10, and the first time ever for a South Korean to win the competition. The best achievement by South Korean pianists so far was by Lim Dong-min and his brother Dong-hyek who won the third prize at the 2005 event. ""I've long been dreaming of taking part in the Chopin competition and decided to participate when I was 11. I finally achieved my dream,"" Cho said before the final results were announced. ""I was nervous during the finals, but I was happy to be here, and I've enjoyed it.""Noting that he loves being a pianist, he said he is ""well aware that it takes a long time to be a genuine artist."" Launched in 1927 to sustain familiarity with the music of Fryderyk Chopin, the competition is recognized as one of the world's most prestigious piano competitions. It takes place every five years in the master's hometown of Warsaw, and young pianists aged between 16 and 30 can take part in the event.

World-famous scholars, including Jeremy Rifkin and Nobel laureate Aaron Ciechanover, will deliver lectures Monday.""Currently, the world is facing climate change, and other challenges, including energy and new diseases, which need to be solved with science technologies,"" South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn also said.""Science technologies are no longer just a tool for economic development. They are taking greater roles in improving the well-being of mankind and in promoting cultural activities,"" he added.""It is meaningful that science experts have gathered to discuss the sustainable development of technologies and shared growth among different countries,"" Hwang said.Minister of Science, ICT and Future Planning Choi Yang-hee also requested the participants make efforts in finding fundamental ways to overcome the common challenges of mankind.""South Korea wishes to contribute to the world's innovation in science technologies through cooperation with various countries and share its vibrant experiences of the past and the present,"" Choi said in an opening speech.The South Korean government also highlighted that it wishes to share its creative economy policy with the world, which aims to generate new growth engines through merging different industries on the back of science and technology. Monday's event commenced with a lecture by Jeremy Rifkin, an American theorist who is also well known in South Korea as a ""futurist."" Rifkin highlighted that global industry is heading towards what he calls ""the zero margin society,"" where more people can enjoy products or services without additional costs.""The wind is not sending invoices,"" Rifkin said, highlighting that environment-friendly power generation can benefit more people without much costs compared to traditional energy sources.""We now have three billion people who are not only producers and buyers. They are now prosumers,"" he said. ""Already the young people live in hybrid systems. They are exchanging goods and services free, zero margin cost in sharing economy.""Rifkin said digitalization has brought the wane of traditional industries such as magazines or TVs, but also have brought new opportunities such as the Internet of Things.""Samsung is moving the IoT platforms. There are tremendous opportunities in South Korea,"" Rikin said. IoT is a concept in which all tangible objects are connected to the Internet and can identify themselves to other devices in order to exchange necessary data for improved efficiency and convenience.On Tuesday and Wednesday, the OECD science ministerial meeting will start, where delegates will begin full-fledged discussions on utilizing science and technology for mankind.Such discussions will be summarized in the ""Daejeon Declaration"" on Wednesday.South Korea's ICT ministry said the declaration will seek to find ""strong,"" ""sustainable"" and ""inclusive"" global growth through science and technology.During the event, members of ASEAN will also meet with officials from the OECD to seek shared growth among nations through science and technology.On Friday, South Korean science and industry officials will hold a meeting to discuss the achievements of the OECD gathering.

The North Korean business entities will mostly sell farm and fishery goods, they said.According to Chinese state media, Chinese people living within 20 kilometers of the border can buy North Korean goods without paying import tax if they spend less than 8,000 yuan ($1,250) per day.   North Korea has been under sanctions by the United Nations due to its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.   China is North Korea's economic benefactor and diplomatic backer, but their political ties remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013.  A top Chinese official visited North Korea last week and held talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with both sides expressing willingness to improve bilateral ties.   Liu Yunshan, the Chinese Communist Party's fifth-ranked official, was the highest-ranked official to visit North Korea since Kim took power in late 2011.

Thomas Fergusson, a grandson of Edward Almond, the late commanding general of the U.S. X Corps.  Almond helped about 98,000 North Korean refugees evacuate by deciding to dump all weapons overboard to get more refugees aboard evacuation ships at the port of Heungnam in 1950.  The December 1950 operation, known as the ""Heungnam evacuation,"" took place as the U.S.-backed South Korean forces began retreating from North Korea after China sent a massive number of troops to fight alongside the communist neighbor.  ""The refugees needed help so I'm very proud that he made the decision to do his best with the help of the Navy to bring them out to safety,"" Fergusson said later in an interview with a pool reporter as he recalled a conversation with his grandfather.  Park also later shook hands with some of the participants at the War Memorial.  ""You are the true hero. Countless of Koreans are alive today thanks to you,"" Park told retired Rear Adm. J. Robert Lunney, who served as a crew member of the S.S. Meredith Victory that brought 14,000 North Korean refugees from Heungnam to South Korea during the war.  ""We look back with great pride having helped Korean people, the Republic of Korea to maintain its integrity and the freedom of its people,"" Lunney later said in an interview with the reporter. ""The only access to freedom was port Heungnam, and the only way they could get out was our ship. We were the last ship out from Heungnam with the refugees through the minefields all the way to"" South Korea's southeastern port of Busan.  The memorial -- which honors American soldiers killed during the Korean War -- was the first event Park attended since she arrived in Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama later this week.  More than 36,500 U.S. soldiers sacrificed their lives to help defend South Korea.  ""I will further strengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance,"" Park said, noting the bilateral friendship forged during the war revived liberal democracy in South Korea.  The conflict ended with a cease-fire agreement, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically at war.

Joel Lee/The KoreThe multilateral institution aims to reduce global poverty and create opportunities for development through leveraged loans. It consists of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes.The institution aims to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030 and boost shared prosperity by lifting the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of population.Korea’s experience in sustainable development and transition to a dynamic knowledge-based economy provide lessons that benefit many other developing countries, according to the WBG. In an effort to deepen engagement with Korea, the WBG opened a national office in Songdo, Incheon, in December 2013. Currently, the group has a series of partnerships and joint projects with Korean partners designed to enhance financial sector management, promote investment in green infrastructure and energy, share knowledge in information and communications technology and assist fragile and conflict-ridden states. To realize these objectives, the Korea Office shares global knowledge with Korean institutions such as the Korea Development Institute and the Korea Eximbank, collaborates with Korean companies and works to deepen engagement with the Korean government. “Our office looks for ways to help clients in Asia’s developing countries, by assessing their risks and opportunities and leveraging our presence here through public-private partnerships,” she said. “As an example, we try to look for successful cases of labor and regulatory reforms in Korea that can be used as advice. We also bring in information from other OECD countries.”Despite the world’s intensifying geopolitical tensions and gloomy financial forecast, Msuya said there are still numerous opportunities to cooperate between the World Bank and Korea. She cited the case of the new Expressway Development Support Project in Ethiopia, designed to help the country expand its road networks between the southern, central and northern regions, where the Korea Eximbank, the World Bank and the African Development Bank have worked together. As another example, Msuya pointed to the “Vietnam 2035 Report,” where Korean policy experts and the World Bank team have informed the Vietnamese government on institutional capacity-building and bureaucratic governance reform.“As a global institution, we bring the international knowledge and perspective to support Korea achieve its ambitions,” she highlighted. “Korea has a very good brand overall in the world. By becoming a foreign aid donor from a recipient, Korea can actually speak with credibility on the international stage.”Regarding the relationship with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which Korea is joining as a founding member, Msuya said the World Bank will closely cooperate with the institution once it starts operations. “One trillion dollars goes into infrastructure development each year, with most going into developed countries. This implies that in emerging, low-income markets, there is a huge infrastructure deficit,” she stressed. “No single institution can meet these enormous demands. Our team will work very closely with the AIIB secretariat in Beijing, by including them as part of our consultation process and connecting with Korean stakeholders.” She added that the two organizations already share views, from safeguards on environmental standards to governance structure, using video conferencing.

ASEAN-Korea Center“Indonesia is a lucrative market with a high growth rate of 6 percent per annum and population of 250 million people,” said Kim in his speech. “The country’s food and beverage industry reached a market value of $82 billion last year, and has great potential for future investment.” According to the Indonesian Embassy’s Deputy Chief of Mission Cecep Herawan, the administration of Indonesia President Joko Widodo and Vice President Jusuf Kalla has continuously improved the investment climate to spur domestic and foreign investments. Recently, the government unveiled a series of policy packages to better manage the macroeconomic environment, aiming to boost industrial competitiveness through deregulation, accelerate implementation of strategic projects by cutting red tape, and devolve power to the regional governments for infrastructure projects. Cumulative Korean investment in Indonesia between 1980 and 2014 was $12.7 billion and is expected to further climb with the launch of ASEAN Economic Community at the year-end, which would create a $2.4 trillion integrated market with 640 million people. Between 2010 and 2014, Korean investment amounted to $6.8 billion and $800 million in the first half of this year. In a separate event on Wednesday, the ASEAN-Korea Center organized an educational program to promote understanding of the region’s multifaceted and multilayered cultures to the Korean youths. The “2015 ASEAN School Tour Program” under the theme “ASEAN and Korea, we are friends” was held at the Bitgoeul Citizen Cultural Center in Gwangju with 600 students from 22 local middle schools participating. They engaged in interactive and entertaining activities designed to foster understanding of Southeast Asia’s diverse cultures and histories, including a quiz competition, cultural experience games, photography and sampling of food, costumes and musical instruments. The venue’s main highlight, the “ASEAN Talk Show,” engaged students and diplomats in a live question and answer session, covering topics from bilateral relations to diplomatic careers. Malaysian Ambassador Rohana Ramli, Cambodian Ambassador Suth Dina, along with other envoys from Myanmar and Laos embassies participated in the show.Since its launch in 2009, the program has drawn over 10,000 elementary, middle and high school students in Korea, helping instill awareness of ASEAN as a close and crucial partner.

They were potentially subjected to levels of PM10 particles, PM2 particles and nitrogen dioxide beyond regulatory limits as of 2013. A study coordinated by the Institute for Public Health Surveillance in 2011 also showed that the air pollution costs residents in the surrounding areas six months of life expectancy and provokes factors that contribute to respiratory problems and heart attacks. It estimated that the pollution’s impact on health, quality of life and life expectancy would represent a cost of about 31.5 billion euros ($35.6 billion) for European public officials.“Air pollution is the unacceptable, and yet avoidable, cause of 42,000 deaths per year in France. It reduces our life expectancy by six to nine months,” said Bernard Jomier, the deputy mayor in charge of health measures. The city found out that road traffic emits 66 percent of nitrogen and 56 percent of PM10 fine particles, making it the main source of air pollutants. Realizing the urgency to fight against air pollution, the Council of Paris unanimously adopted the Paris Climate Action Plan in 2007 in an aim to cut the overall emissions by 75 percent by 2020 compared to the 2004 level. France was the first country that implemented the climate change plan. The goal included a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 25 percent reduction in energy consumption, and energy consumption comprising 25 percent renewable and recovered energy.In order to achieve the goal, the French capital launched environment initiatives with a particular focus on encouraging green transportation and traffic and parking. It aggressively pursued an electric car sharing project while expanding public transportation such as subway lines and trams, and motivating residents to give up combustion-powered cars in return for financial incentives. Autolib, the public electric car sharing service, has served as one of the convenient transportation means for Parisians since 2011.Through the service, Parisians can take and park the electric cars anywhere in the city for only around 10 euros per month. Autolib is a follow-up to the successful bike sharing service Velib, which was launched in 2007. Velib has attracted over 286,000 annual subscriptions, which is equivalent to 1 in 8 Parisians. Currently, about 3,300 Autolib cars are running in the city, with nearly 1,000 charging stations in operation. To raise service availability, the city offers over 5,500 parking lots across the city. About 10 million have registered for the service since 2011, with 90,000 customers actively utilizing it. The service is also available in 64 other municipalities. While some express concerns over the performance of the electric cars, Blue Solution of Bollore Group, which is in charge of producing the electronic components for capacitors, stressed that the special battery not only allows car users to ride longer but also safer.The lithium metal polymer battery is safer than liquid electrolyte batteries because of better temperature stability, it said. It also enables the cars to run up to 250 kilometers per charge. It can also be recycled as the battery does not contain any toxin components, company officials said. Regardless of such innovative development of the electric cars, the Autolib service had a rough start due to public discontent over occupying the public space. “Parisians were not pleased with the service at first because the Autolib parking lots took up large spaces in the crowded city. The beginning was only possible thanks to the amazing harmony of political courage and entrepreneur will,” Blue Solution sales manager Serge Amabile told The Korea Herald. Despite such public concerns, the former city government aggressively pushed for the project with a 3 billion euro private investment. It is expected to break even by next year, Amabile added. The company is currently pushing to expand its Bluebus electric bus service, with a few already running in the capital and other municipalities. In addition to encouraging green transportation, Paris is committed to building an exemplary eco-district in the city to seek the urban sustainability since 2002. With an aim to reach zero energy use, the city has transformed a small neighborhood of Clichy-Batignolles in northwestern Paris into the greenest neighborhood in France.As of now, the 50-hectare region on the outskirts of Paris is currently home to 6,500 residents along with a 10-hectare park and over-140,000-square-meter modern offices with eco-friendly features. The region was nothing more than a railroad company-owned site used for technical facilities and maintenance jobs until a public firm purchased the land for the urban sustainability project.The project was initially pushed as part of the government’s efforts to host the 2012 Olympic Games. Although France failed to host the world’s largest sporting event, Paris continued to promote the eco-region project. In the region, only 12 percent of the area is allocated for roads in order to limit traffic and concentrate flow along a few major roads. The city also made efforts to slow down vehicles and discourage transit traffic by designating 30-kilometer-per-hour speed zones and building winding roads. Under the rule, buildings in the region must meet particularly stringent energy-consumption limitations. All must be equipped with a geothermal-powered urban heating system. The circulated heat is reused for waste burning. The buildings must also have solar panels on the roof. As of now, a combined 40,000 square meters of solar panels are installed in the district, supplying 50 percent of the total energy consumption, city officials said. The active use of the sun’s natural heat and light was possible because the buildings were initially built with effective insulation and glazing, natural ventilation and heat recuperation, the city said. The city also pursues a unique waste collection system. Instead of running waste collection trucks, it introduced a pneumatic underground waste collection system, which sorts the waste before it is sent to waste terminals. The waste is then sucked through underground pipes to the compacting terminal, where just four trucks per week suffice to take the waste away. Building the green district would have been impossible without the public consensus, city officials said.“While it could have affected their daily life during the construction, Parisians around the neighborhood were optimistic of turning the region into an eco-district as they could expect the benefits of the new district,” said eco-district official Nicolas Rouge, who is in charge of managing the sustainable development. With Paris actively putting efforts into carrying out various climate change measures, it has already seen changes in their environment. According to a study conducted by French environment group Airparif conducted between 2002 and 2012, the decade-long efforts to reduce road traffic and encourage green transportation methods led to an unprecedented fall in pollution. The study showed that PM10 emissions fell by 35 percent, nitrogen oxide by 30 percent and greenhouse gases by 13 percent. This was equivalent to exposing 1.7 million fewer residents to fine particles each year. In December, Paris is to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference or COP 21, where countries are likely to declare a new landmark agreement on post-2020 emissions cut targets. The COP 21 is aimed at limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which experts consider as the threshold for climate change.

It took almost three years for the team to study and develop the writing system with sponsorship from the National Research Foundation of Korea.The Aymaran tribe has a population estimated at 3 million in Bolivia, Peru and Chile. It is the largest tribe in Bolivia after Quechua. The Bolivian president is from the Aymaran tribe. The researchers said they began the study in 2012 after finding that the Aymara and Korean languages have much in common in terms of word order and grammar.The team said they are now working on an Aymara-Korean text input method for computers and mobile devices so the tribe can comfortably use hangeul in their daily lives.""We expect the development of the Korean writing system for Aymara will contribute to spreading the Korean alphabet, hangeul, and the Korean culture to the rest of the world, and creating a new market making use of the similarities in the languages,"" Kwon said.In 2010, an Indonesian minority tribe made headlines in South Korea for adopting the Korean alphabet as its official writing system.The Cia-Cia, a tribe of some 80,000 people living in the city of Bau-Bau, located on Buton Island in southeast Sulawesi, was the first foreign language speakers to choose hangeul to transcribe and preserve its fading spoken language.

And many cities around the world are trying to address it. Suwon is spearheading the nation’s effort to foster international cooperation to address climate change,” said Yeom.The city’s green efforts are already paying off. Suwon on Oct. 1 won an award as the country’s most environmentally friendly city by the Korea branch of the World Wildlife Fund, an organization for wildlife conservation and endangered species.The award was based on data registered with the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives’ carbonn Climate Registry (cCR), a platform to assess local and subnational governments’ efforts toward climate actions. Suwon was the first Korean city to sign up to cCR in 2011.The city has racked up positive points in the scope and transparency of its efforts and strategies to cut greenhouse gas emission. Based on its comprehensive plan to address climate change, Suwon announced it would build a strategic road map to achieve its carbon emission reduction goal by 2020 and share its efforts with other cities around the world. As part of these efforts, Suwon last month joined the Compact of Mayors, the world’s largest coalition of city leaders, to address climate change. The city also participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project, an organization that aims to disclose the greenhouse gas emission levels of major corporations, in its endeavor to solidify its footing as Korea’s “environment capital.”To enhance its cooperation with other cities on climate change, Yeom has been meeting with mayors of other cities who lead global green initiatives. In April, Yeom invited Dieter Salomon, the mayor of Freiburg in Germany, to share environmental policies. Freiburg is often touted as “the greenest city in the world.” Salomon’s visit came after a bilateral agreement to expand cooperation on environmental issues at the 2013 Global Town Hall meeting. Since then, Suwon has sent its environment officials to the German city to benchmark its environment policies. The city’s move to enhance international cooperation moves beyond Germany. Since 2011, Yeom has launched an extensive reforestation program in Mongolia and planted more than 60,000 trees in deserted areas. Being recognized for his efforts to improve Mongolia’s natural environment, Yeom was awarded last May by the Mongolian government, a rare and prestigious commendation granted to foreign dignitaries.The mayor’s green initiative is not limited to overseas cooperation. Yeom has rolled out unique environmental policies ranging from the establishment of a green town to public awareness programs on environment issues. Suwon has decided to build its own green town, a neighborhood that minimizes the use of energy, and to preserve a habitat for frogs. An ecological forest will be created with great accessibility to the city’s residents -- six minutes’ walking distance for every resident in Suwon.The mayor also accelerated its outreach efforts to offer tailored green programs to raise public awareness of environmental protection. By 2018, the city aims to allow all the residents to take environment classes, a policy modeled after Freiburg.The city has also been known for its operation of eco-friendly educational facilities. It has designated Namchang Elementary School as a school dedicated to treating students who suffer from atopic disease with due facilities and a treatment system tailored for them. Currently, 130 students attend the school, with 26 receiving treatment for the disease caused by unhygienic environment. Yeom’s relentless efforts to publicize the city’s green initiatives culminated with the city winning the bid for the FIFA 2017 U-2O World Cup Korea in 2017. Suwon and other five cities in Korea will host the event. After Mexico City, Suwon became the second city to host four major FIFA events – FIFA World Cup, FIFA Confederation Cup, FIFA U-2O World Cup and FIFA U-17 World Cup. Leveraging extensive experience in hosting international sporting events, Suwon has garnered positive reviews from the FIFA officials dispatched to assess the city’s readiness to host the game. The officials had reportedly given especially high scores to its accommodation and soccer stadium.Buoyed by the public’s all-out support and the city’s unique cultural heritage, the city aims to be selected as a major hosting cities for the event such as by being able to host an opening ceremony or the playoff. Suwon boasts United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s World Heritage Sites such as Hwaseong Fortress.“Without extensive public support from residents in Suwon city and Gyeonggi Province, we wouldn’t have been selected as the host city of the FIFA U-20 World Cup. We will show the world that Suwon is the epitome of Korea’s culture and sport,” said Yeom.

The annual exam is conducted in November and graded on a nine-level system.The new policy is likely to spark grade inflation for English. According to education firm Uway, roughly one-third of students who took last year’s exam would get the top two grades under the new system, and 23.3 percent would get the top grade.In order to buffer the impact of the 2017 exam, English tests for this year and next year’s Suneung are likely to be easy as well, said Lee Man-gi, an official from Uway.Overall, Lee said making the Suneung English section easier is unlikely to bring the Education Ministry‘s desired effects of reducing private education spending.“With Suneung English failing to determine which students actually excel in the subject, the importance of other key subjects ― math and Korean language ― will increase,” he said, raising concerns of the “balloon effect.”He also said that universities will struggle to find an alternative method to evaluate students’ English skills, such as by having a separate test, which may create a new private education market.Im Seong-ho, chief of Haneul Education, said international schools and foreign language schools are likely to see waning popularity due to the changes. He raised concerns that the frequent overhaul of the Suneung would cause confusion for students, pointing out that the Education Ministry has forewarned of major changes over the next five years.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","2017 college entrance exam ,the 2017 college entrance exam ,2017 college entrance exam known ,2017 exam english tests for ,korea recently confirmed the final","['South Korea', 'Suneung', 'Suneung', 'Uway', 'Lee Man - gi', 'Uway', 'Lee', 'the Education Ministry‘s', 'English', 'korean', 'Im Seong - ho', 'Haneul Education', 'Suneung', 'the Education Ministry']",17,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.07067351  0.39066997

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it plans to crack down on cab drivers who wear sleeveless shirts, short pants, sportswear, slippers or hats that cover the face. Under the current transportation rules, drivers must wear “decent” outfits or the attire designated by taxi companies. Seoul City had initially designated cab driver’s recommended attire, but liberalized the outfits from November 2011 as the drivers complained about the regulation.

The event is part of the program “Delicious Denmark,” designed to showcase Danish open sandwiches, smorrebrod and smushi, to consumers here, who are increasingly searching for different gastronomies. On Wednesday at Mad og Hygge studio in Sinchon in Seoul, journalists and food bloggers participated in a cooking session for the smorrebrod, joined by Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann.  A smorrebrod Danish open sandwich. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“Danish and Nordic food has been gaining growing popularity around the world, as people increasingly care about health and well-being,” Lehmann said. “In Denmark, we produce and consume ingredients directly from our natural surroundings. Danes really care about what goes into our mouths.” Smorrebrod is a traditional Danish dish made of buttered rye bread, which uses whole grains, topped by layers of toppings ranging from liver pate and raw herring to cocktail shrimp and salami. Other toppings such as cooked eggs, tomato, cucumber, cheese, onions and lettuce are used creatively depending on one’s personal taste.As people mix different toppings, some open sandwich restaurants in Denmark have menus that extend as long as 1.5 meters, the ambassador noted. Also, there is regional variety, with the seaside localities using more seafood, such as salmon or herring, and the inland areas bordering Germany using sausages, a Germanic food. Mad og Hygge owner Anne Katrine Salling, an ethnic Korean who lived in Denmark for many years, said that the open sandwich was an old tradition celebrated everywhere in the Scandinavian nation, from family gatherings to casual business meetings. “It’s more of an old Nordic thing,” she said, adding that her grandmothers liked to prepare it. The dish is enjoyed in an atmosphere favorable to friendly association, in a “hygge” setting, meaning a place of friendliness, coziness and cheer. The event also featured a traditional Danish dessert, an apple cake made of macaroons, mashed apples, berry jelly and whipped cream. On Oct. 31, the embassy will organize a cooking session at Daelim Museum in Seoul, introducing an open sandwich variety involving raw fish, smushi, with the help of a Danish chef.

Young couples kissed in the subway and cohabited without shame, petrifying young Choi, who grew up in a country then heavily controlled by the military dictatorship with conservative values.The 22-year-old was a fresh graduate of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, embarking on a graduate program of interpretation and translation at ESIT Universite Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3.For the next 10 years, Choi channeled her studious passion to embrace the new surroundings, and became Korea’s first registered international conference interpreter, Asia’s first doctorate holder in the field and presidential interpreter between the two countries. Aside from her professorship at her home university, Choi has written over 30 books, received the highest award in France, Legion d’Honneur, and founded a communications institute dedicated to promoting Korean culture around the world, which she runs as president.   Hankuk University of Foreign Studies professor and Corea Image Communications Institute president Choi Jung-wha. The Korea Herald“When I did my first interpretation for former French President Francois Mitterrand and Korean President Chun Doo-hwan in 1986, I was so nervous that I murmured, but no voice came out of my mouth,” she told The Korea Herald in an interview. “There were also life-threatening moments, including interpreting inside a malfunctioning nuclear power plant in France, fully dressed up in a protective suit.” When Choi started her career three decades ago, consecutive interpretation, where an interpreter regurgitates an entire speech, was the dominant practice. Over the years, the increasing scarcity of time made simultaneous interpretation more popular. The latter is done by an interpreter translating a sentence before it is finished, after composing a “meaning unit” based on context and words. For a small number of people involved, “whispering” is used, she said, explaining that an interpreter communicates with clients from behind. “Interpretation requires transmitting the subtlest of human emotions,” she stressed. “Therefore, a strong mother tongue is essential for anyone vying to be an interpreter.”As there aren’t enough interpreters well-versed in Korean, the “bi-actif” method of two-way interpretation is commonly practiced among Korean professionals, she noted.  Then-presidential interpreter Choi Jung-wha poses between former Korean President Kim Dae-jung (left) and former French President Jacques Chirac during a state visit in Paris in October 2000. (Corea Image Communications Institute)According to the academic, one big advantage of an interpreter career is being able to engage a wide spectrum of intellectual exercises, including chemistry, history, finance, cooking, music and weaponry. She also claimed that journalism was the closest vocation to interpretation, with both relying on communication and public relations. Another advantage Choi noted was earning large amounts of money for a short duration of work. For one to six hours, a simultaneous interpreter in Korea takes home some $900, plus more for extra hours.The professor said that despite the high financial rewards, the job was physically and psychologically demanding, calling for “extreme concentration, analysis, strength and spontaneity.” Choi personally sticks to a flexible regimen of swimming, jogging, healthy diet and deep sleep, not to mention an optimistic attitude. There are in-house interpreters on one hand, who work either part-time, contract-based, or full-time as regular employees, and freelancers on the other, the professor said. At most interpretation schools, the vast majority are women, as they prefer part-time work to balance with family life. In 2003, Choi established the Corea Image Communications Institute, a nonprofit organization registered under Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which promotes Korean culture around the world. The institute’s gatherings -- Korea CQ Forum and 5.4 Club -- bring together opinion leaders from diplomacy, law, business, medicine, journalism, culture and cuisine for year-round networking, lectures and travel.  Chinese actress Tang Wei (left), is given a Stepping Stone Bridge Award by Choi Jung-hwa, CICI president and professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. (CICI)“Whereas my career revolved around the France-Korea relations in the beginning,” she said, “it has now become global, helped by my interaction with diplomats who are CICI members.” Choi said her work was initially tied to the booming industries between France and Korea -- telecommunications, nuclear power, TGV high-speed railway and aerospace. But over the years, it has come to incorporate culture increasingly, buoyed by Korea’s economic and cultural globalization. “When I went to Paris last month to mark 130 years of bilateral ties, I was guided by French staff speaking Korean,” Choi said. “I was told many times that there were so many French people eager to learn Korean language and culture, but there weren’t enough Korean teachers in France. I got many requests to send Korean teachers.”While underscoring the growing cultural ties, the professor pointed to the blue ocean of possibilities overseas, contending that young Korean job seekers single-mindedly focused on the domestic market. “In this globalized world,” Choi argued, “you have to be a pathfinder and explorer, finding and creating opportunities before anyone else.” She urged young Koreans to pursue careers they desired. As Korean culture is becoming progressively known worldwide, she suggested that there were always areas where jobs were to be found, and even made.Reflecting on the last 13 years of managing CICI, Choi said Korean culture had a “very distinct identity” that blended tradition and modernity dynamically. “Starting from dramas and music to fashion, food and architecture, we have uniquely fused our traditional identity with cutting-edge technologies,” she highlighted.What Korea lacks in its cultural promotion, however, is “the attention to details” that can weld “hard” and “soft” elements impeccably to the finish, she asserted. “To do so, we need more creativity, sensibility and sophistication in all areas, from culture and education to industry and technology.”“In France,” she added, “there is an association called ‘Comite Colbert,’” a gild of 75 French luxury brands that collectively promotes the industry. “Its guiding value is ‘Emerveillement,’ meaning utter wonder or awe.”Similar to the Japanese artisans and masters who have refined their trade over generations, Choi said that Korea should aim for “emerveillement,” and make it sustainable over time. “My ambition is to animate and fire up foreigners’ interest in Korean culture that has just been ignited,” she said. “To make it more delicate and enduring, that’s where I think hallyu’s next challenge lies.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","young korean job seekers single ,liberal culture young couples kissed ,fresh graduate of hankuk university ,enough korean teachers in france ,paris last month to mark","['Choi Jung - wha', 'France', 'Choi', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Choi', 'Korea ’s', 'Choi', 'France', 'korean', 'University of Foreign Studies', 'Corea Image Communications Institute', 'Choi Jung - wha', 'french', 'Francois Mitterrand', 'korean', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'the Korea Herald', 'France', 'Choi', 'Korean', 'korean', 'Choi Jung - wha', 'korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'french', 'Jacques Chirac', 'Paris', 'Corea Image Communications', 'Choi', 'Korea', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'the Corea Image Communications Institute', 'Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Tang Wei', 'Stepping Stone Bridge Award', 'Choi Jung - hwa', 'cici', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'cici)“wherea', 'France', 'cici', 'Choi', 'France', 'Korea', 'TGV', 'Korea', 'Paris', 'french', 'korean', 'Choi', 'french', 'korean', 'France', 'korean', 'korean', 'Choi', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Choi', 'korean', 'Korea', 'France', 'french', 'japanese', 'Choi', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Joel Lee']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.886213    0.71490937

The five-day event will also address international cooperation for a cohesive global fire management strategy.  A helicopter fights a fire in a mountainous region. (KFS)This year’s IWFC will be hosted by the Korea Forest Service and Gangwon Provincial Government. “Wildland fires have been increasingly frequent around the world, due to the rising world population, the rapidly changing ways of land use and climate change,” a KFS official said. “Wildland fires defy a single country’s efforts -- they require joint efforts from international society.”The IWFC will consist of conferences, visits to sites struck by fire and those undergoing restoration, exhibitions and firefighting demonstrations. About 2,000 participants from 88 countries, including forest and environment ministers, policymakers, researchers, scholars, international organizations and nongovernment organizations, will share their knowledge and experience of fire management methodology and team up to tighten international cooperation for sustainable use of the world’s environment. Top experts from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Global Fire Monitoring Center, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Tropical Timber Organization, will play leading roles in the panel discussions, plenary sessions and related subconferences. This year’s topics also encompass an agenda on fire and disaster management, such as the modeling of past, current and future fire regimes, fire ecology; fire, human health and security; fire-atmosphere-climate interactions; adapting forest management, climate change and community-based fire management.The event will also address land and fire management policies; disaster and security management strategies; advanced fire management tools and international cooperation in fire management.KFS officials participate in a rural community’s controlled burning of farmland in an effort to prevent forest fires. (KFS)This is the first time that the IWFC will be held in an Asian country. Since its launch in 1989 in Boston, the IWFC has been held every four years, with host countries being Canada, Australia, Spain and South Africa. This year’s IWFC also puts strong emphasis on innovation in fire management. In addition to world-class experts’ knowledge, the international big-event will present state-of-the-art technologies on fire security systems and solutions, offering ample opportunities for exporters and buyers around the globe. As a representative of South Korea’s leading expertise of 40 years in afforestation and firefighting know-how, it will introduce the latest applications of information and communications technology for real-time fire controls. Margareta Wahlstrom, first special representative of the secretary-general for U.N. Disaster Risk Reduction and the head of UNISDR, has stepped up as this year’s special speaker. Wahlstrom has gained world recognition for her extensive experience in both disaster relief operations and disaster risk management, with the United Nations system and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.Eleven keynote speakers will share their expertise on the legacy of fire, community and wild-land fire and cohesive global fire management strategy. Stephen J. Pyne, regent’s professor of Arizona State University School of Life Sciences and Winston S.W.

The meeting is designed to drum up support for a deal on cutting down greenhouse gases at the U.N. Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris later this year.  In June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it lets business run as usual.  On Sunday, Park is set to hold two separate summits with her counterparts from Pakistan and Denmark on the sidelines.   Park also plans to address the U.N. General Assembly and attend a separate U.N. summit on peacekeeping operations.   Park appears likely to mention North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs during her speech as North Korea has ratcheted up fresh tensions with those programs.  North Korea has recently vowed to launch a series of satellites, seen by Seoul and Washington as a cover for testing its ballistic missile technology.  North Korea did not provide any specific time frame for the satellite launches, but there is speculation that it may launch a long-range rocket in October to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.  The North also suggested that it may conduct a nuclear test in response to what it claims is the hostile policy of the United States and other hostile forces.  North Korea agreed to scrap its nuclear programs in exchange for diplomatic concessions and economic aid under a landmark 2005 deal with the United States, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan.   Still, the North later backtracked from its commitment and conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, drawing international condemnation and U.N. sanctions.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said the Hi Seoul Festival will offer over 50 global and local street performances, mobilizing stages and circuses from Oct. 1-4 in central Seoul. Under the theme “Let’s play on the street,” the event will include 10 international performances from six countries, including the U.K., France and Spain. The U.K.’s popular midair performance “As the World Tipped” played by Wired Aerial Theatre will open the festival on the first day. This is the first time that the performance is to be played in the Asian region, officials said. The closing performance, “Yeongja,” will display the 70-year-long Korean modern history with an 8-meter-tall doll “Yeongja” and local art groups. The large doll will play a symbolic role in Korean history, they added. About 8,000 citizens have participated in organizing the four-day event, the most in its history. Many will take part in street performances, including the closing ceremony. Launched in 2003, the annual program transformed into a street art festival in 2013.Celebrating the third year of transitioning into street festivities, the city will hold an international street art conference with global experts to discuss the future of the industry, the city said. The programs and performances will be held at around Seoul City Hall, Seoul Plaza, Gwanghwamun Square and Seoul Station. All are open to the public for free, the city said.

Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldWhile narrating their unique life experiences in Canada and Korea, the speakers conveyed messages of unity and universality in a live interaction with audience. Han, who runs social food enterprises Yori and Slobbie, said that Toronto between 2003 and 2005, where she learned English and worked at restaurants, was “the happiest” time of her life. “What I felt most genuinely in Canada were diversity and freedom,” Han stressed. “It was a horizontal diversity, and people seemed to trust one other and exchanged positive energy. There were no artificial boundaries and I never felt discriminated against.”Han said she also reveled in the free atmosphere, which felt precious as she was used to Korea’s “paternalistic” and “parochial” norms.  Social food entrepreneur Han Young-mi. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldAfter returning to Korea, Han established start-ups in the food business that hired women from multicultural families. Contrary to their rose-tinted ideals of Korean life, having a Korean husband proved to be emotionally draining to these women, Han learned.“Working with them gave glimpses into their lives,” she noted, adding that to assimilate, they had to master so many things from learning Korean to eating kimchi and catering to their prickly mothers-in-law.“However, many Korean families prevented them from speaking their mother tongue, effectively cutting communication with their children,” she said. “Our families and schools need to be much more open and generous toward these new members of our society. The problem of Korea is not being able to recognize and respect differences.”Han claimed that despite the social and political discourses that emphasize nationalist, ethnocentric sentiments, Koreans are merely “early settlers” of the land, rather than “natives.”“We simply happen to have arrived here earlier,” she pointed out. “Then, there must be others who come after us. As a humane society, it is our duty to help them adapt to their new homes. I learned this in Canada where I felt taken care of upon arrival.”Her business aims to build bridges and restore frayed ties between individuals through food. Aiming to create a sustainable eating ecosystem, it has strengthened contacts with local farms in Korea, provided food to children and people with disabilities and trained young chefs.   Guest speaker Steve Hatherly. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldHatherly, a native of Nova Scotia on Canada’s east coast, said that Canadians were “extremely proud” of the country’s cultural and ethnic diversity. “Of the 35 million people in Canada, only 20 million are native English speakers,” he underscored. “If you walk down the street in any city in Canada, you will come across people of all different colors and walks of life.” Noting that his 15 years here has endowed him a “Busan guy” character, Hatherly encouraged the participants to harness their similarities as opposed to harping on differences. Guest speaker Cha Sang-gu. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldVancouver-native Cha urged the guests to follow their dreams, by relying on their “heart” than “brain.” Quoting Apple founder late Steve Jobs, Cha said: “Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.” Cha, who has worked with musicians Elton John and TLC, aspires to be a hallyu tour de force. He said he was inspired by Korean singer Psy after watching his megahit “Gangnam Style” on YouTube.

Opening the door is Alexandre Jollien, a best-selling Swiss author and philosopher. His easygoing smile further comforts the visitor.Jollien speaks and walks slowly due to his cerebral palsy, but it does not deter him from pursuing intellectual work. Instead, it motivates him to create his renowned literature pieces.Since 1999, he has written six French books about philosophy. In recognition of his talent, Jollien won the Mottart Prize and Montyon Prize in the literature and philosophy section from the French Academy for his first book “Eloge de la Faiblesse (In Praise of Weakness)” in 2000. Alexandre Jollien (Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald)Despite his prominent work, he made the sudden decision to move to Seoul two years ago with his wife and three children. He said he had only to achieve one goal: finding inner peace. “I wanted to find real inner peace. Although I studied philosophy in college and kept questioning myself about the meaning of life, nothing came up until I discovered Zen here. I wanted to be free from desire and anxiety,” he said in an interview with The Korea Herald. Jollien currently studies Zen from priest and religion professor Seo Myeong-weon at Sogang University in Seoul. Zen or Zen Buddhism is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes enlightenment through meditation-practice and self-contemplation. He came to know the priest through a radio show in Switzerland five years ago. Seo, a former Canadian who was naturalized as Korean, is well known for combining the studies of Catholicism and Buddhism. “I was searching for an expert who could teach me the wisdom of daily life. As soon as I heard his radio talk, I immediately knew that he was the person I was looking for,” he said. Although he is Catholic, his infatuation with Zen is not religiously contradictory, but complimentary with his religion, the author said. “We don’t have to struggle with religion. The most important thing is to learn from each religion. Zen is about being here and now. It teaches the way to stay simple and peaceful. The daily meditation helps me deepen my original religious faith,” he said. His efforts to finding inner peace were not motivated by his scholarly curiosity at first. It was rather an essential means to accept reality and understand the meaning of life.The writer had cerebral palsy after the umbilical cord coiled around his neck when he was born in 1975. At age 3, he was sent to a special care center for the disabled and separated from his family for 17 years except for weekends. Every day was a challenge for him as he struggled with his physical difficulties, his mentality and his spirit.“Staying without parents was a huge suffering to me. It was difficult to accept that my friends and I were different from others. It would have been impossible to stay there without the solidarity and friendship that the center members and I formed together,” he recalled.Thanks to the center’s support and his ardent efforts, he was able to walk at age 9 and ride a bike at 18. He also managed to attend college in Dublin, Ireland, and study Western philosophy. He was one of only few disabled in the center’s decades-long history who succeeded in gaining college admission.No matter how much philosophy he studied in college, he still struggled to find inner peace until he met Seo and started daily meditation, he added. “While philosophy is logical and intelligent, meditation embraces the wisdom of life. It helps me empty all unnecessary preoccupation and obsession. Happiness is not something you can achieve. It comes from accepting the reality,” he said. He stressed that humans are not born to be humans, but to become humans. “To become a complete human, we need to practice and conduct philosophical exercise every day. Humans can easily become slaves of emotional passion and prejudice. We need to put efforts to free ourselves from the ego. This is our vocation,” the philosopher said.He recently published the Korean translation of his second book “Vocation to be Humans,” which was first published in 2002. So far, the book has been published in nine countries including Korea. He illustrated in the book that life is a “joyful challenge” as humans have to keep facing and overcoming pain and challenges while grasping meaning from them. Although he has been in a peaceful state of mind since studying Zen, he still sometimes faces unavoidable challenges not from himself but from others. “I can cope with the pain that I face, and accept my physical challenges such as slow moves. But the only thing that is still challenging to me is the public perception toward disability,” the writer said. “I think people should recognize that the physical disability is not something that can be instantly improved, while people’s perception and prejudice are something that can be easily changed.”For now, he does not plan to go back to his home country thanks to the warm hospitality of Koreans, he said. Even the public bathhouse he goes to every day is where he can learn what he calls “equality.” “I love Koreans and the culture here. It feels so good when people view each other without any prejudice. Even at the public bathhouse, I can feel a sense of solidarity as people view each other without thinking of social status or pretense.” His three children are also well adjusted to life in Korea. Other than 5-year-old daughter Celeste, his 11-year-old daughter Victorine and 9-year-old Augustine go to a Korean public school. Asked if she wanted to go to Switzerland, Victorine shook her head, saying she loves the school life here. While Jollien said he would continue meditation toward inner peace in Korea, he suggested a simple tip of reaching inner happiness. “Welcome your weakness and love others with compassion and mercy. Happiness is always within you.”By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","best selling swiss author ,six french books about philosophy ,apartment in central seoul opening ,jollien best selling swiss author ,best selling swiss author and","['Seoul', 'Alexandre Jollien', 'swiss', 'Jollien', 'french', 'Jollien', 'Montyon Prize', 'the French Academy', 'Alexandre Jollien', 'Park Hae - mook', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'Jollien', 'Seo Myeong - weon', 'Sogang University', 'Seoul', 'Mahayana', 'Switzerland', 'Canadian', 'korean', 'catholic', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'Seo', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Celeste', 'Victorine', 'Augustine', 'korean', 'Switzerland', 'Victorine', 'Jollien', 'Korea', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55338705  0.89740145

Attendants included SDSN executive director Guido Schmidt-Traub (from left), DDPP director Jim Williams, IDDRI scientific director Michel Colombier and IDDRI director Teresa Ribera. (Lee Hyun-jeong/The Korea Herald)PARIS ― Deeply reducing greenhouse gas emissions is technically and economically feasible in the world’s largest economies and developing countries, an international research consortium’s report showed Thursday. According to the “Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project’s 2015 Synthesis Report,” limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius is achievable as long as the countries keep the “three pillars” in their green policies. “Our study shows that keeping three principles ― energy efficiency, low carbon-electricity and fuel switching ― can lead the world to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius using technologies that are already commercial or expected to be within the needed timeframe,” said DDPP director Jim Williams, at a conference held in Paris this week.“We, however, don’t think this is an ultimate solution. The most important thing is the strong implementation by the government.” The DDPP is a collaborative global research initiative formed in 2013 to lend scientific support to calls for more aggressive anticarbon moves, and understand how individual countries can transition to a low-carbon economy consistent with the internationally agreed goal of limiting anthropogenic warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. It consists of scholars from leading research institutions in 16 countries, which represent 74 percent of current global carbon emissions from energy. They are South Korea, the U.S, the U.K., Japan, China, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Russia, South Africa and Mexico. The researchers develop the “deep decarbonization pathways” ― a sector-by-sector blueprint of changes over time in physical infrastructure ― that will inform decision-makers about the technological requirements and costs of different options for reducing emissions. The ideas are based on each country’s conditions and circumstances. Each country’s representatives are autonomous in defining their own scenarios and objectives in the analysis.At the conference, the second such report was released, following the first submitted to the U.N. Climate Change Summit last year. It was also part of the efforts to urge the countries to take more ambitious moves against the climate change ahead of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in December in Paris. The conference is convened by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Paris-based nonprofit policy research body Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relation.Unlike other global projects with a target date of around 2030, the DDPP is targeting 2050 for the carbon cut plan in order to view the issue in the long run. “It’s about legacy. The DDPPs are not forecasts of future outcomes but ‘backcasts’ that begin with an emissions target in 2050 and determine the steps required to get there. Having the long-term view will enable countries to think the consequence each of their short-term policies,” said Michel Colombier, the scientific director of IDDRI. In the several sessions of roundtables of the conference, each country’s representatives shared their feasible carbon cut plans and sought better ways to promote the anticarbon moves. The officials voiced that energy efficiency could reduce the energy intensity of the gross domestic product by an average of 65 percent, with nearly all countries making their economies two to four times more energy efficient in 2050 compared to 2010. This could be accomplished through measures such as improving vehicle fuel economy, better building design and construction material and more efficient appliances and industrial processes, they said. Reducing fossil fuel-based electricity generation and introducing more mixes of renewable energy is essential as well. In the case of Korea, the economic structure was pointed to as a challenging factor for decarbonization, as the export-led economic growth highly depends on manufacturing such as steel and petrochemicals. As of 2011, Korea is the seventh-highest carbon emitter, while ranking 15th in terms of gross domestic product in 2012. “The problem is that unlike many other developed countries, the economic growth of Korea has not been decoupled from the emissions. For Korea’s further growth, the government has no choice but to rely on such heavy industries,” said SDSN-Korea director Young Soo-gil, who is in charge of Korea’s report. The energy-intensive heavy industries are already very energy efficient according to international standards, having little room to see further improvements in the heavy industries, he added. The most practical decarbonization plan for Korea is, therefore, maximizing energy efficiency while seeking renewable energies, despite poor resources and environmental conditions, Young said. Switching the source of fossil fuel from coal to natural gas while pursuing the carbon capture and storage technology, or CCS, is one feasible option, he said. CCS is a technology that can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions produced from the fossil fuels in electricity generation, preventing the carbon from entering the atmosphere.As of this year, 53 coal-fired power stations are running across the country, supporting 40 percent of the nationwide electricity usage. The report showed that CCS technology can lower Korea’s energy-related emissions by 86 percent by 2050.CCS, however, currently needs further technological development and ample space to store the emissions, experts said. “Korea is one of the leading countries in innovative technology development.

The units are set to be completed by 2018.  She said the new rental apartments could help stabilize the country's housing market, citing that tenants can stay up to eight years and annual rent hikes are capped at a maximum of five percent.  Her comments came amid a change in the local housing market due mainly to the low interest rate. South Korea's central bank has left its benchmark policy rate unchanged at a record low of 1.5 percent for September.  More and more people are paying monthly rent for their accommodations in recent years, a departure from South Korea's decades-old unique home rental system known as jeonse.  Under the jeonse system, tenants pay a lump-sum deposit, known as key money, to the landlord which is then returned at the end of the rental agreement, which usually lasts two years. Also, during the lease period, the tenants do not pay monthly rent.  The average key money for more than half of the apartments in Seoul has surpassed 350 million won ($299,000), according to data compiled by Kookmin Bank, a flagship unit of South Korea's leading banking giant KB Financial Group Inc.  In comparison, the key money and monthly rent of an 84-square-meter New Stay apartment is 65 million won and 550,000 won, respectively.

Now you can get married,” says the slogan.It is only when the confounded viewer’s eyes wonder to the bottom-right corner and finds the name of the advertiser, “― Plastic Surgery,” that the message it is trying to convey becomes clear: You cannot get married if you are ugly.Bewildered, he may step outside the train and onto the busy streets of Apgujeong-dong ― one of most affluent parts of Seoul ― to find himself surrounded by brightly lit images of beautiful people smiling and looking happy, trying to hammer home the message that cosmetic surgery is the key to happiness.The scene begs the question: Are looks a crucial element to successful life in South Korea?“I never realized it in school, but I have felt that way from time to time after I started working,” said a 29-year-old office worker surnamed Jeong. “A friend of mine compiled a report at her work, but her boss forbade her to make the presentation and had a ‘prettier’ coworker do it instead. This is when she realized that looks are power. A few months later, she had plastic surgery.”After some time hopping between temporary contracts, Jeong recently had plastic surgery herself ― to her great personal satisfaction. Her suspicion that attractive people get all the advantages is backed by a survey last year by a local job information website Saramin, which found that 64 percent of human resources staff evaluate a job applicants’ looks. Some 35 percent said that good looks suggested good relationships with other people, and another 34 percent said that it was an indicator of one’s self management skills.Make-up, clothes and photo shoots for job interviews put extra strain on young Koreans struggling in a weak job market.But the focus on looks is not confined to job applications. Lee Seung-min, a 19-year-old student at a Seoul-based university, said her parents gave her so-called “double-eyelid” surgery for her high school graduation gift, which is pretty common for girls her age.The popular surgery, also known as East Asian blepharoplasty, is done to create an upper eyelid with a crease to make one’s eyes look bigger.“I heard my mom say it used to be like a big deal when she was younger, but it’s not such a taboo now,” she said.The psychological barrier to getting cosmetic surgery that existed up until the early 2000s appears to have all but vanished, with celebrities openly joking about their surgical experiences on TV.This is also implied by the popularity of local makeover shows that offer to change participants’ appearances through surgery, makeup and fashion advice.A frontrunner in the category ― and a focal point of controversy since its launch in 2011 ― is “Let Me In” by tvN.Producer Park Hyun-woo said the program ― which selects the participants from some 4,000 to 5,000 applicants per season ― was launched to help women suffering from their looks, by inducing not only physical changes but also giving them counseling that will help them gain confidence and work better with others. “Many of our participants are people who could barely do anything outside due to personal problems. What they want is not to become pretty, but to lead a normal life like others,” he said. Some applicants even go into modeling and acting, such as a participant in the fourth season whose complex was her height and big gums.“I think it’s positive because they don’t do plastic surgeries on just anyone. They help people who have trouble with their everyday lives,” said a 31-year-old private tutor surnamed Yoon on the program.But other viewers took issue with how “Let Me In” depicted the “transformation” process.One of the early participants of the show was dubbed “Frankenstein woman” because of her looks, and scenes of other people actively avoiding an overweight woman were also shown in the show. “I am concerned that the program may convey the message that ugly, fat women are just not worth anything, said a 27-year-old office worker. “These programs derogate women as people whose sole value lies in their looks, and not as independent beings who can stand on her own. I’m worried that it will spread the misperception that woman ‘have to be pretty.’”The program is not just focused on women’s looks. One of the more recent candidates was a man who has been dating his girlfriend for over two years, but her parents forbid them to get married because of his cleft lip and palate. Her father turned him away with the words, “Go marry someone of your own kind!” This changed apparently when he reemerged after a year of treatment and surgery. He said the girlfriend’s parents had finally accepted their daughter’s now-handsome fiance.Opponents of the show say despite the show’s original intent, scenes like this convey a clear message that key to happiness lies in one’s looks.Last week, local women’s rights group Women Link filed for an injunction to ban the show. “I’m sure there are people who are leading happy lives thanks to plastic surgery,” said an official from Women Link. “But the show doesn’t stop at helping the person. Many people who watch the show develop positive feelings toward cosmetic surgery. They (producers) should be more careful because, as a popular TV show, it has great influence toward people.“The fundamental problem is that it depicts life before surgery as misery, and glorifies the effects the surgery had on their lives.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","makeup and fashion advice frontrunner ,in tvn large subway billboard ,her high school graduation gift ,girlfriend parents had finally accepted ,advertiser plastic surgery that the","['Apgujeong - dong ― one', 'Seoul', 'Jeong', 'Jeong', 'Saramin', 'Koreans', 'Lee Seung - min', 'Seoul', 'east asian', 'Park Hyun - woo', 'Yoon', 'frankenstein']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69109911  0.21720828

Cho Kyu-jun's ""The Stranger"" received the grand prize, while the ""Best Short under 10 Min"" went to ""The Present Future,"" by Kim Joong-yub.In addition, Philipp Andonie of Switzerland won the best director for ""Nachtschicht,"" while Paul Trillo of the United States received the jury prize for ""The Life and Death of an iPhone.""This year, the festival introduced a feature section for the first time in the history of global smartphone film festivals.The award-winning films will be shown at the CGV Apgujeong theater as well as on the festival's homepage and Olleh TV, KT's IPTV service, on Thursday and Friday.In South Korea, a country where more than 60 percent of the country's population has smartphones, the devices are fast becoming an option for filmmaking. Public interest in the use of smartphones for filmmaking began to grow when acclaimed South Korean director Park Chan-wook, best known for ""Oldboy"" (2003), and his brother, Park Chan-kyong, shot a short film on an iPhone 4 in 2011. The brothers brought home the Golden Bear award of the International Short Film Jury at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival for the film ""Night Fishing.""

During the meeting, Xi touted the bilateral relationship has developed to its “best-ever” in terms of politics, economy, trade, people-to-people exchanges and other areas, thanks to the two leaders’ cooperation. Park, for her part, expressed gratitude for taking a “constructive” role in tackling a recent flare-up in tensions with North Korea, stressing the significance of the two nations’ “strategic collaboration” and a unification of the peninsula in ensuring peace in the region.  President Park Geun-hye (left) and her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping chat before their lunch meeting in Bejing on Wednesday. (Yonhap)For South Korea, the rising global power is one of its biggest trade, tourism and investment partners and the most pivotal leverage holder in deterring Pyongyang’s nuclear advancement. For China, a closer relationship with Seoul is indispensable in stabilizing Northeast Asia, keeping the U.S. and Japan in check and nailing down its ambitious regional projects.With the alliance with the U.S. being the backbone of South Korea’s security, however, its ties with China have long focused on economic cooperation. Seoul has been in recent years compelled to walk a fine line between the two world powers as their rivalries escalate over trade, currency and strategic supremacy in the Asia Pacific. Former administrations have tended to oscillate between them depending on their ideologies. Since her swearing-in in early 2013, Park has been taking a different approach -- to sustain the “best” bilateral relations both with the U.S. and China. While keeping up the U.S. ties, she has sought to transform the relationship with China into a more diverse one that entails greater strategic cooperation. With Xi, she herself tried, and apparently succeeded in, building personal rapport. During their summit last year, the two presidents agreed to install a military hotline, closing long dragged-out discussions that were initiated seven years ago. Park is slated to attend a massive military parade in Beijing on Thursday, to which the South Korean military also unprecedentedly sent a three-member delegation led by a three-star general at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Given the recent increased tensions on the Korean peninsula, it is of some surprise to see South Korean President Park planning to attend, but not (North Korean leader Kim Jong-un),” Lauren Dickey, a researcher at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said in a recent commentary piece. “This comes into even starker relief when juxtaposed with the powerful U.S.-South Korean military alliance that keeps 28,500 US troops stationed on the peninsula.” Yet the new strategy has also brought dilemmas and setbacks, demanding Seoul make a tricky choice between them in delicate issues such as joining a China-led development bank and the possible stationing of advanced U.S. missile defense assets here. Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se even came under fire early this year for arguing that to get “love calls” from both of the powers constitutes a “blessing,” not a dilemma. The sensitivity was also laid bare in the lead-up to her trip. Though it has already decided to take part in the military parade, Cheong Wa Dae postponed its announcement almost to the last minute, apparently wary of potential backlash from not only Washington, but others at home and abroad cautious about security cooperation with Beijing. Though the U.S. expressed its respect of the decision in a formal setting, many officials from there did not attempt to hide their uncomfortable feelings behind the curtains. For the approach to turn into a “blessing” in the face of South Korea’s geopolitical situation, Seoul should set up clear goals and define its interests -- the “core” of its dual diplomacy -- as well as long-term principles and strategies that could endure changes of the administration, said Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. ”Aside from the single-term presidency and ideological polarization in society, the government’s foreign policy priorities have often been subject to debate due to a lack of bipartisan, nationwide consensus-building process about diplomatic principles and strategies,” he said in a recent analysis. “South Korea should make clear its position built on its national goals and interests before the U.S. and China respectively heap pressure for their own interests, so that the pressure will not be about choice but negotiations aimed at finding a nexus between the sides’ interests.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","china closer relationship with seoul ,parade in beijing on thursday ,korean president park planning to ,massive military parade in beijing ,summit wednesday between presidents park","['Xi Jinping', 'Seoul', 'Xi', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Bejing', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Xi', 'Beijing', 'south korean', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Park', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Lauren Dickey', 'the Council on Foreign Relations', 'Washington', 'U.S.-South korean', 'US', 'Seoul', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Kim Han - kwon', 'the Korea National Diplomatic Academy', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",14,"[ 2.          1.          0.         ... -0.47310585  0.46224841

Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldCanadian Ambassador Eric Walsh’s favorite book is “Lost in the Barrens” by Farley Mowat, an adventure and coming-of-age story that takes place in northern Manitoba and the southwestern North West Territories in 1935. Walsh said he was moved by the book’s vivid tale of survival and friendship of two boys in their late teenage years, which he read in his teens and still remains etched in his memory. On Sept. 17 at 7 p.m., a TED Salon event will be held at the Canadian Embassy in Seoul, where four speakers will lecture on different issues, showcase live performances and interact with the audience. “Seoul Meets Canada” is an annual event launched in 2013 to promote bilateral cultural understanding and exchange through a partnership between the Canadian Embassy and Seoul city government.

Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldSingapore, meaning the “Lion City,” is a treasure trove of multicultural, gastronomical, architectural, artistic and environmental wonders, owing to its precarious existence at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It is a global city state of 5.5 million citizens of various ethnicities ― 74 percent Chinese, 13 percent Malay, 9 percent Indian and 3 percent from other backgrounds ― who live in harmony within a resilient national identity. The world’s largest travel guidebook publisher, Lonely Planet, this year chose Singapore as the world’s top tourism destination. As Singapore and Korea draw closer through diplomacy, commerce and culture, a growing number of people are traveling to both countries, lured by their ultramodern and traditional charms. Half a million Koreans traveled to Singapore last year, reciprocated by 200,000 Singaporeans visiting Korea, and the number is expected to grow. The “Five Days in Singapore” exhibition by Korean photographer Kim Jung-man at Seoul Auction Gangnam. Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“2015 is a very special year for Singapore as we celebrate 50 years of our independence and 40 years of diplomatic relations with Korea,” Singaporean Ambassador Yip Wei Kiat said in a speech on Wednesday. “Mr. Park’s artistic interpretation will help our friends in Korea better understand and experience the sights, sounds and identities of Singapore.”Lonely Planet, Seoul Auction, the Singaporean Embassy and Singapore Tourism Board collaborated for the exhibition, whose entire proceeds will go to the Korea University Medical Center to support senior citizens’ eyesight recovery operations. “This exhibition will introduce Singapore’s progressive modernity, unique cultural tapestry and heritage, as well as lesser known gems to the Korean audience,” said the board’s regional director for North Asia, Markus Tan. Tan noted that Singapore has continued to invest in its tourism assets to attract leisure and business visitors. The city state’s calendar is full of festivals and events, including the Great Singapore Sale, Singapore Food Festival and the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix. The World Rugby Sevens Series will come to Singapore next year. Singaporean Ambassador Yip Wei Kiat.

The number of daily visitors in May before the fear of the disease had spread stood at around 39,000.The country had been suffering from a sharp decline in the number of visitors since the MERS outbreak, which claimed 36 lives and infected 186 people here. South Korea declared a de facto end to the outbreak on July 28, about two months after it reported its first case.“The resolution of the MERS outbreak and various policy measures to attract foreign tourists apparently have had an impact,” the ministry said. The government has been making various efforts to revitalize the local tourism industry, including exempting visa fees for visitors arriving on group tours.

Under the scenarios of a local attack and all-out aggression by North Korea, the forces fired off K-55 and K-9 self-propelled guns, recoilless guns, and Vulcan automatic cannons at mock enemy camps in a remote drill field in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, near the border with North Korea.A host of KF-16, F-15K and F-4 fighter jets were also flown to bombard mock enemy command facilities, with A-10 Thunderbolt attack aircraft, tanks and machine guns spreading a barrage of shells and rockets. South Korean officials said the deployed weapons and vehicles would have been deployed to the front-line if the recent inter-Korean tensions had escalated into a military clash. The two Koreas narrowly averted a military confrontation earlier this week as they reached a breakthrough deal to defuse tensions.Inter-Korean tensions had sharply escalated after the countries had a rare exchange of live-fire over the border on Aug. 20, over South Korea's border-area propaganda broadcasts critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his political regime.Seoul launched the psychological warfare on Aug. 10 in retaliation for the North's land mine attack that maimed two South Korean soldiers earlier this month.First launched in 1977, the Integrated Firepower Exercise is meant to show off the allies' combined artillery power against North Korea.This year's exercise is the eighth of its kind with the previous one held in 2012. About 2,000 South Korean and U.S. troops from 47 military units joined the drill, which featured South Korea's newly deployed high-tech weaponry like K-2 tanks, K-21 armored vehicles, Surion choppers and FA-50 Fighting Eagle combat jets, as well as a multi-launch rocket system. About 12,000 government officials, civilians, foreign military attaches and security experts, including President Park Geun-hye, observed the live-fire artillery exercise.""I have learned how we could deal sternly with the enemy's provocations and gained confidence that we could win against the enemy,"" said Lt. Col. Huh Jin-young, a tank battalion commander of the Army 8th Division, during the exercise.Separately, Park met with about 80 soldiers who delayed their discharge from the military during the recent tensions with North Korea. Park told them that all South Koreans ""were deeply moved"" by their decision.""People are very proud of you,"" Park said as she shook hands with some of them after the end of the drill.

She has admitted to taking the images, but denied any responsibility for distributing them online. A woman accused of secretly filming women in the showers at a water park is escorted out of the police station in Yongin on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Choi said she was asked to film the images for 1 million won ($850) each time by a man she met online in spring 2014, according to an investigative team from Yongin Dongbu Police Station in charge of the case. “The supposed accomplice has not been verified yet. ... We are currently focusing our efforts on who that person is,” officials said. The suspect reportedly told the police that she committed the crime because she needed the money, and that she was sorry to the victims. The case came to light in mid-August when the images were leaked online via a porn website based outside the country. The two videos -- each under 10 minutes long -- show the women’s shower room at the resort, exposing the victims’ bodies and faces. Police said Choi filmed about 185 minutes of illegal footage. On Aug. 17, officials at the Everland theme park in Gyeonggi Province reported the case to local police, saying that one of the videos appeared to have been filmed at its water park. Officials saw a brief image of a woman in the footage, who was holding a cellphone and appeared to be filming, and identified Choi as the suspect on Tuesday.They were on a stakeout near her father’s house in South Jeolla Province around 6 p.m. Around 9 p.m., she visited a local police station to accuse her father of assaulting her.

The project aims at boosting the local economy and improving service for visitors, officials said.“The new cable car will vitalize the local economy and offer more diverse travel routes for mountain visitors, especially for those who have difficulties in accessing the mountain such as the elderly or disabled,” said Yangyang County officials. Six props and two stations will be built, which will cost around 46 billion won ($39 million) by 2017, they said. Yangyang residents urge the government to allow the cable car project at a demonstration in central Seoul on Aug. 13. YonhapHundreds of Yangyang residents have also endorsed the project, saying that the development of a new tourism source is necessary for their local businesses. “It will not only stimulate the local economy, but also reduce the damage of original tourist routes, as the cable car will help disperse the number of visitors. It will also improve the ‘touring welfare’ for those who have difficulties accessing the mountain,” Yangyang residents said during their rally calling for the project permit last month. “The national park should be enjoyed not only by certain groups, but by everyone.” Environmentalists, however, strongly opposed the plan, citing potential environmental impacts. “The target area of the cable car is a habitat of various kinds of endangered animals, especially the mountain goats. Once the cable car route is built, the habitat will become more exposed to a large number of visitors, which will naturally damage the home of these precious species,” civic activist Lee Jang-kyo at Green Korea United told The Korea Herald. The mountain goat-like goral species is designated as a grade I endangered species by the government. This is the county’s third application for the cable car.In previous requests in 2012 and 2013, the Environment Ministry rejected both applications, citing concerns over the short distance between the Geutcheong station and mountain’s major peak Daecheongbong, and concerns over the habitat of the mountain goats. Under the qualification criteria, the cable car stations must avoid natural habitats of the animals. The location of the cable car’s destination must also be distant from the mountain’s major peak in order to minimize access of cable car users to preserved areas away from the usual hiking courses. The mountain’s major peak is designated by the government. After the two previous plans were rejected, the Gangwon Provincial Government and Yangyang County Office changed the cable car route, and said the new location is far enough from animal habitat areas.It increased the distance between the proposed mountaintop and Daecheongbong to 1.4 kilometers from 230 meters. The county also vowed to restrict visitors from wandering away from the usual hiking routes around the cable car’s station to prevent damage.Despite such modifications of the plan, civic groups still argue that the proposed route will inevitably harm the habitats for endangered animals. Activists hold a rally against the construction plan of a cable car on Mount Seoraksan in front of the Chuncheon City office in Gangwon Province on Aug. 20. Yonhap“More than 10 endangered species of animals live in the proposed route, including the mountain goat,” Lee of Green Korea United said.Green Korea United has monitored the area with nine unmanned cameras for seven months and discovered a number of baby mountain goats in the proposed route area. They said the finding indicated a high possibility of the area being their actual habitat.The Environment Ministry and Yangyang County also conducted a joint on-site inspection, but came to the opposite conclusion that the concerned region is not the habitat. They also added that the real habitat of the mountain goats is located over the mountain ridge. Yangyang County also disagreed with concerns of civic groups regarding the construction of the cable car damaging the ecosystem.“In the past, constructions of cable cars indeed tended to damage the environment as roads had to be built first to kick off the construction,” Yangyang official Kim Cheol-lae, who is in charge of the project, told The Korea Herald.“This time, however, the construction will have little impact as the props will be fully assembled on the ground and delivered by helicopters to be planted at six spots.”Experts, meanwhile, gave mixed views.“The government must be aware of the characteristics of the endangered animals first. The mountain goat is usually cowardly. Whenever it hears the sound of humans, it runs away and hides over the rocky mountain. Once the cable car is constructed, the sound of the vehicle and visitors will ultimately affect its living,” said forest science professor Youn Yeo-chang at Seoul National University. Choung Heung-lak, the head of Migang Ecology Institute, which conducts various environmental impact evaluations, offered a different opinion.“The mountain goat is only sensitive to the sound of humans, not that of the artificial facilities. Once the cable car route is installed, the visitors’ access around the route area will likely be restricted for safety, therefore, the goats will be less exposed to visitors in the region. This will actually support their living.”Opponents also point to the cultural value of Mount Seoraksan.The 1708-meter-high mountain range, which is the third highest in the country, was designated as a national park in 1970 and a biosphere reserve by UNESCO as it has five sectioned preservation regions. It was also designated as a national monument in 1965.The beautiful scenery attracts 3.4 million visitors every year, with about 700,000 reaching the top. “Considering the mountain’s cultural value, the public must acknowledge that it is an asset that our generation should hand down to future generations. Launching a business project is equivalent to selling a precious asset of the next generation,” Youn added.The governments, for their part, have underscored the economic benefits the cable cars would bring, although their data backing the argument have also been questioned by the civic groups.According to the Korean Environment Institute, the ratio of economic benefits to cost was projected to be 1.214, with a result over 1.00 indicating that it is economically more feasible. The think tank also anticipated that the cable car operation would bring more than 150 billion won and nearly 1,000 new jobs.Rep. Woo Won-shik of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, however, claimed that the report did not sufficiently analyze the environmental factors of the project and that it was as a financial analysis report based on inaccurate data, such as an exaggerated number of expected passengers.Yangyang City admitted to the wrong figures, but claimed that it was just a mistake. It later modified the data. The final decision for the cable car project will be made Friday as the Environment Ministry holds a national park meeting, and the opponents fear that this time, the plan might get the green light.In August last year, President Park Geun-hye vowed to actively support the cable car project of Mount Seoraksan as part of the government’s efforts to boost the local economy. “I hope the cable car is pushed as early as possible, by the time the PyeongChang Winter Olympics are held (in 2018),” Park said. Jang Kyu-seok, one of activists for the anti-cable car group in Yangyang County, said, “Despite the two rejections in the past, the city has hastily carried forward the cable car plan again all of a sudden after the president made a remark last year.”Once allowed, the cable car would begin running in February 2018.

But a glance of the faces of the students is enough to snap the visitor back to reality, as the school consists of 80 percent Koreans. ...","A stroll through the beautiful campus of Chadwick International in Songdo, Incheon, is nearly enough to make a visitor forget this is a Korea-based school: Posters on the wall are in English, teachers are foreign and the animated discussions heard in the hallways are also in English. But a glance of the faces of the students is enough to snap the visitor back to reality, as the school consists of 80 percent Koreans. There has been criticism among education circles that foreign education institutes in South Korea ― originally established for the benefit of expatriates here ― are quickly becoming schools sought by privileged Koreans with a fat wallet and a distaste for domestic education, as their English-based curriculum is left largely unchecked by education authorities.There are currently seven foreign educational institutes in free economic zones across Korea. Five of them are in the Incheon Free Economic Zone. Clause 1 of the law on foreign education institutes states that its primary reason is to “enhance the quality of education for foreigners.” Chadwick InternationalAs the primary target of education is the children of expatriates, the law stipulates that the percentage of domestic students allowed to enroll in a foreign education institute cannot exceed 30 percent, although the education superintendent of the region can grant the extension of the ratio to 50 percent. But according to data revealed by Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the small Justice Party, Korean students accounted for over 70 percent of all students at these schools from 2013 to 2015. This is possible because the law is based on the student quota, and not the actual number of students. For example, George Mason University Korea can accept up to 160 students, but only 69 students attended the school in the 2013-14 school year. The maximum number of Korean students condoned by the law is in proportion to the maximum student quota ― 160 ― instead of the actual number of students ― 69. So while 94.2 percent of the university’s students were Korean, it was still below the maximum student quota allowable by the law. This results in the irony of institutions built for foreigners being mostly filled by locals.Despite most of their students being Koreans, foreign education institutes are not mandated to be inspected by education authorities.  State University of New York, KoreaAn Education Ministry directive stipulate that all state-run universities and colleges are to be regularly inspected by the ministry once every three year, and private universities are subject to nonperiodic inspections. Primary and secondary education institutes are inspected by local education offices. But the directive does not cover foreign education institutes. An official from the ministry who formerly worked on the directive on inspections explained that these schools are autonomously inspected. In this case, the Songdo campuses report their operations and finances to the main campus back home. “In the case of other higher education institutes, we (the Education Ministry) give financial support. But we do not subsidize the foreign schools,” said an official from the international cooperation team that overseas foreign schools in Korea. Earlier this year, the ministry came under flak after Rep. Jeong pointed out that many of the foreign schools, including Chadwick and George Mason, had never been inspected by the ministry. The official said the ministry conducted a regular checkup on the school operation ― such as the student quota and faculty ― but said it was not entitled to inspect certain areas such as finances. The ministry said that these education institutes were too new to be inspected. State University of New York, Korea, the first U.S. university to be established here, opened in 2012. However, there are no clauses specifying the number of years schools have be operational in order to be subject to inspection.Although the ministry has announced it will conduct inspections from this year on, the substance of the inspection remains unchanged. Critics have pointed out that the different standards exclusively applied to foreign schools are viewed as unfair, because mostly Koreans benefit from the system that was designed for foreigners. The international schools’ sky-high tuition have also stoked debate that they aggravate educational disparity among locals.The annual tuition fees of Chadwick International from grade 9th to 12th was 38.9 million won ($32,400) for the 2014-2015 school year. It was more than double the tuition fee for the Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, the priciest high school in the country, which is about 17.5 million won per year. “Would I like to send my son to a school that has less than 20 students per class and all-English classes? Sure. But there is no way I can possibly afford it,” said a 33-year-old woman surnamed Kim.An official from a local civic group on education said the reason so many Koreans flock to foreign schools is because they don’t have to follow the curriculum guidelines from the ministry. “Thus, they can focus on English and other foreign languages as much as they want. And they do it for a hefty price tag. These schools effectively became the institutes for the modern-day ‘royalty,’” he said.The foreign schools, however, strongly deny that they are operating as elitist schools for “rich Koreans.” “Our objectives for our students is completely different from schools that just seek to put as many of their students in top-tier universities as possible. Frankly if grades were their main concern, students would get quicker and cheaper results from going to private institutions than attending our school,” said an official from Chadwick International. She pointed out that the school’s curriculum is based on discussions and on challenging students to form their own opinions, rather than cramming information into their heads.While she said it was “understandable” that foreign schools are criticized for having too many domestic students, she dismissed the accusation that these schools serve as exclusive institutes for the education of rich Koreans.“As schools, we can’t really recruit students. These schools are mostly for the foreigners living in the free economic zone, and the recent economic slump means less foreign investments in the area. Ergo less foreign students, and more Koreans,” she said. “The foreigners-to-Koreans ratio for Chadwick is consistently rising.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","elitist schools for rich koreans ,koreans flock to foreign schools ,rich koreans as schools ,schools for rich koreans our ,schools for rich koreans","['Songdo', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'the Incheon Free Economic Zone', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Justice Party', 'korean', 'George Mason University Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'State University of New York', 'KoreaAn Education Ministry', 'Songdo', 'the Education Ministry', 'Korea', 'Jeong', 'George Mason', 'State University of New York', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Koreans', 'Chadwick International', 'Korean', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Chadwick International', 'Koreans', 'ergo', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Chadwick']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.25462744  0.35641593

The two-day exhibition displayed pictures of palaces and chateaux from across the country. Prague Castle is regarded the most significant monument and cultural institution in the Czech Republic, as it was the seat of Bohemian kings, Holy Roman emperors and Czech presidents before becoming a presidential residence. The largest ancient castle in the world, the edifice was constructed in 870 and renovated by Slovenian architect Joze Plecnik in the 1920s and 30s. Timeworn furniture, artworks and decorations adorn the interior, while grandiose facades and patterned gardens foster a “romantic” ambiance for photography and filming. Photographs from “The Architecture of Prague Castle” exhibition were shown in Seoul City Hall lobby last week. Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“Czech buildings have always been at the forefront of European architecture by embodying different styles ― Medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and contemporary,” said Prelovsek, who extensively studied the work of Plecnik, in an interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday. “Czech families travel around the country on weekends to learn about the histories and architectures of castles.” Czech culture has been open to diverse civilizations and people crisscrossing across Europe, which led to intercultural contacts, explained Prelovsek. Czech architecture was influenced by Western and Eastern Europe before communist times, he added. The Iron Curtain prevented much contact with the outside world for over four decades, but following its fall, the Czech culture and economy have opened up to embrace European and global influences, Prelovsek said. Czech students who studied abroad brought home new ideas and styles, enriching the national treasury. During communist times, socialist housing schemes created monotonous, drab flats, which have undergone reconstruction and reparation to this day. Ideological statues were either destroyed or preserved in museums as tourism artifacts, he said, adding that streets named after revolutionaries were rechristened.Photographer Damjan Prelovsek (right) Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldIn commemoration of the silver jubilee, Prelovsek and Czech Embassy Charge d’Affaires Jana Chaloupkova are preparing to publish a book this year on the architecture, landscape and culture of the two countries, combining photographs and descriptions.Chaloupkova noted that the Czech Republic and the Republic of Korea have made great strides in political, economic and cultural domains over the last 25 years. Korea Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se visited Prague in mid-July last year, and Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka visited Seoul in February, with the two sides forging a strategic partnership. About 175,000 Koreans visited the Czech Republic last year, mainly Prague, dubbed the “Paris of Eastern Europe,” but many destinations remain unexplored, Chaloupkova said. “Visitors can take beautiful photos, particularly for weddings, in front of romantic castles and elegant gardens,” the diplomat recommended. “Festivals, exhibitions, operas and concerts of Europe’s finest quality are available day and night.”Czech Embassy Charge d’Affaires Jana Chaloupkova (third from left) speaks beside members of Korea Image Broadcasting Corporation at a photo exhibition at Seoul City Hall last week. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldIn Prague, three big opera houses ― the National Theatre, Tyl’s Theatre and the State Opera ― host performances within their gold-encrusted interiors. Art education has been well-sponsored across different institutions, such as Charles University ― Central Europe’s first university, founded in 1348, where Korean studies has been offered since 1949. The Czech Ministry of Culture offers grants to artists, many of them young, and supports the translation of Czech literature abroad. Eight direct flights are available each week between Prague and Incheon, operated by Czech Airlines and Korean Air. The CzechTourism Seoul Office opened in 2013, along with the Czech Center Seoul, which promotes Czech culture around the world. The exhibition was a collaboration between Korea Image Broadcasting Corporation, Korea Culture Association and the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

The 2015 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop, held in Korea and Indonesia from Aug. 10-18, provided opportunities for 100 undergraduate and graduate students to engage and learn from each other, as they are expected to lead environment-conscious development in the next generation. With ASEAN and Korea becoming progressively intertwined through diplomacy, commerce and culture, cooperation in green growth and responsible forestry is likely to present new challenges and opportunities on both sides. ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary-General Kim Young-sun (third from left) smiles with students of the 2015 ASEAN-Korea Youth Network Workshop during a tree-planting ceremony in Indonesia. ASEAN-Korea Center“The venue will allow you future leaders to learn about your different cultures, experiences and thinking regarding forests,” said the ASEAN-ROK Forest Cooperation executive director Hadisusanto Pasaribu in a speech at Soopchewon training center in Gangwon Province on Aug. 10.The organization was launched in November 2011 to facilitate cooperation between ASEAN member states and Korea in the rehabilitation of deforested areas, climate adaptation, biodiversity conservation, institutional capacity building and technology transfer.Pasaribu added, “Protecting forests requires actions beyond borders, but the regional and global cooperation should also reflect the realities and needs of local communities.” The workshop was launched in 2012 by the ASEAN-Korea Center to promote two-way exchange of communication and education.Part of the program included a visit to the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta on Aug. 14, where ASEAN Secretariat Secretary-General Le Luong Minh and ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary-General Kim Young-sun spoke on the importance of bilateral cooperation. Students pose at the Borobudur Temple in Yogyakarta in Indonesia. (ASEAN-Korea Center)The ASEAN region has 20 percent of the world’s forest and 40 percent of its biological species, from which many low-income people obtain food, water, medicine and energy for basic living. Although the region is growing rapidly as the world’s seventh-largest economy, with a GDP of $3.6 trillion, its development model is unsustainable, as it relies on exploiting natural resources at great environmental and social cost. Southeast Asia has lately lost more than 1 million hectares of forest annually through mining, illegal logging, farmland clearances and oil palm expansion. ASEAN has looked for new solutions to deliver growth with reduced carbon emissions and poverty and improved energy efficiency. Korea, whose mountains and landscapes were stripped bare during the 20th century, is currently modeled after for ASEAN’s green growth initiatives. Korea’s “Saemaul Undong” rural development model, which had diligence, self-help and cooperation as its main mantras, contributed significantly to the country’s green transformation. As a broad-based social movement, the Saemaul Undong demonstrated the need to incorporate the public in a nationwide program ― an experience ASEAN is keen to replicate back home. ASEAN Secretariat Secretary-General Le Luong Minh, ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary-General Kim Young-sun and students pose at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta on Aug. 14 (ASEAN-Korea Center)According to the ASEAN-ROK Forest Cooperation, strengthening “natural capital” ― which is critical to long-term economic viability ― requires a holistic partnership between government, business and society, employing policies, regulations, investment and civic participation. Pasaribu, in a lecture on Aug. 11 in Korea, noted the historic resolution targeting sustainable forest management adopted at the 11th United Nations Forum on Forests in May, which was attended by 125 member states, including 30 forest ministers and vice ministers.A ministerial declaration from the forum recognized the need to include forest issues in international meetings, such as the Addis Ababa Conference on Financing for Development, the U.N. summit for the post-2015 development agenda and the Paris Climate Change Conference.

Detailed descriptions and images highlighting the Danish capital’s sustainable transformation over the last four decades are showcased at “Copenhagen Solutions,” which runs until Sept. 8. The exhibition provides insights for Seoul’s citizens and government, which is vying to be Asia’s leading city in sustainable initiatives through campaigns promoting alternatives to nuclear power and a greater use of public transportation.  The Danish Embassy’s First Secretary Lea Stubbe Teglbjaerg (center) introduces the exhibition “Copenhagen Solutions” to visitors at the Seoul City Hall lobby last Wednesday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldDenmark and Korea have stepped up collaboration in green growth in recent years, as both countries are leaders in green technology and information technology. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon visited Copenhagen last year to bolster cooperation in public transportation and observe its bicycle infrastructure.As Copenhagen aims to be the world’s first carbon-neutral city by 2025, it has promoted collaboration and open communication between diverse players for transparent and effective city development and management.The combined efforts of municipalities, businesses and society have turned the dilapidated industrial city into a vibrant green city since 2000. Denmark’s master plans target public transportation, mixed area use, social housing, energy-efficient buildings, and big data monitoring, helping to attract business with a long-term and stable investment climate.Like most other cities around the world, Copenhagen’s growth in the latter half of the 20th century entailed severe traffic congestion and air pollution. To relieve the situation, the municipal government invested heavily in uninterrupted cycle lanes and public transportation, which continue to be key aspects of urban governance. According to the State of Green ― a Danish green technology promotional agency ― half of all work and school trips in Copenhagen involve cycling. This has reduced travel time, noise, air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, improving citizens’ health while reducing health care costs. Cycling-related injuries decreased by over 70 percent since 2005, thanks to bicycle-friendly infrastructure and a safe driving culture. Copenhagen’s integrated city governance is based on a holistic partnership between planners, city councilors, architects, engineers, investors, contractors, builders and citizens. Since the early 2000s, the city government transformed the polluted harbor into a clean recreational waterfront by modernizing the sewage system, initiating a cleaning program and constructing harbor baths. Citizens now swim, sail and fish in the Copenhagen Harbor year round. Adjacent property prices increased by nearly 60 percent and flooding risks have decreased. As a prime example of waterfront renovation, the Nordhavnen industrial harbor, comprised of islets and canals on Copenhagen’s eastern shore, is being turned into a dense city district accommodating 40,000 residents and 40,000 work spaces. A “smart city” prototype, it will use CO2-neutral energy solutions, smart grids, district heating and cooling, and public transit systems integrating bike paths, pedestrian walkways and subways. All buildings in Copenhagen were required to join the district heating scheme as part of an integrated municipal energy control system since 1993. District heating is one of the most carbon-efficient ways to produce and supply energy locally, and lowers CO2 emissions by 40 percent compared to gas and 50 percent compared to oil boilers. To combat the rising inner-city temperature from global warming, Copenhagen built two district cooling networks, which produce and distribute cooled water to buildings through underground pipelines. It reduces dependence on air-conditioning, saving 14,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. It has also turned rooftops where air-conditioners were once stored into green gardens, helping cool the city temperature. To reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Copenhagen has prioritized biomass technologies that generate energy by incinerating waste products. 60,000 tons of CO2 emissions are expected to be saved by the technology. Copenhagen has partnered with the Swedish city of Malmo across the sea for regional solutions in sustainable living and commerce. The two cities are working to strengthen collaboration in innovative research, clean technology, life sciences and ICT solutions.Copenhagen has also recently partnered Hamburg in the creative industries, climate adaptation, renewable energy, tourism, culture, and research and development.

They engaged in animated conversation, merrily chatting away about their week, vacation plans and dating advice as Seoulites went on with their regular weekend routine. This merry scene was just two days after North Korea had fired artillery shells at the inter-Korea border, and one day after Pyongyang’s leader Kim Jong-un declared a “quasi-state of war” and put his troops on war footing.In spite of threats of war from the hermit kingdom, South Koreans generally appeared comfortable, almost indifferent about the tension going on at the front lines. Amid frequent muscle flexing from their neighbors to the north, South Koreans say they have learned to live their lives adjacent to the openly hostile country, with whom Seoul is still technically at war. “No, there isn’t anyone around me who is really worried about a possible war. I guess it’s like people living in earthquake-prone areas. It’s not that you don’t care, but you stop making a fuss about it,” said Kim Min-ho, a 30-year-old office worker living in Seoul.Sales numbers revealed by local retailers showed no signs of panic buying, either. According to retailing giant E-Mart, sales of emergency supplies -- such as instant noodles, water, canned food and portable gas stoves -- from Thursday to Saturday decreased compared to the same period in the week before. “It’s not like we can be warned (of the war), so I don’t think we can really prepare for it. Personally, I think it’s just a political show of the two Koreas,” said Kim Min-gyeong, a 38-year-old mother of two. A child uses his mobile phone outside an underground evacuation shelter guarded by police in Yeoncheon, Gyeong Province, Sunday. (Yonhap)There was a time when tough rhetoric from Pyongyang induced nationwide panic. In 1994, the inter-Korean tensions rode high amid suspicion that North Korea was seeking nuclear armament. Media reported that major retailers were jam-packed with customers, which was repeated later in the year when then-North Korean leader Kim Il-sung died. “It was different when Kim Il-sung died. I was in another country at the time, and even though I was young, I seriously contemplated if I should return home if the war broke out,” said 36-year-old office worker Ha Eun-jae.But decades of tough words ending up as rhetoric led Ha and other Koreans to worry less.“Now, it’s nothing new. We just think ‘they are at it again.’ I guess in the back of my mind, war is not really considered an option,” she said.In addition, South Korean’s feeling toward the North has considerably softened since former President Kim Dae-jung initiated the “sunshine policy” -- based on increased inter-Korean interaction and economic assistance for the North -- in the late 1990s.A recent survey by Albamon, a local online part-time job recruitment site, showed that 48.5 percent of the college students thought that Japan was South Korea‘s greatest threat over North Korea at 38.3 percent. “Whenever we hear North Koreans saying they will destroy us, we assume they want us to give them something. They did it so many times before,” said a 24-year-old student surnamed Yoo. Nonetheless, a deeply rooted fear of war -- no matter how slim the possibility -– remain in the hearts of many South Koreans. In a popular online thread titled “What South Koreans can do in a war against the North” on the online portal Daum, an anonymous man said he had no faith in the military’s capacity to protect its people in a war, which was echoed by several men who had completed their mandatary military service. Some South Koreans say their seemingly calm demeanor stems from the fact that reoccurring threats have virtually become part of their normal lives.“It’s not that I don’t care about security, but this (South Korea) is the foundation of our lives, so all we can do in these situations is to just hang on,” said Lee Ho-jeong, a 40-year-old housewife. “No country is 100 percent safe, anyway. We’re not going to flee our country just because of a war that ‘might happen’.”Thirty five-year-old mom Yoon Yeo-jeong said she has learned to cope with fear, as there is little choice otherwise. “It’s not like worrying about it will do any good. Living with such tension is something I have to accept as a South Korean.”“But I do feel bad for bringing my son into such a complicated country. I certainly hope that there will be peace (between the Koreas) by the time he turns 20, so he won’t have to do the (mandatory) military service,” she said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","seoul on saturday was packed ,dating advice as seoulites went ,south koreans in popular online ,of sinchon seoul on saturday ,portable gas stoves from thursday","['Sinchon', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Kim Min - ho', 'Seoul', 'e - Mart', 'Koreas', 'Kim Min - gyeong', 'Yeoncheon', 'Gyeong Province', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Kim Il - sung', 'Ha Eun - jae', 'Koreans', 'South Korean ’s', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'inter - korean', 'Albamon', 'Japan', 'South Korea‘s', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'Yoo', 'South Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'South Koreans', 'South Korea', 'Lee Ho - jeong', 'happen’', 'Yoon Yeo - jeong', 'south korean', 'Koreas', 'Yoon Min - sik']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.95766449  0.74157482

The DMZ Peace Train ends at Dorasan, South Korea’s northernmost rail station just 17 kilometers from the North Korean city of Gaeseong. Aboard were some 150 passengers who recently completed a 20-day, 14,400-kilometer journey on the “Eurasia Express” linking Asia and Europe. The journey last month started from Vladivostok and Beijing and ended in Berlin, Germany, capped off with celebratory events longing for peace and prosperity throughout the Eurasia continent. The Eurasia Express runs on the track near Novosibirsk, Russia, July 22. YonhapDesigned primarily to celebrate the feat, the special 80-minute DMZ trip Monday epitomized the blankness that kept reoccurring throughout the Eurasia itinerary in which North Korea remained absent, increasing the awareness of the need for unification of the two Koreas. With Pyongyang abstaining, the participants had to fly to Russia and China to board trains there. “Being not of the Korean War generation and with no family members living in the North, I had never really felt in earnest why we had to be reunited, but the Eurasia Express offered me a chance to change my understanding about North Korea and the unification,” Lee Soo-hyun, a makeup artist who took part in the project, said at the ceremony at Dorasan Station in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. The train program came as South Korea sets its sights on the Eurasian continent as it seeks to broaden its diplomatic and economic horizons and facilitate its future unification with the North through international collaboration. It was a centerpiece of President Park Geun-hye’s “Eurasia Initiative,” a package of projects, such as to connect railways, roads and ports to Europe via North Korea, China, Russia and Central Asia, as well as an integrated Eurasia power grid and a logistics hub. For Seoul, the continent is a treasure trove of opportunities for energy supplies, economic growth and cultural exchange. The Park administration sees the ambitious scheme as being able to cater to not only its own proposed vision to boost peace and trust in Northeast Asia, but also Beijing’s so-called One Belt One Road plan that envisions “land and maritime silk roads” all the way to Europe and even Africa, and Moscow’s drive to reinforce relations with Asia Pacific nations chiefly to revamp the underdeveloped Far East. Yet the initiative will have to tackle daunting hurdles in order to take off. With protracted cross-border gridlock, North Korea remains aloof toward the rail and other industrial partnerships, while tension persists across the continent amid Russia’s standoff with the West over the Ukraine crisis. The outlook for what Seoul envisions as “one Eurasia” is darkening further in the wake of Pyongyang’s land mine attack and artillery exchanges that have pushed up cross-border tension to a new high.

But it also entails daunting geopolitical challenges the divided country has long confronted. Participants of the Seoul-led Eurasia Express journey wave for a photo at Perm Station in Russia on July 25 during their 14,400-kilometer trip from Beijing and Vladivostok to Berlin. (Yonhap)Despite a series of constant obstacles to its diplomacy including a nuclearizing North Korea, the South has consistently pushed to expand its foreign policy coverage toward the continent that has emerged as the fulcrum of global power and wealth.In recent years, the Park Geun-hye government has been revving up its “Eurasia Initiative” to link transport and energy infrastructure across the Eurasian plate, though geopolitics still gets in the way of its implementation.Analysts say Seoul should continue to explore diplomatic and economic possibilities based on its middle-power clout, and take advantage of enhanced ties with Eurasian states to find solutions to North Korea issues.“Perched on the easternmost tip of Eurasia, South Korea largely has two options for its diplomacy: One is moving toward the western Pacific and the other toward the constellation of continental players in Eurasia -- Russia, Central Asia and Europe,” said Kim Tae-hyung, international relations professor at Soongsil University.“Eurasia has historically offered both opportunities and challenges. Despite geopolitical hindrances, there has been no other choice for Seoul but to constantly explore possibilities there to advance its economic interests and help address peninsular issues such as reunification.”Uncontrollable outside influences have long constrained Korea’s independent diplomacy toward the continent, making it difficult for the peninsular state to develop its full geopolitical potential as a bridge between maritime and continental civilizations, historians say.Korea’s strategic thinking toward Eurasia was impeded often by the regional power dynamics, notably when China held a suzerain-tributary relationship with Korea under a Sino-centric order that existed until the mid-19th century, and Japan occupied the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45.The Cold War -- when Korea stood as a stalwart ally of the U.S. in an intense political, military and ideological conflict against the then communist bloc led by the Soviet Union -- also crippled Korea’s Eurasia-bound diplomacy.“Given its location on the map, Korea possesses the geopolitical advantages as a ‘peninsular, bridge and border state.’ But those advantages have turned into geopolitical ordeals throughout the country’s checkered history,” said Park Myung-lim, a peace scholar at Yonsei University. “In order to overcome these challenges, South Korea needs a comprehensive strategy toward Eurasia that also includes addressing North Korea’s nuclear issue, as a crucial task to spur the South’s Eurasia drive.”In the late 1980s toward the end of the Cold War, new opportunities emerged for Korea to step up its diplomacy for Eurasian states.Riding the international reconciliatory mood and the socialist bloc’s moves toward openness and reform, the Roh Tae-woo government pushed for “Nordpolitik,” or Northern Policy -- a bold initiative regarded as one of South Korea’s most successful foreign policy approaches. Taking its name from the West Germany policy of Ostpolitik, or Eastern Policy, toward then-East Germany, Seoul’s policy drive sought to establish diplomatic relations with the traditional allies of North Korea -- the former Soviet Union and China -- and other socialist states, with an aim to improve its economy and pressure the North to take steps to reduce cross-border tensions.Under the initiative, South Korea built ties with Hungary and Poland in 1989. In 1990, it established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, then Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Seoul also established ties with Moscow that year and with China two years later. “When Nordpolitik was adopted, diplomatic situations were very favorable, and the Roh government grabbed the chance to clear the obstacles that had clogged up Korea’s diplomacy toward the wider Eurasian continent,” said Chun In-young, professor emeritus at Seoul National University.Amid the international criticism of China’s bloody crackdowns on the massive democracy protests at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, the Chinese government took Seoul’s diplomatic overture as a chance to ease its isolation. The then-Soviet Union also welcomed Seoul’s northward policy as an opportunity to facilitate its policy of openness and reform.Based on the diplomatic foundation that Nordpolitik laid, South Korea continued to pursue deeper ties with China, Russia and other former communist states, although its security alliance with the U.S. against North Korean aggression has posed challenges to managing ties with America’s former foes. As the regional powers have vied to expand their influence over Eurasia that accounts for more than 70 percent of the world’s population and 60 percent of the global GDP, Seoul renewed its policy attention to the continent in recent years.In October 2013, some eight months into office, President Park Geun-hye unveiled her Eurasia Initiative through which she has strived to bolster economic cooperation with Eurasian states by establishing a pan-Eurasia system of transport and energy networks that link Korea to those states.Seoul has promoted the initiative to revitalize the regional economy, create jobs, push Pyongyang toward openness and reform, defuse cross-border tensions and lay the groundwork for national reunification. As part of the initiative, Seoul launched the “Eurasia Express” last month. The project is a 20-day, 14,400-kilometer railway trip reaching Germany’s Berlin via China’s Beijing and Russia’s Vladivostok. Garnering much global attention, the project raised hopes that Pyongyang would participate as an integral part of the initiative to help promote peace and cooperation in the region.The so-called Rajin-Khasan logistic cooperation project involving North Korea is also part of the initiative. The project seeks to modernize the 54-kilometer-long Rajin-Hasan railway, which is to be used to transport freight from Hasan in Russia to Rajin in the North by railway, and then to a South Korean port by ship.To test the feasibility of the project, some 45,000 tons of coal from Russia was transported to Pohang, South Korea’s southeastern port city, via Rajin last November, and another 140,000 tons to three South Korean ports in Dangjin, Gwangyang and Boryeong in April this year.With much publicity, the Eurasia Initiative appears to have fared well. But a series of geopolitical variables darken the prospect of its success: North Korea under the fledgling leadership of Kim Jong-un continues to raise security uncertainties on the peninsula and Russia’s ongoing conflict with the West to aggravate geopolitical tensions.“The strategic vision embedded in the initiative is forward-looking and necessary for Korea’s future. Yet, current overall geopolitical conditions are not favorable for Seoul to actively push for it,” said Chun of Seoul National University. “Security conditions are still bad due to North Korea’s adherence to its nuclear ambitions, while Russia’s Putin engages in a conflict with the West and seeks to evolve strategic ties with China, which the U.S. strives to keep in check.”Above all, the trickiest variable for the successful implementation of the Eurasia drive is North Korea, experts said, stressing the need for the South to devise a more effective, creative way to lift the North out of the political, economic backwater.“Even though there will be a flurry of economic, cultural and people-to-people exchanges across the continent, the issues of peace and security, which obviously trump other issues, have remained unsettled with the North posing constant security challenges,” said Park of Yonsei University.“In light of this, South Korea needs to focus more on the North Korea issue as a key point of its Eurasia initiative. It also needs a more comprehensive Eurasian strategy, which includes stably managing relations with both the U.S. and China, to maximize its potential as a peninsular state.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","massive democracy protests at tiananmen ,korea nuclear issue as crucial ,jobs push pyongyang toward openness ,south korea needs comprehensive strategy ,russia vladivostok garnering much global","['South Korea', 'Eurasia', 'Seoul', 'Eurasia Express', 'Russia', 'Beijing', 'Vladivostok', 'Berlin', 'North Korea', 'eurasian', 'Seoul', 'eurasian', 'North Korea', 'Eurasia', 'South Korea', 'Eurasia', 'Russia', 'Kim Tae - hyung', 'Soongsil University', '“eurasia', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Eurasia', 'China', 'Korea', 'sino', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'the Soviet Union', 'Korea', 'Eurasia', 'Korea', 'Park Myung - lim', 'Yonsei University', 'South Korea', 'Eurasia', 'North Korea ’s', 'Eurasia', 'Korea', 'eurasian', 'Roh Tae - woo', 'South Korea ’s', 'West Germany', 'Eastern Policy', 'East Germany', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Soviet Union', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Hungary', 'Poland', 'Yugoslavia', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Bulgaria', 'Romania', 'Seoul', 'Moscow', 'China', 'Nordpolitik', 'Roh', 'Korea', 'eurasian', 'Chun In - young', 'Seoul National University', 'China', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Nordpolitik', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'America', 'Eurasia', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'eurasian', 'pan - eurasia', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Eurasia Express', 'Germany', 'Berlin', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'Rajin', 'North Korea', 'Rajin', 'Hasan', 'Russia', 'Rajin', 'south korean', 'Russia', 'Pohang', 'South Korea ’s', 'Rajin', 'south korean', 'Dangjin', 'Gwangyang', 'Boryeong', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Russia', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Chun', 'Seoul National University', 'North Korea ’s', 'Russia', 'Putin', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Eurasia', 'North Korea', 'Yonsei University', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Eurasia', 'eurasian', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",15,"[ 6.          1.          0.         ... -0.65951383  0.50273705

Since coming to Korea in 2014, I found out that Denmark, in the minds of Koreans, was known for author Hans Christian Andersen, Lego and happy people, not to mention the bicycles, wind energy and clean environment. Denmark’s green profile is strongly grounded in fact. Denmark became the world’s first nation to establish a ministry committed to environmental protection in 1971, spearheading the world’s sustainable development agenda. In early July, Denmark generated 140 percent of its electricity demand with wind power and exported the surplus to Norway, Germany and Sweden. With sustainability taking up the mainstay of our national policies, we have learned that environmental protection does not have to come at an economic price.In fact, Denmark’s green initiatives ― centered on environmental protection, scientific innovation and long-term public commitment ― drove our economy’s strong and steady growth for the past 40 years. Far from stifling business, Danish companies have gained competitive advantages on the global stage with their innovative products and services, as environment gradually came to the fore of global paradigm. Danish companies Vestas, Grundfos and Maersk came to dominate the wind energy, pump manufacturing, and container shipping sectors, respectively.  Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann (Danish embassy)Copenhagen aspires to be the world’s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025, being the microcosm of pristine living endowed with practical benefits. By openly communicating with citizens, collaborating with knowledge institutions and implementing sustainable urban policies over the last 20 years, Copenhagen was crowned the world’s most livable city in the Quality of Life Survey by global affairs magazine Monocle in 2008, 2013 and 2014.The exhibition “Copenhagen Solutions,” running from Aug. 19-Sept. 8 in the Seoul City Hall lobby, will illustrate the city’s down-to-earth transformation from a polluted, dilapidated industrial city to a smart and vibrant green city. The exhibition will display Copenhagen Harbor’s redevelopment experience, which has enabled Copenhageners to swim, fish and ride boats in the heart of the city since 2002. In the early 2000s, swimming in the harbor was unthinkable due to severe pollution from the sewage. To address this problem, the city modernized the sewage system, initiated a cleaning program and created harbor-front recreational areas. The transformation also enhanced the city’s livability, boosting local businesses and real estate values while reducing the risk of flooding. Simply put, the harbor’s transformation offered economic, environmental and social benefits in one package.  Copenhageners swim, bathe, fish and sail in the city harbor all year round, thanks to the modernization of sewage and redevelopment of harbour-front by the municipality. (State of Green)But how does all of this relate to Korea? Korea has proven to be a fast-mover time and time again in diverse areas. Korea became one of the world’s major economies, with many of its multinational corporations dominating the global market today. It also achieved technological breakthroughs in a matter of a few decades since the Korean War. The importance that Denmark and Korea attach to green growth and the global paradigm shift toward sustainable development make us essential partners. This is precisely why the Green Growth Alliance was established in 2011 to combine Denmark’s expertise in sustainable development and Korea’s technological capacities. GGA meetings have taken place annually at top governmental levels, and this year’s meeting will take place in Copenhagen. Our partnership was bolstered by the establishment of the Strategic Partnership and the Green Growth Alliance in 2014. Both our national leaders President Park Geun-hye and former Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt realized that energy-efficient policies were imperative to sustaining economic growth and dealing with climate change. The combination of Korean technologies and Danish design expertise will be showcased at the “Smart Solutions for Innovative Cities” conference organized by the Innovation Centre Denmark in Copenhagen in September, eliciting the participation of high-ranking Korean officials. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon visited Copenhagen in 2014 to sign a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in tourism, urban living and green solutions. As Mayor Park expressed his wish to turn Seoul into a bicycle-friendly city several years ago, he rode a bike around Copenhagen and discussed with his Danish counterpart on cooperative strategies for bicycle infrastructure and policies.  Copenhagen's harbour-front (Danish Embassy)Copenhagen has created numerous bicycle lanes, parking spaces and highways that allow people to conveniently travel across the city. More than half of the city’s inhabitants, including corporate executives and high-level politicians, prefer to ride bicycles as a main form of transport. This culture of loving bicycles is why Copenhagen was chosen as the European Green Capital in 2014 by the European Commission.The Copenhagen Solutions exhibition will feature the city’s bicycle lanes as well as centralized district heating and cooling systems with high energy efficiency. It will also show big data technologies that optimize traffic flows and carbon dioxide emission. The public-private partnership that promotes long-term solutions and meets diverse interests will also be showcased. Climate change, water shortage, and desertification will increasingly plague the world’s ecosystem in the future. The environmental degradation has far-reaching consequences that are unbounded by national borders. It is crucial for us to make the right choices now for our shared sustainable future. Sustainability is not a luxury. It is an unavoidable responsibility for our future growth.","korean officials seoul mayor park ,denmark became the world first ,global paradigm danish companies vestas ,ranking korean officials seoul mayor ,2014 the exhibition copenhagen solutions","['Thomas Lehmann', 'Danish', 'danish', 'Korea', 'Denmark', 'Koreans', 'Hans Christian Andersen', 'Lego', 'Denmark', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Germany', 'Sweden', 'danish', 'danish', 'Vestas', 'Grundfos and Maersk', 'Danish', 'Thomas Lehmann', 'Danish', 'Copenhagen', 'the Quality of Life Survey', 'Monocle', 'Copenhageners', 'copenhagener', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Denmark', 'Korea', 'the Green Growth Alliance', 'Denmark', 'Korea', 'GGA', 'the Strategic Partnership', 'the Green Growth Alliance', 'Park Geun', 'Helle Thorning - Schmidt', 'korean', 'danish', 'the Innovation Centre Denmark', 'Copenhagen', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Copenhagen', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Copenhagen', 'danish', 'Copenhagen', 'Danish', 'Copenhagen', 'the European Green Capital', 'the European Commission']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60188758  0.50077832

Ha, the head of nonprofit group Think Cafe, began to engage in civic movement in the early 1980s. He said that he witnessed a new breed of social activism that was open, participatory and peer-driven during the 2008 candlelight vigils. “In 2008, citizens voluntarily took to the streets to voice concerns over their own problems and tackle them,” the 54-year-old activist told The Korea Herald. “The candlelight rallies made me realize that the traditional methods of social movements driven by civic groups were fundamentally changing.”  Activists protest Korea's agreement to import U.S. beef in Seoul in 2008.(Korea Herald)In South Korea, civil society, meaning the nonprofit sector between the state, the market and households, has been a driving force for democracy, serving as an opposition force to strong state powers. But the nonprofit sector, also known as the third sector, is now at a crossroads, confronting challenges to position itself amid the diminishing support from citizens and advanced technology that substitutes civic groups’ role in mobilizing people. While experts remain divided over when Korea’s civil society emerged, it is thought that the mass mobilization of the public dates back to the Japanese colonial rule in the first half of the 1900s.In a fight for independence, street demonstrations took place at times across the nation, despite fierce crackdowns by the Japanese. In August 1945, Koreans eventually gained independence from Japan, but had to continue their fight for democracy under military regimes that dominated the nation through oppression.  Despite their efforts to seek legitimacy on the back of the public’s anti-communist sentiment and rapid economic development, the oppressive rulers – Syngman Rhee (1948-60), Park Chung-hee (1963-1979) and Chun Doo-hwan (1980-1987) – faced a series of pro-democracy protests including the April Revolution in 1960 and the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. As Korea’s rapid economic growth led to an increase in educated students and the middle class, Korean students spearheaded a nationwide movement for democracy in 1987, challenging the decades-long military rule and demanding constitutional change to guarantee a democratic election.  The uprising ended in success, achieving what scholars here view as “procedural democracy,” as the military ruler Chun stepped down and agreed to adopt a direct presidential election system. The social activist Ha, who is also the author of the recently-published book “My story of Civil Movement,” was one of the students protesting on the streets along with millions of others. “The June Uprising was an important experience for Koreans to expand democracy and realize that a collective movement can bring about a positive change in society,” said Ha, pointing out that the historic event paved the way for Korea’s civil society to flourish. Since the 1987 democratization, Korea saw its number of nonprofit groups increase from 3,898 in 1996 to 15,180 in 2002, according to data from the Information Center for Civic Movements. With no official statistics available, experts estimate that the total number would top 30,000 or more in 2015. While the civil movement continued to focus on promoting democracy by demanding political and social reforms in the 1990s, civic groups started to expand their interests into various issues ranging from the environment and human rights to gender equality. Protests and candlelight vigils remained a common form of Korean civic movement, with the number of mass gatherings hovering around 10,000 in the 2000s. The number hit a record high in 2008 due in part to the anti-U.S. beef imports campaign, with nearly 14,000 protests held across the nation, according to the National Police Agency. The heyday for civic groups came in the 2000 general election, when an alliance of some 900 nongovernmental groups released a blacklist of some 100 politicians who they saw as unqualified to serve in the National Assembly, urging voters to reject them. Some of the listed candidates had criminal records, while others were involved in corruption.The campaign heavily influenced the general election, with political parties disqualifying candidates named on the list. Nearly 70 percent of listed candidates who ran in the election failed to secure a seat. “Since then, Korea’s established civic groups earned the trust of ordinary citizens and took the lead in candlelight rallies throughout the 2000s,” Park Young-sun, a sociology professor at Kyung Hee University, told The Korea Herald. Korean society saw some signature demonstrations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including the minority shareholders movement to protect rights infringed by corporate interests in the aftermath of the 1997 financial crisis, the Misun-Hyosun vigil in 2002 for two teenage girls killed by a U.S. military vehicle and the anti-impeachment vigil in 2004 to stop President Roh Moo-hyun from being impeached by the opposition bloc. But nonprofit groups have gradually lost ground in Korea in recent years. Kim So-ra, a 26-year-old university student who has closely worked with nongovernmental organizations in development sector, says she doubts civic groups’ accountability. “It seems like there are few nonprofit organizations that are financially independent,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “When they rely on other sources like the government and political groups for funding, how can they be solely representing citizens?”Joo Sung-soo, a professor who teaches civil society studies at Hanyang University, said that low membership of nonprofit groups among the general population had become the biggest concern.“The low membership of civic groups means that they suffer from a shortage of funding,” Joo told The Korea Herald. “The lack of money limits their roles to criticizing the government and its policies rather than engaging at grassroots in local communities.”According to government statistics, only 1 in 10 Koreans aged 13 or older has joined a nonprofit organization as of 2013, illustrating eroding representation of ordinary Koreans in civic groups. And the ideological polarization in civil society contributes to the public’s growing indifference to civil movement led by non-profit groups. “Unfortunately, ideological radicalism is sapping the civic movement’s popularity,” he said, adding that the political division had escalated when the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration taking office. Joo said that the divided country was destined to have clashes over political ideology as South Korea remains at war with North Korea. “But since 2008, the feud intensified over how to view North Korea and the United States, especially with President Lee unconditionally allowing right-wing civic groups into civil society,” he claimed.  Activists protest Korea's agreement to import U.S. beef in Seoul in 2008.(Korea Herald)With nonprofit groups losing their influence and becoming institutionalized, they have grown apart from citizens, which might have propelled Koreans to pour onto the streets in the 2008 candlelight vigil, the sociology professor Park said. Korea had suspended beef imports from the U.S. after the country reported in 2003 the first case of mad cow disease that scientists said could infect humans with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.When the Korean government struck a deal to import U.S. beef that critics said were not assured of safety in 2008, a high school girl went onto an Internet forum to express her worries. Her posting immediately went viral, inducing thousands of Koreans to hold candlelight vigils across the nation. “It is a much-needed progress that citizens voluntarily mobilized themselves to voice their opinions thanks to Internet,” she said. “But the candlelight vigil could also mean a limitation on Korean civil society as it did not help improve the link between citizens and the policy-making process.”Lee Chung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, pointed to Korea’s “weak” political party system failing to fully represent citizens’ interests as being behind the problem in such mobilizations. “Individual protests result from the nation’s lack of established mediating institutions such as political parties and civic groups that can reflect citizens’ demands in the policy-making process,” Lee told The Korea Herald. But such movement without organizing power is quick to gain momentum and then lose steam, making it hard to have their voices heard in the political realm. “If the trend continues, it could further undermine the nation’s already-faltering representative democracy,” Lee said. Hopefully, it will sound an alarm to the established political parties and civic groups so that they could reform themselves and increase citizens’ representation in the political system, he added. While the longing for democracy and the powerful experience of toppling the authoritarian regime shaped the country’s civil society until the early 2000s, the rise of the Internet and a tech-savvy generation might require a change in how civic movements are run. Ha, who considers himself as a first-generation social activist, said that modern-day citizens become aware of social issues online and closely respond to problems affecting their own lives, reducing the room for civic groups to mobilize them in a conventional way. “Society changed, and so should civic groups,” Ha said, adding that first-generation non-profit organizations at the forefront of civil society should listen more carefully to citizens at the grassroots level.“To create a lasting social impact, we should adapt to a new environment in which technology enables face-to-face interactions,” he said. “Because that is the way to expand democracy.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","changing activists protest korea ,2008 candlelight vigil the sociology ,candlelight vigil against beef import ,beef in seoul in 2008 ,gender equality protests and candlelight","['South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'the United States', 'Ha Seung - chang', 'korean', 'Think Cafe', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Herald)In South Korea', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Japanese', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Korea ’s', 'korean', 'Chun', 'Civil Movement', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Information Center', 'korean', 'u.s.', 'the National Police Agency', 'the National Assembly', 'Korea', 'Kyung Hee University', 'the Korea Herald', 'korean', 'Misun - Hyosun', 'U.S.', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Korea', 'Kim So - ra', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Sung', 'Hanyang University', 'Joo', 'the Korea Herald', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Joo', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'Park', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Creutzfeldt - Jakob', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",6,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.10011152 0.2291809  0.10331721]

Starting next month, Seoul Metropolitan Government will run a pilot project that offers psychological treatment through the bonding between humans and pets. The program takes a cue from a U.S.-based service that provides a chance for positive interactions with animals for the sake of people’s health and well-being.The program will offer bonding opportunity to applicants with pets as they feed, groom, take a stroll and play games together, city officials said.The pet-assisted therapy will first be offered to those living in public shelters and in need of psychological treatment. Each person will be paired up with a pet and its owner that have acquired due qualifications.“This is part of an attempt to better support psychological stability for those in need and to improve the public perception toward the pets, through using the positive effects of the bonding between humans and pets,” city officials said. The city will recruit 100 volunteers and provide 80 hours of classes in animal assisted-therapy and hands-on courses. They will be qualified to participate in the program only if they complete the courses and pass the evaluation. The evaluation will be based on the criteria mapped out by the U.S. civic organization Delta Pet Partners, the city said. It will include tests on sociability and aggression of the pets. The pilot project will consist of 10 classes, each running for an hour. After carrying out the project by April next year, the city will determine whether to expand the program and include abandoned dogs, officials said.(rene@heraldcorp.com)","the pet assisted therapy will ,sunday starting next month seoul ,pets the pilot project will ,mental illnesses sources said sunday ,said the pet assisted therapy","['Lee Hyun - jeong', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'U.S.', 'Delta Pet Partners']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5422712   0.32267737

""It seems to be appropriate to conduct pest control for such trees in spring and autumn.

It will be the production’s final tour after 20 years of performances around the globe. The show was produced by Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil and premiered in Montreal in 1996. It has since captivated nearly 14 million fans in five continents through 6,200 performances. Canadian Ambassador Eric Walsh (third from right) poses with artists of show “Quidam” at a press conference in Seoul on Thursday. In the picture are Cirque du Soleil press attache Jessica Leboeuf (left) and Mast Entertainment CEO Kim Yong-gwan (fourth from left). Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldAs a pinnacle of multisensory theatrical experience, the show displays an extravaganza of choreography, music, storytelling, costume, makeup, stage technology and lighting. It started as a big top show and was converted into an arena format in 2010. The display in Seoul will be in a big top, which is much larger than in an arena, and retains the feel of a live circus. “I may be a Canadian ambassador, but I am here first and foremost as a big fan of Cirque du Soleil,” Canadian Ambassador Eric Walsh told journalists at a press conference in Seoul on Thursday. “I saw the first show in 2004, and since then have tried to see at least one every year. The costumes, music and acrobatics make the whole show an absolute thrill, every time.”Artists and organizers of show ""Quidam."" Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldThe Cirque du Soleil, based in Montreal, started with a group of 73 street performers. They went on a first tour around the Canadian province of Quebec in 1984, and have not stopped since, reaching a worldwide audience of 155 million, with 15 million coming to their shows last year alone. Some 1,300 artists and 5,000 people from 50 different countries work for the company, with 1,500 employees at the Montreal headquarters. “‘Quidam’ has a very special status among all other Cirque du Soleil productions. It is a show with a soul. Every performer breathes life into it, which is why it has been so successful over the years,” Mast Entertainment marketing and communications director Jean Heon told The Korea Herald. “The story depicts growing human isolation in our society. We are all quidams, which loosely translates from Latin into anonymous passersby, strangers in the crowd or the silent majority. The show has a special message urging us to care of each other, and establish our lost communications in families and communities.”(Mast Entertainment)Cirque du Soleil press attache Jessica Leboeuf said: “Many people have remarked that our show had a Tim Burton-ish feel to it, being surreal, lurid and shadowy, but the story is a bit like ‘Alice in Wonderland’ ― the Cirque du Soleil version of it. We really try to explore the world through human emotions, and allow the audience to ride character Zoe’s emotional rollercoaster.”The storyline revolves around Zoe, a young school girl who loses communication with her distant and apathetic parents. Feeling that she lost all life’s meaning while seeking to fill the emotional void, Zoe slides into the whimsical, imaginary world of Quidam, where she meets characters that encourage her to free her soul. (Mast Entertainment)“When the writer and director Franco Dragone first came up with the storyline in 1994, we were skeptical whether the show could make big,” Leboeuf said. “But into the late 1990s and onward, with the growing consumerism and people’s isolation, the storyline became closer to reality and found a hungry audience.”Leboeuf attributed part of the show’s success to artistic guide Guy Laliberte, who attracted the best talents in different expertise around the world. “Quidam” employs 45 performers and 45 support staff from 23 different countries, and the troupe feels like a “small United Nations,” she explained. Also as Canadians, the staff are used to diverse multicultural settings with people from different nationalities and upbringings, Leboeuf added. (Mast Entertainment)“The performers literally interact with the crowd during the show. We handpick people from the audience and do a spontaneous clown cinema act,” she highlighted. “Audience feedback really influences the performers, because they really crave it and thrive on it to modify their act. In every country or city, the response is different. The artists will gauge the crowds in the first week and readjust for a live, animated performance.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","passionate korean theatergoers quidam circus ,world famous canadian stage show ,korean theatergoers quidam circus spectacle ,200 performances canadian ambassador ,famous canadian stage show will","['canadian', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Quidam', 'canadian', 'Cirque du Soleil', 'Montreal', 'canadian', 'Eric Walsh', 'Quidam', 'Seoul', 'Jessica Leboeuf', 'Mast Entertainment', 'Kim Yong - gwan', 'Joel Lee', 'Seoul', 'canadian', 'canadian', 'Eric Walsh', 'Seoul', 'Quidam', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea', 'Montreal', 'canadian', 'Quebec', 'Montreal', ""Quidam '"", 'Mast Entertainment', 'Jean Heon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Latin', 'Jessica Leboeuf', 'Tim Burton - ish', 'Wonderland', 'Zoe', 'Zoe', 'Quidam', 'Franco Dragone', 'Leboeuf', 'Guy Laliberte', 'Quidam', 'United Nations', 'Canadians', 'Leboeuf', 'Joel Lee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48170748  0.67571497

According to the Supreme Court, the authorities agreed to establish an “international justice department” under the Patent Court as early as February next year. Under the new system, testimonies and pleas can be made in English, while documents and written evidence in English will be considered valid. The verdicts will also be available in both Korean and English after the ruling, they said. Currently, foreign-language documents are required to be submitted in Korean after translation and all legal processes are conducted only in Korean. This is part of the top court’s project to improve its functioning as the legal system for intellectual property rights. Once introduced, Korea will be the first East Asian country to adopt an English-speaking patient lawsuit system.As South Korea is a member of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, most international patents take effect in the country. Therefore, foreign companies can file lawsuits here regardless of having or not having local branches in Korea. The new move will likely lead to more patent lawsuits here, experts said. “Many patent cases have been filed abroad, especially in Europe and the U.S. Sometimes this has posed challenges and inconvenience to Korean companies. The newly launched system will likely attract the cases to Korea, thereby offering better service for them,” lawyer An Hae-jin of law firm Daeji told The Korea Herald. “But conducting the legal process in English may also cause some language burdens and unnecessary costs for the Korean companies. How the new system is established will play an important role,” she added.Acknowledging the problems that may be faced by Korean companies, the top court is considering allowing the English lawsuits only if both the plaintiffs and defendants agree to hold the proceedings in the language, sources said.The top court’s project task force has already applied for a budget plan of 400 million won ($340,000) for the establishment of the international justice department, they added.

Barcelona” at the Seoul Arts Center’s Hangaram Art Museum from July 3-Nov. 11. A total of 170 works including sketches, sculptures, furniture, paintings, ceramics and mock-up models selected from various organizations in Spain showcase the ingenious designs of the great thinker, whose motifs emanated from nature, biology and religion. “Unique Gaudi. Barcelona” at the Seoul Arts Center’s Hangaram Art Museum. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldThroughout the exhibition’s six sections, participants can walk through the architect’s lifelong overview, student works, early projects, relationship with patron Eusebi Guell, residential designs, furniture and craft, his magnus opus the Temple of the Sagrada Familia, as well as works by Spanish painter Joan Miro devoted to Gaudi. “Despite many exhibitions on Gaudi in Korea, there has never been one so sweeping in its coverage of works across the architect’s entire life period,” said CEO of Architwins Lee Byung-gi at the opening reception on Friday. “Gaudi’s work was not simply a representation of nature, but a product of concerted efforts to materialize life’s vitality into built forms ― mainly stones ― with practical considerations. He tried to express ethereality in reality.” Exhibition organizers and sponsors raise their glasses at the opening reception at Seoul Arts Center on Friday. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldGaudi exemplified Catalan Modernism, which sought the revival of Catalan culture in the context of turn-of-the-century modernization, urbanization and industrialization. Under the influence of neo-Gothic and Oriental techniques, Gaudi incorporated organic forms into the mainstream modernism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which stirred Europe physically and psychologically.He is also famous for his “god-like details” on ornamentation, merging ceramics, stained glass, ironwork and carpentry crafts with his architecture. Lee noted that six of the seven buildings by Gaudi, which are on the UNESCO World Heritage list ― Parque Guell, Palacio Guell, Casa Mila, Casa Vicens, Casa Batllo, Crypt in Colonia Guell, and Gaudi’s work on the Nativity facade and Crypt of La Sagrada Familia ― represented Spain’s six social classes in his time. ""Unique Gaudi. Barcelona"" exhibition at Seoul Arts Center. Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“These energetic entrepreneurs were the vanguards of social and economic change, and wanted their buildings to embody their lofty aspirations,” Lee explained. “Their guiding values being nationalism, revolution, bohemianism, energy, expansion and the like, these landlords revolutionized traditional gothic architecture into modernistic and rational structures.” ""Unique Gaudi. Barcelona"" exhibition at Seoul Arts Center. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldGaudi’s Catholic faith grew stronger throughout his life, leading to religious images in his works. This earned him the nickname “God’s Architect,” and prompted calls for his beatification in recent years. The venue was organized by the Michuhol Art Center, Aurea Cultura I Art and Catedra Gaudi at Universidad Politecnica de Cataluna ― a research institution specializing in collecting, studying and disseminating Gaudi’s work.

The scholarship, established in 1983, is a global program offered to candidates who have shown potential to be “future leaders, decision-makers and opinion formers” in diverse fields, such as academia, politics, business, media, religion and civil society. The program is offered to some 700 students in more than 110 countries each year, mainly funded by the U.K.’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office with partial contributions from universities, companies and foreign governments. The 2015 Chevening Scholars pose with British Ambassador Charles Hay (center) at a reception marking their departure at the ambassador’s residence in Seoul on Thursday. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“It is a huge achievement to be selected as a Chevening Scholar, as you have been chosen on the basis of your potential to be a future leader,” British Ambassador Charles Hay told the recipients at the ambassador’s residence in Seoul on Friday.“I know that all of you being Korean will work extremely hard. But I encourage you to not work hard every night, and experience the diverse and vibrant cultural life on offer in the U.K.”Chevening has a worldwide network of over 44,000 alumni who have held different positions of influence, including former Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev, former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Velez, former Polish Prime Minister Marek Belka, Indian Cabinet Minister Nittish Mishra and Chinese Vice Minister for Tax Administration Xu Shandu. More than 1,100 Korean Chevening Scholars have studied in the U.K. and joined the alumni, which regularly hosts knowledge forums, social nights, annual trips and education classes for lower-income children.

Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“Korea has the mission to upgrade its model of social and economic development through globalization. Britain, having deep knowledge and far networks from its past colonial expanse, would offer lessons to benchmark,” BKL Partner and Korean alumni president Park Jong-baek told The Korea Herald. Park, who studied international business law at London School of Economics from 1999 to 2000, noted: “Korea’s social norms are either unquestioningly one-sided and trendy, or bifurcated along extreme ideological lines. There is no room to express opinions different from the mainstream view, and everyone is on a rat race toward the same finish line. This creates winners and losers.” The strength of British education, according to Park, is that it respects students’ diverse talents and allows different paths of educational and vocational development. It is also attentive to the students’ needs, with teachers showing high degrees of dedication and professionalism. To diversify this mentality that dominates Korea, Park hoped the scholars would do some cross-cultural introspection in the multicultural U.K. He also encouraged them to deepen the bilateral relations following their career enrichment. (From left) BKL partner Park Jong-baek, IBK Chief Deputy General Manager Lee Dong-hoon, MOFA second secretary Kim Sung-jun and KT manager Ju Dae-wu. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldMinistry of Foreign Affairs second secretary Kim Sung-jun, who will study social policy at LSE, said he wanted to learn from Britain’s wealth of historical and political experience in governing society. “Britain has adopted different policies across a broad ideological spectrum since the end of WWII, from social democracy to laissez-faire economy,” the young diplomat said. “I also want to delve into its rich culture, which has posh, highbrow features on one hand, and queer, hipster trends on the other.”While pointing out that Korea also offers high-quality scholarships to students from developing countries, Kim commented that benchmarking Chevening would serve as a useful public diplomacy tool for the Korean government. A manager at KT, Ju Dae-wu, who studied new media at the University of London from 2008 to 2009, said he benefited from closely interacting with his professors, who were world-renowned scholars in their fields of expertise.“The classes were without formalities and mannerism, and a one-hour lecture was followed by an hourlong discussion led by students,” Ju said. “The curriculum was intellectually engaging, with theory-focused lectures and qualitative research.”IBK chief deputy general manager Lee Dong-hoon, who studied international banking and finance at the University of Birmingham from 1998 to 1999, said he learned the U.K.’s advanced financial techniques and the rule of law called “compliance.” “Finance started from London and its financial market has been at the forefront of cutting-edge financial engineering, with diverse products and regulatory response capacities,” he said. “I studied there right after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and thought that if we had adopted these measures earlier, the Korean economy could have weathered the crisis better.”Korea’s Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Financial Supervisory Service, Bank of Korea, Diageo Korea, Korea Britain Society, HSBC and PCA Life Korea are the scholarship sponsors and partners.

Over the past few years, direct purchasing from overseas has spread among Koreans, mainly because the exclusion of a middleman allows customers to buy the products cheaper. Last year, the government announced it would simplify the importation process to promote the market growth.Earlier in the month, the Fair Trade Commission chief Chung Jae-chan acknowledged the issue and rolled out a series of countermeasures. This includes increasing the number of employees dealing with direct purchasing-related issues and launching a website by September providing the users with the information they need when buying directly from overseas websites.Inconvenience related to online shopping from overseas websites accounted for 37 percent of total complaints registered to the center.

Some 50 drivers will be recruited through HIGH& to drive the selected cabs. The vehicles with an engine capacity of 2800 cubic centimeters or larger can operate as a “luxurious taxi” after they apply for a permit from the city government. (Yonhap)The move comes in line with the latest bid by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to ease regulations on the operation of luxury taxis. Currently, the law requires vehicles to retain at least an engine capacity of 3000 cc, restricting the types of cars that can run as high-end cabs. Korea already has luxury cabs licensed to drive across the nation, but they are required to charge customers through a meter and carry taxi signs like any other regular taxi.But the new premium cab-hiring system gives more leeway to drivers and operators, not requiring them to bear taxi signs or run on the meter system. The cabs will look like a regular car except that their license plates should be yellow. It will also allow them to freely set the prices. The starting taxi fare will be likely set at around 7,500 won ($6.50) to 8,500 won, 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than that of current high-end taxis, according to an official from the Seoul government. The current premium taxis’ starting rate is 5,000 won. The vehicles will not roam the city to find passengers like traditional cabs, but will only be hired by those making a reservation in advance. An official from Seoul Taxi Association told The Korea Herald that it expects the system to improve labor conditions for cab drivers suffering from low income and punishing working hours. Those driving luxury cabs will receive a salary, which will be higher than the average monthly wage for regular taxi drivers, amounting to about 2.1 million won. The move comes as the city saw a growing number of high-end car services illegally operated by individuals, especially at nighttime, and a high demand for taxi-hiring services such as Uber, which the city called “illegal.” “The new scheme was designed to legalize the operation of premium taxis to help the taxi industry and protect citizens,” an official from the city government told The Korea Herald. “Unlike the current premium taxi service, the city will promote fair competition in the private sector to offer the high-quality service to passengers,” he added.But some members of the public have voiced concerns over Seoul’s plan, accusing the municipality of being self-contradictory.  “Seoul City launched its own version of Uber while it blocked the global taxi-hiring app from doing business here,” Ahn Jin-gul, a secretary general for People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, told The Korea Herald. Seoul banned Uber from operating here, imposing a penalty on those illegally running taxis through the app without cab drivers’ licenses as well as passengers using the system. The difference between Uber service and Seoul government’s proposal is that those seeking to run high-end taxis should hold taxi driver’s licenses to be granted a permit.The civic activist said that Seoul City’s new system could pose a threat to taxi drivers as competition to find passengers would intensify in the already maturing industry. The plan to adopt a higher rate than ever for the luxurious taxis also opens up the possibility of an increase in overall taxi fares, dealing a blow to Seoul citizens, Ahn pointed out. “The plan needs a more thorough review and consensus from relevant parties,” he said, adding that it is premature to introduce the system.The Seoul City official, however, shrugged off the concerns.“It is a matter of choice for both consumers and drivers,” he said, adding that it will leave the system to work in accordance with the principle of the “market economy.”“Not all Koreans would use the high-end taxi system, which means drivers and operators should take their own risks,” he said. “The price and the number of taxis will be decided upon demand.”  The official said that there are already some drivers considering applying for a permit to operate their taxis under the new scheme, adding that taxi drivers seem to welcome the new system.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","put 30 taxis into trial ,30 taxis into trial operation ,the new premium cab hiring ,the global taxi hiring app ,30 taxis into trial","['Seoul', 'Uber', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'HIGH &', 'Seoul Taxi Association', 'HIGH &', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Taxi Association', 'the Korea Herald', 'Uber', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City', 'Ahn jin - gul', 'People ’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Seoul', 'Ahn', 'Seoul City', 'Koreans', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31281805  0.37233055

But, few of them might know that there is an aging building near Wangfujing, which was used by the Japanese military police as a prison where Yi Yuk-sa (1904-1944), one of Korea's most famous poets and an independence activist, died. Universally known by his pen name, Yi's works symbolize the spirit of Korean independence movements against Japan's harsh colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. In the 1930s, Yi studied in China, while making frequent contacts with a number of Korean independence activists. Yi, who suffered symptoms of lung disease, was arrested in 1943 and transferred to the prison of the Japanese military police in Beijing, where he endured brutal torture. About 19 months before the Korean Peninsula was liberated, Yi died in the prison. As the 70th anniversary of the Korean Peninsula's liberation from the Japanese colonial rule approaches, Yonhap News Agency recently visited the former prison of the Japanese military police. Like many aging buildings in Beijing, the former prison is facing demolition. Park Han-yong, an official at the Seoul-based Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities, told Yonhap by telephone that, ""Along with Shanghai, Beijing was one of the centers for anti-Japanese independence movements for Korean activists."" ""But, efforts to preserve historical sites in Beijing have been neglected, compared with Shanghai,"" Park said. The institute is conducting research work on Koreans who gained by collaborating with Japan during the colonial rule. Every year, South Korea has marked the foundation of Korea's provisional government in Shanghai, where the interim government was based. Japan's harsh colonial rule left deep scars on the hearts of Koreans. During that period, Koreans were banned from using their own language at schools and forced to adopt Japanese names.Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were also mobilized as forced laborers and sex slaves.

Many Koreans who contracted the virus did so while caring for their family members at MERS-affected hospitals.  Koreans participate in a campaign that promotes good hygiene practices that reduce the spread of infections and viruses on Tuesday, after Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn announced the ""de facto end"" to the MERS outbreak. (Yonhap)In its efforts to prevent hospital-acquired infections, the Health Ministry will now require all visitors at medical facilities to register at the entrance. The ministry is also thinking of ways to minimize the number of visitors -- those who come in for the sole purpose of visiting or caring for inpatients -- to hospitals. “We certainly think that there should be a new system which prevents hospitals from receiving too many visitors all at once,” said Kwon Deok-cheol, head of the central MERS task force. “It’s important to prevent any infectious virus from entering the country. But we have realized that it is also equally important to build a system that minimizes the risk of hospital-to-hospital transmission.”Kwon also pointed out the Korean practice of seeking care at multiple hospitals, known as “doctor shopping,” was one of the main factors contributing to the spread of the MERS virus in the country. “What doctor shopping does is it triggers so many patients living nationwide to seek treatments at large, general hospitals in Seoul,” he said. “Without a new system that regulates the number of visitors, large hospitals will remain vulnerable to hospital-to-hospital transmission as so many people would be exposed to the virus should there be an outbreak of any contagious disease.”The government also plans to establish a new system that offers full nursing care to include assistance usually provided by patients’ family members, said Kwon. According to a recent study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, introducing the system would require the Health Ministry to spend 4.6 trillion won ($3.95 billion) to offer full nursing services at 1,780 hospitals nationwide by 2020, and hire 47,922 more nurses to make it possible. “We had been planning (to introduce the full nursing system) before the MERS outbreak took place,” said Kwon. “Before the outbreak, our initial plan was to have more nurses in small hospitals in regional and remote areas. But through this outbreak we learned that big hospitals in Seoul can in fact be more vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections.”South Korea currently has the lowest patient-to-nurse ratio among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, at 0.28 nurses per patient. The OECD average is 1.25. To increase the number of nurses, the Health Ministry announced its plan to newly establish a two-year nursing program in universities earlier this year. Currently, there are two types of nursing certificates in Korea. One can be obtained by attending a four-year university degree program, while the other only requires a year-long certification program offered in non-university institutions. With the newly established program, there will be three types of nurses with different skills and responsibilities, including caring for inpatients, and this would eventually improve the quality of the nation’s health care, Kwon said. The plan, however, has been fiercely opposed by the representative bodies of Korean nurses, who claim that nurses with degrees in four-year programs would likely lose their jobs once the new system gets established.The MERS outbreak has killed 36 and infected 186 since the index case was confirmed May 20. The spread has consistently shown signs of fading, with no additional cases confirmed since July 6. The World Health Organization states that the declaration of an end to an outbreak should be made at least 28 days after the last confirmed patient has completely recovered. Among the 12 confirmed patients remaining in hospitals in Korea, 11 have tested negative for the virus and are currently being treated for after-effects of the disease. Of these, three are said to be in unstable condition, although the Health Ministry refused to identify them.It is unclear when the last remaining MERS-positive patient’s condition might improve, as the patient is said to be suffering from blood cancer on top of MERS. The patient is reported to be in his or her 30s.Also on Tuesday, the special MERS response committee at the National Assembly proposed a resolution to launch an inspection by the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea on the Health Ministry and the Samsung Medical Center‘s handling of the outbreak during the early stages of the crisis.The Health Ministry had refused to share the list of MERS-affected hospitals for more than two weeks after the index case was confirmed. The lack of transparency has been blamed for the public fear that eventually damaged the nation’s economy.The ministry has also been accused of protecting commercial interests of the MERS-affected hospitals by not sharing the information, rather than keeping the general public safe from the possible infection. Almost half of all confirmed cases occurred at the Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, which is still largely known as one of the top hospitals in the country.Meanwhile, a total of seven countries, including parts of China, the Czech Republic, Russia, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates, have all lifted their travel warnings on Korea as of Tuesday, according to the  Foreign Ministry.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","hospital acquired infections south korea ,middle east respiratory syndrome tuesday ,viruses on tuesday after prime ,tuesday after prime minister hwang ,affected hospitals koreans participate in","['Seoul', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'South Korea', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Yonhap)In', 'the Health Ministry', 'Kwon Deok - cheol', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Kwon', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'the Health Ministry', 'Kwon', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD', 'the Health Ministry', 'Korea', 'Kwon', 'korean', 'the World Health Organization', 'Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'the National Assembly', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'China', 'the Czech Republic', 'Russia', 'Vietnam', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Korea', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.17531508  0.29740757

During the broadcast, it showed ads for several North Korean firms selling Korean ginseng, construction materials and information technology.During a 2009 competition in Pyongyang for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, no advertisements for North Korean firms were seen, although the North allowed South Korean and Japanese sponsors of the match -- including Samsung, Hyundai and Toshiba -- to advertise their brands.Analysts said that the communist state seems to use the advertisements for multiple purposes including improving its international image of an economic backwater.“The ads during the match are obviously a very good opportunity for the North to show to the outside world that it also has various corporate entities that are thriving,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior analyst at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.“Thus, in terms of the political aspect, the North may want to use the advertisements to improve its image, largely associated with abject poverty.”Chang added that the advent of commercials is also connected to the increased autonomy in the management of state corporations. The North has allowed state firms to use their profits, left after meeting its state production quotas, to increase their production efficiency and interests, which might have triggered competition among them and raised the need for commercials, he pointed out.Cho Bong-hyun, a senior researcher at the Industrial Bank of Korea, noted that the unusual ads appear to underscore Pyongyang’s efforts to attract foreign investments and shore up its debilitated economy.“Recently, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered state firms to focus on exports and improve the quality of their goods. Kim appears to be more active to produce some tangible economic gains and in that process, we now see these ads,” he said.“To show that his regime is faring well, he needs to show some economic achievements. But state firms do not seem to be performing well.

SNUH surgeon Dr. Lee Kwang-woong performed the operation, together with a colleague, an anesthesiologist and a nurse who were all from Georgia. In the operation, 18-year-old Mariam Gobejishvili donated 60 percent of her liver to her 55-year-old father Gocha Gobejishvili. Lee visited Georgia in February to examine the facility and faculty of the Aversi Clinic, where the surgery was performed, and gave the green light for the operation. The clinic purchased equipment from a list prescribed by SNUH.  (Clockwise) Aversi Clinic surgeon Nikoloz Ubiria, surgeon Ioseb Gelashvili, surgeon Koba Shanava; Seoul National University Hospital surgeon Lee Kwang-woong; Aversi Clinic anesthesiologist Tina Khutsishvili and morphologist Tamar Javakhsishvili; Seoul National University Hospital professor Kim Hee-joong, professor Kim Suk-hwa, president Oh Byung-hee; Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava; Seoul National University College of Medicine dean Kang Dae-hee; and Georgian Embassy Minister-Counsellor George Khabelashvili (Seoul National University Hospital)“I decided to have an operation several months ago, and my daughter was the first one to decide to be a donor,” Gocha told the Georgian press. “At first, I refused, as I was worried about her health. However, we entrusted our health to the clinic.”The clinic is a private hospital managed by a pharmaceutical company. Most doctors are university professors educated in Europe. The partnership was first suggested by Georgian surgeon Koba Shanava, who did a 6-month internship at SNUH under Lee’s supervision last year. A Georgian anesthesiologist did a 3-week internship at SNUH in March before the surgery, and a clinical pathologist and three surgeons participated in a monthlong training program in June. “It is critical to maintain high operational standards, as upheld by the SNUH liver team,” Aversi Clinic surgeon Nikoloz Ubiria told The Korea Herald. “A new organization like us needs to learn the medical ‘culture’ -- how the operation is planned and executed, and post-operation is managed.”“Dedication, precision and professionalism result in a successful operation, with a healthy recipient and donor.”The Georgian Embassy in Seoul provided administrative support, and aims to expand medical cooperation to more fields, surgeon Koba Shanava said. The team completed a second successful operation in May. Since then, the number of patients waiting to be operated on at the clinic has multiplied.Liver transplants are split into diseased donor and living donor types. The former involves a dead person, and is relatively easy to execute, according to Lee. The latter is more difficult, as the donor’s safety must be taken into account. Both operations are for patients with a terminal liver disease, who must undergo the surgery to survive. A long list of causes -- hepatitis B and C, alcohol overconsumption and cancer – can lead to terminal liver failure. The surgery is highly complicated and a complex post-operation procedure is required, Lee said.  From left: Seoul National University Hospital surgeon Lee Kwang-woong, donor Mariam Gobejishvili, recipient Gocha Gobejishvili and surgeon Koba Shanava pose before a living donor liver transplant in Tbilisi, which took place on March 20. (Seoul National University Hospital)“I consider myself a second generation Korean liver transplant surgeon, who learned from senior compatriots, unlike the first generation who learned from Western and Japanese doctors,” Lee said. “It’s about time Korea shared its experience with other countries. Interactions such as this will raise both countries’ profiles with one another, and save lives.”Korea is at the world’s top level in living donor surgery, in terms of technique, survival rate and the number of operations per million people, according to Lee. The five-year survival rate for recipients in Korea is over 90 percent, compared to around 80 percent in Europe.Georgia’s health care and insurance are largely state-managed alongside private clinics. Patients do not pay for emergency operations, and nonemergency care is half-covered. The government currently does not provide financial support for living donor liver transplants. “It is our goal to demonstrate to the government that this program will work in Georgia,” Ubiria said, urging financial, administrative and legal backing from his government.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","generation korean liver transplant surgeon ,georgian anesthesiologist did week internship ,second generation korean liver transplant ,successful living donor liver transplant ,korean liver transplant surgeon who","['the Seoul National University Hospital', 'the Georgian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Tbilisi', 'Georgia', 'Korea', 'Lee Kwang - woong', 'Georgia', 'Mariam Gobejishvili', 'Gocha Gobejishvili', 'Lee', 'Georgia', 'the Aversi Clinic', 'snuh', 'Aversi Clinic', 'Nikoloz Ubiria', 'Ioseb Gelashvili', 'Koba Shanava', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Lee Kwang - woong', 'Aversi Clinic', 'Tina Khutsishvili', 'Tamar Javakhsishvili', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Kim Hee - joong', 'Kim Suk - hwa', 'Georgian', 'Nikoloz Apkhazava', 'Seoul National University College of Medicine', 'Kang Dae - hee', 'Georgian', 'Seoul National University', 'Gocha', 'georgian', 'Georgian', 'Koba Shanava', 'snuh', 'Lee', 'georgian', 'snuh', 'snuh', 'Aversi Clinic', 'Nikoloz Ubiria', 'the Korea Herald', 'Georgian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Koba Shanava', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Seoul National University Hospital', 'Lee Kwang - woong', 'Mariam Gobejishvili', 'Gocha Gobejishvili', 'Koba Shanava', 'Tbilisi', 'Seoul National University', 'Hospital)“I', 'korean', 'western', 'japanese', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Korea', 'Georgia', 'Georgia', 'Joel Lee']",7,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.1057377  1.12399065 0.47866026]

Khan visited Seoul to expand economic cooperation and elicit Korean investment in Pakistan, building on former Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won’s visit to Islamabad in April last year. He participated in the first annual meeting of the Pakistan-Korea Joint Trade Commission Wednesday, as both countries seek to launch a full-scale free trade agreement. From left: Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan, Federal Minister for Commerce Khurram Dastgir Kahn and embassy Commercial Counselor Aamir Zazir Gondal speak to journalists at Lotte Hotel last Wednesday. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“Our economy is well positioned to take off,” Khan stressed, adding that the “extremism and terrorism that has threatened Pakistan for the last 10 years have dwindled markedly.”Due to terrorism, many major international airlines did not fly to Pakistan and investors preferred to do business in Dubai or Singapore instead, he said.“But our military and intelligence actions targeting terrorism have strengthened law and order substantially,” he argued. “Our government aims to give young people hope through economic growth and employment, so that they stay away from extremism and terrorism.”Khan pointed to improved macroeconomic indicators, which have boosted investors’ confidence and Pakistan’s engagement with the world economy. International credit rating service Moody’s raised its outlook for Pakistan from negative to stable to positive between 2012 and 2015.The government has also reduced deficits, divested shares of state-owned enterprises and successfully adapted to the international bond market, Khan said. “We are partners in growth,” the minister stressed. “Korean businesses can be part of Pakistan’s expanding economy, estimated to have a GDP of $270 billion with 4.2 percent growth last year.”Pakistan aims to develop its transport infrastructure, energy infrastructure, logistics and mining. Agriculture and food processing, particularly meat and poultry, are also ripe for investment, he added. To fill energy shortages by 2017, Pakistan aims to import electricity from China and Tajikistan, and gas from Turkmenistan.“Pakistan’s geostrategic location acts as a ‘fulcrum’ between Central and South Asia,” Khan claimed. “With our Asian partners, we want to transform our diplomatic friendships into economic partnerships.”He added, “Pakistani companies that have long looked to the West for trade and investment are increasingly looking east.”As China’s east end is Korea and west end is Pakistan, and China has free trade agreements with both countries, the minister said, Islamabad and Seoul should sign an FTA to complete the triad. Pakistan has exported textile, yarn and metal to Korea for decades, and aims to expand the export’s scope and range. Bilateral trade amounted to $1.2 billion last year, with the trade balance in favor of Korea: Pakistan imported $700 million from Korea and Korea imported $500 million from Pakistan. Cumulative Korean investment is $140 million. POSCO, Hyundai, Samsung, LG, Lotte and Sambu-Daewoo have set up businesses and factories in Pakistan in the construction, electronics, energy and food sectors. Korea’s EximBank has agreed to provide $50 million to construct an information technology park in Islamabad and a special children’s hospital will be built in the southeastern province of Sindh with Korea’s assistance. Pakistan’s first motorway, which runs 367 kilometers between Lahore and Islamabad, was built by a Daewoo construction company in the early 1990s. Most Pakistanis associate Korea with the highway, which has become a landmark, Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan said. Minister Khan highlighted the ambitious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project ― a $46 billion Chinese investment in Pakistan’s highways, ports, transmission lines and energy pipelines ― which will be open to international investors. “The project raised Pakistan’s international profile as an investment destination, and raised investors’ confidence in our country,” he underscored. “It is significant in the context of the opening of Iran, as Pakistan wants to include Iran in the corridor.”As part of the scheme, the Gwadar Port in southwestern Pakistan on the Arabian Sea would open routes to Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Korean companies can participate in joint projects in Afghanistan, and build the “Central Asian connection” through Gwadar, the minister noted. “So many of our sectors are underdeveloped that if you are willing to bring in new management and technology into any part of the economy, you will be met with opportunities,” he claimed, adding that workers could work for many multinational firms in Pakistan.Unfortunately, the relations between Pakistan and India have not improved under the governments of prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, Khan added. “The current situation is not conducive to taking our relationship forward. (But) despite the diplomatic tension, bilateral trade has continued, ranging between $2.5 (billion) and $3 billion a year.”Khan argued that the young professionals visiting Pakistan will get an “exotic feel” of a country on the cusp of development. “Living in Pakistan may be comparable to Korea 30 years ago,” he said. “We have a very colorful culture, with different styles of cultural expression in music, art, theater, clothes and food.”Pakistan also has a diverse terrain and climate, from the high mountains in the north to the southern seas and everything in between. A steady stream of Korean tourists travel to Pakistan’s “majestic north” for mountaineering, according to the ambassador. 11,000 Pakistanis currently live in Korea, including some 1,000 students, 1,000 laborers and a great number of businesspeople. Over 1,000 Pakistanis have married Koreans and settled here since the late 1980s.

Located at the heart of Europe, Switzerland has relied on its modern transport, communications infrastructure and electricity network for its tightknit democracy, community and commerce. As Switzerland has few natural resources and imports 80 percent of its energy, an efficient use of its resources has been important to the people and business, the minister noted. The high cost of electricity has led public, commercial and research institutions to develop efficient technologies.The Fukushima nuclear disaster, with its irreparable environmental, economic and emotional damage, has served as a crude wakeup call to phase out nuclear power. The first plant will shut down in 2019 amid the country’s transition to renewable power sources, mainly hydropower. Switzerland’s five nuclear plants currently generate some 38 percent of its electricity, while 56 percent comes from hydropower, 4 percent from other renewables and 2 percent from fossil fuels. Noting that global energy demand will rise 60 percent by 2035, Leuthard said, “The ability to offer energy at affordable prices is a decisive factor for a modern economy.”She added, “That is why improving energy efficiency, expanding renewable energy and advancing energy security are on the global agenda of governments.” “Global energy and environmental issues and Switzerland” seminar at the Westin Chosun Hotel on Thursday. (Swiss Embassy)According to the International Energy Agency, 20 percent of the world’s population consumes 80 percent of global energy and the 1.3 billion people in the most industrialized countries use 35 times more electricity than the 2.2 billion people in the least industrialized nations. In Asia, private automobile ownership has risen sharply, and the number of cars in the world is estimated to reach 1.8 billion by 2035. “Therefore, it is critical to take steps to reduce (our) carbon footprint in transport, buildings, cooling and heating systems,” Leuthard stressed. “This is where the greatest potential lies in reducing energy consumption and boosting efficiency.”To reduce the ecological footprint, Leuthard stressed incorporating information and communications technologies into the energy production, transmission and consumption at all levels. “When our German neighbors speak of ‘Industry 4.0,’ they are referring to the advanced form of business based on ICT,” the minister highlighted. “I believe we should go a step further and develop an ‘Infrastructure 4.0’ strategy.” According to the minister, information and communications technology can be embedded in “every part” of the “smart networks” ― from electricity meters in the home to turbines at power stations. Doing so would modernize the infrastructure and economize utility. Leuthard underscored that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is in the interest of both emerging and developing countries. “All countries must do their part to reduce emissions and assume their share of responsibility,” she stressed. “Each country’s measure will be different based on the energy and power mix.”Switzerland is pursuing policies to cut down greenhouse gas use by adhering to the 2010 Cancun Agreement, where controlling global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels was agreed upon as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The minister lauded Korea for its $100 million contribution to the Green Climate Fund (same as Switzerland), as well as hosting the institution in the Songdo district of Incheon. She also praised Korea for launching the Emission Trading System this year ― a market-based approach for controlling pollution through incentives ― as Asia’s first country to adopt such a system on a nationwide scale.

They stand as not only hotspots for relaxation and various leisure activities for city dwellers, but also as historical treasure troves and ecological assets. Bamseom Islets, epitome of ecological diversity Located below Seogang Bridge linking Yeouido and Mapo, the Bamseom islets are the only remaining naturally occurring river islands in the Hangang River that have not been affected by modern human settlement. Over the last five decades, the sandy islets have become an epitome of ecological resilience. Their collective size has grown more than sixfold to almost 280,000 square meters since the U.S. forces measured them in 1966, due to natural sedimentary buildup. While some 180 species of plant flourish there, the surrounding waters provide a nursery ground for a multitude of fish species including the Korean striped bitterling, the Korean spined bitterling and the Korean oily shiner. Seoul City has been providing special protection since it designated the islands as an “Ecosystem and Landscape Region for Conservation” in 1999. In 2012, the Bamseom islets were added to the Ramsar wetland list. “Bamseom’s instinctive ecological recovery represents the birth of a barometer for the Hangang River’s ecosystem,” Han Dong-uk, director-general of the PGA Wetland Ecology Institute, wrote in the 2009 book, “Islands in the Hangang River.” “Its reemergence has also greatly contributed to upgrading Seoul’s image as a metropolis, allowing residents to feel themselves the nature’s astounding resilience that created an ecological space and paradise for migratory birds in the urban center.” Nodeulseom Island, time-honored playgroundUntil the Joseon dynasty, Nodeulseom Island was one of the five main ports in the Hangang River basin, named after the neighborhood south of the river, meaning “a stone that white herons play with.” The name of nearby Noryangjin originated from the Chinese characters for “Nodeul naru (port).”The 150,000-square-meter area, which was once a sandy plain visited by Seoulites for swimming, today supports the Hangang Bridge. It houses a pedestrian overpass, a 2,000-square-meter landing pad for helicopters and a monument dedicated to Lee Won-deung, an Army master sergeant who died while saving a teammate during a high-altitude parachute training exercise in 1966. The oval-shaped island was called Joongjido during the Japanese colonial rule before it gained its current name in 1995. Seonyudo Island, storied ecological park Known as the country’s first recycled ecological park, Seonyudo Island had for two decades been the site of a large-scale water purification plant until 2002. A building once used as a pumping station has since been transformed into a gallery that chronicles the history of the river, with the geological, ecological and cultural heritage of the surrounding region on display. In the 17th century, Seonyudo Island was a peak named Seonyubong that rose 40 meters above sea level, embracing two small mountaintops and a white sandy beach at its foot. Many boatmen were said to have often tied up their vessels by the river and indulged themselves in the breathtaking landscape, which was also portrayed in the works of Jeong Seon, a prominent Joseon period painter. During colonial rule, however, Japan broke rocks there to build an embankment to prevent floods, turning it into a low hill cut off from the land.Now, gardens with different themes entice visitors, while Seonyugyo, an arch-shaped bridge connecting the park and the Yanghwa area of the south bank, is splashed with rainbow-colored lights in the evening making for a perfect night out for many and earning it the nickname “Rainbow Bridge.” “Though the reminiscences of Seonyubong were forgotten long ago, we now have a park that has left intact almost all memories of a water treatment facility, the fruit of industrialization, yet with an unexcelled aesthetic sensibility,” wrote Pae Jeong-hann, a landscape architecture professor at Seoul National University in the aforementioned 2009 book. Seoraeseom Island, home of canola flowers In May, Seoraeseom Island becomes carpeted with yellow canola flowers ― and couples and families seeking to greet the harbinger of spring, as well as volunteers tasked with telling them the island’s stories. The artificial island was built in a 25,000-square-meter area between Banpo and Dongjak Bridges as part of Seoul City’s drive to lay the Olympic Expressway and develop the overall Hangang River basin in 1982-86. Maps drawn in the 17-19th centuries showed another island called either Banposeom or Kido Island on the spot, and a sand dune was reported to have been there in the 1960s. In addition to the canola festival, weeping willows, reed fields and walkways along the shore have made the island a breathing place for urbanites, while many anglers visit the area to cash in on the slow stream flow and high water temperature to catch carp. Seoraeseom Island also provides a habitat for a number of migratory bird species and has a water ski stand and flower gardens. By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","seoul joining 50 other species ,ducks black crowned night herons ,landscape architecture professor at seoul ,festival weeping willows reed fields ,flocks of spot billed ducks","['Seoul', 'Bamseom', 'Yeouido', 'Shim Sa - jeong', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan', 'Bamseom', 'Seonyudo', 'Nodeulseom', 'Seoraeseom', 'Nanjido', 'Jeojado', 'Bamseom Islets', 'Seogang Bridge', 'Yeouido', 'Mapo', 'Bamseom', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Seoul City', 'Bamseom', 'Bamseom', 'the PGA Wetland Ecology Institute', 'Seoul', 'Nodeulseom Island', 'Nodeulseom Island', 'Noryangjin', 'chinese', 'seoulite', 'Lee Won - deung', 'Army', 'japanese', 'Seonyudo Island', 'Seonyudo Island', 'Seonyubong', 'Jeong Seon', 'Joseon', 'Japan', 'Yanghwa', 'Seonyubong', 'Pae Jeong - hann', 'Seoul National University', 'Seoraeseom Island', 'Seoraeseom Island', 'Banpo', 'Dongjak Bridges', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Banposeom', 'Seoraeseom Island', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.50043464  0.8519069

(Seoul Metropolitan Government)For Korea, the Hangang River has undertaken that role, serving as a crucial conduit for people’s exchanges and communication, and laying the groundwork for the flourishing of ancient kingdoms, though it was, at times, exploited by outside forces as an invasion route.The 514-kilometer-long river that runs through the center of the peninsula has been at the heart of Korea’s history, including its dramatic rise from the rubble of the 1950-53 Korean War, which is often dubbed as the “Miracle on the Hangang River,” historians said.“The Hangang River has historically been a major transport line that facilitated not only the movements of people and materials but also the spread and integration of cultures across the peninsula,” said Chun Woo-young, professor at Hanyang University’s Institute for East Asian Cultures.“From a military standpoint, the river was a crucial defensive perimeter and center of the ancient kingdoms’ competition (for geopolitical primacy). It has long been a central point of the peninsula’s history.” The country’s use of the river dates back to Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages, and an array of relics representing these ages, such as earthenware, stoneware and bone implements, have been unearthed in the river’s basin. Those relics, some of which are preserved in the Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site in southern Seoul, indicate that the river provided vital resources for Koreans, such as fish, and helped them advance their cultures, which gave rise to ancient communities along the river.During the Bronze Age, the river was a key medium for the spread of cultures from the northern and central parts of the peninsula to the southern regions. Cultural exchanges that helped devise farming methods and tools led to the nation’s overall agricultural development.During the so-called Three Kingdoms Period (B.C. 57-A.D. 668), the river emerged as the nucleus of the peninsular geopolitics with the three kingdoms ― Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla ― fiercely competing for control of the river, which was seen as essential to achieve military, economic and political preeminence.In the Goryeo Kingdom (918-1392), the importance of the river continued to be highlighted as King Woo (1374-1388) and King Gongyang (1389-1392) designated the current location of Seoul as the capital of the dynasty in 1382 and 1390, respectively ― though their decisions were later overturned due to social and political confusion that followed the change of the capital. The Hangang River was a core transport route during the Joseon era (1392-1910) through which people around the country paid their taxes. In the agricultural society, the mainstay of state revenues was farm products. The products were delivered via the river as land-based transportation was poorly developed.After Japan colonized the peninsula in 1910, the river was exploited as a means to facilitate its illegal occupation of Korea and advance its imperialist causes. During the 36-year-long colonial rule, Japan built railroad and pedestrian bridges over the river to make it easier and faster for it to transport war materials overseas, particularly after its invasion of Manchuria in 1931.After the communist North, backed by the former Soviet Union and China, invaded the South across the 38th parallel in 1950, the river played another role in Korea’s tragic history.Some of the bridges, built by Japan, were bombed to prevent enemy forces from crossing the river and advancing further south, while a wave of South Koreans used other bridges or waterways to find shelter from the rumbling tanks.With the country emerging from the ashes of the war, the river has become a symbol of the country’s rapid economic rise, which led to the coinage of the “Miracle on the Hangang River,” and turned into a popular venue for family picnics and water sports.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","seoulites swim and row boats ,history rivers have played pivotal ,essentials seoulites swim and row ,river on aug 1964 seoul ,the river provided vital resources","['Seoul Metropolitan', 'Korea', 'the Hangang River', 'Korea', 'Chun Woo - young', 'Hanyang University ’s Institute for East Asian Cultures', 'Paleolithic', 'Prehistoric Settlement Site', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'the Bronze Age', 'Goguryeo', 'Baekje', 'Silla', 'King Woo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Manchuria', 'Soviet Union', 'China', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'South Koreans', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54941195  0.29025421

According to Korea Express Corporation, those who do not wear seat belts face a 1.45 percent chance of being killed in a traffic accident, compared to a 0.39 percent chance for those who are belted.A survey suggests that Koreans generally ignore the advice to buckle up, with only 22 percent of passengers in the back seat using the safety restraint, significantly lower than other countries like Germany at 97 percent, the United Kingdom at 89 percent and Japan at 61 percent.

The basis for this progress was the Framework Act on Women’s Development, first enacted in 1995. The complete revision of the act passed the National Assembly on May 2, 2014, with the name changed to the Framework Act on Gender Equality. The revised act took effect on July 1 this year. For the past 20 years, the women’s development law contributed to many areas related to female participation and gender equality. However, there were concerns that the act had its limitations as a basic law encompassing all individual laws and policies that have advanced to apply gender equality. Therefore, this change ushers in a new paradigm shift, from emphasizing women’s development to the practical realization of gender equality. Moreover, this shift not only clearly ensures the philosophy of gender equality outlined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, but also guarantees gender equality rights and reaffirms the government’s responsibility on the matter. The Framework Act on Gender Equality has a great significance in bringing gender equality through instituting a system of consideration of policy impacts on women, female-friendly cities, and a family policy strategy in preparation for the reunified Korea in which both men and men could equally participate, and much more.Starting this year, Women’s Week has become Gender Equality Week, where gender equality policies can be advanced and the culture of gender equality can be spread throughout Korean society. Furthermore, creating measures to prevent gender discrimination in national and local governments, guaranteeing equal access to health care, setting up legal basis for the provision of women-friendly cities and reflecting gender equal perspectives in international cooperation have helped the paradigm of women’s development to evolve into the practical realization of gender equality. Since the mid-1980s in Korea, many areas of society, including politics, economics, family, various institutions, laws and policies have set up the basis to eliminate discrimination against women and achieve gender equality.Moreover, the Act on Equal Employment for Both Sexes was enacted in 1987 to achieve gender equality in employment; the Infant Care Act (1991) was enacted to support child rearing; the Revision on the Three Laws on Maternity Protection (2001) was carried out to distribute the cost burden of pregnancy, childbirth and parenting; the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes (1994) and the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Crimes of Domestic Violence (1997), and the Act on the Prevention of Sexual Traffic and Protection, etc. of Victims (2004) were enacted to improve women’s social status. Also, in the mid-2000s, efforts to create an environment where both men and women can enjoy a work-life balance have flourished thanks to the enactment of the Equal Employment Opportunity and Work-Family Balance Assistance Act (2007), the Act on the Promotion of the Creation of a Family-Friendly Social Environment (2007), and the Act on the Promotion of Economic Activities of Career-Interrupted Women. Furthermore, there have been continuous efforts to reflect gender perspectives in general policymaking by the Ministry of Gender Equality and many other central government ministries, such as by introducing the Gender Impact Assessment Act (2004), Gender Budget Statements and Gender Budget Balance Sheets (2009), which shine a light on international society as an exemplary case. However, since the Korean society has put so much effort and emphasis on preparing laws and systems to protect and support women, there has been a backlash, with critics calling those efforts reverse discrimination against men.And as there is an increase in the number of women excelling in legal and administrative institutions, corporations and media, there is also a social atmosphere in which many say, “Now women are placed above men.” Women’s status in society has definitely improved, but only a few occupy influential positions in society, and many women still struggle with discrimination, suffer from nonregular employment and poverty, and are victims of domestic violence. Moreover, South Korea’s female labor market participation is still characterized by the “M curve.” According to the 2014 Economically Active Population Survey, women’s labor market participation is not much different than that of men’s in their 20s, but in their 30s, it decreases due to marriage, childbirth and child care, to fall 30 percent lower than that of men’s. By their late 30s, this disparity reaches about 40 percent. Among the OECD countries, only South Korea and Japan show this kind of female employment structure. In addition, women who have experienced a career break due to pregnancy, childbirth and child care earn 21.9 percent less when they are reemployed. That is the reason Korea’s gender wage gap is so high compared to the rest of the OECD. Korea’s achievements in gender equality would give equal benefits to men and women because traditional duties will now be understood and shared by both genders. Women are wives, girlfriends, sisters and colleagues where they live together among men in a variety of ways. Looking at it plainly, for example, when a woman is still in the workforce contributing to the household economy, the husband’s burden on providing for the family will lessen greatly. Since we have advanced beyond women’s development to the realization of a gender-equal society, women’s policy is now facing a new threshold for change. At this stage, forming a social agreement on women’s policy is very significant, and implementation of the Framework Act on Gender Equality will work as a starting point. There is a need for a social consensus on how women’s policy is not just for women, but is crucial for creating a society where both men and women can enjoy happiness together. By Lee Myung-sunLee Myung-sun is the current president of the Korean Women’s Development Institute.

We have 11 Nobel Prizes in the sciences and medicine,” Australian Ambassador Bill Paterson said at the event.“Today’s showcase provides an opportunity to identify long-term partnerships that can contribute to Korea’s creative economy.” Na Heung-bok, a representative of the Korea Medical Devices Industry Association, said: “Korean medical associations look forward to cooperating in the medical device industry with Australia.”Australia’s medical technology industry is a world leader in many fields, including diagnostics, imaging equipment and digital health applications, according to the ATC.The Australian market for medical devices was ranked the second-most attractive in the Asia-Pacific this year, as well as eighth in the world for technological specialization and 13th for medical device patents. In 2013-14, the country’s medical devices sector exported around A$1.7 billion ($1.3 billion) worth of products to 167 different countries. Multinational health care corporations such as GE Health, Cook Medical, Medtronic and Baxter International operate manufacturing, research and development projects in Australia. At the event, Dr. Paul Savage of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization presented on the medical biomaterials, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery processes that CSIRO is studying in Australia. “The focus of future biomedical materials research is in the development of combined materials, especially the use of polymer and stem cell combinations for tissue regeneration. The commercialization is expected to be realized in the near future,” he said.Professor Gordon Wallace of the University of Wollongong presented on the commercialization of Australia’s medical research and the effect of 3-D bio-printing on medical science. “Medical devices such as glaucoma implants, cartilage restoration scaffolds, and customized drug delivery have been realized through 3-D bio-printing,” according to Wallace. “The 3-D printer has made basic stem cell research possible, while artificial tissue produced by 3-D printing could eventually replace animal testing. Three-D printing challenges how we think about fabrication and enables us to more closely integrate fundamental and applied biosciences.”The achievements of past Australian medical breakthroughs was presented at the conference with special mentions for Cochlear’s bionic ear, Resmed’s continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnea, the world’s first 3-D-printed titanium heel implant and adaptive diagnostic technology platforms. A team at the University of Queensland has developed technology to make clearer images from MRI scanners that is now included in more than 65 percent of all manufactured MRI scanners.

(Uky Baek/Ukynepeople)Two Korean artists will stage a performance piece this week in an effort to lift the role of art in society. “Endless Lingering” by violinist Won Hyung-joon and artist Park Gian will be held at the Jeju Museum of Contemporary Art from Thursday to Saturday. The performance will feature Won playing J.S. Bach’s “Chaconne,” accompanied by Park’s dance and a movie showing the flowing movement of paint on her painting. The performance is the first of a concert series to mark 70 years of national division that has been organized by Won, who is supported by the Swiss Embassy and is executive director of Lindenbaum Music. Concerts will be held in Busan and Gyeonggi Province in July, and at Dongnimmun Gate in Seoul on Aug. 13 and Panmunjeom in the Demilitarized Zone on Aug. 15. “I thought art and music were like oil and water. I assumed music lovers did not like art exhibitions, and vice versa,” Won told The Korea Herald. “But by collaborating with Park, I learned that the two met at an intersection.”Park, who has worked for the last five years on the “automatism” technique of pouring paint on canvas, said her work attempts to arouse people’s emotions. The whirling clothes in her dance express the wind, and the moving paint captures gravity, she claims. “Art collaboration has existed for some time, most notably by French abstract painter Georges Mathieu and Korean-American artist Paik Nam-june,” Park explained. “In today’s ‘age of convergence,’ celebrities such as Big Bang, Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus are expanding the frontiers of their genres by experimenting with new methods.”As consequence, they have widened their platforms and made them more accessible to the public, she pointed out, adding that she focuses on both “what” and “how” of her creation. Park said that many people’s tendency to see art as extravagance needs to be rethought. “One of my friends in a developing country told me that her people did not have the luxury of enjoying art, as they were too busy making ends meet,” she said. “But I think that from a developed country’s perspective, Korea would appear similar. Art is not simply high living, but well-being of our souls essentially.”http://cms.heraldm.com:8080/WebStudio/Won agreed, stressing that artists and musicians have a social role to play. “Music is not simply for pleasure, but a practical tool to address and solve social issues,” he said.“Korea developed singlehandedly toward economic prosperity since the Korean War, but now that we have achieved wealth, we are hungry for culture,” he said. “But our society is affected by the side effects of the rapid growth, particularly on our humanity, happiness and trust. Music can mend our cleavages and heal our wounds.”Won pointed out that the arts in Korea have been confined to the domain of households, and consequently, closed off from society. It is the duty of culture-lovers to expand the social possibilities of arts, he said. By solving Korea’s political divisions and economic discrimination, Won hoped that the government and companies could pay more heed and support to the arts. “One example might be for the opposition party members, or management and labor representatives, to sing together in a choir,” he noted. “By practicing together, they would come to understand each other’s feelings better.” On Independence Day, Aug. 15, at the Joint Security Area, 70 members of the Lindenbaum Festival Orchestra will sing Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 in D minor, as part of the “One people, one harmony” concert. Through the Swiss Embassy in Seoul, Won sent an official request to the North Korean government to send 70 musicians across the border, and is awaiting confirmation. The Swiss Embassy in Seoul has supported Won since 2009, when Swiss conductor Charles Dutoit led a concert in Seoul on Swiss national day in August as part of the Lindenbaum Music Festival. More collaboration has occurred since then, and in 2013, the Lindenbaum staged a concert in the Swiss Camp of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Panmunjeom. By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","festival orchestra will sing beethoven ,2013 the lindenbaum staged concert ,concert in seoul on swiss ,lindenbaum festival orchestra will sing ,stage performance piece this week","['Won Hyung - joon', 'Park Gian', 'Uky Baek /', 'korean', 'Won Hyung - joon', 'Park Gian', 'Won', 'J.S.

The Irish Embassy on Tuesday hosted Dr. Kim Jung-ro, the director of the Settlement Support Center for North Korean Refugees, for his new book “The Irish Peace Process.” (From left) Author Kim Jung-ro, Irish Ambassador Alngeal O'Donoghue and former Korean Ambassador to the U.K. Ra Jong-il pose at a reception Tuesday at the Irish Embassy in Seoul to mark the publication of ""The Irish Peace Process."" (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The Good Friday Agreement, signed on April 10, 1998, laid the ground for long-lasting peace and reconciliation, and ended a conflict of over 750 years. Most of Ireland gained national independence from Britain in 1921, but the island remains politically divided between the North and South. The Good Friday settlement was a political agreement between Northern Ireland’s unionist and nationalist parties, as well as a legal agreement between the British and Irish governments. Ireland has many similarities with Korea, having survived colonial rule, national division and civil war. The Irish and Koreans share similar cultures, including a shared love of drinking and singing, with Korea sometimes nicknamed the “Ireland of Asia.”“Every conflict is unique, but there are aspects of our experience that may provide some insight into the tragic situation on the Korean Peninsula,” said Irish Ambassador Aingeal O’Donoghue, who worked on the negotiation process for five years. “Ultimately, what did we achieve? We moved from conflict to peace, and are currently in the process of building true reconciliation. The peace process gave the Northern Irish people a real sense of security, that they have the key to their own future.”The conflict, which had killed over 3,000 since the late 1960s, originates in the 12th century when Norman and English invaders colonized Ireland. People now tend to view the conflict in an ethno-religious light ― British Protestants versus Irish Catholics ― but the causes are political, social and economic, the ambassador explained. O’Donoghue noted that peace was forged gradually through a shared realization that Ireland could not be united through an armed struggle.“A diverse range of players on the Northern Irish side realized that a violent solution was not going to benefit anyone,” O’Donoghue said, adding that the British government also ended its military operations there. Brave politicians in Northern Irish and British governments took risks for peace, putting national interests before personal and partisan gains. John Hume, the founding member of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, and corecipient of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize, advocated compromise with the republican party of Sinn Fein. O’Donoghue stressed that the “principle of consent” allowed both peoples to decide their respective futures. “Our vision is fundamentally that of what the people of Northern Ireland want,” the ambassador told The Korea Herald. “Whether they want to be part of a united Ireland or Northern Ireland, it is for the will of the people, basically.”She said unification would only happen with the majority consent of the North, adding that only harmonious teamwork would sustain reconciliation. The commitment to democratic and peaceful means obligated paramilitary organizations on both sides to join a cease-fire and decommission their weapons in a “verifiable and guaranteed way.”“It was a very long process that involved extremely close cooperation between the British and Irish governments,” O’Donoghue underscored. “In 30 years, the two governments went from opposition to collaboration, overwhelmingly endorsed by their peoples.”The international community, particularly the U.S., European Union, Finland and the Irish diaspora, played strategic roles, alongside civil society and business communities. “The wisdom of the Irish experience is that they did not predetermine their destination, but have continuously asked questions about where they were headed and how they could get there. The people of Ireland were wary of their present defining their future,” said Kim, a longtime official at the Ministry of Unification.The author received his bachelor’s degree in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and master’s degree and Ph.D. in international relations at Columbia University and the University of Cambridge.He added that his book, written in Korean, did not offer an alternative to the German model of unification, but complementary guidance. Unlike German reunification, which happened under “very specific historic circumstances,” the Irish peace process is ongoing and more applicable to Korea, the author argued. “Germany’s reunification was a historic miracle, conditioned under favorable geopolitical currents ― a thaw of Cold War with the Soviet Union declining,” Kim wrote. “But the military rise of China has sparked tensions in East Asia, and strengthened the defense alliance between the U.S. and Japan, precipitating a new Cold War.” North Korea, meanwhile, has developed nuclear weapons while continuing its human rights violations, further regressing into isolation. Noting that Korea, like Ireland, has adopted a “peaceful, incremental and consensual” unification policy through the Korean National Community Unification Formula formulated in 1994, Kim pointed to the feasibility of the Irish experience. The key to their success was the institutionalization of cooperation and power-sharing, according to the author. Institutional mechanisms, such as the North-South Ministerial Council and the Joint Secretariat, have safeguarded and propelled the implementation of cooperative initiatives. Prime ministers, deputy prime ministers and ministers from both sides have participated in council meetings. The agreement granted British and Irish citizenship to the people in the North, and through joint projects, the two governments have expanded economic cooperation in various fields, such as agriculture, education, environment, health, transport and tourism.Most relevantly for Korea, Kim advised institutionalizing the will of cooperation, or pursuing a double-track of political and institutional approaches. He also recommended promoting a healthy public debate and society-wide integration. Doing so, the author wrote, may break the gridlock that has stymied inter-Korean relations for the past 25 years, and reorient Korea’s official policy, which currently aims at political reconciliation before institutional integration. He added that the logic of unification should progress from an ethnicity-based concept to an inclusive citizenship, reflecting Korea’s multicultural social transition. By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","refugees for his new book ,new book the irish peace ,korean refugees for his new ,irish embassy on tuesday hosted ,his new book the irish","['Korea', 'Korea', 'Northern Ireland ’s', 'the Irish Embassy', 'Kim Jung - ro', 'the Settlement Support Center', 'north Korean Refugees', 'Kim Jung - ro', 'Irish', ""Alngeal O'Donoghue"", 'korean', 'U.K.', 'Ra Jong - il', 'the Irish Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea', 'Ireland', 'Britain', 'Northern Ireland ’s', 'british', 'irish', 'Ireland', 'Korea', 'irish', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Irish', 'Aingeal', 'northern irish', 'Norman', 'Ireland', 'british', 'Protestants', 'Irish', 'Catholics', 'Ireland', 'northern irish', 'british', 'northern irish', 'british', 'John Hume', 'Social democratic', 'Labour Party', 'republican', 'Sinn Fein', 'Northern Ireland', 'the Korea Herald', 'Ireland', 'Northern Ireland', 'british', 'irish', 'U.S.', 'European Union , Finland', 'irish', 'irish', 'Ireland', 'Kim', 'the Ministry of Unification', 'the Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'Columbia University', 'the University of Cambridge', 'Korean', 'german', 'german', 'irish', 'Korea', 'Germany', 'the Soviet Union', 'Kim', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'Ireland', 'the Korean National Community Unification Formula', 'Kim', 'irish', 'the North - South Ministerial Council', 'the Joint Secretariat', 'british', 'irish', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'inter - korean', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29715705  0.22511819

Considering that Koreans mainly blogged in 2009 and have since gone to Twitter to communicate with others online, the research team studied both blog posts and tweets associated with the flu pandemic and MERS to find out the trends in discussions of the diseases. The most-mentioned figures on Twitter from May 20 to June 18, at the height of the local MERS outbreak, were President Park Geun-hye and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, rather than health-related officials, the report showed.The two have exchanged criticism over the handling of the outbreak since the mayor revealed in early June that a confirmed MERS patient might have exposed more than 1,500 Seoul citizens to the deadly virus. Mayor Park publicly blasted the government’s failure to monitor suspected MERS patients and hiding key information from the public and municipalities, vowing to find its “own ways” to protect Seoul residents. President Park, however, lashed out at the mayor, saying municipalities’ independent actions could add to public confusion. The conservative ruling Saenuri party also accused the liberal mayor of spreading “false” rumors. Eight out the 10 most-mentioned names on Twitter were politicians. Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo was ranked seventh. The result drew a clear contrast from how the people responded to the swine flu pandemic of 2009. The disease infected about 760,000 Koreans and claimed 263 lives until it abated a year later. During the 2009 flu pandemic, the most-mentioned person on blogs from April 28 to Sep. 2 was Park Seung-chul, then-leader of the government’s task force to fight the epidemic.Dr. Kim Woo-joo, the head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, took the No. 2 spot at the time, followed by Jeon Jae-hee, then-minister of health and welfare, and Lee Jong-gu, a former director of South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Key politicians made it into the 10 most circulated names, but ranked lower down than health-related figures. Former President Roh Moo-hyun was the fifth most-mentioned name, followed by then-President Lee Myung-bak and U.S. President Barack Obama. Back then, Koreans mainly made comments about the disease itself, with such words as prevention, vaccine, infection, influenza and virus being the most-used words on blogs. Professor Yoo, who led the research, pointed to a lack of communication between the government and the public as the reason behind the stark difference in Koreans’ way of viewing the 2009 flu pandemic and the MERS outbreak. “As citizens saw signs of lacking communication in responding to the MERS crisis, compared to the 2009 epidemic, they turned to politicians taking charge of managing crisis,” Yoo noted. The researchers also found that information about MERS-affected hospitals was spread on Twitter before it was made public by the government. From May 28, tweets that read “Don’t go to Yeouido St. Mary’s Hospital for a while” were circulating until the hospital in question officially announced on May 31 that a confirmed MERS patient had been detected at its facilities. Saying that the information could spark public panic, health authorities declined to name the hospitals that had confirmed MERS patients. It finally revealed the list on June 7 amid growing public calls for the information.Information about Samsung Medical Center, which has been the biggest source of MERS contagion to date, also went available on Twitter two days before the hospital made public that it had a confirmed MERS patient in its emergency room. “Netizens seemed to actively exchange information about MERS-stricken hospitals to refrain from going to the facilities, which we think in part contributed to preventing additional infections,” the research team said. MERS has killed 33 people in Korea, with more than 186 diagnosed as of Sunday, since the nation reported its first case in May. Korea has seen the biggest outbreak of MERS outside Saudi Arabia, where the virus was first discovered in 2012.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","koreans mainly blogged in 2009 ,politics than the deadly virus ,social media to learn koreans ,barack obama back then koreans ,2009 flu pandemic the most","['South Koreans', 'Seoul National University', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Koreans', 'Park Seung - chul', 'Kim Woo - joo', 'the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases', 'Jeon Jae - hee', 'Lee Jong - gu', 'South Korea ’s', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Koreans', 'Yoo', 'Koreans', 'Yoo', 'Yeouido St. Mary ’s Hospital', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'netizen', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Saudi Arabia']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5463509   0.76215845

The country's death toll from the viral disease stands at 33. The hospital owned by the country's top conglomerate has been blamed for nearly half of all infections here since MERS first broke out on May 20. The medical center is currently shut down indefinitely. The latest contraction follows a diagnosis of a nurse at the same hospital confirmed a day earlier, stoking concerns that the disease at the facility appears far from containment. A total of 13 medical staff members from the hospital have caught the virus. Out of the 185 people diagnosed with MERS, 41 remain hospitalized while 11 of them are in critical condition, according to ministry officials. So far, 111 have been discharged following complete recoveries. The number of those who remain in isolation sharply dropped overnight to 1,434 as of early Saturday from 2,067. They have been separated for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients. Over 16,000 people have been subject to isolation as suspected cases so far while some 14,700 of them have been released after they showed no symptoms of MERS for the known maximum incubation period of 14 days for the disease.MERS is a viral respiratory disease first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The fatality rate of the disease had been tallied at over 40 percent until the outbreak here as there is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.In South Korea, the fatality rate of the disease remains at around 18 percent.

All the energy generated by the wind farms, which are expected to be officially commissioned in 2016 or 2017, will be supplied to the reclusive state, the report said. It also noted the possibility of further exports to South Korea and Japan.The project to generate wind power for the electricity-scarce North came as the two countries have been struggling to cope with international isolation. Russia has been under criticism from the West for its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula last year while the North has been under sanctions for its nuclear and missile development.The international community has carefully watched the development of Pyongyang-Moscow relations with concerns that the bilateral cooperation could undermine the international efforts to persuade the North to denuclearize.The North Korean regime has been in desperate need of outside assistance to shore up its debilitated economy and secure public support to strengthen the young leader’s political legitimacy. After the deterioration of its ties with South Korea and China, the two core providers of economic aid, the North apparently turned its policy attention to Russia.

They are participating in a mid-career training program – the Korea Study Tour -- launched in 2007. The 11-day tour comprises morning lectures and afternoon trips that delve into Korea’s material and institutional development, covering administration, governance, e-government, reforms, health care, education, finance, infrastructure, green growth and human resources. From left: LG CNS vice president Lee Eung-joon; Prem Singh, deputy director of the LBSNAA Indian civil service training center; Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami; Hong Taek-chun, dean of the Korea Development Institute; and Mahindra Korea country director Dilip Sundaram pose at a reception for Indian Administration Service officers on the E-Land Cruise on Wednesday in Seoul. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The participants will visit the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Incheon Bridge, Korea Railroad Corporation, Boramae Medical Center, Korean Eco-friendly Rural Village, Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation and Seongdong Technical High School, among other places. The tour was organized by the Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management, with members of the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) participating. At the opening reception on the E-Land Cruise on the Han River on Wednesday, Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami encouraged the officers to reenergize the India-Korea partnership following Prime Minister Modi’s visit in mid-May. “When Indians think about Korea, the words discipline, dedication and organization come to mind,” the ambassador said in a speech. “Within our relevant international context, very few countries have such a perfect match as Korea, in terms of our complementary needs and capacities.”  Officers of the Indian Administration Service got onboard a cruise along the Han River on Wednesday as part of a training program organized by the KDI School of Public Policy and Administration. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)LBSNAA deputy director Prem Singh said the program had been both “educational and inspirational.” “Korea has been particularly inspirational to us, as you have rapidly developed from poverty,” Singh told The Korea Herald. “As Korea was economically similar in the 1970s and 80s to today’s India, we believe we can also make it happen as an Asian country.”The IAS officers are tasked with transforming India’s once-planned economy to a market economy, as well as harmonizing economic growth and sustainable development, according to the KDI. Government innovation, responsible policymaking and execution were listed priorities. The deputy director said Korea’s lessons could be implemented in India, although the two countries had vastly different sizes and issues. “Korea’s government and market are big enough that we can benchmark your expertise and experience,” he pointed out, adding that the participating provincial officers will in future take various posts in federal ministries.  Officers of the Indian Administration Service got onboard a cruise along the Han River on Wednesday as part of a training program organized by the KDI School of Public Policy and Administration. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Singh explained that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has maintained a “smooth and liberal” relationship with the bureaucracy, allowing innovation of the elephantine institution. “Our Prime Minister interacts with bureaucrats at all levels, from junior to senior positions, and we are very enthused to work with him. Our relationship will bring positive results,” he underscored. Modi has also made efforts to include diverse social strata into the economy through his “Make in India” and “Clean India” policies, aimed at cultivating the manufacturing sectors and improving public health. Noting India’s democratic system, he added that it was necessary to compromise the competing demands of communities and parties. “We are a very heterogeneous society,” Singh said. “India has consciously and rightly chosen a strategy of taking everyone onboard. Taking care of everyone is the bureaucrats’ primary responsibility.”Regarding the rigid caste social structure, which has bound India for thousands of years, Singh said the wave of economic globalization and liberalization of the early 1990s, along with education, have led to a change of mindset. “People don’t go by caste as much as they used to,” he noted. “Fulfilling your dream is more possible nowadays. The caste has given way to the market, where the money is.”By Joel Lee(joel@heraldcorp.com)","servants visited korea last week ,cruise on wednesday in seoul ,korea last week to benchmark ,staying in korea from june ,the korea study tour launched","['indian', 'Korea', 'the Indian Administration Service', 'Korea', 'the Korea Study Tour', 'Korea', 'Lee Eung - joon', 'Prem Singh', 'LBSNAA indian', 'indian', 'Vikram Doraiswami', 'Hong Taek - chun', 'the Korea Development Institute', 'Mahindra Korea', 'Dilip Sundaram', 'Indian Administration Service', 'the E - Land Cruise', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Incheon Bridge', 'Korea Railroad Corporation', 'Boramae Medical Center', 'Korean Eco - friendly', 'Rural Village', 'Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation', 'Seongdong Technical High School', 'the Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management', 'Lal', 'Shastri National Academy of Administration', 'the E - Land Cruise', 'indian', 'Vikram Doraiswami', 'India', 'Korea', 'Indians', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Indian Administration Service', 'the KDI School of Public Policy and Administration', 'Joel Lee', 'Prem Singh', 'Korea', 'Singh', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'India', 'asian', 'IAS', 'India', 'KDI', 'Korea', 'India', 'Korea', 'the Indian Administration Service', 'the KDI School of Public Policy and Administration', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea', 'Narendra Modi', 'India', 'Singh', 'India', 'India', 'Singh']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30981404  0.59816295

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)In an interview with The Korea Herald on Thursday, Chaima said that his country hoped Korea could contribute in education and health, while pointing to unexplored trade and investment opportunities. “Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, despite having gained independence more than five decades ago. I came to Korea on behalf of our country and people, as we could not leave the task to the government,” Chaima said. Chaima is a board member of Sanitation and Water for All, a global organization dedicated to providing water, sanitation and hygiene services to places in need.  Members of the Korea-Malawi Friendship Society pose at the inaugural ceremony at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (International Development Consulting Group)The director pointed out to his country’s stable political and social environment as strong incentives for Korean investment. The country’s multiparty electoral democracy was established in 1993 and, unlike many other conflict-ridden regions in Africa, Malawians resolve differences through dialogue, he said. English is an official language in Malawi, a former British colony, and the country has friendly relations with most Western countries. The Malawian government has started an anticorruption drive to improve the transparency of governance and rule of law. Chaima expressed his desire to provide quality education for Malawi’s young students, improve the public health system plagued by HIV, establish Africa’s development, finance, science and technology institutes in Malawi and lure Korean investment. Malawi has abundant water from Lake Malawi and the Shire River, ideal for shipbuilding, tourism and fishing. Lee Kyung-soo, the chairman of the International Development Consulting Group, said Malawi had cheap labor, agricultural produce and a safe society, ideal for foreign investment. China and Japan have built factories, schools and infrastructure in Malawi, Lee added. Health care, education, agriculture, science, technology, energy and mining are priority areas for investment, Chaima pointed out. He secured an agreement with the Seoul National University of Science and Technology for scholarship and student exchange programs, which will start next year. By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","malawi visited korea to participate ,korea herald on thursday chaima ,restoration plan malawi visited korea ,society last week leading malawian ,plan malawi visited korea to","['Malawi', 'Korea', 'the Korea - Malawi Friendship Society', 'malawian', 'George Chaima', 'New Restoration Plan Malawi', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'the Korea International Cooperation Agency', 'George Chaima', 'New Restoration Plan Malawi', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Chaima', 'Korea', 'Malawi', 'Korea', 'Chaima', 'Chaima', 'Sanitation and Water for all', 'the Korea - Malawi Friendship Society', 'the National Assembly', 'International Development Consulting', 'korean', 'Malawians', 'Malawi', 'british', 'western', 'malawian', 'Chaima', 'Malawi ’s', 'Malawi', 'korean', 'Malawi', 'Malawi', 'Lee Kyung - soo', 'the International Development Consulting Group', 'Malawi', 'China', 'Japan', 'Malawi', 'Lee', 'Chaima', 'the Seoul National University of Science and Technology', 'Joel Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.551193    0.94110954

For starters and globetrotters alike, a visit to the Kerala state of southwestern India would be worth a try, Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami says. “Choosing one place over another is difficult and subjective, but I would recommend a holiday in Kerala for a perfect balance of culture, healing and scenery,” Doraiswami told The Korea Herald in an email interview. “An itinerary can include a cruise along the backwaters in a private boat, pampered with fresh seafood and hospitable care. You can heal your mind and body with a traditional massage and spa.” Endowed with serene shorelines, tranquil backwaters and tropical rainforests, Kerala is fast becoming an international tourist hotspot. It is home to the Ayurveda ― an alternative and traditional Hindu medicine that uses natural healing methods handed down over 5,000 years. “And the gentle and warm Kerala people know how to make visitors feel special,” according to the ambassador. The region has maintained a strong tradition of multiculturalism for millennia, being the hub of east- and westbound exchange in commerce, religion and science. Kerala attracted seafaring merchants from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, China and West Asia, who came in search of spices. Indian Ambassador Vikram Doraiswami (left) speaks beside Korea World Travel Fair president Hong Ju-min at the Korea World Travel Fair 2015 at Coex in Seoul on June 11. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Doraiswami’s most memorable trip to the southernmost region happened 23 years ago with his colleagues. “We were all young and fresh university graduates on our first job. We felt both empowered by the small cash in our pockets and being free adults on a holiday,” Doraiswami said. “On the sunset beaches lined with palm trees, we enjoyed our cold beer and fresh grilled seafood laced with coriander and coconut. We also watched traditional dances performed on the site of ancient temples.” Doraiswami has been back to Kerala several times on work, he added, while noting that “the magic of that particular holiday remains special” in his memory. Kerala has high rates of human development in India, with literacy, life expectancy and gender ratio scores topping the national charts. It is one of the least corrupt states in the country with a vibrant media scene. Kerala’s airports are linked with those of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore or Chennai. Doraiswami, 45, who arrived in Korea in April, said being an ambassador here made his “dream come true.” He started his career as a journalist before joining the Foreign Service in 1992. “Apart from the enormous and unfulfilled economic agenda that needs to be realized between our countries, there is a great deal of cultural exchange to be promoted,” he emphasized. “India has one of the world’s most diverse cultures in every sense, due to its sundry geography, climate, society and religion.”India offers Korean visitors a distinct and exotic experience “within the overall comfort zone that our shared Asian cultural traditions provide us,” Doraiswami said. The ambassador plans to increase two-way flights, youth exchange and media partnerships between the two countries. He also aims to invite Indian movie directors to shoot Bollywood films at popular Korean hangouts, which would generate a sizeable tourism interest from India. So far, Doraiswami has visited Daejon, Busan and Ulsan all on “incredibly busy” business trips, but said he would like to tour temples, mountains and islands in Korea. “Indian travelers will enjoy the mix of cutting-edge modernity and well-preserved heritage that Korea offers,” he pointed out, adding that his compatriots can start from Seoul and Busan, and later explore Korea’s rural areas. By Joel Lee(joel@heraldcorp.com)","sizeable tourism interest from india ,holiday in kerala for perfect ,science kerala attracted seafaring merchants ,world travel fair president ,tropical rainforests kerala is fast","['India', 'Kerala', 'India', 'indian', 'Vikram Doraiswami', 'Kerala', 'Doraiswami', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kerala', 'Hindu', 'Kerala', 'Kerala', 'Greece', 'Rome', 'Egypt', 'China', 'indian', 'Vikram Doraiswami', 'Korea World Travel Fair', 'Hong Ju - min', 'the Korea World Travel', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea', 'Doraiswami', 'Doraiswami', 'Kerala', 'Kerala', 'India', 'Kerala', 'Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Chennai', 'Doraiswami', 'Korea', 'the Foreign Service', 'India', 'korean', 'asian', 'Doraiswami', 'indian', 'bollywood', 'korean', 'India', 'Doraiswami', 'Daejon', 'Busan', 'Korea', 'indian', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Korea']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78818071  0.65168738

During the process, the convenience store chain received monetary benefits from the existing VANs that initially wanted to maintain their contracts but later balked when the demand became excessive, it said.The watchdog said the two VANs had accepted the change to their contracts in September 2010, which required them to pay 3.5 billion won over seven years, but when Ministop asked for the signing of a revised arrangement just five months later, they rejected the call and had their contracts terminated.The FTC said it has also asked state prosecutors to launch a criminal investigation into the case. The watchdog said the latest action against Ministop Korea will send a warning to large retail chains that have been cited in the past for exploiting VAN companies.

Kim Young-sun stressed that Korea’s evolving relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations is vital given the bloc’s geopolitical value and growth potential and the ramifications of its ongoing integration efforts, not to mention the two sides’ complementary economies.“ASEAN needs us and we, South Korea, need ASEAN. I would like to portray the bilateral partnership as one sharing a ‘common destiny.’ We’d better not think of it just as a group residing in a different region,” Kim, the center’s secretary-general, told The Korea Herald this week.“The two sides have no historical or political tensions, and there is no need for them to get mired in any war of nerves for national pride or anything, as their relations are complementary. In addition, we share Asian values and cultural common ground,” he added.  Kim Young-sun, secretary-general of the ASEAN-Korea Center, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald. (Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald)Taking the helm of the institution in March after some 35 years of diplomatic service, Kim has prioritized fostering trust between South Korea and ASEAN, which he highlighted as a critical element in forging a “mutually beneficial, substantive and sustainable” partnership.The foremost thing to do to build mutual trust is to accurately understand each other, Kim said, underscoring the center will focus on removing Koreans’ “misperceptions” about ASEAN and help them better understand it. ASEAN consists of the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.“To build trust, you should first know the other side ― its cultural and social characteristics, and other basic things about it,” he said, noting the image of the fast-growing and economically vibrant ASEAN is still eclipsed by the negative image ― associated largely with illegal migrants here, only a fraction of ASEAN’s population of 625 million.“ASEAN is not what it used to be a decade ago or so. It has made great strides in the direction of integration and technological development ― despite initial worries over their development gaps and other differences ― under their vision of ‘unity in diversity’ and ‘connectivity’ efforts.”In recent years, the center has initiated a variety of programs, such as holding various lectures and forums on ASEAN, cultural exhibitions, tourism fairs and youth exchange events ― a reason why it has emerged as a core conduit to improve mutual understanding. Launched in March 2009, the center has also made a series of publications such as “Korea’s Changing Roles in Southeast Asia” and “Understanding ASEAN through 4Cs (ASEAN Charter, Community, Connectivity and Centrality).”These programs and publications reflect Seoul’s growing policy attention to ASEAN, which will become a giant integrated group boasting the world’s third-largest population, $2.4 trillion in gross domestic product and strategic locations linking the Indo-Pacific region hosting the world’s most crucial trading and energy supply routes.At the end of this year, the bloc plans to launch the “ASEAN Community” consisting of economic, socio-cultural and politico-security pillars, all of which aim to deepen the bloc’s integration and contribute to the region’s peace and stability.“The launch of the community slated for the end of this year would not bring about an abrupt, drastic change, but it can be a milestone in the integration of ASEAN and also in the development of the East Asian region as a whole,” he said.“The transformation is an ongoing process, which has been happening and is happening now, and will continue beyond 2015. ASEAN is taking a far-sighted view rather than seeking immediate gains under its motto of One Vision, One Identity and One Community.”Korea is not the only one to beef up policy efforts to cement ties with ASEAN amid its stepped-up integration endeavors ― the reason Korea needs a more strategic policy vision, the secretary-general pointed out. The U.S. is seeking to court it with the so-called “rebalancing” policy, while China seeks to strengthen ties with the bloc with its “One Belt One Road” initiative. India is also pushing its “Act East” foreign policy drive to deepen its partnership with the fast-developing group.“Korea should keep a watch on the changing contours of the Southeast Asian region which major powers and industrial leaders are scurrying to court,” Kim said, pointing out that Seoul needs to have a well-thought-out strategic policy direction.“Just sticking to the way Korea has dealt with the ASEAN, Korea could lose economic and other opportunities.”Entering diplomatic service in 1977, Kim has served in various domestic and overseas positions including those in Indonesia, Japan, Lebanon, Egypt, Israel and the U.S. He also served as the Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson between 2009 and 2011.Kim obtained a bachelor’s degree in politics from Seoul National University in 1978 and master’s degree in politics from Keio University in Tokyo in 1991.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","korea needs more strategic policy ,we south korea need asean ,reason korea needs more strategic ,korea need asean would like ,korea needs more strategic","['South Korea ’s', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Kim Young - sun', 'Korea', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'South Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'asian', 'Kim Young - sun', 'ASEAN', 'Korea Center', 'the Korea Herald', 'Ahn Hoon', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Singapore', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Brunei', 'Vietnam', 'Laos', 'Myanmar', 'Cambodia', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Seoul', 'ASEAN', 'the Indo - Pacific region', 'ASEAN', 'east asian', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'India', 'southeast asian', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'ASEAN', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Indonesia', 'Japan', 'Lebanon', 'Egypt', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'the Foreign Ministry ’s', 'Seoul National University', 'Keio University', 'Tokyo', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.56569815  0.53324735

The 26-year-old from the Philippines had left her home country for the first time in hopes of becoming a singer and supporting her 3-month-old daughter. She started working the day she arrived in Korea, at a club near a U.S. military base in Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province. As an E-6-2 entertainment visa holder, Aquino thought she’d be singing at the club full time. But instead, she was forced to wear a revealing dress and “talk” to customers so they would purchase as many drinks as possible. The customers kept touching her against her will, but her boss simply said, “That’s what everyone has to deal with here.”From that day until she ran away with her colleagues in March, Aquino and her seven colleagues worked 12 hours daily, from 6:30 p.m. till 7 a.m. the next morning. Their Korean boss, whom they called “Papa,” held their passports, as well as their first two months of pay. They were eventually arrested on sex trade charges and detained after receiving deportation orders.Starting their third month, the women were each paid 400,000 won ($360) monthly. One of the women was never paid at all. During the day when they were not working, the women were locked in their rooms and needed permission to go out. “We would take turns and eat in the bathroom,” Aquino, who is filing a lawsuit against her boss, told The Korea Herald at a women’s shelter.But nothing was worse than being forced to provide sexual services to their customers, when one of them couldn’t sell 660,000 won of drinks in a week. (123rf)Often they would be forced by their boss to perform sexual acts in the club, or even agree to a “bar fine,” which meant going out with a customer away from the club for sex. Most of their customers were foreign laborers, many from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand and Turkey, although the club initially started as an exclusive place for American soldiers. “I’d just volunteer to touch (the customers) because it was better to touch than being touched,” she said. Controversial E-6 VisaAquino, who currently stays at a shelter with three of her colleagues, is one of some 4,500 foreign workers who arrive in Korea with the notorious E-6 Entertainment Visa each year. The visa is issued to foreign athletes and dancers and singers who wish to work in tourist hotels, bars and clubs in Korea. Yet according to last year’s survey by the National Human Rights Commission, 70 percent of female E-6 holders have experienced sexual abuse at least once during their stay here. Many of them become victims of sex trafficking.In spite of the visa’s reputation, the number of E-6 holders increased from 4,246 in 2011 to 4,940 in 2013. The number of E-6 visa holders who eventually became illegal immigrants has risen as well, from 1,446 to 1,504. The government estimates that about 70 percent of the current E-6 holders are from the Philippines. For Aquino, Korea was a land of opportunities. Back home in Cagayan de Oro, she worked as a telemarketer while singing part time for events such as weddings.Aquino, who holds a degree in hotel management, earned about 250,000 won a month. It sounded promising to go to Korea and sing full time. That way, she could support her 3-month-old daughter better, she thought. After a few sessions with brokers and singing in front of officers at the Korean consulate to “prove her vocal skills,” she left her baby to her ex-boyfriend to move to Korea. Before leaving the Philippines, without telling her why, her brokers deftly glued together two pages of her passport, hiding her E-6 visa before they took two layovers in Iloilo, in the Philippines, and Hong Kong.“I asked them why we aren’t taking a direct flight to Seoul, and they just said because it’s cheaper to (take multiple flights),” Aquino said. It was only after she came to Korea that Aquino learned about the existence of the Overseas Employment Certificate issued by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. Under current Filipino laws, those who have obtained an E-6 visa from the Korean government must obtain the OEC in order to leave the Philippines. Those with the E-6 but without the OEC are banned from leaving the Philippines at all international ports in the country. Getting an E-6 visa from the Korean authorities without an OEC, however, is no problem.“Many brokers use a simple trick of sticking two passport pages together at the airport in the Philippines,” said Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer who represents Aquino and her colleagues. It is believed to be a frequently used tactic by the brokers to fly out with the women in the Philippines as tourists, thereby not needing an OEC, and then enter Korea with an E-6 visa.“I believe the OEC is only issued when the government of the Philippines has verified that the Korean workplace is safe and legitimate after an inspection by their Seoul-based officers. I think the Filipino government is working hard to protect its citizens, but it should work with its Korean counterpart so such brokers can’t maneuver around the system so easily,” said Kim.None of the four women staying at the shelter said they knew anything about the OEC before leaving the Philippines. Trisha Ramos, one of the four, still remembers the moment that made her feel utterly helpless while staying at the detention center.“I called the Embassy of the Philippines (in Seoul) for help,” she said. “They said they cannot help me because I’m illegal ― because I don’t have the OEC.”Abuse after abuse When one of the customers offered Anne Navarro a job opportunity in January, she like felt she had nothing to lose. The 23-year-old had been working at the club since October, and had just been forced to do her first “bar fine.” Whenever she and her colleagues refused to do sex work, their boss would verbally abuse them with explicit words, or threaten to “take you and bury you in the mountains.”The customer was a worker from Sri Lanka who was at first kind to Navarro. One day in January, he told her he would arrange a job interview for her once Navarro moved in with him. When she did, he changed completely, locked her in his house and physically abused her. Navarro’s boss eventually tracked her down, took her back and told her she now had to work for free as she damaged his business by running away. From October until March, Navarro was never paid.Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan man held a grudge against Navarro’s Korean boss, who sued him for kidnapping Navarro. As a regular visitor to the club, he knew well about the illegal sex services that were happening behind doors. In revenge, he reported Navarro’s boss to the police for violating the country’s antiprostitution laws. On March 2, police officers visited the club and encountered the women. But the women had already been trained by the boss to say certain things to the police. That day, the women denied being forced to offer sex. They, however, managed to get their passports back from the boss through the police.“(The boss) said if we reported him to the police, it would only put us in trouble. I didn’t know anyone (in Korea) and I had no one to trust. I didn’t know if I should trust the officers (either), especially when my boss was right beside me when I was asked with questions,” said Aquino.On March 9, with their regained passports, the women ran away from the club. The police managed to track down closed-circuit television footage of the women providing sexual services. The women were all eventually arrested in early April under illegal sex trade charges. Soon after, Ramos went back to the club in handcuffs with the officers and showed them where the illegal sex services took place. “I was with my boyfriend when I was being arrested,” said Ramos, who still has nightmares about the experience. “He kept asking the officers if I could hire a lawyer. They said no and just took me away.”Detention center and second traumaMia Mendoza was admitted to Hwaseong Detention Center in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, on April 7, after receiving a deportation order along with Aquino and Navarro. Ramos joined them two days later.The facility is where foreign nationals who have been ordered to leave the country stay. Refugee applicants stay there, too. Most people are deported after two to three months. But sometimes the wait can take years.Until they met their lawyer Kim, who was provided by a nongovernmental organization, they had been sharing a single bar of soap with 15 other detainees and only eating eggs and kimchi, while being required to sit straight and only watch TV from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m.After several grueling weeks, the women were released from the center on May 20 and were granted permission to stay in the country until their appeal against the deportation order was completed. Still, the women are soon to be indicted on charges of illegal sex trade by the prosecution.“Once they are indicted, they will have to relive the first trauma all over again (as they’ll have to testify during the trials),” said Kim.“The biggest problem right now is that the prosecutor doesn’t identify the women as victims, and never recognized that they may have been coerced or forced into such situations.”Unlike the prosecution in Korea, Kim said, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses its “trafficking indicators” to identify and rescue trafficking victims. The indicators include: “Is the victim in possession of identification and travel documents?” and “Was the victim coached on what to say to law enforcement and immigration officials?” Another indicator states: “Has the victim been threatened with harm if the victim attempts to escape?”The women are filing charges against their boss and the Korean man who arranged for their trip to Korea for human trafficking and forcing them into sex work. Kim is also reporting their case to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.He said the police and the Korea Immigration Service failed to acknowledge the women as potential trafficking victims, only recognizing them as foreign criminals.Those who receive the deportation order are required to be detained, while those who are banned from leaving the country cannot go overseas until permission is granted. Kim said this was a convenient way to practically imprison them indefinitely, so they can investigate the case without having to worry about them escaping.“They had to be protected, not detained, while facing deportation orders,” he said. “And they can only be truly protected when they stay here until they see justice done. At the same time, they have the right to pursue their lawsuit without being detained. If they are deported, they will have to live with this trauma forever.”‘What’s illegal is illegal’Park Jong-cheol, a lieutenant at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, is one of the officers who dealt with the case of the four women. In response to Kim’s accusations, Park said if the women spoke honestly on March 2, the day the first investigation took place, the police wouldn’t have arrested them. He said he is unsure if the women indeed had been planning to return to the Philippines after running away from the club.Park stressed the women’s status had already been illegal from the minute they escaped the club, as it is legally banned for E-6 holders to leave their workplace without reporting to their employer. “As an investigator it’s your job to question everything. Literally everything,” he said. “You can’t assume everything your suspects tell you is true.”He said the women told him during the investigation that the last thing they wanted was to be sent back to the Philippines. The officer said he has seen many female foreign workers stay in Korea as illegal residents as long as they can ― practically until they get caught ― to make money to support their families back home. “I think the main issue was the money,” he said. “It seemed like they were the breadwinners of their families back home. But whatever the motives and reasons are, what’s illegal is illegal. Some people say it’s harsh, but jobs like mine need to follow the rules.”Combating modern slavery Last year, South Korea ranked 49th in the Global Slavery Index, in terms of people in modern slavery in absolute numbers, among 167 countries released by Australia’s Walk Free Foundation.According to the report, some 93,700 people are estimated to be trapped in modern slavery ― such as human trafficking, debt bondage, sex slavery and forced migration or marriage ― in the country. Poverty is known to be among several factors contributing to the commercial exploitation of people for both cheap labor and the sex industry in Asia, as well as forced migration and human trafficking. All of the four women, all in their early or mid-20s, were never married but had children to support back home, on top of their parents and siblings. Every month, Aquino would send 250,000 won out of her 400,000 won of monthly pay to her family and her ex, who raises their daughter alone in the Philippines. Mendoza would also wire 200,000 won to her family every month. It was half of her exploited salary, but it would still be more than her four-member family’s household income back home. Korea’s stipulated minimum wage is 5,580 won, meaning the women should have been paid at least 1.34 million won a month by their employer for working 12 hours daily and five days a week. Park Mi-hyung, head of the International Organization for Migration’s Seoul office, said government officials, especially those who work in the immigration office, should be educated on victim identification, especially when giving out deportation orders to foreign laborers. She also said the authorities should have a fundamental debate on whether or not the E-6 visa should continue to exist in the face of the frequently reported cases related to human sex trafficking. “A lot of the people who migrate to another country (to work) don’t have a lot of options back home. A lot of the times, it is their last resort to survive,” she said. “What we need is a system where all foreign workers can arrive and work in Korea with adequate legal protection, where they can earn their wages without being exploited during their stay here.”Aquino, who was visibly hopeful during the interview, said she still hopes to sing in Korea one day. While the women were working at the club, although initially hired as singers, they almost never performed during their stay there.“We would only sing when we are by ourselves alone, when all of our customers are gone,” she said. “What I want is to do what I was originally told to do before coming here, to sing.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com) All names of the victims have been changed upon request.―Ed.","boyfriend to move to korea ,supporting her month old daughter ,next morning their korean boss ,korea herald at women shelter ,slavery last year south korea","['South Korea', 'Tessa Aquino', 'Philippines', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Dongducheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Aquino', 'Aquino', 'korean', 'Aquino', 'the Korea Herald', 'Sri Lanka', 'Bangladesh', 'Thailand', 'Turkey', 'american', 'E-6 VisaAquino', 'Korea', 'e-6 Entertainment Visa', 'Korea', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'e-6', 'e-6', 'e-6', 'Philippines', 'Aquino', 'Korea', 'Cagayan de Oro', 'Aquino', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Philippines', 'e-6', 'Iloilo', 'Philippines', 'Hong Kong', 'Seoul', 'Aquino', 'Korea', 'Aquino', 'the Overseas Employment Certificate', 'the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration', 'e-6', 'korean', 'OEC', 'Philippines', 'OEC', 'Philippines', 'e-6', 'korean', 'OEC', 'Philippines', 'Kim Jong - chul', 'Aquino', 'Philippines', 'OEC', 'Korea', 'e-6', 'OEC', 'Philippines', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Filipino', 'korean', 'Kim', 'OEC', 'Philippines', 'Trisha Ramos', 'Seoul', 'Anne Navarro', 'Sri Lanka', 'Navarro', 'Navarro', 'Navarro', 'Navarro', 'Sri Lankan', 'Navarro ’s', 'korean', 'Navarro', 'Navarro', 'Korea', 'Aquino', 'Ramos', 'Ramos', 'traumaMia Mendoza', 'Hwaseong Detention Center', 'Hwaseong , Gyeonggi Province', 'Aquino', 'Navarro', 'Ramos', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'the U.N.

They are fed, groomed and catered to at a degree many less fortunate humans would envy.Dog hotels and a variety of beauty services from hair salons to nail shops are flourishing here. Some pooches are considered to be more than companions, becoming partners in fighting crime and assistants to the blind. Dogs today even have their own TV programs. Smart gadgets are designed to monitor their health or to automatically vacuum dog hair around the house. With the growing number of single-person households, whether they be widowed seniors or lifetime bachelors, dogs have become faithful companions, often without the hassle that comes with engaging other humans.The market size of the pet business is expected to grow to 6 trillion won ($5.4 billion) by 2020, according to research by the Nonghyup Economic Research Institute. About one in five households currently owns a dog or cat, local reports say.But not all dogs have it so good. Many are abused, abandoned and even butchered. The commercial popularity of dogs has bloated the number of those being bred, creating an image of dogs as disposable pets. More than 80,000 dogs are abandoned each year, particularly in summer. As their owners jet off on summer vacations, their pets are left to die or sequestered at overcrowded shelters. The government also spends more than 10 billion won a year to help abandoned animals find new homes and administer euthanasia for those failing to find one.Even on a less heavy note, clashes continue between those who cherish dogs as they would their own children and those who stigmatize them as being inferior creatures that can be sacrificed on a whim. The relatively young culture of cohabiting with dogs has yet to be followed with cultural guidelines on how to behave with them in public or how to accept them as part of the community.A fierce debate also persists over Korea’s infamous dog-eating culture. Despite dog eating being a centuries-old custom, the diametric views of the animals as life companions and edible livestock doesn’t appear to be an issue likely to be settled in the near future.Nonetheless, dogs in Korea have come a long way since haggard hounds were tied up to a pole in the rugged front yard of a house.It is frowned upon if a dog is neglected or abused, something that most would have nonchalantly ignored just decades ago.The government is also jumping on the bandwagon to establish a more systematic management of the country’s growing canine population.Since mid-2014, it has required owners to register their pets with local governments and the agricultural ministry. The mandatory rule was designed to curb the number of abandoned pets and reduce the cost of rescuing and finding new homes for them. If someone fails to register their pets, the government could impose a fine of up to 400,000 won.In nearly a year since the measure was enacted, nearly 890,000 companion dogs or pets were registered with the Agriculture Ministry. Officials say there are millions more still unregistered. It may take a while to account for all the dogs kept in Korea, but the efforts are better late than never.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","korea infamous dog eating culture ,humans would envy dog hotels ,over korea infamous dog eating ,dog in korea for more ,korea infamous dog eating","['Korea', 'smart', 'the Nonghyup Economic Research Institute', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Agriculture Ministry', 'Korea', 'Cho Chung - un']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54254079  0.60227907

The rest have been urged to watch the opening show live from the video-sharing website YouTube.  ""Our festival is where sexual minorities in South Korea get to communicate with and instill morale in each another,"" Kang Myeong-jin, who is gay and head of the organizing committee, said. ""It's where we exhibit positive energy despite all the stigma we've faced.""  Kang's comments illustrated challenges facing people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in a country where the Confucian tradition is deeply ingrained.  In 2013, two South Korean male filmmakers tied the knot, marking the first public wedding in the country for a gay couple. Still, the two have been seeking to get legal status as South Korea does not recognize same-sex marriages.  In South Korea, homosexuality is criminalized only among soldiers, not civilians.  Christian groups have been staging rallies at Seoul Plaza, the intended venue of the festival, as this year marks the first time the event takes place so close to the heart of the city. Previous festivals had all taken place in Shinchon, a college neighborhood in western Seoul.  ""This festival has promoted indecent exposure and promiscuity in public for years,"" Kim Kwang-gyu, head of a coalition of Christian parents, said. ""We sincerely hope it stops taking place in South Korea.""  Police have also banned LGBT activists from parading around Seoul on June 28, the final day of the festival, much to the organizers' chagrin.  The Korea Queer Festival 2015 consists of four special events scattered throughout the next two weeks, a three-day film screening and culminates in a gay pride parade starting at Seoul Plaza.   South Korea, roughly a third of whose population is Christian, remains relatively closed off to sexual minorities.  In a Pew Research Center survey published in 2013, 39 percent of South Koreans said the society should accept LGBTs, compared with 59 percent of nay-sayers.

We don’t have specific details of the situation,” said an official from Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education. “The health authorities tell us nothing.”The complaint, if true, implied that the SMOE ― entrusted with the task of ensuring the well-being of all students attending public institutes in the city ― is being kept in the relative dark concerning students’ health status amid an ongoing outbreak. It sparked concerns about its capacity to properly deal with the MERS situation, after the country’s first student patient was confirmed earlier in the day.Although the ministry released a press release confirming that the teen patient ― a 16-year-old high schooler ― is attending a Seoul-based high school, the SMOE said it was not even sure of the relevant facts.The officials said they learned about the student patient by inquiring at the health center in Gangnam-gu, southern Seoul, where he was diagnosed with the disease. One SMOE official said that she learned other details of the teen patient in question through media reports that were collected in official documents ― which were used in turn to brief the media.“I looked it up in the news. The health authorities are not telling us anything,” she said. “Regarding MERS patients, neither the Education Ministry nor local education offices have due information. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and the Health Ministry hold the authorities. The ministry tells us the information about the patient,” said a high-ranking official from the Education Ministry.There have been concerns that such monopoly of information could be a recipe for disaster, as the local education office ― which has the authority to cancel classes at times of high risk of contagion ― is left in the dark about the MERS situation in schools.Under the current system, health authorities alert the patients with their diagnosis. Each student is to report his or her case to the school, which in turn reports it to local education offices. But there is no regulation that mandates students to report one’s case to the school, meaning the school ― and consequently the education offices ― runs the risk of not keeping accurate track of a possible MERS outbreak among its students.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","relative dark concerning students health ,schooler is attending seoul ,dark concerning students health status ,disaster as the local education ,the country first student patient","['the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'SMOE', 'Seoul', 'SMOE', 'Gangnam - gu', 'Seoul', 'SMOE', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control', 'the Health Ministry', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66225392  0.36802399

The Internet has rewoven the fabric of our daily lives ― how we communicate with each other, work and entertain ourselves ― and become a foundation of the global economy. Seemingly on a daily basis, new businesses that use the Internet as their foundation are disrupting and often replacing long-standing business models and industries. From music and video to communications and mail, more and more of our “offline” world is moving online.But every time we post a Facebook status to our friends, send a message via Line or WhatsApp or tweet to our followers, that information is housed in giant data centers that require a lot of electricity. These data centers are a key part of the cloud, and a single one can require as much energy as a medium-sized city. If the internet were a country, it would rank sixth in the world on the basis of how much electricity it uses, and the amount of data shuttling around the world is expected to triple in the next few years as more and more people get connected.The Internet we love, and the companies that run it, are at the crossroads in terms of where their energy comes from. For the past four years, Greenpeace has been working to challenge global Internet companies to build an Internet that is renewably powered, and have seen the start of a race among leading internet companies. Facebook became the first to commit to be 100 percent renewably powered, after 1,000,000 people asked the company to “Unfriend Coal” (2011), and Apple followed shortly thereafter in 2012 with its own commitment to move off of coal, in response to users around the world who asked Apple to clean its cloud. Along with Google, we have now seen a total of eight global Internet companies that have committed to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy. Many of these commitments are already having a big impact in making our world greener, both online and offline, as IT leaders use their influence with monopoly utilities and government officials to disrupt the dirty energy status quo and shift investment to renewable sources of electricity.Here is a great example. In 2012, Apple, Google and Facebook all had data centers in North Carolina, home of Duke Energy, the largest U.S. electric utility and almost entirely dependent on coal, natural gas and nuclear power. Because of their commitment to renewable energy, these companies were able to get Duke to commit to offering large customers the ability to buy renewable energy. And just this past month, these three tech giants sent a strongly worded letter to the heads of the state legislature expressing their shared concern about a bill that would roll back renewable energy policy, stating “the right and ability to access power from renewable resources is not merely a goal, but an expectation.” South Korea is in a similar situation, so what has driven Duke Energy can happen here. Able to claim the fastest broadband speeds in the world, Korea is already a major engine behind the rapidly growing Internet economy. As homegrown Internet powerhouses such as Naver and Daum Kakao rapidly expand across Asia and beyond, the importance of having Korean Internet companies enter the race to build a renewably powered Internet cannot be overstated. That’s why Naver’s announcement of its commitment to be 100 percent renewably powered is such an important step forward ― it’s the first Asian Internet giant to enter the global race to build an Internet that is renewably powered, and we certainly need other Korean IT leaders to make sure they are not the only one. This race is not a short one, and access to renewable electricity remains a significant hurdle in Korea and many countries in Asia. But as we have seen in the United States and elsewhere in the world, when IT leaders use their economic and political influence, they have the ability to shift even the most recalcitrant utilities to shift their investments toward renewable energy, at almost Internet-like speed. With the same commitment and leadership, Korean Internet giants can become a leading force not only in building an Internet that is renewably powered, but also opening the door for renewable energy in Korea and other major Asian markets.By Gary CookGary Cook has been Greenpeace’s Senior IT Analyst since 2009 and has over two decades of experience in government and corporate policy on climate and renewable energy, working with government officials and multinational corporations to strengthen policies to deploy energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions at the international, federal and state level.While with Greenpeace, Gary first successfully campaigned to secure commitments to 100 percent renewable energy from Facebook in 2011, Apple in 2012 and Amazon Web Services in 2014, and has worked to secure 100 percent renewable commitments from a total of four additional major Internet companies.","the rapidly growing internet economy ,four additional major internet companies ,global internet companies to build ,rapidly growing internet economy ,rapidly growing internet economy as","['WhatsApp', 'Greenpeace', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'North Carolina', 'Duke Energy', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Duke Energy', 'Korea', 'Daum Kakao', 'korean', 'Naver ’s', 'asian', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the United States', 'korean', 'Korea', 'asian', 'Gary CookGary Cook', 'Greenpeace ’s', 'Greenpeace', 'Gary first', 'Apple', 'Amazon Web Services']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.65879709  0.79313236

The health minister and elected leaders of four local city governments ― the Seoul and Daejeon mayors and the Gyeonggi and South Chungcheong provincial governors ― pledged to immediately form a working level consultative body and share information on concerned hospitals and patients. The ministry also decided to give the authority to cities to diagnose and confirm the contagious disease. So far, only the ministry authorities were permitted to confirm the MERS infection. “It has been difficult to contain the disease by only monitoring and tracing those who closely came into contact with the confirmed MERS patients (since the situation became serious). The ministry will provide reagents for disease detection to 17 local health organizations where gene tests are available,” said Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo. The move came after the discordant MERS responses of the central government and municipalities caused public confusion. Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung in Gyeonggi Province on Sunday unilaterally released the personal information of a suspected MERS patient ― the address, workplace and the school name of the patient’s children ― on his Facebook to raise the alert, Lee said. Lee’s independent move, however, stirred controversy as it was posted without consulting education authorities. Last Thursday, the office of Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon also vowed to make its own moves against the MERS outbreak after it found out that a doctor at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul put more than 1,500 residents in danger of contracting the disease by attending three public events. Park claimed that the information of the confirmed doctor was released only after the city held a meeting with the ministry authorities. He urged the central government to open up the MERS information to cities to better fight the spread of the disease.The confirmed doctor, however, refuted, saying that the he had attended only two events while the virus was in the incubation period, adding that the city did not correctly check the facts. He also criticized the city government for decrying him as an immoral doctor. Cheong Wa Dae also expressed regrets over the Seoul mayor’s unilateral move, saying such action could only worsen public fear over MERS. Seoul Mayor Park fired back at the central government, saying that an excessive response is better than belated action. Meanwhile, Seoul City strengthened disinfection measures on public transportation and increased medical staff to quickly respond to suspected MERS cases. The city also urged the public to cancel or postpone large civic events to prevent possible infection.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","health and municipalities vowed sunday ,municipalities vowed sunday to strengthen ,patients the ministry also decided ,and municipalities vowed sunday ,doctor at samsung medical","['the Ministry of Health', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi', 'Health', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'Dae', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Seoul City', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15867341  0.63429314

In an opening speech, Moon Chang-yong, South Korea's deputy finance minister of tax and customs, said that sharing knowledge and experience is a win-win strategy that can contribute to better fiscal balance as well as stimulating the economy.While tax reforms are primarily carried out at the national level, there is a need for greater international sharing and cooperation.""In particular, a large number of multinational enterprises have been taking advantage of differences in tax laws of each country to shift profits to non-tax or low-tax jurisdictions,"" Moon said.Under such circumstances, improving the tax system of a single nation will not prevent cases of offshore tax evasion, he said.The conference has brought together some 70 tax officials from the World Bank, the IMF, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Vietnam, Thailand and other Asian countries.

Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would replace the rides at Seoul Land in Seoul Grand Park with electricity-zero rides by 2020. The rides will be run by manpower with a minimal amount of electricity, allowing children to physically play like those in German theme park Ketteler Hof. The amusement park will offer eight types of eco-playgrounds where children can interact with various things ranging from water and wood to animals.This is part of the city’s project to renovate Seoul Grand Park. The park, which opened in 1984 in Gwacheon, south of Seoul, consists of the 820,000-square-meter-large Seoul Land, a 2.4 square-kilometer zoo and a small camping site for visitors. Seoul Land opened four years after the park, in 1988. Along with the amusement park renovation, the zoo will be separated from Seoul Grand Park and integrated with the Seoul Children’s Park zoo in the east of the capital in the future, the city said. A special zone for saving endangered species and native animals will be constructed in the zoo. As part of the efforts to boost animal welfare, the city will gradually stop exhibiting the animals in cages and push for quasi-natural habitats, it added. To attract more visitors, the city will build a “forest for healing” in the 4-square-kilometer vacant area in Seoul Grand Park. Various walking routes, gardens and a meditation center will be feature at the site, officials said.The city will also offer a private tour program for small groups of zoo visitors and provide accommodation facilities, they added.

Over the next several decades, using foreign aid, Korea elevated its economy to the world’s 14th largest, pushing the frontiers of market and technology. The miraculous transformation of a once-ravaged country was aided in large part by the World Bank, which provided over $15 billion in development assistance to build Korea’s railways, rural towns and schools. The World Bank Group Korea Office and Korea’s Ministry of Strategy and Finance organized the conference, “Korea Week 2015 ― Retrospect and Prospect,” at the Sheraton Incheon Hotel in Songdo from Monday to Tuesday, celebrating the last 60 years of productive partnership.  Axel van Trotsenburg. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The WBG is a family of five organizations ― the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ― that provide leveraged loans to developing countries to reduce poverty and create wealth. Korea joined the IBRD in 1955, the IDA in 1961 and the IFC in 1964. It exited these programs by 1995, only to rejoin following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. “In Korean culture, 60 years represents a life cycle and Koreans say that life truly starts at 60. I hope this year will mark the beginning of our new lifelong partnership,” Axel van Trotsenburg, the WBG vice president of East Asia and the Pacific, told The Korea Herald on Monday. “Although the form of our relationship has evolved over the years, its depth and importance remain the same. Our solidarity strengthens our institutions and motivates other countries that are still struggling.” In an effort to deepen engagement with Korea, the World Bank opened a Korea Office in Songdo, Incheon in December 2013. Korea became the first country to become a donor after having been a recipient by joining the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee in 2010. Since then, it has more than doubled its ODA contributions to $1.85 billion last year, offering replenishments to countries in Africa and South and Southeast Asia. In the early days, the World Bank provided financial support, policy advice and technical assistance to Korea. Between 1962 and 2001, Korea received over $15 billion for 133 projects in rural development, transport, education and environment. The World Bank provided $65 million to build roads and housing in Gwangju in 1980, which contributed to Korea’s balanced development. It provided $100 million for vocational training of workers between 1980 and 1986. Nowadays, some 50 Korean institutions and companies are providing technical assistance to developing countries in the areas of finance, information communications technology, electronic learning and urban and sustainable development. The key to a successful partnership, according to Trotsenburg, is long-term engagement capable of meeting the evolving challenges of the globe. “Korea beat the perception of a poor country by lifting its meager income at the end of the war to a $25,000 mark,” Trotsenburg said. “This has been nothing short of impressive. We can help lift people out of poverty globally as Korea has done itself.”The factors that have led to Korea’s economic rise are the sound regulatory framework and macroeconomic policies, an export-oriented strategy, high savings and investment, development of human capital, risk-taking and entrepreneurship, Trotsenburg pointed out. The land reforms in the 1950s and 1960s distributed income equitably across cities and the countryside. A series of seven five-year development plans from 1961 have harnessed competitive industries, enabling a progression from light to heavy and high-tech industries. “The combination of strategic policies and hard work allowed Korea to overcome its challenges,” he argued, adding that Korean people have managed to preserve their culture and identity against a tide of modernization.Trotsenburg said that the World Bank supported multilateralism essential for the international financial architecture. “We need to have the best possible cooperation and coordination, because taxpayers’ money is involved and people want results,” he stressed. In the spirit of multilateralism, he said the World Bank welcomed the ascendency of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which Korea announced in March its intention to join, as it will allow both institutions to collectively reduce infrastructure deficits in Asia, he highlighted. “The World Bank shares information on best practice, operation and governance with the AIIB, as it has done with other multilateral institutions in the past.”The global infrastructure deficit currently exceeds $1 trillion, of which $800 billion is in Asia. The World Bank provides $10 billion a year of infrastructure financing to Asian countries.The World Bank works together with the United Nations, Asian Development Bank and national governments. As the United Nations works to enforce its sustainable and millennium development goals this year, the World Bank will join the global coalition against climate change, Trotsenburg emphasized. Korea’s future challenges lie in managing its natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions and making a transition to a green economy, Trotsenburg underscored. The aging population and volatile global economy can be other retarding factors on growth. The good news for Korea, according to the vice president, is that it belongs to the world’s most economically dynamic region of East Asia, which creates more than half of global growth. “Korea has been exemplary in conquering overseas markets with its export-oriented strategy and continuous innovation,” he said. “Continuing the path of success will open new blue oceans for Korea.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","korea received over 15 billion ,half of global growth korea ,financial crisis in korean culture ,infrastructure deficit currently exceeds trillion ,asian financial crisis in korean","['Korea', 'Korea', 'the World Bank', 'Korea', 'the World Bank Group Korea Office', 'Korea ’s Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance', 'retrospect', 'Prospect', 'the Sheraton Incheon Hotel', 'Songdo', 'Axel van Trotsenburg', 'Joel Lee', 'WBG', 'the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development', 'the International Development Association', 'the International Finance Corporation', 'the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency', 'the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes', 'Korea', 'ibrd', 'IDA', 'IFC', 'asian', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Axel van Trotsenburg', 'WBG', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'the World Bank', 'Korea Office', 'Songdo', 'the OECD ’s Development Assistance Committee', 'ODA', 'World Bank', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the World Bank', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Trotsenburg', 'Korea', 'Trotsenburg', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Trotsenburg', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Trotsenburg', 'the World Bank', 'World Bank', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Korea', 'the World Bank', 'AIIB', 'the World Bank', 'asian', 'the World Bank', 'the United Nations', 'Asian Development Bank', 'the United Nations', 'the World Bank', 'Trotsenburg', 'Korea', 'Trotsenburg', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37340671  0.30915484

According to Greenpeace Korea, the country’s seven major Internet firms were found to have used less than 1 percent renewable energy for running their data centers. Most are supplied by electricity from fossil fuels or nuclear power. IT corporate service provider SK C&C; used only 1 percent solar power for their energy supply as of 2010, the largest amount in the local IT industry. Korea’s leading mobile carrier KT came second with 0.44 percent geothermal and solar energy, followed by portal giant Naver with 0.006 percent solar energy use. Gary Cook (center), senior IT analyst at Greenpeace, attends a press conference on renewable energy use among Korean IT firms at the Greenpeace Korea office in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The energy usages of four other top IT companies ― LG CNS, LG Uplus, Samsung SDS and Daum Kakao ― were not revealed as they declined to provide their energy measures, thereby securing themselves with the least points in information transparency in Greenpeace Korea’s report. Data centers ― facilities equipped to house computer, telecommunications and storage systems ― are known to spend a great amount of electricity. In 2013, the more than 100 data centers in Korea used 2.6 billion kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to the amount of power that 12 million households use in a month. “For Korea, with the fastest Internet speed and the best IT technology in the world, it is a matter of will to utilize the renewable energy. It’s not a choice but an essential move for the Korean IT industry to adopt the green energy in order not to get left behind in the global market,” said Gary Cook, the senior IT analyst at Greenpeace. As of now, the electricity demand of the world’s IT sector accounts for 7 percent of total power consumption, with the figure produces rapidly, experts said emissions. In 2011, the total cloud computing in the world used about 684 billion kwh, which would rank it as the sixth highest electricity consumer if it were compared alongside countries, according to Global e-Sustainability Initiative’s report. China topped the ranking, followed by the U.S., Japan and India. Google once noted that each of its Web searches performed requires 0.2 grams of carbon. Unlike in Korea, global IT firms have been active in adopting pro-renewable energy. In December 2011, Facebook pledged its commitment to be the first in the IT sector to be powered with 100 percent renewable energy. Its new data center in Iowa, opened last year, runs entirely on wind. Other top IT giants such as Apple, Google and Amazon have also promised to supply their data centers with renewable energy, joining Facebook’s green move. In 2013, Apple adopted a 100 percent green energy policy in its manufacturing factories. In Korea, Naver, which openly provided its energy information, vowed Wednesday to adopt the 100 percent renewable energy policy for its data center operations, becoming the first Korean company to make the green commitment.Greenpeace Korea urged the IT sector to first unveil their energy usage information, as it is a basic step toward to building a “green Internet,” ahead of carrying out further measures. “Revealing the information on power usage, electricity sources and carbon emission levels will allow the customers to acknowledge the value of brands and thereby stimulate the companies to go greener,” said an official from Greenpeace Korea.

Due to the immense volume of articles, it is impossible to correct and counter every single one. Therefore, in agreement with the EBC and the surviving family of Mr. Yoo Byung-eun, we are publishing the following combined corrections and Official Statement by EBC.* This label, which is translated as the Salvation Group, has been applied disparagingly to the Evangelical Baptist Church1. In regards to the claims that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun was the owner of the Sewol ferry vessel and the owner and Chief Executive Officer of Chonghaejin Marine Ltd (“Chonghaejin”) and its affiliated companiesThe majority of the media reported that, as the owner of the Sewol ferry, Mr. Yoo Byung-eun directly managed Chonghaejin and its affiliated companies and that he used operating funds for personal purposes. However, Mr. Yoo retired from his executive management position in 1997. He did not own any shares in the noted companies, nor had he managed operations, nor used the operating funds for personal reasons. He was not the owner of the Sewol ferry, nor the chief executive officer of Chonghaejin. As such, he had not provided any directives in regards to the overloading of the Sewol ferry or its renovation (e.g. expansion of the cabins and cargo area). 2. In regards to the reports of Mr. Yoo Byung-eun’s accumulation of illicit funds and lobbying of lawmakersAlthough some media outlets reported that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun had established favorable relationships by paying bribes to politicians, the Korean Prosecutors’ Office verified last October that reports of such bribery activity were false. We hereby correct all articles pertaining to this matter.3. In regards to the allegations of Mr. Yoo Byung-eun’s asset holdings in other people’s names and misappropriation of offerings made to the EBCThe majority of the media reported that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun was a wealthy billionaire who owned real estate properties, including Geumsuwon, both in Korea and abroad under other people’s names and that he diverted the tithes and offerings made to the EBC to an illicit fund and expanded his businesses.The EBC has confirmed that reports of his wealth incorrectly included real estate properties owned by farming associations, which had been established by church members. Thus, these reported properties were not held by Mr. Yoo Byung-eun in another person’s name, but are owned by the noted farming associations.Additionally, Mr. Yoo did not embezzle from the EBC nor did he expand his businesses by diverting tithes or offerings of the pertaining church and its members into an illicit fund.4. In regards to the reports related to Mr. Yoo Byung-eun’s position within the EBCThe EBC has stated that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun was not a religious sect leader. Although he was ordained as a pastor in the 1970s by missionaries at the Far East Broadcasting Company, he did not serve as a pastor. There is no pastor in the EBC, as it is a congregation of laymen.It was also verified that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun did not participate in the official process to register EBC as a church in 1981, nor had he been revered as a religious sect leader or been made into a God-like figure by the pertaining church or its members.5. In regards to reports that the EBC is a cult and that it has false doctrinesThe majority of the media reported that the EBC is a religious cult and that it preaches doctrines that are not consistent with Christianity. There are certain churches in Korea that call the EBC a cult, solely based on differences between their and the EBC’s doctrines. However, the EBC has affirmed its belief in the Bible, the Trinity, Jesus’ conception by the Holy Spirit and His birth, death and resurrection. The EBC does not worship a particular individual as a religious sect leader or preach any doctrine that contradicts the Bible.6. In regards to reports that Lee Yong-wook, a senior Coast Guard official, and the Sewol ferry crew, including Captain Lee Jun-seok, are members of the EBC and that the EBC managed ChonghaejinIt was verified that the captain and the crew members who abandoned the ship at the time of the Sewol ferry accident are not members of the EBC. Only two people have been confirmed as members of the EBC: the late Jeong Hyun-seon, who died while evacuating passengers and thus was designated a national hero, and another person, who had been rescuing passengers and was himself later rescued in an unconscious state. It has also been verified that the EBC does not own any shares of Chonghaejin and that it did not engage in its management. Furthermore, the EBC has stated that Lee Yong-wook, a senior Coast Guard official, has not attended the EBC for the past 15 years.7. In regards to reports of Mr. Yoo Byung-eun’s attempt to flee the country by ship, reports of his seeking asylum and reports of his possession of firearmsThe majority of the media reported that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun attempted to flee the country by ship, that he requested asylum in several countries but was rejected and that he possessed firearms to protect himself. The prosecutors hastily announced without confirming the facts that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun attempted to seek asylum. However, two months later on August 18, the prosecutors revised their statement noting that “upon investigation into the identity of the caller, a person with no relation to the Salvation Group had placed a prank call.” In addition, there was no evidence of any attempt by Mr. Yoo to flee the country. It has also been confirmed that the firearms alleged to be in his possession were collectibles. Furthermore, not only were they collectibles that could not be operated, they were also not in his possession while he was fleeing.8. In regards to reports on allegations about the EBC’s and Mr. Yoo Byung-eun’s links to the Odaeyang incident and their relationship with the Fifth Republic of KoreaSome news articles created the impression that the EBC and Mr. Yoo Byung-eun were behind the Odaeyang mass suicide incident. Some also reported that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun had been able to rapidly grow the Semo Group in the 1980s (e.g. securing the business rights to operate the Han River Ferry Cruise) by using a connection with Mr. Chun Kyung-hwan and a close relationship with former President Chun Doo-hwan’s Fifth Republic of Korea. However, the Odaeyang mass suicide incident was thoroughly investigated by the prosecution and the police three times -- in 1987, 1989 and 1991. All three investigations concluded that the EBC and Mr. Yoo Byung-eun had no connection to the incident. Also, neither Mr. Yoo Byung-eun nor the EBC had any collusive ties with the Fifth Republic of Korea. All of this was verified in the official document issued from the Incheon District Prosecutors’ Office on May 21, 2014.9. In regards to reports alleging that Mr. Yoo Byung-eun held photography exhibitions at the world’s top museums by donating funds and that he coerced purchases of his artworksThe artwork of Ahae (Mr. Yoo Byung-eun) was examined and authorized for exhibitions at renowned museums and exhibition sites in the United States and Europe by their screening committees. The exhibitions were unrelated to donations, and it was confirmed that there was no causal relationship between Ahae’s donation history and the exhibitions. Moreover, Mr. Yoo’s photography exhibitions were authorized by the committees after the directors of the respective museums had acknowledged the artistic value of Ahae’s works and subsequently proposed hosting the exhibitions. It has been confirmed that the exhibitions were not a result of Mr. Yoo’s patronage or donations. Moreover, the museums have verified that an exhibition can never be authorized unless the artistic value of an artist’s works is recognized by the screening committee, irrespective of the amount of money an artist donates.Additionally, it was reported that Mr. Yoo coerced Chonghaejin and its affiliates to purchase his photos at inflated prices. However, this has been confirmed to be false.Lastly, the Evangelical Baptist Church has released the following statement to the media:“We sincerely request of the press to serve the public’s right to know with objective and balanced reporting, guarding against biased arguments from its interviewees, all the while fulfilling its duty and responsibility to create no victims from such reporting.We ask the press to reflect upon its manner of reporting on the Sewol ferry accident. Without waiting for the truth to be revealed through the completion of the investigative and judicial process, the reporting largely focused on releasing exclusive and sensational news reports, which led to misleading the public and essentially conducting a trial in the court of public opinion. We also ask the press to avoid compromising the democratic principles of a constitutional state and to prudently take strict precautions against those forces that aim to take advantage of this period of heartbreak for this nation in order to advance their own position and authority.”","sewol ferry tragedy the media ,published flood of indiscriminate articles ,16 2014 sewol ferry tragedy ,ferry tragedy the media ,tragedy the media published flood","['the Press Arbitration Commission', 'the evangelical Baptist Church', 'the "" Salvation Group', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'EBCAfter', 'Korean', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'EBC', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'official Statement', 'the Salvation Group', 'the evangelical Baptist Church1', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Chonghaejin Marine Ltd', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Chonghaejin', 'Yoo', 'Chonghaejin', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'the korean Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Geumsuwon', 'Korea', 'EBC', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Yoo', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'the EBCThe EBC', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'the Far East Broadcasting Company', 'EBC', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'EBC', 'EBC', 'EBC', 'Christianity', 'Korea', 'EBC', 'Trinity', 'Lee Yong - wook', 'Coast Guard', 'Lee Jun - seok', 'EBC', 'ChonghaejinIt', 'Jeong Hyun - seon', 'Chonghaejin', 'EBC', 'Lee Yong - wook', 'Coast Guard', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'the Salvation Group', 'Yoo', 'the EBC ’s', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Odaeyang', 'the Fifth Republic', 'KoreaSome', 'EBC', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Odaeyang', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'the Semo Group', 'Ferry Cruise', 'Chun Kyung - hwan', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Fifth Republic', 'Korea', 'Odaeyang', 'EBC', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'EBC', 'the Fifth Republic of Korea', 'the Incheon District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'the United States', 'Ahae ’s', 'Yoo', 'Ahae ’s', 'Yoo', 'Yoo', 'Chonghaejin', 'the Evangelical Baptist Church']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15294063  0.59371215

(Yonhap)Camels are thought to be major reservoirs for MERS. The virus is thought to have been common in the animals for the past two decades.The World Health Organization has advised people to avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms or other open areas where the virus is known to be circulating. However, there have been no confirmed cases so far of MERS transmission outside of medical facilities.Park officials were quoted as saying that although they believed the camels at the park were born and raised here and therefore unlikely to be relevant to the MERS situation, they decided to have them tested to alleviate public concern. One Bactrian camel and a dromedary camel live at Seoul Grand Park.Last week, another park in Gwangju also placed its camel in seclusion. This camel was also born at Seoul Grand Park before being moved to the Gwangju park in 1996.MERS fears have gripped the nation since last month, when its first case was detected. As of Tuesday morning, two have died from the virus in Korea, and a total of 25 people here have been confirmed as infected.(khnews@heraldcorp.com)","two camels indoors since tuesday ,spreads camels at local zoo ,infection spreads camels at local ,camels at local zoo have ,seoul have secluded two camels","['Seoul Grand Park', 'Gwacheon', 'Seoul', 'Seoul ’s Research Institute of Public Health & Environment', 'the World Health Organization', 'Korea', 'infected.(khnews@heraldcorp.com']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55871218  0.58147323

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said it obtained 18 underground water samples among 32 boreholes in Yongsan Garrison in central Seoul last week. The central government will look into whether the samples contain toxic volatile substances such as benzene, xylene and toluene. Korean environment officials suspect that the oil leaks, which were detected in 2001 around Noksapyeong Station near the U.S. base, originated from Yongsan Garrison. If confirmed, Seoul City will demand that the U.S. military officials carry out decontamination work before returning the garrison land next year. The result of sample analysis is expected to be released later this month, officials said. This is the second sample gathering in Yongsan Garrison following the first in 2001 after the oil leaks. Late last year, Seoul and Washington reached an agreement on on-site sample-gathering over oil detected in the neighboring region. In 2003, both parties mutually announced that the oil near the subway station could “have likely come from the U.S. military base.” For the clean-up measures, Seoul City has injected about 7.1 billion won ($6.4 million) in the region around the base, with the majority of the cost reimbursed by the central government through a lawsuit, they said. According to the government’s report last year, about 12,000 square meters of land near the base is polluted, while more than 700 liters of underground water is contaminated.Benzene was detected in the water with 0.836 milligrams per liter on average, the report added. This is about 55 times higher than the safe limit of 0.015 milligrams per liter. Despite the city’s clean-up efforts, the average concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons of the water also recorded 119.3 milligrams per liter, which is nearly 80 times higher than the standard limit. Its maximum concentration reached more than 4,400 times the limit, it added.

These include the on-going debate over teachers making political statements or high stress and academic pressure suffered by students due to heated competition.“There have been talks about students committing suicide because of the education situation. Stress (is) put on them by the government, teachers, parents and the system; but it’s almost like we’re not going to talk about that,” she said. “I’m disappointed that there hasn’t been some recognition that there are some things that should change.”Susan Hopgood. (Education International)The international education forum was criticized despite the fanfare, as Korea’s education authorities arranged a lengthy special session on how education has contributed to its rapid economic growth. It invested most of its energy on boasting the accomplishment by Korean students, namely its high performance in Program for International Student Assessment.Hopgood, however, said the education should be more than PISA scores.“PISA only shows some of the (academic) accomplishments. It’s important because it gives international comparisons, but there also needs to be introspection within the system,” she said, adding Korea should ask itself how it can meet the needs of students and teachers in various aspects.These include the immense stress put on students by high expectations on academic performance. The suicide rate for teenagers has increased by 57 percent from 2001 to 2011, a recent report by the Korea Health Promotion Foundation showed.The pressure rises particularly around November during the the national college entrance exam ― called Suneung here. The grade each student gets in the exam plays a critical role in his or her college admission, and reports of students taking their own lives around the day of Suneung emerge each year. “We hope there is a recognition that the competitive nature of your education system needs to change. And the high-stakes are what causes unhappiness of students,” she said. She spoke out for teachers’ rights in Korea. Under Korean law, teachers and other civil servants are prohibited from publicly expressing their political views.This, Hopgood pointed out, violates their right to freedom of expression. “Teachers should have the same civil rights as all other members of the society. ILO (International Labor Organization) and UNESCO’s recommendation on the state of teachers ― which was adopted by the Korean government ― makes it clear that teachers should have rights, including the right to make political statements,” she said.Hopgood reiterated the EI’s position that the government should abandon its attempt to delegalize the left-leaning Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union, which has received criticism for being too political. Speaking from her experience as a teacher in Australia, Hopgood said Korean educators should encourage dialogue on social issues, including politics. This is essential to ensure that the education is not just confined to the textbooks, but also addresses real-life issues. “The achievement of quality education for all cannot happen until you have proper social dialogue and inclusion of the teaching community,” she said.Education International is a federation of 401 associations and unions across the world, representing some 30 million teachers and education workers in 171 countries and territories.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","debate over teachers making political ,korean law teachers ,the left leaning korea teachers ,education forum 2015 last week ,korean law teachers and other","['South Korea', 'Korea', 'the World Education Forum', 'Susan Hopgood', 'the Education International', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Program for International Student Assessment', 'Korea', 'the Korea Health Promotion Foundation', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Hopgood', 'International Labor Organization', 'UNESCO', 'korean', 'Hopgood', 'EI', 'Korea Teachers and Education Workers ’ Union', 'Australia', 'Hopgood', 'korean', 'Education International', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.08512831  0.69809437

200,200,[Herald Interview] ‘Education backbone of long-term development’,"Often when countries strive for economic prosperity, investments in infrastructure, finance and technology spearhead their agenda.

While those sectors are important, Amina J. Mohammed, the special adviser to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on post-2015 development planning, said investing in education was equally, if not more, crucial.“Education is the absolute backbone (of development). It’s fundamental to any society growing,” she told The Korea Herald. Mohammed, formerly a coordinator of the gender and education task force for the U.N. millennium project, said fostering an educated population contributed to people’s capacity to handle incoming challenges. “It enables changes and allows you to make choices,” she said.  Amina J. Mohammed (The Korea Herald)The importance of education is particularly crucial for young democracies, Mohammed pointed out. She took the example of the Arab Spring, a revolutionary wave of protests in the Arab world that started in Tunisia.“Young people can overthrow their government overnight, like in Tunisia. The real challenge is what you do the day after that,” she said. “That requires education. It requires an education to tell you that nothing is quickly fixed.”She explained that after the conflict, it took long-term investment to rebuild infrastructure and to rebuild the minds of the people in society and the community. But if it is done right, the process can help resolve the conflict. Education is the key to building one’s capacity to solve social problems internally, and not relying on outside forces to provide answers, she said. “Human rights abuses across the world are unprecedented, you have to look at the root causes. The symptom is the conflict, but the root cause is lack of investment in basic education,” she said. But the consequences of not having an education are disregarded because the effects are not immediately inconceivable, she said. “I think this is what we’re missing; we’re not understanding the implications of not having proper education system to deliver quality education.“If you don’t have a functioning health care system, people die. If you don’t have a functioning education system, it’s the living dead,” she said, emphasizing the role of an educated population as the driving force behind betterment of a society.“Political leadership can’t do anything without an educated population. And the quality and the ambition of what you want to achieve has to be on the back of education. As the U.N. seeks to set the post-2015 development agenda, it plans to build on the lessons they have learned from the millennium development goals, she said. One such difference is the strong institutions that will enforce the goals to be implemented.Another is the universality of the agenda, making development about everyone and not just few people. In education, this translates into ensuring equal access to education for everyone. Mohammed emphasized the importance of achieving gender equality in education. She pointed out that as women have different gifts than men, they can complement men in partnership. “I think women in leadership positions are able to look and approach a solution from different places. There is less anxiety about having to approach a problem in a certain way, and they will look at different options,” she said. “Have more women in decision-making, and we’ll see lots of difference in issues such as climate change.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","achieving gender equality in education ,prosperity investments in infrastructure finance ,crucial for young democracies mohammed ,the korea herald the importance ,countries strive for economic prosperity","['Amina J.

South Korea’s high-quality education has been credited for the country’s economic surge but has done little for its students’ happiness, the Indian activist against child labor said. “Education systems everywhere, including Korea, have to be more child-friendly. It should be easy and friendly for young people to approach,” he said during a joint interview at the World Education Forum 2015. In 2014, he won the Nobel Peace Prize alongside education activist Malala Yousafzai. Kailash Satyarthi. (Yonhap)The 61-year-old advocate of children’s rights started Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood Movement) in 1980 to end child abuses such as forced labor and human trafficking while working to promote education for all children. To date, it has helped over 80,000 children. Satyarthi underscored that satisfaction in life does not lie in wealth and development. “In one sentence, happiness and satisfaction does not lie in what we are given, but what we give,” he said.The Korean education system has been long associated with its rapid economic development in the latter half of the 20th century. The WEF 2015 had an entire special session devoted to its “success story.” But Satyarthi stressed that economic prosperity does not automatically bring happiness.“(Koreans) are gaining from all over the world. Electronic goods, telephones. ... It is a brand. Everybody is using (Korean products). But more important is how you return this to the rest of the world,” he said. Despite some outsiders ― most notably U.S. President Barack Obama ― praising the Korean education system, the students are often burdened with high academic pressure, depriving them of happiness. The happiness index of Korean students was 19th among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to a May report by the Korea Bang Jeong Hwan Foundation and Yonsei University. Korean students gave their lives a score of 90.4 points, which is an improvement from 60~70 points in the past but is still lower than the OECD average of 100.This, Satyarthi pointed out, is hindering the true purpose of education.“The objective of education is basically to discover the human quality and potential of every single human being, community, and the entire world. Eventually this potential should be transmitted to the betterment of the world. Helping each other,” he said.“Many countries are poor but happy. Their social connectivity is high, which gives them a sense of security and cooperation. They are closer to each other and more open to each other,” he said.This is the key for children to achieve happiness, he explained.“A very simple thing that one can ask is, what I can do to make others happy? What did I do to make new friends? If you try to make a friend, an unknown person happy each week, it will make you happy every week,” he said.He warned of possible side effects from excessive competition, a pitfall that many Korean students ― in their high-pressure environment ― fall into. “Creativity and competition should be complimentary. There should be a competition to see who can come up with a more creative idea. If a competition pushes back others, then it is wrong,” Satyarthi said.To raise their happiness levels, he encouraged Korean children to connect with the rest of the world’s children and learn about them. “They (Korean children) should not be confined to themselves, but they should be open and break the solidarity. Go out, you are the hopes for the world. Identify yourself and play a role for the world.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","obama praising the korean education ,barack obama praising the korean ,happiness index of korean students ,obama praising the korean ,2014 nobel peace prize","['Kailash Satyarthi', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'indian', 'Korea', 'the World Education Forum', 'Malala Yousafzai', 'Kailash Satyarthi', 'Bachpan Bachao Andolan', 'save the Childhood Movement', 'korean', 'Satyarthi', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Korea', 'Jeong Hwan Foundation', 'Yonsei University', 'korean', 'OECD', 'Satyarthi', 'korean', 'Satyarthi', 'korean', 'korean', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.33410695  1.00040781

The Incheon Declaration succeeds the movement and vows to guarantee nine years of primary and secondary education to everyone while emphasizing the importance of lifelong learning. Another focal point is to secure equal educational opportunities and accessibility for all.It said sustainable development cannot be achieved without substantial financing, particularly in countries that are lagging behind in education quality. The declaration said participating countries agreed to increase investment in education, and urged all members to devote at least 4-6 percent of the GDP or 15-20 percent of their public expenditure on education. “Korea actively supports spreading the education agenda chosen at the forum, thus contributing to the ultimate goal of everyone receiving a quality education,” Hwang said. The declaration will provide an education blueprint for U.N. member states up until 2030, organizers said. It also states the role of education for sustainable development within the framework of the U.N. development agenda, which will be confirmed in September.

Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka does not mince words when she talks about the education of young girls. “It is the right thing to do,” she said emphatically during an interview with The Korea Herald at a hotel in southern Seoul on Monday. Mlbambo-Ngcuka is in Korea to attend the World Education Forum 2015 being held in Incheon May 19-22.For the developing and underdeveloped countries around the world, investing in women brings about fundamental changes in society, Mlbambo-Ngcuka argues. “It ensures they will make contributions as citizens,” she says, explaining that countries are compromising their own development when they do not educate women. For example, educated women means better health management of the country, as lifestyle-related illnesses can be avoided and better immunization and nutrition of children can prevent illnesses. “Education of women has multiple benefits,” Mlbambo-Ngcuka says, concluding, “It is the only sustainable way to end poverty.” Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family)One way to ensure education for women is to have more women in leadership positions, not an easy task in countries where women are not represented in the upper hierarchies of power. This is where governments need to step in. “There is no country where women’s leadership has increased without special measures, such as quotas. People think it is normal to be led by men only. We are finding that there is permanent affirmative action for men,” she says. A crucial element in getting women into leadership positions is encouraging and educating women to believe in other women and to vote for them, she explains, as women who are in leadership positions can be role models for other women. Mlbambo-Ngcuka cites the example of a women’s battalion sent to Liberia to boost security there that has had a strong impact on the women of that country. “The number of women in Liberia who went into careers in the security field increased overnight,” she says, emphasizing the importance of role models.As many more men are already in leadership positions, they can play an important role in the empowerment of women. “You need men who are gender sensitive. You need to make it a collective responsibility. Even when men have power, it should benefit both men and women,” Mlbambo-Ngcuka says.Concerning violence against women in conflict zones, Mlbambo-Ngcuka called on the world leaders to make it their issue, pointing out that “the law enforcers are letting us down because they are not focused enough.” Asked about the issue of Japanese military sexual slavery during World War II, Mlbambo-Ngcuka says, “It is an issue that is bigger than U.N. Women.” She adds, however, that while an international dispensation system is needed, it is important that the two countries ― Korea and Japan ― attend to the matter.

Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and 2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi.In his speech, Ban said it was “unacceptable” that 57 million school-age children are unable to attend school, and urged the participants to pool their efforts to provide education opportunities for women, children, minorities, physically challenged and those in conflict-ridden regions.The WEF 2015 will continue through Friday at Songdo Convensia in Songdo, Incheon.In the process of discussing the universal education values ― such as lifelong learning, vocational training and education ― Korean officials were set to use the opportunity to promote the country’s efforts on enhancing the education system and the role education played in country’s vast economic development.One of the plenary sessions to be held on Wednesday will be under the topic of “Education drives development.”Korea Education Development Institute chief Baek Sun-geun will present a special lecture on how education became the driving force behind the country’s economic development in the mid- to late 20th century, organizers said.Kim’s presentation will be followed by panel discussions ― including U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs and Korea University president Yeom Jae-ho -― on the direction of the future of education and on education’s role in a country’s development as indicated by Korea.On Friday, foreign participants will visit five schools in Incheon and one each in Seoul and Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, respectively. The schools were picked by the respective education offices for their curriculum.For example, Incheon Hannuri Multicultural School was chosen for its various programs that support students from multicultural families. Bukincheon Girls’ Middle School was selected as a case study of Korea’s flagship “free semester” policy, which exempts first-year middle school students from tests for a semester and allows them to try out various vocational experiences instead.“Introducing these classes will be a great opportunity to let the world know the excellence of Korean education,” said an official from Incheon education office.But the biggest international education event in Korea to date also came with backlash, as some civic groups criticized the Korean government for attempting to whitewash conflicts within the education circles. The Education Ministry, for instance, is currently at a standoff with liberal local education chiefs over financing the free child care program. The government revoking the legal status of local progressive teachers’ group Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union also remains a hotly debated issue.The KTU’s Incheon branch accused the ministry of discriminating against groups that are not favorable toward the government. “Ironically, while preparing an event to discuss the direction the world education, (the ministry) did not even ask the teachers’ union in their own country to participate,” the KTU said in a statement.The KTU and seven other civic groups held a joint press conference outside of the WEF 2015 venue and blasted the government for “concealing the devastating state of Korean education and just focusing on praising itself.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","2015 on tuesday gathering education ,international education event in korea ,2014 nobel peace prize laureate ,education forum 2015 on tuesday ,tuesday gathering education related experts","['South Korea', 'the World Education Forum', 'Incheon', 'the Korean Education Ministry', 'U.N.', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'World Bank', 'Jim Yong Kim', 'UNESCO', 'Irina Bokova', 'UNICEF Executive', 'Anthony Lake', 'U.N.

Thermo Future Box, Brauerei Zoller-Hof Graf-Fleischhut, Deutsche Extrakt Kaffee, Heinrich Manten, IQ 4 YOU, Miller conSup Gesellschaft fur Import und Export, Sanotact Limited, Schneider, and Zott Dairy Asia Pacific, participated. The German food industry is Europe’s largest, with 6,000 companies employing over 550,000 and generating 175 billion euros every year. Ninety-five percent of German food and drink suppliers are small and medium-sized companies. Most of them are family-owned with histories running back centuries. The most popular categories are meat and meat products, followed by dairy and bakery goods and confectionery. Due to the world-renowned quality, competitive price, reliable supply and large product range of German foods, the export value of the industry grew by more than 160 percent from 1998 to 2013. With the world’s oldest beverage quality law ― the German beer purity law of 1516 ― Germany produces over 5,000 beer varieties. “Although Germans are passionate beer drinkers, we are not the world’s beer-drinking champions as the common perception suggests. We hold the third place globally in beer consumption with 107 liters per capita,” the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture said in a press release. The import value of food and beverages from Germany to Korea increased by 50 percent in 2014 from a year age at 420 million euros. Pork belly, in particular, has seen a fourfold increase. German wine, dairy products, pork offal and baking ingredients also have high potential for imports, said the BMEL, which supported the participating firms.

The woods will be imported by Canada Wood, and the design will be created by the SOLTOS Architects. The Gangwondo Development Corporation provided the land for the construction, and support for the preliminary construction and landscape architecture. It will also oversee the building maintenance during and after the Olympics.

The main overpass will be connected with 17 adjacent roads by placing light bulbs on the roads to make them look like tree branches, the city said. Mass, a cofounder of urban design practice MVRDV in Netherlands, has pushed for a number of global projects including Grand Paris Plus Petit ― a plan that envisioned the future of the French capital. “The strategy (of Mass’s proposal) that changes the concrete construction to a place of life with a means of nature was future-oriented and innovative,” said Seung Hyo-sang, the capital government’s official city architect.The panel of judges, comprising five local and international urban architects, assessed the proposals from seven invited designers based on four categories: interpretation of the place, harmony with neighboring areas, preservation of the original overpass and feasibility of the program, the city said. The kilometer-long section of the high-rise road is considered part of Seoul’s heritage from the industrialized era, as it has connected the city center to the western region since the 1970s. Scheduled to be completed by 2017, the project is expected to cost about 38 billion won ($35 million), the city said. The traffic may be restricted starting from October for construction, it added. The city has held a number of civic events and a public hearing to widen the social consensus over the project as it has faced objection from residents and business owners near Seoul Station, citing traffic congestion and business losses.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","mass proposed his seoul arboretum ,his seoul arboretum plan ,his seoul arboretum plan to ,proposed his seoul arboretum ,seoul arboretum plan to change","['dutch', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'dutch', 'Winy Mass', 'Seoul', 'New York City', 'Green City Project', 'Netherlands', 'french', 'Seung Hyo - sang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Station', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21905223  0.25983405

EU Ambassador Tomasz Kozlowski and 20 other ambassadors from EU member states will visit 42 schools this year, and present European history, politics, economy and culture, as well as their career. The program started last year in collaboration with the Seoul Education Office, and was received with high interest. For this year, 68 schools applied, including 21 reapplying from last year. Kozlowski, who is Polish, highlighted the continental organization’s motto, “United in Diversity,” and explained the history and governance of the 28 member states.“The EU was created out of a joint effort in 1950 to prevent wars,” Kozlowski said. “As a peace project since the beginning, it has led to today’s common security policies and arrangements.”  European Union Ambassador Tomasz Kozlowski speaks to students of Kyungbok Business High School in western Seoul on Friday as part of the “EU Goes to Schools 2015” program. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)He stressed that Europeans were able to put their bloody history behind them and unite around common objectives. A few Balkan countries are currently negotiating for EU membership, he noted. The criteria for EU membership are democracy, a market economy, the rule of law and human rights. Capital, people, goods and services freely move across borders in the EU bloc, which is home to 500 million citizens. The main objective is to maintain peace and harmony not only in Europe, but across the world, according to the ambassador. The EU’s people benefit from economic development and social solidarity. He also touched upon different institutions: the European Council, European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the European Parliament.Students were surprised to learn that the Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian and Korean languages belong to the same Ural-Altaic linguistic family.Mutual understanding and cooperation are high between the EU and Korea, Kozlowski said, as both sides have extensive cooperation in science and technology, energy, environment, education, public health, development assistance, human rights, tourism and culture. During the Europe Day 2015 reception at Lotte Hotel last Monday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said that Europe’s experience of transition from communism and regional integration provides a model for Korea’s unification and reconciliation with its neighbors.Korea is the first Asian country with which the EU concluded three agreements on political cooperation, free trade and crisis management. Korea is also one of the EU’s 10 strategic partners worldwide. The EU is Korea’s third-largest trading partner after China and ASEAN, with bilateral trade volume of $114 billion last year. The EU is the largest foreign investor in Korea, while Korea also invests heavily in Europe. The ambassador highlighted educational opportunities in Europe, including the Erasmus Plus program for the 2014-20 period aimed at boosting knowledge, employment and student exchanges. Responding to the increasing number of Korean students ― currently 10,000 ― who are eyeing European education, the Study and Research in Europe Fair 2015 will be held at Ewha Womans University on Wednesday. During a question-and-answer session, third-grader Lee Da-hee asked Kozlowski how he overcame difficulties in life. He responded, “Be self-confident, curious and willing to learn. Be an optimist and do not think about failures.”“Have different options, and establish yourself with knowledge, resilience and experience to build self-confidence,” he added. Answering second-grader Jung Ye-won’s question about his life goals, Kozlowski said that although life was unpredictable and complicated, it was wise to have some general goals. “Get a fulfilling and satisfying job to produce results, and do not work only for money. Work to develop yourself,” he advised. “Never be too ambitious, but be realistic. For example, I do not dream of becoming the United Nations secretary-general like Mr. Ban Ki-moon.”The ambassador also stressed the importance of having a work-life balance and family commitment. “Please enjoy your life. Life is not only about studying. Koreans work too hard,” he said.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","seoul on friday eu ambassador ,research in europe fair 2015 ,europe among korean high school ,in western seoul on friday ,in europe fair 2015 will","['the European Union Embassy', 'korean', 'the Kyungbok Business High School', 'Seoul', 'EU', 'Tomasz Kozlowski', 'EU', 'european', 'the Seoul Education Office', 'Kozlowski', 'polish', 'EU', 'Kozlowski', 'European Union', 'Tomasz Kozlowski', 'Kyungbok Business High School', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'Europeans', 'balkan', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'the European Council', 'European Commission', 'the Court of Justice', 'the European Union', 'the European Central Bank', 'the European Parliament', 'estonian', 'finnish', 'hungarian', 'korean', 'Ural - Altaic', 'EU', 'Korea', 'Kozlowski', 'Lotte Hotel', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'asian', 'EU', 'Korea', 'EU', 'EU', 'Korea', 'China', 'ASEAN', 'EU', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'european', 'the Study and Research in Europe Fair 2015', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Lee Da - hee', 'Kozlowski', 'Jung Ye - won', 'Kozlowski', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'korean', 'Joel Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80045944  0.75772804

The municipal government also scrapped a construction ban on its concert hall.Public jitters over leaks at the aquarium and reported vibrations in the movie theater prompted the city government in December to activate a partial ban of the tower in southern Seoul, which will likely become the country's tallest structure at 555 meters when completed in 2016.City officials still ordered the country's largest retail conglomerate to update the safety monitoring results of the facilities on its website and bolster overall safety management measures to ease ""public anxiety.""""A thorough management plan that factors in chances of additional safety accidents, is essential as public anxiety lingers despite (results that found) no problem in structural safety,"" said Jin Hee-seon, who oversees the city's housing and construction policy.Lotte Corp., a group affiliate that manages the tower, welcomed the move and announced plans to reopen the facilities next week following a three-day free admission promotion for selected visitors.""We plan to put our heart and soul into creating a cultural venue and a safety landmark that Seoul citizens can be proud of,"" company president Noh Byung-yong said in a statement.The Lotte affiliate forecast that lifting the ban, which had been a major drag on its profitability, will attract an additional 20,000-30,000 visitors to the high-rise.Visitor numbers have recently halved compared to a year earlier, when some 100,000 people visited the tower each day following its opening, the company said.

A graduate of Paris' National School of Fine Arts, Dornand de Rouville has been living in Korea for 10 years.Published by Seoul Selection on April 27, the book will be available at local bookstores and amazon.com.

We would, then, see the mood of reconciliation and cooperation emerging in the region.”Concerns over Seoul’s diplomacy have recently been rising as it appears to be caught in a competition between the U.S., its only security ally, and China, its largest trading partner. The strengthening U.S.-Japan alliance has also highlighted South Korea’s tricky position as the alliance is expected to further pressure it to join their efforts to keep China in check.Seoul’s strained ties with Tokyo and Pyongyang have added to the concerns over its diplomatic challenges, with critics arguing that Seoul needs a more “strategic” approach.Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies of Seoul National University, said that the “maneuvering space” for South Korea’s diplomacy is increasingly limited by the rising U.S.-China tensions, stressing that Seoul needs a more creative, sophisticated strategy to handle foreign relations.“There seems to be a lack of strategic thinking on the part of the Seoul government when its diplomatic maneuvering space is being reduced due to the Sino-U.S. competition ― very limited compared with the 1990s right after the end of Cold War when Seoul had greater flexibility in its diplomacy,” he said.“The inter-Korean relationship is the only area that we can deal with for now to turn the Korean Peninsula into an area for Sino-U.S. cooperation, not a confrontation. It is the reason why Seoul needs to do more to improve cross-border relations.To enhance ties with the North, the South needs to pursue a method of “coexistence” and refrain from indicating ― albeit not intended ― that it is pursuing reunification by absorbing the communist state into the South, some observers said.President Park Geun-hye has repeatedly said national reunification will help address North Korea’s nuclear problem and its woeful human rights conditions ― a message that Pyongyang thinks reveals that Seoul envisions unification via a collapse of North Korea.“Seoul should send an unequivocal message to Pyongyang that it has no intention of seeking reunification by absorbing the North. It has to clearly present that it is exploring ways of peaceful coexistence with the North,” Chang of the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, said.As Pyongyang maintains hostile rhetoric toward Seoul and sticks to its nuclear development, inter-Korean relations have continued to falter. Seoul has sought to unconditionally reopen dialogue with Pyongyang, but the communist regime has put forward preconditions such as lifting a set of economic sanctions that Seoul imposed after the North torpedoed the South Korean corvette Cheonan in March 2010.For the inter-Korean relations to move forward, some experts argued that Seoul needs to relax the sanctions and continue to pursue dialogue. Pyongyang also needs to improve ties with Seoul to help ease its international isolation and shore up its moribund economy, they noted.“For now, there are no neighboring countries that maintain stable, good relations with the North. But should the South come forward, improve ties with the North and secure some initiative in leading peninsular issues, this would, of course, be a diplomatic advantage for Seoul,” said Chin Hee-gwan, unification professor at Inje University.“Improved inter-Korean relations would lead to a reduction in North Korean threats, which will reduce the need for Japan to push for heavier armament and will also influence Washington’s policy toward the peninsula and the region.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","university improved inter korean relations ,seoul needs more strategic approach ,seoul to help ease military ,seoul to improve inter korean ,korean ties to secure diplomatic","['Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Sino - U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Koh Yoo - hwan', 'North Korea', 'Seoul ’s Dongguk University', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'South Korea ’s', 'u.s.-china', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'sino', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Sino', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Chang', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Chin Hee - gwan', 'Inje University', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Song Sang - ho']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58427864  0.59092295

About 56 percent of the capital’s taxis are private, it said.Of them, about 31 percent of the drivers are over the age of 65, with 12 percent being 70 or older.While 35,000 of the private taxies are obligated to operate daily, only 48 percent, or 16,931 of them are running nightshifts due to worries over their safety on the road, the data said.The older the drivers were, the less they worked at night, the data added. While more than half of those aged 50 or younger went to work at night, only 24 percent of those in their 70s did so. The city said that such low participation in nighttime taxi driving derived from the aged drivers’ concerns over accident risks. According to data from the city authorities, just 22 percent of taxi-related accidents from 2010 to last year involved drivers aged 65 or older. However, the number of car accidents by older aged drivers in general jumped to some 15,000 cases in 2012, nearly fivefold that of 2001. “The accident rate of aged drivers is usually higher than the average. When accidents take place, they also tend to face a hike in insurance fees, (making cab drivers reluctant to work at night),” Seoul officials said. In an effort to alleviate the cab accident concerns by aged drivers, Seoul City has suggested that the Transport Ministry limit the cab drivers’ age to 65. But several legislation attempts in the past died due to a backlash from the cab industry, the city said.

The electric vehicle symposium was launched in 1969 and has been recognized as the premier global event in leading trends and technological breakthroughs in the electric mobility area.Under the theme of “e-motional technology for humans,” the 28th symposium will showcase the newest technologies, from low-speed battery electric vehicles to fuel-cell electric buses. Companies from Scandinavia and Korea have an ideal match due to their complementary structures in the electric mobility sector. Korea is a leader in information and communications technology and automobile industries, while the Nordic countries are pioneers in energy-efficient design and technology with innovative research and development. The electric vehicle industry has driven technological innovation and solutions to address climate change. It aims to be at the forefront of the green economy and sustainable growth by reducing carbon dioxide emission and fossil fuel usage. Over 60,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are out on the Nordic roads, a 150 percent increase between 2013 and 2014. Due to the strong political focus on green energy and sustainable transport solutions, the electric mobility sector is considered to have high growth potential in Scandinavian countries. The industry is also positioned at the intersection of automotive, energy and ICT, and can be linked to the city’s smart grid. The partnership was organized by e-Insero and the Innovation Center Denmark at the Danish Embassy in Seoul, and the Swedish Energy Agency, Finnish innovation funding agency Tekes Nordic Energy Research Norden provided support.

The annual meeting was held to boost cooperative efforts in tackling various environmental issues, such as yellow dust, fine dust or marine debris.The three countries’ environment ministers Yoon Sung-kyu of South Korea, Chen Jining of China and Mochizuki Yoshio of Japan joined the event.The integrated yellow forecast system will be pushed by the joint anti-yellow dust study group, comprised of 30 environment experts. Since 2008, the three countries have run the group to put efforts into improving forecast accuracy while restoring desert areas in China, they added. Starting with sharing data on yellow dust for the forecast system, the countries will expand the range to fine dust and ultrafine dust soon, officials said. At the Korea-China bilateral talks on Wednesday, Beijing agreed to provide raw yellow dust data from a number of sites, they said. So far, Korea was able to gain yellow dust data of only four sites from Chinese meteorological agency, not from the environment authorities. “As most of the yellow dust source sites are in China, the raw data will allow the Korean government to forecast the dust route more precisely,” Yoon said. In a bid to further prevent the inflow of dust, Seoul’s ministry said it would support Beijing to restore desolated land and conduct a joint study on sustainable land use.At the Seoul-Tokyo talks, the two countries agreed to share their ultrafine dust information in real time and cooperate more in forecasting yellow dust. Along with the trilateral agreement on improving air quality, the three countries agreed to create a negotiation channel to seek ways to solve problems with marine debris, officials said.Japan has urged Korea and China to take action against the growing environmental threat of the sea. Japan has become the country most seriously affected by marine waste from China and Korea, according to an official at Korea’s Environment Ministry. At the TEMM16 held in Daegu last year, the states determined nine environment agenda to put collective efforts into.This includes improving air quality; conserving biodiversity; managing chemical materials; sustaining resource cycling; tackling climate change; conserving the maritime environment; raising public awareness; restoring the urban environment; and pushing for a green economy.

The university, which had topped the list since its inception in 2012, slid to second place, with Switzerland’s Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne snatching the No. 1 spot. The fourth annual ranking by Times Higher Education ranked the top 100 universities that were founded less than 50 years ago, using 13 indicators across four areas -- research, teaching, knowledge transfer and international activities. The top five positions were claimed by Asian institutions, with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Hong Kong University of Science and Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University holding onto third, fourth and fifth place, respectively.South Korea increased its representation on the overall list of the world’s top young universities, with the University of Ulsan entering the list at 90th. Unlike the traditional Times Higher Education’s world university rankings, which is dominated by U.K. and U.S. institutions, the table for young universities has put more emphasis on metrics other than history and heritage to better capture the potential of young institutions. This year, a total of eight nations including South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Netherlands and France appeared in the top 10 table.

YonhapWashington and Tokyo have been beefing up security cooperation this week through their new defense guidelines and a joint alliance vision, warning China should not take any unilateral action to change the regional “status quo” in breach of international law.“We are united in our resoluteness in opposing unilateral attempts to change the status quo in whatever form,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said during a joint press conference following his summit with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington on Tuesday.“Any dispute should be resolved peacefully based on international law and not through coercion or intimidation,” he added, apparently referring to the disputes that China has raised with Japan and other nations over a series of islands in the East and South China Seas.Obama accused China of “flexing muscles,” noting that there are “real tensions” with China over its approach to maritime issues. He also said that a strong U.S.-Japan alliance should not be seen as a “provocation.”“It should be seen as a continuation of the important work that we have done to ensure that you have a stable area where there are diplomatic conflicts (and) a healthy economic competition,” he said.Analysts said that amid a strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance, China may try to avoid any critical confrontations with the U.S., and seek a milder form of diplomacy that would continue to expand its diplomatic and economic clout.“China could utilize its creative imagination to enhance its clout instead of clashing with major powers in the region, although psychological conflicts with Japan could be amplified,” said Kim Heung-kyu, diplomacy professor at Ajou University.Kim said that China may seek to maintain stable relations in the Western pacific area where conflicts persist, while pushing to advance toward its west through its “Silk Road” projects, open new opportunities in the country’s south and bolster cooperation with Russia, Mongolia and others north of China.He added that amid stronger U.S.-Japan cooperation, countries in the Asia-Pacific may seek closer ties with the U.S., and their tendency to “bandwagon on” the rising power may weaken.Some experts pointed out that given that the U.S. and Japan are beefing up their military cooperation to curb China’s aggressive behavior over maritime issues ― not to provoke or threaten China ― the allies’ enhanced security cooperation would not cause serious tensions in the region.“Washington and Tokyo believe that deterring China or preventing any conflicts would be the best way to go. So, they seek to increase their monitoring and readiness with an ultimate goal of deterring China’s aggressive behavior,” said Nam Chang-hee, security expert at Inha University.“Thus, I believe the allies’ moves to prevent any attempt at changing the status quo will be helpful to promote security in the region. But should Japan make moves that provoke China too much, then the allies may not be able to achieve an optimal deterrence against China.”Observers said the moves to keep China in check would pose a tricky diplomatic challenge to South Korea, which has been striving to maintain stable relations with China, its biggest trading partner. They said Seoul should employ a more active diplomacy to address the deadlock in the relations with North Korea and improve ties with Japan, so as to gain diplomatic leverage in the complicated power dynamics in Asia-Pacific.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","analysts said wednesday 김종훈 의원 ,cooperation to curb china aggressive ,diplomatic challenge to south korea ,워싱턴 연합뉴스 심인성 특파원 새누리당 ,countries analysts said wednesday 김종훈","['U.S.', 'Japan ’s', 'China', '금지.>Kim Jong - hoon', 'the International Relations Committee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'YonhapWashington', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Washington', 'China', 'Japan', 'Obama', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Kim Heung - kyu', 'Ajou University', 'Kim', 'China', 'Russia', 'Mongolia', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', 'China', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'China', 'Nam Chang - hee', 'Inha University', 'Japan', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Song Sang - ho']",14,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.51809222  0.90077835

The road is 17 meters above ground and served as a connection point of the city center and the western region from the 1970s.Manhattan’s High Line Park, a 2.5 kilometer-long linear park built 9 meters above ground on an abandoned railroad into a green space. Promoted as a resident-led urban renewal project, the park now draws about five million visitors every year, serving as a landmark in the city, officials said. In Seoul, the project is facing protests from residents and business owners near Seoul Station, citing potential traffic congestion and sales damage. Criticism also rose over a lack of communication with residents prior to the unveiling of the project. In a bid to alleviate the backlash, Seoul City has held a number of public hearings and the mayor has made several visits. At the public event next month, the city will provide a 400 meter-long artificial grass area, along with parasols and mats for an expected 2,000 citizens. Street art activities, a mobilizing library and various performances will take place, officials said.The city will also install four booths where citizens can voice their opinion about the project. All opinions will be considered in the city’s decision-making process, authorities said.

The University of Toronto has over 540,000 alumni ― one of the largest and most active in the world. Their academic and professional excellence has contributed to the university’s recognition as Canada’s top higher educational institution. Over 1,000 ethnic Korean students and researchers study at UofT each year, and many come back to Korea to work or continue their learning. Canadian Ambassador Eric Walsh expressed his regret at the event Thursday for not being a legitimate alumni member. “I went to the University of Toronto schools, a closely affiliated university preparatory school for 7th to 12th graders, and after my undergraduate at McGill, started a masters program in Russian and European studies at UofT,” Walsh said.  (From left) Mark Fox, professor of industrial engineering and computer science, chancellor Michael Wilson, Canadian Ambassador Eric Walsh and Barbara Dick, assistant vice president of alumni relations, pose at the University of Toronto alumni reception at the Canadian Embassy in Seoul on Thursday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“But only a year into the program, I was hired by the government. For anybody in Canada with a bachelor’s degree to get an offer of employment, let me tell you, you jump on that.”Barbara Dick, assistant vice president of alumni relations, told some 50 guests: “As graduates, you are the most influential and effective ambassadors of our university. Your accomplishments reflect our outstanding reputation in the region and the world.”She added, “I was struck by speaking to many of you here today how interesting and diverse your paths have been. No one has taken a straight line from point A to B.”With world-leading professors, researchers and thought-leaders, the UofT comprises three campuses ― St. George, Scarborough and Mississauga ― and spearheads global research in a broad range of disciplines. The discovery of stem cells, insulin and black holes, as well as the anatomy of criticism and global village, have been some of its scholarly achievements over the past 188 years since the school’s establishment. The UofT ranked first in Canada and 15th in the world by the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings 2015. Among publicly funded universities, it ranked eighth globally. The diversity of the student body, which comes from the world’s most multicultural city of Toronto and 111 countries abroad, reflects the institution’s international character. Graduates go on to fill leadership positions across the globe in a range of vocations. The university started a $2 billion fundraising campaign, “Boundless,” in late 2011 to attract talent and research funding.Chancellor Michael Wilson, former Finance Minister and Canadian Ambassador to the U.S., praised students for their achievement. “Our students see their education as something broader than the nuts and bolts of their school life. They have produced groundbreaking results through entrepreneurship and innovation worldwide,” Wilson said. He added that the bilateral trade volume has increased from $4 billion to $10 billion since 1991, when he came to Korea as a finance minister on a trade mission. “Our robust trade and investment will grow by leaps and bounds through the bilateral free trade agreement, as it came into force this year,” he said. The chancellor highlighted some 1,500 joint publications involving over $10 million in funding that have been coauthored by researchers from the UofT and their colleagues in Korea. There are also numerous other collaborations in medicine, commerce and humanities, he stressed. Ted Sargent, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UofT, is currently leading joint research on renewable energy with the Ulsan National University of Science and Technology, which has received funding from the Korean government. Kim Eun-gi, the president of the Korean alumni branch, said the university’s recognition in Korea rose from mid-2000 onward after its high international ranking was publicized in the media. Although America’s Ivy League schools still dominate the demand in Korea, the UofT is recognized above state universities in the U.S., he said. Kim is a professor and dean of Korea University’s Graduate School of International Studies, and received his masters and doctoral degrees in sociology at UofT. The advantage of studying at a Canadian university is that students are pushed hard academically ― much more than in Korea ― and they receive theoretical grounding, critical insight and enlightened companionship that last a lifetime, according to the professor. The Korean alumni group, which has been officially registered since 2001, holds lectures, field trips, hiking trips, sports events, pub nights and year-end parties every year. It is a valuable source of networking and information-sharing, Kim said. Mark Fox, an international authority on artificial intelligence and professor of industrial engineering and computer science, gave a lecture at the reception, dubbed “Smart cities need smart citizens.” Pointing out the difficulties of having a perfect system of information communication technology in a city, Fox said it is critical to empower citizens to achieve their goals without relying on the municipal resources. As the global population increases with urbanization, the need for urban energy consumption will increase, along with welfare demands from the aging population, Fox pointed out. To address these challenges, the professor is developing artificial intelligence that will optimize the interface between citizens and the city’s electricity, water, transportation, and open government systems.

She said she is ""pleased with"" the deal.In the agreement, South Korea has secured long-term advance consent from the U.S. for early stages in experimental reprocessing, called ""Pyroprocessing,"" including ""Post-irradiation examination"" and ""Electro-reduction."" South Korean officials characterize pyroprocessing as ""recycling"" spent fuel, while it has yet to be commercialized.Pyroprocessing is said to have less chance of being converted into a program to produce nuclear weapons as it leaves separated plutonium mixed with other elements.The agreement will allow South Korean scientists to conduct research into the untested technology at existing local facilities.Besides, Seoul will be able to push for a low-enrichment program through consultations with Washington.The allies have decided to establish a high-level standing commission to consult on the sensitive issue, with the U.S. represented by its deputy secretary of energy and South Korea its vice foreign minister. After signing the agreement, U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert described it as ""reciprocal.""""It respects each other's sovereignty and it enhances our shared leadership on civil nuclear issues,"" he stressed in a statement.Amb. Park Ro-byug, who led Seoul's negotiations, also said the deal would pave the way for ""advanced and reciprocal"" cooperation.""Since South Korea and the U.S. have established a system for strategic and forward-looking cooperation in the nuclear energy sector, the alliance is expected to strengthen further,"" he told reporters.The deal, coupled with pages of agreed minutes, stipulates that South Korea has an ""inalienable right"" to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.It added the Seoul-Washington nuclear partnership will be the ""cornerstone"" of the global nuclear nonproliferation regime.The agreement will remain in force for 20 years with the two sides to extend it for five years if both wish to do so.South Korean officials said their country will be able to expand its non-military nuclear program, as it tries to increase nuclear plant exports.Park also said the deal will give a big boost to South Korea in pursuing foreign markets for export of nuclear reactors.""It is meaningful that we have opened the pathway for uranium enrichment, albeit not in the foreseeable future,"" a senior foreign ministry official said on background. ""Related criteria and procedures have been made. Industrial and technological considerations will be among key factors.""The ministry will discuss with other related authorities to decide whether the National Assembly's approval of the deal is required, he added.

Separately, KAI has already built and delivered four trainer jets to Peru.Park and her Peruvian counterpart, Ollanta Humala, watched the maiden flight of the first basic trainer jet.The two pilots of the trainer jet received training for six months in South Korea last year. Park gave red scarves to 10 pilots who attended the ceremony.The move came a day after Park and Humala agreed to cooperate in Peru's advanced trainer jet project, a move that could raise the prospect of a South Korean defense firm winning a lucrative deal.The move ""is designed to further expand mutual cooperation in high-tech aviation technology,"" Park said Monday in a joint news conference with Humala after their summit in Peru, the second stop on her four-nation swing to South America.South Korea said bilateral cooperation in the aviation industry could help Seoul and Lima make inroads into the aviation market in South America, currently dominated by Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA.The comments came as KAI is competing with foreign rivals to win a deal worth about $1 billion for Peru's next-generation light attack aircraft.KAI has offered its FA-50 supersonic jets, a light attack variant of the T-50 Golden Eagle supersonic trainer jet that was developed with U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin. It is the most-advanced variant of the T-50 family operated by the South Korean Air Force.Last year, South Korea signed a $420 million deal to export 12 FA-50 fighter jets built by KAI to the Philippines under a government-to-government deal.Separately, Park met the mayor of Lima by visiting the city halll.

YonhapPresident Park Geun-hye looks at an artifact exhibited at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History of Peru on Sunday. YonhapAt the summit held at the presidential palace in Peru’s capital, the two oversaw the signing of a number of memorandums of understanding including that of cooperation in creative economy, customs and e-governance.South Korean officials said the summit paved the way to reinforce the trade and investment cooperation as well as diversify the two nation’s high value-added exchanges in defense, security and infrastructure.Peru is the second stop on Park’s four-nation trip to South America, which is designed to boost economic ties with the region. Park’s trip will also take her to Chile and Brazil, where bilateral economic and trade cooperation is expected to be high on her agenda.At the summit, the two leaders also reportedly discussed in depth Korea’s push to export its light attack FA-50 fighter jets.Under a 2012 deal, the sole Korean aircraft manufacturer is helping Peru assemble 16 turbo-prop planes called KT-1P for the Peruvian Air Force. Separately, KAI has already built and delivered four trainers to Peru.Park’s visit comes as KAI is competing with foreign rivals to win a contract worth about $1 billion for Peru’s next generation light attack aircraft by offering its FA-50 supersonic jets.The FA-50 is a light attack variant of the T-50 Golden Eagle supersonic trainer that was codeveloped by KAI and U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin. It is the most advanced variant of the T-50 family operated by the Korean Air Force. The FA-50 has a radar warning receiver and night vision imaging, and is capable of carrying 4,500 kilograms of weapons. It also has a 20 mm cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles.The two countries are also expected to cooperate in modernizing Peru’s customs and legal administrative systems. While helping Peru establish an e-governance system, Park urged for her counterpart’s attention for wider advances by Korean companies in setting up an integrated public safety network. On Sunday, Park visited Peru’s oldest state museum Sunday on the first stop of her trip to Peru. The president took a brief tour of the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History of Peru. The museum ― once home to revolutionary hero Jose de San Martin ― houses about 300,000 Incan and pre-Incan artifacts.She also met with about a dozen representatives of Peruvian fan clubs of hallyu, or the Korean wave, a symbolic move that illustrates the growing popularity of Korean pop culture in the South American country.Korean TV shows, films and pop music have gained immense popularity in Peru and other South American countries in recent years, beyond China and Southeast Asian countries.Young Peruvians clapped their hands and greeted Park with “annyeonghaseyo,” which is “hello” in Korean, before giving her a stuffed llama doll and a silver brooch.Park’s office said more than 120 fan clubs are active in Peru and estimated their members were between 30,000 and 50,000.Later, Park had dinner with about 80 representatives from the Korean community in Peru and asked them to further promote Korean culture in the country.","talks on monday in lima ,무단 전재 재배포 금지 president ,on sunday park visited peru ,peru on sunday yonhappresident park ,delivered four trainers to peru","['Park Geun - hye', 'peruvian', 'Ollanta Humala', 'Lima', '오후(현지시간', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Museum of Archaeology , Anthropology', 'Peru', 'Park Geun', 'the National Museum of Archaeology , Anthropology', 'Peru', 'Peru', 'south korean', 'Peru', 'Park ’s', 'Chile', 'Brazil', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Peru', 'KAI', 'Peru', 'KAI', 'Peru', 'KAI', 'U.S.', 'Lockheed Martin', 'the Korean Air Force', 'Peru', 'Peru', 'Park', 'korean', 'Park', 'Peru', 'Peru', 'the National Museum of Archaeology , Anthropology', 'Peru', 'Jose de San Martin', 'incan', 'peruvian', 'korean', 'korean', 'south american', 'korean', 'Peru', 'south american', 'China', 'southeast asian', 'Peruvians', 'Park', 'Korean', 'Park ’s', 'Peru', 'korean', 'Peru', 'korean']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39601085  0.93962038

The venue was organized by the Argentine embassy and part of the Malbec World Day on April 17, which celebrates the country’s flagship grape variety through 70 events in 64 cities around the world.“Malbec is an art that expresses the essence of being Argentine ― our bond with our land as well as passion, warmth and trust in life,” Argentine Ambassador Jorge Roballo said in a speech. “With a glass of Malbec, you will get a taste of our history shaped by the European settlers, who toiled the harsh land to produce the world’s finest wine.”Malbec has a full-bodied taste due to its robust tannin structure, and goes well with Korean food, said Choi Hoon, the president of Korean Academy of Wines at the event.  From left: Thai Ambassador Kulkumut Singhara Na Ayudhaya, Uruguayan Ambassador Alba Florio Legnani, Argentine Ambassador Jorge Roballo and Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Marmazov pose at the Malbec World Day wine-tasting event at JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul on Friday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“When I visited Argentina several years ago, I witnessed a beautiful scenery of mineral-rich water melting from the snow-covered Andes Mountains and flowing into the streams and wetting the fertile land,” he said. “That the Malbec wine, despite having originated in France, now represents Argentina’s finest spirit is an undeniable reality.” The Malbec originated in Bordeaux, Cahors and Loire Valley in France, and was imported to Argentina in the mid-19th century by a French agronomist Michel Aime Pouget. With the help of Italian and French immigrants, Malbec adapted quickly to the country’s varied terroirs and developed even better than those from France, according to the Wines of Argentina, an Argentine promotional agency. Park Han-wool, an employee at the Ola Restaurant in Some Sevit in Seoul, who participated in the event, said Malbec is known as a high-end wine among Korean connoisseurs. “People come to the restaurant with good knowledge of wines compared to five years ago, when they simply ordered the restaurant’s recommendation,” she told The Korea Herald. “Thanks to the wine comics, ‘Droplets of God’ by Japanese animation writer Shin Kibayashi, many Korean wine-lovers are gaining insight into the complex world of wine-drinking.” These days, more people order wine to go along with Korean dishes instead of Korean drinks, she noted. Twelve importing companies from 16 wineries presented wine varieties at the event: Kooksoondang, Keumyang International, Kiljin International, Les Vins de Maeil, Lotte Liquor, Luvincorea, Mendoza Wine Korea, Shindong Wine, Shinsegae L&B;, LB Wine, Winell and World Wine.

One such analog product group through which Koreans are finding a nostalgic reprieve from digital information overload is toys.Toys are no longer just for kids. The toy market dedicated to Korean adults alone is an estimated 700 billion won ($639.1 million) industry that is rising at an annual rate of 20 percent, according to local reports.Song Dong-ho runs Seung Jin Toy in Seoul, specializing in Lego products. (Yoon Sarah/The Korea Herald)Adults enjoying hobbies considered more suited to children ― dubbed by local media as “kidults” ― are behind the steady growth.Mostly men in their 30s and 40s are paying for often expensive toy products and joining online communities to discuss their shared interests, particularly in Lego sets, robot, action figurines and drones.A popular Lego online community, Brick Nara, has over 120,000 active members who share and give feedback on each other’s toys and constructions. A quick search yields about 3,000 such online communities of mainly adult members in Korea.One successful corporate businessman surnamed Kim, who is in his 40s, said he waits for the weekends, not just to rest, but also to play with his “quadcopter” drone.K-pop singers like Kim Dong-wan, 35, from boy group Shinhwa, have also joined the growing number of men flying drones during their leisure time.Kim Mun-cho, a professor in sociology at Korea University, said in an interview last month, “As fixed preconceptions about adults behaving like adults and children behaving like children erode, the recreational culture for adults is expanding in various directions.”Photo taken at Milan’s Lego Village during an event promoting manual and analog products, May 10, 2014 (123RF)Korea, together with Japan, has the most Toys “R” Us stores in Asia, with almost 100 licensed outlets of the toy store retailer operating across the country.Limited edition Lego sets that sell out in stores are often resold at higher prices online as second hand products or collectors’ items.Seoul’s historic Dongdaemun wholesale toy and stationery market, which is a 60-year-old alleyway containing some 125 jam-packed shops, is a hidden gem among adult and children toy devotees.A staff member named Seol Chang-wook, who works at Daekwang PR, a shop specializing in drones and remote-controlled cars, said that about a quarter of daily customers are men, mostly in their late 40s.“Some adults become personally interested in toys after initially intending to buy them for children,” said Seol.The most successful shop in the market is Seung Jin Toy, which specially retails Lego toy products, chalking up annual sales of 3 billion won ($2.7 million) and attracting over 1,000 visitors daily.“Children these days don’t have that much time to play because of their studies, but parents are still willing to enhance their creativity through toys,” said Song Dong-ho, who runs the store. Sales tend to peak on Children’s Day, Christmas and children’s birthdays.Song said toy sales have grown tenfold in the 30 years since he first opened the business in the early 1980s, though it suffered a downturn during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.Near the area, Art Toy Culture 2015, a three-day toy fair and exhibition, is underway at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul. The cultural event offers a glimpse into global toy design trends, with works on show by 150 toy designers both from Korea and abroad.Art Toy Culture 2015 builds on the success of its precedent last year, which drew about 42,000 visitors and sold 1 billion won ($913,000) in toys over a five-day run.On a larger scale, Korea is currently constructing the world’s biggest Legoland theme park attraction in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, which is scheduled to open in March 2017.Legoland Korea, which will also be the world’s first to be located on an island, is part of Chuncheon city’s wider efforts to market itself as a “future global children’s city,” attracting investment from toy companies across the world.In the meantime, the penchant for analog toys among adults and children shows no sign of waning ― if anything, it is fueling fresh energy into the global market.As one example, Lego is developing its hybrid analog-digital lines, Fusion and Mindstorms, which both incorporate digital technology, as play trends evolve in an increasingly digitized age.By Yoon Sarah  (sarah356@heraldcorp.com)","and drones popular lego online ,drones popular lego online ,drones popular lego online community ,korea is flooded with digital ,2017 legoland korea which will","['South Korea', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Song Dong - ho', 'Seung Jin Toy', 'Seoul', 'Lego', 'Yoon Sarah', 'Korea', 'Lego', 'Lego', 'Brick Nara', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'Kim Dong - wan', 'Shinhwa', 'Kim Mun - cho', 'Korea University', 'Lego Village', 'Japan', 'Lego', 'Seoul', 'dongdaemun', 'Seol Chang - wook', 'Seol', 'Seung Jin Toy', 'Lego', 'Song Dong - ho', 'Children ’s Day', 'Song', 'asian', 'Art Toy Culture 2015', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Legoland', 'Chuncheon', 'Gangwon Province', 'Chuncheon city ’s', 'Lego', 'Fusion and Mindstorms', 'Yoon Sarah']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.68972474  0.72160041

Children play soccer nearby. Cars skate past every few minutes. It is spring again.It was serene and peaceful, thought Lee Hye-gyung, owner of a small laundry shop on Danwon Street in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, a working-class town just south of Seoul. Lee went about her usual work of ironing shirts and knitting and patching clothing.Just two blocks from her small shop is Danwon High School, where her two children once attended. Her daughter has now gone to college. But her son Jun Hyun-tak has gone to heaven.She stared at the school from her shop window just as she has thousands of times before, during brief pauses in an interview last week.Why. Why him. Why now. Why me. Why, Lee had asked.Hyun-tak drowned in the Sewol ferry disaster on April 16 last year. He was on the 6,825-ton passenger ferry Sewol when it capsized in waters off Korea’s Jindo Island, South Jeolla Province. Families of Sewol disaster victims weep as they offer flowers to the waters off Jindo, South Jeolla Province, Wednesday. (Yonhap)Over 300 people died, 250 of them students from Danwon on a school trip. The ferry was on a routine trip from Incheon to Jejudo Island.The New York Times called it one of Korea’s “worst peacetime disasters.” The Financial Times said it signaled a “need for broad reform of South Korea’s safety regulations.” Korean opposition lawmakers called it a “massacre.” Prosecutors here called it a “murder.”Victims’ families, including Lee, call it a man-made calamity.Whatever it was, the Sewol disaster is an ongoing matter, Lee said. One year on from the tragedy, nine people remain missing. Lee still has questions about the disaster’s causes and government rescue efforts, such as who allegedly erased her son’s cellphone records from the day of the disaster.“I visit the school every now and then to remember him. I go to his classroom to miss him, now that he’s gone,” Lee said. She spoke calmly, sometimes whispering, sometimes pausing to cry. “I had rarely, if ever, visited the school before the accident.” It was Hyun-tak’s birthday the day before the accident, she added after a brief moment of silence. He would have turned 18 this year.Danwon Street in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. (Jeong Hunny/The Korea Herald)Calm before the stormIt had been foggy at Incheon Harbor on the evening of April 15 last year on Hyun-tak’s 17th birthday. The Sewol was docked at the port and ready to go once the fog dispersed. At about 9 p.m., port officials announced the ship would sail.“We went out to the harbor to eat dinner,” said Choi Eun-soo, one of the survivors. Choi was among the dozens of truck drivers who were familiar passengers on the ship, as they transported cargo between the mainland and Jejudo Island regularly. They had loaded their vehicles on the ship that night and had been waiting.“(We) were just killing time on the port,” Choi said.It was around that time that Choi and the other drivers saw the Danwon High School students for the first time.“The kids were extremely noisy that night,” remembered Park Yong-woon, another driver who was on the Sewol. “They boarded the ship about that time (when port officials said the Sewol would sail). Probably excited, I guess, about their trip.”Hyun-tak talked to his mother over the phone for the last time, some minutes after he and his classmates boarded.“I’m eating dinner on the ship now, Mom,” he said.“So the ship’s sailing as planned, despite the fog?” Lee asked.“Yes, Mom.”The night went by relatively peacefully, according to survivors. Nothing appeared out of the ordinary, they added. The fog didn’t appear to be an issue.They all went to sleep in their cabins.Disaster strikesIt was after breakfast the next morning at about 8:49 a.m. when disaster struck.“I remember falling against the wall hard,” said Jeon Byung-sam, another driver on the ship. “I was walking in the hallway when the ship suddenly turned. I fell through my cabin door and lost consciousness after hitting the wall.”Jeon relayed his story at a bedside interview last week in a psychiatric hospital in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.Jeon had fallen because the Sewol had begun listing portside after an undertrained crewmember manning the ship turned it sharply starboard. Portside refers to the ship’s left and starboard the right.The ballast water in the ship that should have rebalanced it was insufficient, containing only 580 tons, less than 40 percent of its legal requirement. The Chonghaejin Marine Co., the Sewol’s operator, had removed some of the water to load the ship with commercial cargo, apparently to gain more revenue. The overloaded cargo weighed as much as twice its legal limit, prosecutors said. The shipping company had also constructed additional cabins on the ship’s upper floors, worsening its balance.Despite the ferry’s listing, the crew told passengers to stay in their cabins through on-ship broadcasts. Captain Lee Jun-seok, who has been charged with murder and negligent homicide, testified he feared the swift currents would sweep away those who jumped ship.But Lee himself abandoned the ferry once the Coast Guard arrived on the scene at about 9:30 a.m. He allegedly failed to issue evacuation orders before leaving the ferry in his underpants.By then the ship had listed about 60 degrees, making it difficult to climb out. Those on the upper side threw down fire hoses to aid people stuck on the ship’s sinking side, according to Choi.“That’s all we had. When we asked the Coast Guard officers for ropes, they said they didn’t have any.”Most of the students stayed in their cabins as told, even as water began seeping in. Those stuck inside the sinking Sewol knocked on their cabins’ windows, helplessly asking for rescuers to break them open, survivors said.Only a few stuck inside made it out alive.“I can still see the students banging on the ship’s windows,” Jeon said. The unconscious Jeon had woken once the cold sea water began flowing into his cabin. He climbed out his cabin door and jumped into a nearby rescue boat, despite his injured arm.Jeon Byung-sam. (Jeong Hunny/The Korea Herald)“For months after the accident, I saw the students in front of my hospital bed. Every time, it took me five minutes or so to realize I was hallucinating,” Jeon said. Park remembers offering his jacket to one of the rescued students after they were pulled from the sinking ship.“The kids reminded me of my grandchildren,” the 63-year-old driver said. “Those kids...” he murmured before pausing to wipe away tears during an interview last week. “The nightmares are worse. I dream about those students who I remember weren’t able to get out,” he recalled.Park Yong-woon. (Jeong Hunny/The Korea Herald)The long waitIt was May 1 when divers found Hyun-tak.Lee had spent day and night for two weeks at Jindo Island, the nearest administrative district to the disaster scene. Families of the victims, emotionally drained from erroneous news reports and slipshod countermeasures by the authorities, prayed for a miracle. But they knew.“I had prayed to my deceased father-in-law to please save Hyun-tak and please not to take him away from me. I said I was sorry, that it was I who had done wrong,” she recalled.Parents and families of the missing spent the night huddled at Jindo harbor, waiting for any sign of more survivors. Others waited at the Jindo gym, the only indoor structure large enough to house hundreds in the rural county.Some parents hoped that the doors on the sunken Sewol had shut closed, keeping those stuck inside able to breathe in small air pockets. Two divers died during the salvage operations in the months after the accident.The overheated news coverage sparked criticism when some asked controversial questions to survivors. Victims’ relatives yelled and threw water bottles at cameramen. Some hurled expletives. Veteran New York Times reporter Choe Sang-hun said it wasn’t easy covering the scene.“When I first began reporting for a foreign news outlet, the Sampoong Department Store collapsed (in downtown Seoul),” Choe said, referring to the 1995 disaster that left 501 dead.“That incident was bigger than (the Sewol disaster) in terms of lives lost.”“But it was tougher for me to cover (the Sewol disaster), going around and asking the victims’ families. There are bound to be families wanting to mourn in peace,” he added.Jindo Harbor. Locals call the harbor by its old name, Paengmok Harbor. (Jeong Hunny/The Korea Herald)An unwanted aftermathThe accident left survivors and bereaved families scarred and perplexed, despite two investigations into the disaster.Prosecutorial investigations into the Sewol’s crew, the Chonghaejin Marine Co., and maritime regulators resulted in more than a hundred people being punished. Authorities blamed regulators for condoning repeated safety violations by Chonghaejin officials, such as overloading the Sewol and taking out large quantities of ballast water. They also charged the crew with abandoning the Sewol while leaving passengers on board.Coast Guard officer Kim Kyung-il, one of the first rescuers on the scene, was found guilty in a district court for not urging passengers to try and leave the ship until it was too late. Judges added that Kim had rewritten parts of his ship’s log on the day of the accident to hide botched rescue efforts.Prosecutors have also indicted governing Saenuri Party Rep. Park Sang-eun for allegedly receiving kickbacks from Korea Shipping Association regulators after the Sewol incident.The lawyer for imprisoned Coast Guard officer Kim said to judges in January that officials had used his client as a scapegoat by dumping the responsibility of the government’s failed rescue operations onto Kim.A government-sponsored investigation will conduct a third probe into the disaster. Victims’ families assert the panel must probe the presidential office and the Ministry of Oceans Fisheries, two bureaus they feel that the previous investigations failed to look into. But observers say it will be difficult as the departments are responsible for the investigation’s budget and mandate.Debate continues over how to raise the Sewol from the water. It currently lies about 40 meters under the Maengol channel, a 90-minute boat-ride from Jindo Island. The bereaved say the Sewol must be salvaged to find the nine missing bodies. They have refused to take reparation payments until the nine have been found. Evidence suggesting foul play by officials or regulators must also be uncovered, they add. Officials expect salvage operations to cost at least 100 billion won, and likely much more. But the families also face criticism that they should wait for officials to conclude reparation payments and salvage operations, as the nation’s grief turned into exhaustion.“Enough is enough,” said one taxi driver in Ansan. “All the street rallies and all the publicity will do little to solve the families’ demands.” He added that “many” of the taxi drivers who had ferried the victims’ families between Jindo Island and Ansan without charge in the days after the maritime disaster were frustrated.“Some (families) treated us like we were their private drivers,” he said. The driver said an unseen rift has appeared in Ansan, dividing residents between those who sympathized with the bereaved families, and those who did not.Residents on Jindo Island have urged officials to salvage the ship, not just for the sake of the bereaved, but for the sake of their livelihoods. The pollution from the shipwreck has crippled the rich fishing ground around Jindo Island, residents and officials at the Jindo County Office said.“Fishermen here used to sell their catch at the markets in Seomang, but the merchants there stopped buying our fish after the accident,” said Kim Ju-wan, a taxi driver on Jindo Island.(Watch Kim explain how the tragedy crippled Jindo's economy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s19kCkC5yQc)Jindo County, South Jeolla Province. (Jeong Hunny/The Korea Herald)Rim Bo-sub, chief of Jindo County’s tourism planning section, said the shipwreck has killed the tourism industry.“As long as the ship is there, it will stick out as a symbol of the Sewol disaster,” Rim said, “as if the accident never ended. And as long as it never ends, our town is going to be about mourning.”At Jindo Harbor, photos and the names of those missing hang on the walls of the makeshift homes housing their families.Left aloneLee said she considered selling her shop and moving away from Ansan after losing her son.“But I remember telling Hyun-tak I would always be here at the laundry shop, no matter what,” she said. “I can’t leave because of that.”“Now Hyun-tak’s friends who survived the sinking come and visit,” Lee said.“Every time they come, I repress the urge to ask them what they remember about Hyun-tak, about the last moments. I repress that urge because I fear I might hurt them.”Every once in a while, she spots one of Hyun-tak’s friends. “I see him every now and then on this street. But I look away every time our eyes meet. He does, too. We’re both scared ... I guess I remind him about the sinking, just as he reminds me about my son.”Lee Hye-gyung.

The six-day WWF is the world's largest water event in which world leaders, experts, business officials and activist groups gather to discuss political and technological aspects of global concerns regarding water shortage issues. Various sessions were held to discuss ways to resolve water-related issues in the southeastern cities of Daegu and Gyeongju, with specialists and scholars sharing advanced technologies to manage water use and supply.Speaking at the opening of a ministerial meeting, South Korea's Land, Infrastructure and Transport Minister Yoo Il-ho stressed the need for global cooperation to resolve the water issue.""Water is crucial for the existence and prosperity of mankind, but many parts of the world are suffering from difficulties related to water shortages,"" he said. ""The problem should be tackled by the entire world, not by one country.""""This year marks the final timeline for the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, and so the 7th WWF holds a very significant meaning. We should come up with meaningful outcomes that can be applied to help achieve those development goals."" Yoo said.Some 100 ministers and other politicians from different countries took part in the political process of the session, and discussed problems regarding water sustainability, management and safety, among other issues. Also during the political process, ministers from South Korea, Japan and China vowed to further boost trilateral cooperation in tackling issues related to water and agreed to share their know-how with others in overcoming such problems. ""We share the recognition that water policy innovation and reform should be promoted by each country in order to strengthen the core role of water resource in sustainable development, improve synergy among relevant government agencies and relevant stakeholders, enhance the resilience of water infrastructure and attract more financial investment into the water sector,"" the ministers said in a joint statement released by Seoul's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.This year's event also includes sessions on the science and technological aspects of the global issues, which the event's organizers say is a first for the WWF, which first began in 1997. Discussions for local and regional authorities also began on the same day, where participants gathered to analyze ongoing water shortage issues for different parts of the world.

The percentage was more than twice the comparable figure of 11.3 percent for adults.The study was conducted last year on 15,000 South Koreans aged 10-59. It defines those who have difficulty in their everyday lives due to dependency on smartphones as the addition-prone group.By age, the portion of addiction-prone smartphone users in their 20s came to 19.6 percent, with such respondents in their 30s, 40s, and 50s coming to 11.3 percent, 7.9 percent, and 4.8 percent, respectively.Middle-school students were more likely to be addicted to smartphones than other groups, while children from double-income families were more inclined to become addicted.More than half of the teenagers responded that smartphones distract them from studying, while 51.7 percent said that spending a lot of time on smartphones has become a habit. Another 49.6 percent said they become jittery when not using smartphones, according to the findings.To deal with the issue of smartphone addiction, the ministry said it will provide related education programs at schools, and issue counseling guidelines for high-risk students.The government also plans to provide teenagers from low-income bracket households with an incentive of up to 500,000 won ($456) to receive special treatments from hospitals in case of serious addictions.Meanwhile, the survey also showed that the respondents spent 256.5 minutes on smartphones everyday, while the addiction-prone group put in 318.5 minutes.Mobile messengers accounted for 40.3 percent of the time, followed by news with 37.2 percent and games with 21.7 percent,according to the survey.

In an interview with The Korea Herald, three senior officials engaged in the U.N.-led process explored the significance of the new framework, which will be hammered out at a summit in September to fight poverty and achieve more environmentally friendly growth for the next 15 years. The diplomats include Shin Dong-ik, deputy minister for multilateral and global affairs at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry; Wu Hongbo, a Chinese representative who serves as undersecretary-general for the Department of Economic and Social Affairs at the U.N. and secretary-general for the Third International Conference on Financing for Development; and Martin Sajdik, president of the Economic and Social Council at the U.N. and permanent representative of Austria to the U.N. in New York.Korea, for its part, is seeking to beef up its contribution to the global efforts as it gradually expands official development assistant outlays as an emerging donor. While stressing the need for future monitoring and execution on the ground, the diplomats pinned high hope on Seoul’s support, such as through the incoming leadership of the U.N.’s ECOSOC tasked with overseeing its implementation of the “historic” agenda for all 193 member states.The following are excerpts from the interview with the three officials on the sidelines of the U.N. Development Cooperation Forum in Songdo, Incheon on Thursday. The Korea Herald: What are the key questions to be tackled in today’s forum, and what is your expectation for the results and deliverables of the event?Wu Hongbo: The international community, through the United Nations, has massively advanced to embrace sustainability in future development. Other national governments have caught up with the phase. As a solo operation is no longer effective, we have to tear down the barriers between the different departments. That’s number one. Secondly, the resources to be used for sustainability will be huge. Where do we get these resources? This is a question bound for everybody. So in addition to traditional ODA, we need to have more players on-board, like international public and private financing…Shin Dong-ik (right), deputy minister for multilateral and global affairs at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry; Wu Hongbo (left), undersecretary-general for the Department of Economic and Social Affairs at the U.N.; and Martin Sajdik, president of the Economic and Social Council at the U.N. and permanent representative of Austria to the U.N. in New York, speak during an interview with The Korea Herald on the sidelines of the U.N. Development Cooperation Forum in Songdo, Incheon on Thursday. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)They have also been talking about the monitoring and follow-up system. This is very important. When we talk about the Millennium Development Goals, we stopped short about the means of implementation and monitoring and follow-up mechanisms. This time, these are not forgotten. Let’s say you have a good idea and a good plan. But you have no money, and no means of implementation, then this makes it empty talk. But this time, the international community is really serious about this. Martin Sajdik: Some of your readers may think this is nave. There is a gap. But at the end of September, the leaders of the world will come to New York and adopt this agenda. Now this will mean that you have 193 nave presidents and nave prime ministers who are as nave as those diplomats and officials that talk to you now. So this is not the case. These ladies and gentlemen know what they’re doing. This is all in all real politics. The problem for many politicians is when they adopt this (kind of agenda) their people would want, they will hopefully be accountable. ― Have you put that in place? What have you been doing?...One of the 193 targets is that you have to have birth certificates in every country. This is very concrete. In Austria, we have birth certificates. But in other countries in the world, they have none. If you don’t have birth certificates, you are nobody. You cannot go to school or register, and what kind of life do you have? So it makes a lot of sense to have targets, the 193 targets. It’s very important to understand what is behind it. Wu: Some developing countries worry that the unfinished business of MDGs may be forgotten as the attention is switched to SDGs. That is an unnecessary worry because as we set it from the beginning, the unfinished business of MDGs will be carried over to the SDGs. One of the important pillars of future sustainable development is the eradication of poverty. I think people understand that it is important to bring people out of poverty. In the new agenda, we have a target that by 2030, basically we will eradicate extreme poverty in the world. This is encouraging because as the secretary general has said, we will have that done in our generation. I think no generation in human history was able to say that. KH: How do you assess the contribution of Korea in promoting the Millennium Development Goals and the role it can play in the post-2015 era? Shin Dong-ik: In today’s meeting, I reminded them about the track record and history that we only joined the United Nations in 1991 after becoming an independent country in 1945, which was very late to join the U.N. system. We joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee as a new donor member in only 2010, so everyone knows our history in development cooperation is not long enough. But we’d like to be a modest contributor and a new emerging donor in the world development field. We’d like to increase the volume of our official development assistance modestly, but consistently and continually. So far, the total volume of our ODA is $2.3 billion and this year it will be a little higher than that…From our side, Korea has more interest in priority in the area of rural development, the environment, education and monitoring issues. Now we have the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets, but we don’t know how the final document and agreement will be made based on the SDGs. Anyhow, we have our own interest areas so we will make efforts to contribute positively and constructively in reaching an agreement on the final goals and post-2015 agenda. Wu: Korea has been a very important member of the United Nations; it has demonstrated its leadership in multilateral areas in many ways, hosting this DCF for example. The next president of ECOSOC is the Korean permanent representative in New York. That is a crucial period; just two months before the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda and the initial periods of implementation of this historic development agenda. Under the leadership of Korea, ECOSOC can play a unique role in implementing the new agenda.KH: What are the lessons learned from Korea’s development, how they could help shape up the post-2015 agenda? Shin: First, we need to enhance country ownership and capacity building. In today’s session, we agreed to make this effort to strengthen national ownership and capacity building. The mindset is a co-value of people, and political will, based on strong mindsets, is another important area to realize our common goals. Without providing adequate training and education, it seems to be very difficult to achieve the goals to strengthen the ownership and capacity building. Another part is that for a more innovative partnership, we will need to mobilize all the available resource and actors to push forward our SDGs and post-2015 agenda. This is not new ― global partnership and international innovative partnership is a common agenda. And lastly, as I mentioned as the participants agreed in Busan, we need to reflect this important concept of monitoring and accountability system within the GPEDC (the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation in Busan in 2011) and the existing U.N. system. Hopefully the final document on development cooperation, as well as financing development in Addis Ababa the concept of the GPEDC monitoring mechanism, will be in place for the next 15 years. These three areas are nothing new, but very important basics to implement the post-2015 agenda.KH: What are the steps that ECOSOC has taken to help prepare for the post-2015 development agenda and the role that the council would play in implementing it? Sajdik: ECOSOC has undergone a major reform that was decided upon two years ago by the General Assembly. It was designed to make ECOSOC a real player in the post-2015 development agenda as a unifying platform for implementation and general policymaking and the review. Under the auspices of ECOSOC, there is the so-called high-level political forum to give ultimate political guidance and recommendations for policies to take on the implementation of the post-2015 agenda. This sounds all very technical; but in reality it is not really technical. It is all about the implementation on the ground. You have to understand that this post-2015 development agenda is completely unique. I have said in my speech today that this is unparalleled in history. It is an agenda for all 193 member countries on sustainable development. It is an unbelievable undertaking. It is not only on development assistance but also on sustainable development for the whole world…I think the contribution of ECOSOC in the future will be much more permanent and visible, and it will be under the presidency of Korea. My successor from the end of July on will be Ambassador Oh Joon, who is now already one of the vice presidents of ECOSOC. KH: What do you think would be the key inputs of DCF in preparing for the post-2015 agenda? Sajdik: Since Monterrey (the 2002 U.N. conference on financing for development in Mexico), we have been moving from an ODA-centered approach toward development. We speak about different resources for development and resources coming from the business sector. ODA cannot cover all the costs of development in developing countries. I think a lot of discussions are around what are other means of finances; how we can build enough trust in the business sector to be an honest and fair partner in the deliberations; is it in the interest of the business sector to be a partner?; and so on … Leading companies have understood very well ― without sustainable development, they will be out of business. If we continue development like what it is, they will lose that business. KH: One of the key questions that is being discussed at the symposium is the allocation of ODA in the post-2015 era. What do you think should be the top priorities?Wu: As far as ODA is concerned, I think we have to recognize the importance of the contribution made by the ODA, in particular in the economic growth of the least developed countries. They constitute a major part of their budgets for development. Traditional donors have suffered economic setbacks and difficulties… From my point-of-view, ODA will continue to be very important as public financing will leverage more resources in developing countries. But ODA is not enough because the resources required for development worldwide are very big … In addition, we have to be innovative. This morning we also had discussions about how to align different approaches in mobilizing financial resources.

""Both advanced and developing countries should make water-related challenges an opportunity for economic growth.""  The United Nations warns on its website that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water-stressed conditions.  Park pledged to increase support for resolving the water shortage problem by boosting cooperation with international organizations such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Green Growth Institute.  She also proposed setting up the so-called ""K-Water Program"" that calls for Seoul to provide its water-management know-how to developing nations.  Forum participants are expected to discuss a variety of issues, including climate change, disaster relief and energy. High-ranking government officials also will have roundtable discussions to hammer out government-level solutions to water shortages.  Other programs, such as the Water Showcase, in which a contest is held to find creative ways to solve water-related issues, as well as a Citizen's Forum with members from 150 institutions from 34 countries, will be held on the sidelines of the WWF, organizers said.

Cities also vowed to better implement the Compact of Mayors proclaimed at the United Nations Climate Summit in September last year. The compact addresses cities’ pledges to raise their commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 454 megatons by 2020. At the forum, five cities ― Paris and Nantes of France, Montreal of Canada, Johannesburg of South Africa and San Rafael of Argentina ― presented their green projects and vowed to strengthen their anti-carbon drives. The Seoul Action Plan and the Seoul Declaration will be delivered to the U.N. Climate Change Conference, or COP 21, which will be held in December in Paris. Countries are likely to declare a new landmark agreement on post-2020 emissions cut targets at the Paris talks. The COP 21 aims at limiting the global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which critics consider as the threshold for climate change. After the forum, the host city held an event dubbed “Seoul on Stage” to promote its three flagship green projects including the “One Less Nuclear Power Plant,” a scheme pushed to reduce energy consumption by as much as one nuclear power plant’s capacity by developing renewable energy. Seoul City pledged earlier this week to cut emissions by 40 percent by 2030 under its statement “Promise of Seoul.” In the meantime, Seoul City won the Global Earth Hour Capital Award of the Earth Hour Challenge Awards for its efforts in seeking sustainability-focused projects to make a greener city, officials said. Seoul City competed with 162 other municipalities. The EHCC Award, run by World Wide Fund for Nature in collaboration with ICLEI, promotes low-carbon cities and efficient use of renewable energy. Seoul City has hosted the five-day congress from Wednesday under the theme of “Sustainable Solutions for an Urban Future” with some 240 city representatives and 250 officials from international bodies.

Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties 21 in an aim to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius. This is to mark the first agreement joined by both developed states and developing countries. More than 30 countries, including European Union members and the U.S., submitted their cut plans as of last month, with more countries to unveil their schemes soon. South Korea has not submitted its plan yet. The cities will come up with more concrete plans to achieve the objectives of the declaration at the World Mayors Council on Climate Change on Friday. Five cities ― Paris and Nantes of France, Montreal of Canada, Johannesburg of South Africa and San Rafael of Argentina ― will also announce their own specific plans on cutting emissions, ICLEI officials said. The Seoul Declaration and the cities’ specific plans will be delivered to the COP 21.

Seoul Metropolitan Government has run the campaign “One Less Nuclear Power Plant” since 2012 to reduce the energy dependence on nuclear power by developing renewable energy sources.Having few options for alternative sources, South Korea depends on nuclear power for 31 percent of its energy needs, according to government statistics. The capital’s energy self-sufficiency rate also remains at 2.95 percent.With a goal of cutting energy consumption by 2 million TOE (tons of oil equivalent) by 2014, the city expanded the number of mini solar power plants installed at houses and offices, and replaced indoor light bulbs with energy-efficient LEDs.  This photo shows a 1.2-megawatt solar power plant constructed in 2013 at Gangseo farmers market in western Seoul. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)The city also carried out the Eco Mileage program, which offers incentives to those who save electricity. More than 1.5 million citizens have actively joined the program so far. As a result, energy consumption in Seoul decreased by 2.04 million TOE six months earlier than expected, and the greenhouse gas emissions fell by 5.6 million tons. The energy self-supply rate also rose to 4 percent last year, the city said. Seoul City is now pushing to offset carbon emissions by 20 million tons by 2030, which would be a 40 percent decline compared to 2005, while eyeing to increase the energy self-sufficiency rate to 20 percent by 2020. Along with the flagship energy-saving project, the city has been carrying out a large-scale public transportation campaign since 2004 to attract more passengers to use buses and subway. The city constructed bus lanes across the capital to offer faster travel. It also introduced a public transfer system which allows passengers to transfer between buses and the subway lines without extra charges. For better air quality, the city replaced some 7,000 diesel-powered buses with compressed natural gas-fueled buses.In the meantime, the capital is planning to construct 10 light rail lines to reduce blind spots in its subway and bus network by 2025, the city said.Along with energy-saving plans and the transportation scheme, the urban regeneration project is another flagship policy of Seoul City for a sustainable future.The capital is attempting to provide tailored urban development measures based on the characteristics of each region for sake of sustainability. It is seeking to transform 27 regions in the capital into specialized areas under specific themes. For example, an old industrialized region Janganpyeong in eastern Seoul will turn into an environment-friendly town by 2017. By constructing the country’s first-ever upcycling center ― a 16,500-square-meter building for green start-ups and recyclable material sales ― the city will promote the culture of reusing, recycling and upcycling. The existing used car market and water sewage museum in the region will also be used for this purpose, the city said. About 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) is to be injected in the overall urban regeneration project, it added.

Currently, some 28,500 soldiers are here to deter aggressions from North Korea.  ""The defense ministry has a plan to set up the group for the American service personnel who had served here,"" a senior Seoul official said on condition of anonymity. ""The entity, expected to be set up in the U.S., is tentatively named, the Korea Defense Veterans Association.""  ""We are planning to raise the issue during the upcoming Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue and to ask for support from the U.S. government,"" he said, citing the high-level bilateral meeting slated for April 14-15 in Washington.   ""It will be a chance to thank the veterans for their commitment to peace on the Korean Peninsula,"" the official said, adding Seoul expects them to play a key role ""in opening the future of mutual prosperity.""  During the planned talks next week, the two sides are also to discuss ways to further boost coordination to deter and counter threats from the communist North.  The seventh KIDD will be followed by the two-day deputy minister-level talks of the Defense Trilateral Talks between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan in Washington starting April 16.   ""On the occasion of the planned trilateral meeting, we will once again make it clear and strongly deliver our stance to Japan that Dokdo is South Korea's territory by history, geography and international law,"" the official said.   Japan has renewed its claim to South Korea's eastern most islets of Dokdo in the East Sea, worsening the already-frayed Seoul-Tokyo relations.  ""We, however, are to hold the trilateral talks as planned, as efforts to boost security cooperation should be pushed for, apart from historic issues,"" the official added.  During the DTT, the three countries are expected to discuss ways to increase cooperation on missile defense, information sharing and other matters of mutual interest.

Seoul City is hosting the five-day International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives World Congress 2015 at Dongdaemun Design Plaza, eastern Seoul, in an aim to urge better cooperation for a sustainable future. It is the first time a Korean city has held the ICLEI’s flagship assembly.ICLEI, the world’s largest municipality network comprised of over 1,000 cities from 87 countries, seeks collective efforts to lead a sustainable future and curb global climate change. Launched in 1990, the organization has focused on cutting carbon emissions. Over 50 Korean cities have joined the international body, including Seoul, Incheon, Busan and Jeju City.  Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon (center) and other participants clap after unveiling the sculpture for the civic campaign “Reducing 1 Ton of Greenhouse Gas Per Person” at Seoul Plaza on Friday. (Yonhap)A total of 203 city representatives, including Paris, Tokyo and Guangzhou, and over 250 officials from international bodies will participate in the assembly. It is the most participants in the ICLEI’s history, the city said. Guests include high-ranking officials such as Joan Clos, executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Program and Yvo De Boer, director general of the Global Green Growth Institute. Under the theme “Sustainable Solutions for an Urban Future,” the ninth event will provide opportunities to share each city’s green initiatives and seek ways to boost the municipality’s role in solving global issues. The triennial assembly mainly consists of seven plenary sessions, eight sub-plenary sessions and 28 small roundtable talks. The plenary sessions will discuss global climate change issues and examine solutions for sustainable regional development. The sub-plenary sessions cover various issues, from strategies for local water security to post-2015 agendas, the city said. The small roundtable talks will devise plans on how to practically motivate municipalities to fulfill their roles in eight agendas. These include sustainable city; resilient city; biodiverse city; low-carbon city; resource-efficient city; smart urban infrastructure; green urban economy; and healthy and happy community. At the opening ceremony Wednesday, several key officials will deliver high-level addresses. Three speakers will include Ibrahim Thiaw, deputy executive director of the U.N. Development Program; Michele Sabban, president of R20 Regions of Climate Action; and Xinsheng Zhang, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. On Thursday, the congress will open with a keynote speech from climate change expert Jorgen Randers on “2052 ― A Global Forecast for the Next 40 Years.” Randers is a climate strategy professor at BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo, Norway, and a member of the Club of Rome. He is also a coauthor of “The Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update.”After the speech, city participants will adopt the ICLEI Seoul Declaration, which will underline the municipalities’ efforts toward reaching the goals addressed in the Compact of Mayors. The compact, which was settled in the U.N. Climate Summit in September last year, addresses cities’ pledges to scale up their commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 454 megatons by 2020.The declaration will also urge countries to agree on new post-2020 targets and take stronger action to reduce carbon emissions. The joint efforts of municipal governments against climate change have been considered crucial as curb countries around the world are preparing to step up their anti-carbon measures to meet their new post-2020 targets.More than 30 countries, including the U.S., Mexico and the Europe Union members, submitted their detailed pledges to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in the form of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions last month ahead of the Paris talks later this year. In December, countries will finalize their post-2020 targets for cutting the carbon emission at the U.N. Climate Change Conference, or the Conference of the Parties 21 in Paris. The talks are intended to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius ― which experts consider as the threshold for dangerous climate change. This will mark the first time that developing countries will join the new agreement. The Kyoto Protocol in 1997 only required developed states to curb emissions. In the World Mayors Council on Climate Change on Friday, municipalities will negotiate on how to expand participation in the Compact of Mayors and enhance accountability. As part of efforts to support the countries’ initiatives, the ICLEI members will deliver the Seoul Declaration and their specific plans for COP 21. The closing plenary session Friday will conclude with a keynote speech by Yolanda Kakabadse Navarro, president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, over the municipality’s role in curbing climate change. Along with the sessions, the Seoul City government will promote its three flagship anti-climate change projects at the event “Seoul on Stage.” The host city will introduce its eco-friendly transportation system, urban regeneration project and the “One Less Nuclear Power Plant” project ― an energy-saving project that aims to reduce energy consumption as much as the capacity of one nuclear power plant by developing renewable energy. Right after “Seoul on Stage,” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon will announce the “Promise of Seoul” ― a comprehensive strategy against climate change in 36 categories ― to clarify the city’s practical role and responsibility for deterring climate change. The comprehensive plan was outlined based on suggestions from the Korean public, which were reviewed by experts, the city said. The major goal of the strategy is to reduce the city’s carbon emissions by 10 million tons or 25 percent from the 2005 level by 2020, and further cut emissions by 20 million tons until 2030, it added. The comprehensive plan has beenwell received by the public, officials said. A number of civic groups launched a campaign called “Reducing 1 Ton of Greenhouse Gas per Person” last year to urge the public to work on reducing emissions in their daily lives. More than 800,000 citizens have signed up to take part in the anti-carbon move, they added. On the sidelines of the Congress, Seoul City will also ink memorandums of understanding with 10 foreign cities to boost policy sharing, especially in the issues of waste management, sewage treatment and air quality management. As part of efforts to support the local green industry, the city will hold a special meeting to bridge local environmentally friendly companies with overseas counterparts, the city said. A number of events and a climate change exhibition will also be open at DDP and Seoul Plaza for civic groups and citizens, it added.

The city has announced it would employ an environmentally friendly transportation system and enforce the use of green products during the International Council for Local Environment Initiative World Congress 2015, themed “Sustainable Solution for an Urban Future.” The conference will run from April 8-12. The city will use green buses and electric taxis to transport visitors between conference venues for free, according to Seoul City officials. The buses, using environmentally-friendly compressed natural gas, are known for being fuel-efficient and emitting fewer pollutants. Artworks made of recyclable materials are displayed to promote the ICLEI World Congress 2015 at Seoul Plaza on April 1. (Yonhap)The city replaced all of its buses with CNG buses by 2014 in a project that began in 2002. A total of 7,500 city buses were replaced. “Those 7,500 buses will demonstrate the city’s commitment to addressing climate change. We plan to give visitors an opportunity to take a ride and see what it is like,” said a city official.Another green transportation experience will be offered through electric taxis. The city plans to have two available for visitors starting Wednesday. Since September, the city has provided 10 environmentally friendly taxis to local taxi business operators.“If required, we are planning to put extra electric taxis on the street. We are trying to find ways to provide more access to the taxis,” said a city official.The conference will become a venue for Seoul’s green initiative. The city mandated that all attendants must use environmentally friendly products during the meeting. Attendants will be advised against using disposable cups and hard-copy handouts. Instead, they must carry tumblers and download handouts via smartphones. The city also plans to plant trees to counter carbon emissions generated during the conference. The event will take place at Dongdaemun Design Plaza, one of Seoul’s landmark buildings located in downtown Seoul. The city will designate a vehicle-free area near the building on Friday between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. where it will host various events to celebrate the occasion.

The first Korean nurses in history ― Kim Martha and Lee Grace ― were taught by Edmunds at the school and became nurses in 1906. Among the two, Kim was an abused housewife before joining Edmunds, while Lee had been a servant for an aristocratic family.“Edmunds mentored the very first Korean women who chose to have a career with professional education,” said an official at the Korean Nurses Association. Born in Ontario, Canada, Edmunds received her training as a nurse in Michigan in the U.S. and arrived in Korea as a Christian missionary in 1903. During her years as the president of Pogunyogwan from 1903 to 1908, she translated a number of English-language textbooks on nursing into Korean and introduced the first uniform for nurses to wear in the country. She married William Butler Harrison, an American pastor who worked in Korea’s South Jeolla region, in 1908. Upon marring Harrison, she joined her husband’s missionary work in the Jeolla region. Their son, Charles, was born in Mokpo, South Jeolla Province in 1911, and later participated as a marine officer during the Korean War. Edmunds returned to the U.S. with her husband in 1928, and died there in 1945. The Order of Merit, received Tuesday by the Korean Nurses Association on Edmunds’ behalf, will be handed over to her descendants ― who currently live in the U.S. ― at the opening ceremony of the International Council of Nurses 2015 Conference in Seoul on June 19.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","american nurse who founded korea ,first korean nurses in history ,korean nurses in history ,the first korean nurses ,korean nurses in history kim","['Margaret Jane Edmunds', 'american', 'Korea', 'the order of Civil Merit', 'south korean', 'the Korean Nurses Association', 'the Pogunyogwan Training School for Nurses', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Kim Martha', 'Lee Grace', 'Kim', 'edmund', 'Lee', 'korean', 'the Korean Nurses Association', 'Ontario', 'Canada', 'Michigan', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'christian', 'Pogunyogwan', 'Korean', 'William Butler Harrison', 'american', 'Korea', 'South Jeolla region', 'Harrison', 'Jeolla', 'Charles', 'Mokpo', 'South Jeolla Province', 'U.S.', 'the Korean Nurses Association on edmund ’', 'U.S.', 'the International Council of Nurses 2015 Conference', 'Seoul', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53891844  0.60730338

The new guidelines were unveiled in January 2014.  On Tuesday, Japan also plans to unveil its 2015 diplomatic paper, named the Diplomatic Bluebook, which will reportedly repeat its claim to the islets.  In last year's report, Tokyo said the islets are ""clearly an inherent territory of Japan,"" in light of historical facts and based upon international law.  South Korea has vowed to take stern actions against Japan's possible provocations over Dokdo, saying that it is needless to say that the islets are South Korean territory in terms of history, geography and international law.  ""Seoul will sternly respond to any provocations that Japan makes in terms of Korea's territorial sovereignty,"" a Seoul official said.  Experts say that Japan's potential provocations over the islets are expected to further dampen bilateral ties, which have already reached their lowest level in recent years.  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of the Seoul-Tokyo ties. But their ties have been strained due to history issues that include Tokyo's use of South Korean women as wartime sex slaves in World War II.

Minister Cecilia Alvarez-Correa signed an offset agreement with Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Korea International Cooperation Agency and Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, which would provide technical assistance to Colombia’s automotive and electricity sectors. An offset agreement is an ancillary deal between a government and agency or company to enhance collaboration under a negotiated contract. Companies usually provide assistance to boost their chance in government contracts, particularly in developing countries. Colombian Minister of Trade, Industry and Tourism Cecilia Alvarez-Correa (center) poses with Ministerial Counselor for Government and Private Sector Maria Lorena Gutierrez (right) and Ambassador Tito Saul Pinilla at the Shilla Hotel in Seoul last Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Korean agencies agreed to share knowledge in technological innovation, research and development, and human resource management, Alvarez said. “As Colombia’s first FTA with an Asian economy, the agreement will open the door to the Asia-Pacific region for our people and business,” Alvarez told The Korea Herald on April 1. “Colombia wants to learn from Korea’s rapid development experience and capitalize on our complementary trade structure.”The FTA with Korea was approved by the Colombian Congress in December and is currently undergoing a Constitutional Review. Colombia recorded one of the highest economic growth rates in Latin America, with an average 4 percent growth rate for the last 10 years. The volume of foreign direct investment rose from $6.8 billion in 2010 to $15.5 billion in 2014. Meanwhile, Korea is the 29th-largest FDI contributor to Colombia and the second-largest investor country from Asia. Bilateral trade volume increased from $730 million in 2005 to $2 billion in 2014.Colombia has accumulated a $7.7 billion trade deficit with Korea for the last 10 years, which the country aims to reduce through free trade. It wants investment in the automobile, transportation and energy sectors, and plans to increase the exports of coffee, meat, fruit and flowers, as well as cosmetics, garments and coal to Korea, the minister said. Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and Korea International Cooperation Agency are working with several Colombian industries to increase productivity and competitiveness, ProColombia said. Alvarez, one of seven female ministers in the Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos’ government, highlighted Korean President Park Geun-hye’s planned visit to Colombia in mid-April, which will be accompanied by a trade delegation of 100 companies.

His involvement in child care gradually improved his relationship with Kim as well.“When we first got married, we got into a lot of fights because he knew nothing about domestic work. He only knew how to make ramen and wouldn’t put his own socks in the washing machine,” Kim said. A scene from KBS’ reality show “Superman is Back,” which features celebrity dads trying to connect with their young children without the help of their wives. (KBS)“And it got worse when we had our daughter four years ago. We were both working, but I was mostly in charge of child care and domestic errands.”Kim and her husband, both 34, work in the finance industry, and spend nine to 12 hours at work each day. The mother said her husband is still not a fan of doing laundry or cooking, but is more willing to play with his daughter on weekends after watching numerous episodes of “Superman is Back.” Among many celebrity dads featured in the show, Kim’s husband particularly loved watching martial arts fighter Choo Sung-hoon and his daughter, Sa-rang. “I think he didn’t expect someone like Choo Sung-hoon, whose outward appearance is athletic and tough, to spend such quality time with his little daughter,” Kim said. “I think watching Choo gave my husband this unexplainable sense of jealousy and confidence ― that if Choo can pull it off, then he can pull it off, too. Anyhow, it all worked in my favor. My quality of life, especially on weekends, improved dramatically.”A scene from “Ode to My Father,” a generational epic of a father making sacrifices for his family as his nation experiences rapid economic development since the Korean War. (CJ E&M;)Experts say TV shows such as “Superman is Back” and “Dad! Where are we going?” are a positive influence on today’s Korean society, where more working fathers are taking paternity leave to spend time with their children. The number of dads who chose to take the leave increased by almost tenfold ― 863 percent ― from 2008 to 2014. Kim Eun-hee, a scholar at the Korean Institute for Gender Equality Promotion and Education, said the TV programs challenge the “maternal myth,” the notion that women are meant to be naturally maternal and therefore better caregivers than men.“By watching these programs, viewers learn that with time and practice, dads can also become great caregivers to children. The dads in the shows, who at first don’t know what to do when babies are crying, become so much more adept at parenting in later episodes,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “Viewers also get to watch the dads grow as human beings as they witness their children grow at the same time. And I think that’s important. No one just becomes a parent ‘naturally.’ Becoming a parent requires time and learning, both for mothers and fathers.”Kim said she especially enjoyed an episode where Lee Hwi-jae, a popular TV presenter and a dad of twin boys, makes friends with other mothers in his neighborhood.“Most Korean men interact with people they meet at work,” she said. “But by spending more time with their children, they can also connect with their neighbors. It makes their lives more interesting and meaningful that way; their lives become more than just work. Communities are important for both parents and children.”In spite of the increase, however, the number of dads who took paternity leave last year only accounted for 4.4 percent of all working fathers in the country. Some critics say such TV shows in fact reflect the bleak reality where most of fathers cannot opt to spend more time with their family. “People tend to want to see what they don’t have or can’t achieve. It’s called having a fantasy,” said culture critic Lee Moon-won. With soaring youth unemployment, limited job security ― 1 in 5 young adults started their careers in contract positions as of last year ― and household debt, more than half of South Korean millennials said today’s children will not be better off than their parents, according to a survey by American think-tank the Pew Research Center in 2014. “I don’t think you can even consider work-life balance when your priority is to feed your child first,” said Ahn Sang-soo, a researcher at the Korean Women’s Development Institute.Culture critic Lee said another popular reality variety show “We Got Married” ― which features paired-up celebrities in faux-marriages to show what it would be like if they were married ― and the recent silver screen hit “Ode to My Father” ― a heart-wrenching tale of a self-sacrificing Korean father who belongs to the postwar generation ― show the opportunities Koreans have lost in the recent years. “Not many young Korean men can afford to take a girl out to a pricey restaurant like the men do in ‘We Got Married,’ or get married at all,” said Lee. “And with this bleak view of the future, not many fathers today would volunteer to sacrifice themselves for their family like the character in ‘Ode to My Father,’ because they no longer believe that hard work guarantees a better future for the next generation.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","his daughter on weekends after ,rarely watches tv but she ,self sacrificing korean father ,kbs reality show superman ,celebrity dads caring for their","['Kim Jin - ha', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'KBS ’', 'Kim', 'Choo Sung - hoon', 'Choo Sung - hoon', 'Kim', 'CJ e&m;)experts', 'korean', 'Kim Eun - hee', 'the Korean Institute for', 'Gender Equality Promotion and Education', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee Hwi - jae', 'korean', 'Lee Moon - win', 'south korean', 'american', 'the Pew Research Center', 'Ahn Sang - soo', 'the Korean Women ’s Development Institute', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43730226  0.93359983

Seoul Metropolitan Government broke ground for the Seoul Upcycling Plaza (tentative name) in Janganpyeong, eastern Seoul, as part of the project to stimulate the culture of reusing, recycling and upcycling. In contrast to reusing and recycling, upcycling uses waste materials to convert them into new products. It has been a rising global trend, especially in the European fashion market. In Korea, only about 30 upcycling companies exist as of this year, the city said.Spread over 16,500 square meters, the five-story building will consist of workspaces for upcycling-focused social start-ups and artists, and a large market for upcycling products, processed waste materials and secondhand items, the city said.Once the facility is opened, the Janganpyeong area will transform into an environment-friendly town with the existing Jungnang water treatment facility, used car market and water sewage museum, the city said. This is part of the city government’s long-term environment project aimed at using the waste as a source for the green industry. Along with the nation’s largest upcycling center, Seoul City vowed to make efforts to expand the number of upcycling companies to 1,000 and create about 20,000 fresh work opportunities with new jobs such as upcycling material planner and eco-designer, the city officials said. It will also raise the recycling rate from the current 64 percent to 75 percent by 2017, which will be the highest in the world. The city will also improve the food garbage-turned-biogas rate to 100 percent. The current rate is around 30 percent, they added.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","upcycling center seoul city vowed ,opened in seoul in 2017 ,first ever upcycling center will ,thursday seoul metropolitan government broke ,nation largest upcycling center seoul","['Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Janganpyeong', 'Seoul', 'european', 'Korea', 'Janganpyeong', 'Jungnang', 'Seoul City', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61286759  0.13810368

A total of 41 sightseeing activities have been offered so far. The shopping-focused routes will be divided into industry, fashion and beauty to target Chinese visitors, while the arts program will cover traditional culture, food, religion and “hallyu,” which will be aimed at both Japanese and American sightseers, the city said. According to the survey conducted last year, Japanese tourists preferred independent travel with a focus on hallyu, while Chinese tourists mostly picked group packages with an interest in food and shopping. Meanwhile, Americans favored independent travel, but they also wanted to experience diverse traditional culture and festivals, the city said. The history tour route will show Korean history from the Three Kingdoms Period (B.C. 57-A.D. 676) to the present. The neighborhood sightseeing program will offer a glimpse of four regions ― eastern, western, southern and northern Seoul, it added. The natural ecology tour package will focus on visiting mountains and rivers and the “theme tour” package will offer a sightseeing tour at night. The city said it would also provide more sightseeing opportunities in the tour packages. Modern structures such as the Seoul Anglican Cathedral and the Salvation Army building will be included in the Deoksugung Palace-Jeong-dong route in the center of the capital, officials said.

Five new stops opened on Subway Line No. 9 from Sinnonhyeon Station to Sports Complex Station in southeastern Seoul on Saturday. The extended service is expected to attract about 3,000 additional daily passengers, the city said. In a bid to reduce rush-hour crowding, the city government said it would offer a number of free alternative buses on the subway route from Gayang Station in the west to Yeouido. It will also run free Yeouido-bound express buses in the mornings from three spots ― Gimpo Airport Station, Gayang Station and Yeomchang Station.

The international exposition in Kazakhstan’s capital of Astana will feature “future energy,” showcasing innovative and environment-friendly solutions to global energy needs. “Astana will be a platform to present to the world where Kazakhstan stands in its transition to renewable energy as well as scientific research and development,” Zhoshybayev told The Korea Herald on March 20. “Kazakhstan has traditionally relied on coal, oil and gas, but is turning to renewable energy to fight climate change.”More than 2 million people from 100 countries and 10 international organizations are expected to participate in the event to be held between June 10 and Sept. 10, 2017. Twenty-five hectares are designated for pavilions, with easy access to the city center, airport and railway stations. The deputy minister said his country decided to host the event following Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s declaration to nurture green energy at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro.As a national project targeting “green growth” as part of “the third industrial revolution,” the international exposition will search for solutions to combat climate change and reduce CO2 emissions; promote alternative energies; ensure energy security; manage energy production, storage and use; and guarantee universal access to sustainable energy. The venue is expected to be a catalyst for continuing innovation in science and lifestyle, “becoming an integral part of life in the republic,” said the deputy minister. Kazakhstan is currently diversifying energy sources by building two nuclear power plants alongside wind and solar power stations, Zhoshybayev said. It is also strengthening energy independence alongside international projects involving Europe, Russia, China and other regional and Asian countries. “We have learned from Korea’s experience hosting the Yeosu Expo 2012, including selection of the ideal site, concerts and cultural events for attracting young people, reusing buildings for housing, and transport and logistics for tourists,” Zhoshybayev said. “It is my pleasure to welcome Korean friends to Astana before and during the expo to experience the dynamism and hospitality of Kazakh people.”The deputy minister pointed out tourist attractions in Astana, including the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation and Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center designed by British architects Foster and Partners; Green Water Boulevard by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa; Bayterek Tower; and Ak Orda Presidential Palace.Zhoshybayev met his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul and delivered an invitation to President Park Geun-hye.He signed a memorandum of understanding between the National Company Astana Expo and Korea Tourism Organization, and expressed hope for future bilateral collaboration on renewable energy research, information technology and automobile sector.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","expo 2017 and garner korea ,astana expo and korea tourism ,korean friends to astana before ,company astana expo and korea ,welcome korean friends to astana","['Kazakhstan', 'Rapil Zhoshybayev', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Kazakhstan', 'Astana', 'Astana', 'Kazakhstan', 'Zhoshybayev', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kazakhstan', 'Kazakh', 'Nursultan Nazarbayev ’s', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Kazakhstan', 'Zhoshybayev', 'Russia', 'China', 'asian', 'Korea', 'Zhoshybayev', 'korean', 'Astana', 'Astana', 'Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center', 'british', 'Green Water Boulevard', 'japanese', 'Kurokawa', 'Bayterek Tower', 'Orda Presidential Palace', 'korean', 'Cho Tae - yul', 'Park Geun', 'the National Company Astana Expo', 'Korea Tourism Organization', 'Joel Lee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15742533  0.99534225

""Swimming is everything to me. It's all I've ever done and not being able to compete is hugely shocking. It's as if my whole life has been taken away from me in an instant. It makes it difficult for me to think about retirement at this point.""FINA collected Park's samples on Sept. 3 last year and the suspension began retroactively on that day. It ends on March 2, 2016, which theoretically gives Park time to get ready for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August that same year.However, a local rule instituted last year by the Korean Olympic Committee may prevent Park from swimming in Rio. The rule states that an athlete who has served a drug-related suspension of any length is ineligible for national teams for three years, starting with the end of the suspension.The KOC has hinted it may look into amending the rule to allow Park to compete after all, but the swimmer himself said he wasn't looking that far down the road.""If I am ever given the opportunity to race at the Olympics, then I will endure whatever rigorous training that lies ahead,""Park said. ""But I think it's not appropriate for me to talk about my Olympic participation. I've let down so many people, and I believe it's only right for me to take plenty of time to reflect on myself.""Park added that he will try to give back to the people who've supported him through thick and thin.""I realize clearly that everything I've accomplished as a swimmer must not be taken for granted,"" he said. ""I understand how precious my career has been, and I will spend time serving the community. My objective is not to become an Olympian or to win medals. It is to become someone who's not ashamed of himself.""

Speaking at the second anniversary of the 5.4 Club, Pasquier said for Korea to take the next qualitative leap forward to become an attractive tourism destination, “You don’t need to modernize too much.”“French people like tradition and traditional places,” Pasquier told The Korea Herald. “It’s convenient to have highways, but it’s also nice to drive on small roads where you can see the landscape.” Pasquier was responding to tourism-related surveys carried out by the Corea Image Communication Institute, which hosted the event at Lotte Hotel on March 17. The 5.4 Club holds year-round gatherings aimed at celebrating the four pleasures of seeing, eating, enjoying and talking. Its members are professionals from diverse countries with an interest in promoting Korea around the world. Jordanian Ambassador Omar Nahar said, “When I first came to Korea, I was told that Korea is surrounded by three different seas ― Donghae (East Sea), Namhae (South Sea) and Soehae (West Sea).”“But over the next four years, meeting beautiful friends at CICI, I discovered the fourth one ― Saranghae (I love you).” The crowd cheered and clinked their wineglasses. Pasquier said Korea lost important connections with the past in its pursuit of modernity.“Sadly, you had a lot of destructions. But you still have very nice places like old temples and national parks,” he said. “It’s also nice to walk and hike there in the mountains.”Bukchon Hanok Village is another spot the ambassador likes to visit.When asked whether he felt uncomfortable at Korea’s raucous and coarse traditional markets, he said, “French people feel comfortable everywhere, you know. It’s very nice to go to the Noryangjin Fish Market and other markets in Seoul and Busan.”Pasquier noted foreigners feel unsafe walking on the streets in Korea due to the pedestrians-unfriendly drivers. “In France, usually when people cross the streets, cars stop,” he said. “In Korea, not always. You have to be careful. The driving culture needs improvement. I think so.”The ambassador said the embassy is preparing “very big events” to celebrate the 130th anniversary of ties with Korea next year.“We want to show that France is a very important and friendly country to Korea,” Pasquier said without further explaining. The programs are confidential, “Because we want to surprise everybody.” By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","wineglasses pasquier said korea lost ,their wineglasses pasquier said korea ,breakneck speeds french ambassador ,pasquier thinks koreans should slow ,at breakneck speeds french ambassador","['Korea ’s', 'french', 'Jerome Pasquier', 'Koreans', 'the 5.4 Club , Pasquier', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Corea Image Communication Institute', 'Lotte Hotel', 'Korea', 'jordanian', 'Omar Nahar', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Namhae ( South Sea', 'CICI', 'Korea', 'Hanok Village', 'Korea ’s', 'french', 'the Noryangjin fish Market', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'Korea', 'France', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'France', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74496216  0.58892703

289,289,Korea’s struggle to create its own Silicon Valley,"Han Min-jin, a 26-year-old engineering student at a local college in Seoul, is living his dream. He founded a small business named Byit last year offering services for community sports events.“Starting a business was a dream come true after a mundane internship with a local accounting firm,” Han said in an interview last week.

He founded a small business named Byit last year offering services for community sports events.“Starting a business was a dream come true after a mundane internship with a local accounting firm,” Han said in an interview last week. Han is among the thousands of Koreans in their 20s and 30s who founded their own companies in the ongoing South Korean start-up boom of the 2010s. They are the Korean millennials refusing to follow in the footsteps of an earlier generation, who considered it a family honor to get a job at one of the country’s top conglomerates such as Samsung Electronics or Hyundai Motors.But these inexperienced entrepreneurs must fight an uphill battle to even dream of reaching the levels of start-up success achieved by Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg.Not only do they face the typical start-up problems -- money, for instance -- they also must overcome a conservative consumer culture, while fighting a virtually impossible battle against the likes of big conglomerates.“If (smartphone) app-makers create a pay-walled smartphone app, consumers are likely to avoid the app. They’re bound to think paying for the apps is something wrong,” Han said.Pledging to break down such barriers, President Park Geun-hye came up with her proposed panacea of “creative economy.” She promised to spawn a start-up-friendly environment and eventually replace Korea’s current conglomerate-based growth model in the long run.Two years in, the creative economy has achieved some success.The Growth Ladder Fund, a government-funded program dedicated to linking new businesses with venture capital and other financial buttresses, has produced 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion) in investment since its inception in May 2013. The fund will strive to boost an extra 2 trillion won this year, said Seo Jong-gun, head of the fund’s secretariat.The Youth Startup Fund, another public money scheme for start-ups here, has lent 250 billion won to up to 3,200 businesses since 2012. The fund restricts its loans to business starters under age 40 and is operated by the government’s Small and Medium Business Administration.“Most loans are functioning,” said a SMBA spokesperson who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “The initial repayments are not due until earlier this year with most of the loans not being excessively burdensome in amount,” the spokesperson added.Some local start-ups also reported impressive milestones under the Park administration, such as the 4-year-old smartphone app-maker Channelbreeze, which reportedly attracted up to 21 billion won ($18.5 million) from venture capitalists earlier this month.“The high-tech start-up environment is certainly better than it was in the 1990s,” said Kim Wonshik, professor of economics at Konkuk University. “The IT atmosphere is much more developed than 20 years ago when the technology was still in its developing stages.”President Park Geun-hye talks with young filmmakers at the opening ceremony of the Busan Center for Creative Economy & Innovation last week. (Yonhap)A darker realityBut the reported achievements mask a darker reality that most start-ups face, according to some business founders.Han is one of those arguing that Park’s policy has been more of a show than a reality.“To secure a 100 million won loan from the SMBA’s Youth Startup Fund, I have to go through hours of mandatory classes at a government start-up education institute, spend another hundred hours writing proposals to civil officials, and stack up receipts for every penny we spend.”Such administrative burden takes away precious hours that should be spent on developing trial products to test on the market, he said.“Every time we go to a product exhibition, we’re surprised at how many of our competitors are developing their products,” Han said.“Timing and speed is key to a high-tech start-up like us,” said Kim Jae-woong, a college student working with Han.Government programs are helpful, but they sometimes create more problems than they solve, Han and Kim said.There are also start-up pirates who abuse the government’s lenient lending programs, they claimed.“I’ve seen guys set up four to five ghost companies that they use to gain extra loans from the government,” Han said. Public lending programs usually limit loans to one per start-up. But such loan pirates bypass the rules by setting up their shadow companies.The funds gained by the loan-hogging practices are used to support the pirates’ original start-ups. The abuse soaks up government money that should have been used to give opportunities to other potential start-up founders, Han said.And then there are the unfair competition practices of Korea’s billion-dollar family-run conglomerates, according to Rep. Hong Jong-haak, member of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.“Generally speaking, large U.S. companies give start-ups an exit plan by purchasing small companies for their talent, or products,” the lawmaker said.“But here, when large companies see promising markets, they steal ideas and start their own businesses, and crowd the start-ups out. They also steal talent from smaller companies. How can you expect a start-up to survive in such conditions?” the former activist added.Han Min-jin (left) and his team hold a meeting in Byit's office. (Byit)‘Uncreative’ economyThe main problem of Park’s creative economy is its failure to address the strongest barrier against starting businesses here -- excessive loan regulations to entrepreneurs -- according to Hong, the economist-turned-lawmaker.“Korean loan rules force entrepreneurs to risk everything,” Hong said in an interview with The Korea Herald last week. Hong supports Park’s idea of fostering start-ups, but charges that the policy is far from perfect.“If first-time start-ups fail -- something more than likely for most -- banking rules force entrepreneurs to give up their salaries, their homes, their cars to repay business debts -- things considered essential to a basic livelihood,” he said.These strict rules, in turn, scare away potential entrepreneurs from ever founding a business, Hong added. Hong is preparing amendments that will ease credit rules, although officials at the Financial Services Commission have already expressed opposition to his ideas.Officials at the state-run Korea Guarantee Fund and the Korea Technology Finance Corporation, and the FSC, the country’s top financial regulatory body, say Hong’s proposals would spark excessive moral hazard, citing already-worrisome amounts of unpaid loans.Outstanding loans dealt out by the KTFC alone stand at 8.9 trillion won ($7.8 billion) as of late last year. The count is a rise from a much smaller 192.2 billion won in July last year.Hong, however, said that the government’s thinking is anachronistic.“The burden of figuring out if a potential borrower is someone likely to commit moral hazard is solely on the lenders,” he said. That burden should not be offloaded by creating conservative lending regulations, Hong argues.A step toward Korea’s Silicon ValleyNonetheless, Park’s critics acknowledged that the creative economy is a step in the right direction.“Our current conglomerate-centered economy poses dangerous systemic risks that could bring on something resembling the Great Depression,” Hong said, taking the world’s worst economic depression of the 20th century as an example.“Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all companies that are 20, 30 years old.”“We need something that will trigger an outpouring of new businesses to compete with the existing big companies,” Hong said.Konkuk University’s professor Kim agreed the creative economy was a necessity.“The economy needs more start-ups to grow. New businesses mean new jobs. Korea’s start-up atmosphere has been depressed since the IMF crisis,” Kim said, mentioning the 1997 Asian financial crisis.“The results of Park’s policy are going to show up years later,” the economist added.Until then, Han and other 20-something business starters say drastic changes are needed.Han suggested government programs facilitating crowdfunding, an investment ploy aggregating small amounts of money from modest investors to form a larger fund.“When I heard of Kickstarter, I became very envious of my counterparts in the U.S.,” Han said, referring to the online crowdfunding site launched in 2009. The site allows entrepreneurs to access cheap capital in a relatively quick time frame. Kickstarter has raised close to $1.6 billion and has funded more than 80,000 projects, according to its website. It is available for start-ups in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada among other countries, but not here.“There are some similar schemes here, but South Korea’s conservative culture is likely to stifle such programs anyway,” Han said.A bill aiming to facilitate crowdfunding has been pending in the National Assembly since June 2013. President Park has been urging the lawmakers to pass it.Revisions propose easing online stock trading rules and setting up regulations to make online investments more transparent.Known by legal texts as amendments to the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act, the law remains largely ignored, with the main political parties blaming each other for the delay.The bill will likely remain ignored in next month’s extraordinary session at the Assembly, as the rival parties remain engrossed in political wrangling over such issues as public pensions reform and remapping of parliamentary voting districts ahead of next year’s general elections.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","26 year old engineering student ,korean loan rules force entrepreneurs ,the youth startup fund another ,venture capitalists earlier this month ,they are the korean millennials","['Han', 'Seoul', 'Byit', 'Han', 'Han', 'Koreans', 'south korean', 'korean', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Hyundai Motors', 'Steve Jobs', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'Han', 'Park Geun', 'Korea', 'the Growth Ladder Fund', 'Seo Jong - gun', 'the Youth Startup Fund', 'small and Medium Business Administration', 'Park', 'Kim Wonshik', 'Konkuk University', 'Park Geun', 'the Busan Center for', 'Han', 'Park', 'the SMBA ’s Youth Startup Fund', 'Han', 'Kim Jae - woong', 'Han', 'Han', 'Kim', 'Han', 'Han', 'Korea', 'Hong Jong - haak', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'U.S.', 'Han Min - jin', 'Byit', 'Park ’s', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'the Korea Herald', 'Hong', 'Park ’s', 'Hong', 'Hong', 'the Financial Services Commission', 'Korea Guarantee Fund', 'the Korea Technology Finance Corporation', 'FSC', 'Hong', 'KTFC', 'Hong', 'Korea', 'Silicon ValleyNonetheless', 'Park ’s', 'Apple', 'Hong', 'Konkuk University ’s', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'asian', 'Park', 'Han', 'Han', 'U.S.', 'Han', 'Kickstarter', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'Canada', 'South Korea ’s', 'Han', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act', 'Assembly', 'Jeong Hunny']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70709646  0.75496316

Marking the one-year anniversary of Korea Policy Foundation, some three hundred people took part in the symposium, “Development Strategy for the Tumen River Area for Northeast Asia’s Peace and Prosperity,” at the Korea Press Center in Seoul on Mar 12.

Three policy experts presented their views on building a multinational city, establishing supranational cooperation and kick-starting the Greater Tumen Initiative -- a multilateral economic cooperation mechanism involving China, Russia, Mongolia and South Korea.

“The next 100 years for the Northeast Asian community should be based on coexistence and symbiosis,” KPF chairman and former Employment and Labor Minister Yim Tae-hee said in a keynote speech. “Today’s symposium will find intersecting interests and creative solutions for the common future of neighboring countries.”

“By participating in the GTI, Korea can materialize President Park Geun-hye’s Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative and Eurasia Initiative,” said Na Won-chang, former GTI coordinator and current head of the Eurasian department at the Foreign Ministry. “The organization can develop into a multilateral framework for land and sea transport routes, regional trade and energy supply.”

The GTI was launched in 1992 under the auspices of the United Nations Development Program and called the Tumen River Area Development Program then. Since 2005, the program was renamed GTI and helmed by China, which sought to create an attractive investment destination for energy, tourism and transport sectors and environmental preservation. 

In a meeting in Seoul last September, participating countries agreed to elevate the regional body to an international organization by 2016. 

North Korea was a member when the GTI was founded in 2005, but exited the union in 2009 citing lack of funding. However, Pyongyang recently showed its renewed interest in the project, referring to the region as “the linchpin” of regional economic integration.

Lee Sang-jun, senior researcher at the Korea Research Institute for Human Settlement and well-known expert on North Korean city planning, made a pitch for a regional development strategy by enlarging existing projects underway in the area. 

“Jump-starting and augmenting projects in the Tumen River area will restore Korea’s lost continental identity and facilitate integration into Eurasia,” Lee said. 

“Once a multistakeholder mechanism is established and public infrastructure such as railways, roads, electrical lines and natural gas pipelines are built, we will be able to elevate the cooperation up a notch.” 

The area has long been underdeveloped and isolated despite its strategic value, experts point out. But in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest emanating from shifting geopolitical conditions ― China’s growing clout, Russia’s economic woes and South Korea’s transcontinental ambition. 

“It is critical for Korea to preemptively secure a foothold in the supranational cooperation mechanism to keep China’s self-aggrandizing position in check,” Lee said. “We can do that by broadening the current bilateral cooperation between Beijing and Pyongyang or Moscow and Pyongyang to trilateral schemas involving Seoul, and ultimately to a multinational body encompassing all regional powers.” 

Lee proposed expanding the Rajin-Khasan project ― a border area enterprise aimed at refurbishing North Korea’s northeastern city of Rajin into a logistics hub and linking it with Russia’s Khasan through the Trans-Siberian Railway ― to elicit participation of Korea, China, Mongolia and Japan.

Russia, for its part, has pushed its own “pivot to Asia” agenda in recent years, squeezed by Western-led sanctions and plunging petroleum prices. In an effort to stamp its footprint in Russia’s eastern edges and venture into the Asia-Pacific, Moscow has actively garnered Seoul’s support for joint investment in the Russian Far East and North Korea. 

Russia’s Far East region holds vast reserves of energy and mineral resources and ample agricultural production capacities for the soaring East Asian economies, analysts say. Russia’s trade turnover with Northeast Asian economies was nearly $150 billion in 2013, with China accounting almost $90 billion. 

Kim Seok-chul, a renowned architect and chairman of the presidential commission on architectural policy, advocated building an international city in the Tumen River area. 

“The overarching yardstick of separating modern societies has been the nation-state armed by the military-industrial complex,” Kim said. “What I am proposing is going beyond nations ― building a humane community based on aspirations of peace and recognition of otherness.”

Highlighting potentials for combining Russia’s energy sources, China’s food supplies and underground resources, and North Korea’s labor and rare minerals, Kim suggested erecting a multinational port city pairing with Rotterdam, Netherlands.

To be at the center of the transcontinental trade, Kim said, the harbor should be open to the East Sea and the Pacific and connected with the Trans-Siberian Railway and Trans-Mongolian Railway.

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Germany is Europe’s largest medical technology market and manufacturer with nearly 1,200 medium-sized enterprises employing 125,000 people and 11,300 small companies employing 70,000. International revenue reached 17 billion euros ($17.8 billion) in 2013, and the industry is expected to grow at around 3.8 percent annually until 2018. Germany exports more than 50 percent of its medical products to the European market, followed by North American and Asian markets at around 18 percent each. Export of German products to Korea has grown by 50 percent over the last five years, reaching 234 million euros in 2014; Germany imported 100 million euros of equipment from Korea in the same year. According to the German Industry Association Spectaris, Germany’s medical technology industry consists almost entirely of small and medium-sized enterprises that rely on high-innovation capacities and export-led strategies. There is close cooperation between universities, companies and hospitals for research and development, with companies investing an average 9 percent of their revenues in research. Schuster explained that there is a long process from fundamental research to applicable research that leads to production. While the public sector invests mostly in fundamental research, the private sector concentrates more on practical and applicable fields, making two-way collaboration critical, he said. For German companies, an international partnership is not only for selling products and services, according to the Charge d‘Affaires, as they constantly look for research collaboration and innovation. Samsung Medical Center’s clinical assistant professor Alice Tan said creating partnerships with German companies will help upgrade the service quality of Korea’s growing medical tourism industry. “Korea already has excellent doctors, but what we need are high-quality equipment and medication for attracting medical tourists,” she said. “By opening our market, we can gain access to the best available technology and exchange ideas of global standards.”Tan highlighted that despite concerns for increased costs to patients, particularly on low-income people, health care privatization also brings a number of benefits, including increased investment in medical research and infrastructure. As a growing number of foreign hospital groups is interested in purchasing Korean hospitals, she noted, industry collaboration will benefit both foreign investors and domestic professionals.The convention annually draws around 1,000 exhibitors and 70,000 visitors.

(Twitter)These rooms also had sexual or degrading rules for entering. One room demanded that the freshmen dance the provocative routine the girl group EXID used for their single “Up & Down.” Another required those entering to smell the feet of the occupants and then voice their opinions on the smell.Other rules included one requiring the youngest freshman present to sing with a senior student of the opposite sex, and imitating a popular comedy sketch while looking at a senior with a “deep gaze.” As the details of the event and the controversy spread on the Internet, the university and the student association of the business school have apologized and promised countermeasures. The university on Wednesday issued a statement saying that “stern measures” would be taken to prevent such incidents recurring. “The situation will be reviewed closely to prevent such incidents recurring, and stern measures will be taken according to the results (of the review),” chief of the university’s student affairs Lee Sang-geun said in the statement. As part of the follow-up measures, the university plans to strengthen sexual equality education and to review various related systems. The student association of the business school also posted a public apology and promised to take preventive steps. “(The association) will endeavor endlessly to reform the bad customs of the business school students’ society,” the student’s association said.","for freshmen at the sogang ,harassment scandal following welcoming event ,school also posted public apology ,new students on feb 25 ,freshmen at the sogang university","['Seoul', 'Sogang University', 'korean', 'EXID', 'Lee Sang - geun']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57985282  0.26522318

The KCSC, however, lifted the ban on Ashley Madison on Tuesday, following the decision by the Constitutional Court to repeal the anti-adultery law on Feb. 26. In the historical ruling, which came 62 years after the law was enacted, the court judged that an article of the criminal code was unconstitutional as it violates individuals' freedom to choose their sexual partners and their right to privacy. The KCSC said it allowed the site to reopen as the legal grounds for the ban no longer exist, but added it will ""keep close tabs on the site for any potential abuse that might lead to sexual-related crimes."" Launched in 2001, Ashley Madison has been a huge success in the United States, Taiwan and Brazil. It has recently gained popularity in Hong Kong and Japan. Avid Dating Life Inc., the website operator, also runs a similar online dating site called CougarLife, which mainly offers middle-aged women dating chances with younger men.

While the installation attracted some 5 million visitors with its photogenic presence during its month-long display, critics raised suspicions that Lotte allegedly used it to allay safety concerns over the mall.As part of the plan to recycle the display, Lotte said it will launch a display titled ""Come Swing with Rubber Duck X Fabrikr"" where it will install 24 rocking chairs that have been made with parts from the animal figure.The floor and ceiling of the exhibition venue will be designed to emulate wind and water, so that visitors who sit in the rocking chairs will feel as if they are riding the rubber duck, Lotte said in a press release.Some parts of the rubber duck will be re-used to make souvenirs for shoppers and will be distributed on a first-come first-served basis next month, it added.

Sherpa Ambassador Ayse Sinirlioglu, who will preside over the 10th annual meeting of G20 heads of government in Turkey’s southeastern city of Antalya from Nov. 15-16, participated in a MIKTA senior officials’ meeting in Seoul. “Between Turkey and Korea, the sky is the limit,” Sinirlioglu told The Korea Herald at the Turkish Ambassador’s residence in Seoul on Feb. 28. “To strengthen our strategic partnership, the two countries will speak with one voice at MIKTA and G20 as well as the United Nations and World Trade Organization.” As an informal alliance involving Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Australia, MIKTA was established in September 2013 to boost collaboration on global issues of common interests. Turkey’s G20 Sherpa Ambassador Ayse Sinirlioglu (right) poses with Turkish Ambassador to Korea Arslan Hakan Okcal at the ambassador’s residence in Seoul on Feb 28. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)In the first deputy foreign ministerial meeting in Seoul, the five representatives discussed creating a website, establishing activity guidelines, holding business forums and expanding academic exchanges and research.Korea took the yearlong chairmanship from Mexico last September and will host the next ministerial meeting in May in Seoul.Sinirlioglu said that through MIKTA’s informal framework, countries can initiate agendas of mutual interests complementary to the G20. “As all MIKTA countries belong to the G20, our memberships reinforce our objectives on multiple levels.”Representing 90 percent of the world’s economy, 80 percent of trade and 70 percent of population, the G20 has emerged as a premier platform for international economic cooperation, policy coordination and result-oriented action. It takes up a plethora of issues, including sustainable development, food and energy security, climate change, job creation, poverty and corruption reduction.“This year is pivotal for development cooperation,” Sinirlioglu said. “The Third International Conference on Financing for Development will take place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in July, and the United Nations will convene a summit in September to adopt a post-2015 development agenda.”With the global economy plunging into a post-crisis quagmire of declining growth and uncertainty, the G20’s responsibility as a leading international institution has become more salient than ever, the ambassador said. At the last G20 conference in Brisbane in November, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called for more inclusive governance to give low-income developing countries a stronger voice:“We want to be the voice of everybody,” he said. “If the G20 agenda is only limited to financial issues, the G20 does not have international legitimacy.” Turkey has vowed to expand the institution’s mandate beyond economic development to geopolitical issues: the Ebola outbreak in Africa, terrorism in the Middle East and the refugee crisis in Eastern Europe. “Participating in G20 is a dynamic and evolving process,” Sinirlioglu noted, adding that each presidency ensures the continuity of agenda and aims to reach consensus among member states. Compared to other international organizations, observers say the group’s informal structure enables open dialogue and rapid response to problems. The ambassador explained the three “I” priorities of inclusiveness, implementation and investment under the Turkish presidency. “Inclusiveness has both domestic and global dimensions,” said Sinirlioglu. “Domestically, the G20 strives to spread the benefits of growth and prosperity across all segments of society.”Toward this goal, the organization has set a goal to reduce gender gap in labor participation, youth unemployment and endorse small and medium-sized enterprises. The Turkish government also included inclusive business to the agenda, encouraging businesses to undertake local procurement, employment and other corporate social responsibility initiatives in countries they are investing in. Internationally, Turkey has prioritized reducing inequalities between nations and making the G20 more relevant to low-income developing countries, Sinirlioglu said. “Our presidency will play a bridging role between the developed and developing countries with an emerging market point of view,” she emphasized. “We will eradicate poverty and support sustainable development in developing countries.” For implementation, Turkey has institutionalized greater oversight and discipline by requiring governments to self-monitor their progress and peer-review others. “Out of the 1,000 policy proposals drawn up from the Australian presidency, we will focus on structural reforms and 5 to 8 of the most impactful policy measures to achieve our goal of boosting global growth by over 2 percent by 2018,” Sinirlioglu pointed out. The Sherpa Ambassador said that the third pillar of investment is in short supply in both developed and developing countries, particularly in infrastructure. “The OECD estimated that demand for infrastructural investment will amount to $70 trillion by 2030, but this cannot be singlehandedly done by the public sector.”She added, “It is vital to improve the investment climate and boost private sector’s confidence in these long-term projects.”Sinirlioglu is the wife of Turkish foreign ministry undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu and was appointed as a deputy undersecretary in December. She served as an ambassador to Romania (2008-11) and Spain (2011-14).

The kingdom plans to install up to 18 nuclear reactors by 2040.South Korea -- which relies on 23 nuclear reactors for one-third of its energy needs -- has emerged as a new export powerhouse of nuclear power plants in recent years.In 2009, a South Korean consortium won a $20.4 billion project to build four light water nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates by 2020 in South Korea's first export of nuclear reactors.Also Wednesday, Park was to meet with Hashim Yamani, head of Saudi Arabia's renewable energy agency KA CARE, according to Park's office.Park also plans to meet with business leaders of South Korea and Saudi Arabia, and Korean residents in the kingdom.Later in the day, Park will fly to the United Arab Emirates, the third stop on her four-nation swing that will take her to Qatar. Earlier this week, she visited Kuwait and met with its emir and sought his interest and assistance to ensure that South Korean companies can participate in industrial and infrastructure projects in the oil-rich country.Park's Mideast tour comes as oil-rich regional countries are seeking to diversify their economic portfolios ahead of the inevitable advent of a post-oil era.

The administration is seeking a turnaround in both political and economic credibility. Lee Byung-kee. (Yonhap)Lee Byung-kee, who was named chief of staff Friday, is not accompanying Park on her nine-day overseas trip. Instead, the former National Intelligence Service chief has been tasked with settling pending domestic issues, including new taxation policies, in coordination with economy-related ministers.Lee, 68, is also required to seek close exchanges with the ruling Saenuri Party to improve communication with opposition parties, including the New Politics Alliance for Democracy.But opposition lawmakers and civic groups have criticized him over his career track record. He is one of a select number who continuously served as a close aide to Park during the 2007 and 2012 presidential campaigns.The main opposition party, in particular, point to his immediate previous position of spy chief, calling the designation of the incumbent NIS chief to the central post for state affairs “an unprecedented, inappropriate personnel policy.”Lee is the first spymaster to be appointed to the chief of presidential staff since the naming of Park Gye-won during the Park Chung-hee military regime, 37 years ago.Lee also worked for the Lee Hoi-chang camp during the 2002 presidential election.Cheong Wa Dae has predicted that he will increase communication with the ruling party, the opposition and the public, citing his negotiation skills. The presidential office is also pinning hopes on him for a recovery in relations with North Korea and Japan.“Lee Byung-kee is expected to smoothly assist the president, lead the presidential office and open communication between the people and Cheong Wa Dae with his experience and leadership in state affairs and inter-Korean relations,” said presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook.Born in Seoul in 1947, Lee started his career as a public official after passing the Foreign Service Examination in 1974.Lee, who worked as the ambassador to Japan in 2013, was named the 34th NIS director in 2014.Park’s appointment of Lee as chief secretary came nearly two months after she vowed to reorganize the presidential office and carry out a partial Cabinet reshuffle.The president appointed former Saenuri floor leader Lee Wan-koo as new prime minister and replaced the maritime, transport and unification ministers. She has been facing demands both from the ruling and the main opposition parties to start afresh with a new lineup of personnel amid deepening public distrust of her policy directions on welfare and the economy.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","trip to four wealthy muslim ,2007 and 2012 presidential campaigns ,cabinet reshuffle the president appointed ,attract oil money in her ,her nine day overseas trip","['Park Geun - hye', 'muslim', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'Yonhap)Lee Byung - kee', 'Park', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park', 'NIS', 'Lee', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Byung - kee', 'inter - korean', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'the Foreign Service Examination', 'Japan', 'NIS', 'Lee', 'Cabinet', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Kim Yon - se']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00341655  0.53267515

What was rather shocking for university professor Lee Dong-yeon, however, was the level of political satire allowed in French society.“France has respected political satire, viewing it as a right for free speech,” said Lee, who teaches Korean traditional art at Korea National University of Arts. “In Korea, however, there are certain subjects that cannot be lampooned publicly.”Though democratic for nearly three decades, South Korea’s freedom of speech has been largely restricted, experts say. Rat graffiti on a G20 poster painted by Park Jeong-soo, a university lecturerThey say that powerful presidents, a history of military dictatorship and other structural problems have long hindered political satire from flourishing in Korean society. The freedom of expression has suffered more under the back-to-back conservative administrations, the global rankings indicate.International media watchdog Freedom House downgraded Korea’s press freedom to “partly free” from “free” in 2011, during President Lee Myung-bak’s term. It continues to be rated “partly free.”Press freedom rankings by Reporters Without Borders also point to a dramatic fall in Korea’s free speech. Its ranking peaked at No. 31 in 2006 during the liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration, but it dropped to No. 69 in 2009 during the first year of Lee’s presidency.This year, Korea ranks 60 among 180 countries in the index, down three notches from a year earlier. Clampdown on political satire and powerful presidency A flyer created by pop artist Lee HaIn recent years, a series of incidents showed how minor offenses, such as graffiti and scattering flyers, could be treated as serious crimes if done with satirical intent. In November 2010, Park Jeong-soo, a university lecturer, was apprehended after spray-painting a rat on G20 Summit posters in Seoul, only a few days prior to the event. Though Park claimed that he drew the rat, inspired by the initial in G20 that sounds like the Korean word for “rat,” the prosecution alleged that the graffiti was intended to insult President Lee Myung-bak. President Lee was widely referred to as a rat by his liberal critics. The court later ruled that the painting was “beyond what freedom of expression allows” and ordered Park to pay a fine of 2 million won ($1,800).The high-profile case rekindled the debate on the government’s tolerance for freedom of expression. “The Korean government uses heavy-handed tactics against criticism of the president, because people tend to refrain from voicing criticism after witnessing the heavy punishment faced by those against the government,” Park Ju-min, the lawyer who represented the lecturer, told The Korea Herald.Park says such practices by the authorities have deterred Koreans from challenging political power, which poses a threat to the development of democracy in the long term. This heavy-handedness has continued under the conservative Park Geun-hye administration.In a similar case, a 21-year-old art student, surnamed Kim, was indicted in December after painting a caricature ridiculing the former dictator Park Chung-hee, the late father of the president. The dictator ruled the country for nearly two decades after seizing power in a military coup.The prosecutors did not charge Kim with lampooning the former leader, but with damaging public property,“(But if it were really about damaging public property,) why wasn’t I arrested when I painted graffiti to mourn victims of the Sewol ferry sinking?” Kim said in a media interview. It doesn’t end there. The painting “Sewol Owol” by local artist Hong Sung-dam, was pulled from the international art festival Gwangju Beinnale for its parody of President Park in August last year.The painting, which depicts President Park as a puppet controlled by her father Park Chung-hee, had a political statement that was “too strong,” experts say.Hong said that he wanted to lampoon President Park and those with power who he thinks should be held accountable for the Sewol ferry tragedy. More than 300 people, mostly students, died or went missing in the accident and many blame the government for its botched rescue efforts. The cases point to the Korean government’s aversion to satire of the president, the traditional art professor Lee pointed out. Behind the fear of political satire are what many see as an “imperial presidency” and Confucian culture that have prevailed for decades here. “Korean presidents have been given an almost god-like status, which is a reminder of the country’s authoritarian past,” the lawyer Park said. “That’s why Koreans seem to fear the president.”Concern looms over rule of law The regular cast of MBC’s “Infinite Challenge”The limited understanding of satire in the political realm has led to abuses of the law by the government, experts point out.One controversial invocation of the law came last October, when Lee Ha, a local pop artist, was captured by the police spreading flyers lampooning President Park from the rooftop of a building in Seoul. Lee was apprehended on charges of trespassing though the owner of the building did not even report him to the police.The 47-year-old pop artist said he was investigated for hours, with the police mainly asking about his political intentions. “The question is ... would the police still apprehend him if the flyer did not bear a satirical image of President Park?” said law professor Hong Seong-soo from Sookmyung Women’s University.In the flyers, the pop artist depicted President Park as an insane woman wearing a floral top and a blue skirt, with her eyes and ears closed. It read “Wanted” at the top and “Mad Government” at the bottom. “Breaking into private property is clearly a violation of the law, but I think he would have only been cautioned by the police if his flyer had not targeted the president,” Hong told The Korea Herald. “The government seems to use the law to suit its political agenda and silence dissent.”But the authorities do not clamp down on every case of political satire about the president. “Only high-profile people, who can wield influence, are selectively punished,” he said. “What I am concerned about is that such inconsistent enforcement of the law could undermine its reliability and stability.” Professor Choi Jin-bong, who teaches mass communication at Sungkonghoe Univeristy, said the government’s actions showed a double standard. “It seems like the government does not apply the same principle to its supporters,” Choi told The Korea Herald, in reference to right-wing activists who at times send anti-North Korea flyers to the communist country on the inter-Korean border.It is a “double standard” by the government not to intervene in the flying of helium-filled balloons containing such leaflets, leftists have claimed. They have been opposed to distribution of anticommunist flyers, maintaining that it poses a threat to public safety by provoking North Korea to retaliate. “It is not fair. Is this really how democracy works?” he asked. Media self-censorship grows Screenshot of “Dojjingaejjin,” a skit from KBS’ comedy show “GagConcert”In the mainstream media, a few Korean TV programs have tried political satire, but faced a backlash from what critics called “external forces.”One of the examples is “LTE News,” a segment of SBS’ comic variety show “People Looking for Laughter.”In one of the episodes that aired on Oct. 6 last year, the hosts satirized President Park’s controversial cabinet appointments and her absence in times of trouble.“When any problem arises regarding her personnel, she happens to be on overseas trips. When her former spokesman Yoon Chang-jung was in trouble (due to his alleged sexual harassment), she was in the U.S. When prime minister-designate Moon Chang-keuk was at the center of controversy (due to his pro-Japan views), she was on an overseas trip in Asia,” said the two hosts in the episode.A few days later, the episode was removed from SBS’ website, renewing questions about government censorship of the media.Speculation swirled that the government exercised influence on the broadcaster to delete the episode, which was firmly denied by the program’s production team. Professor Choi attributes the growing trend of media self-censorship to the system of appointing heads of public broadcasters.“If the heads of public broadcasters are named by the president, the media cannot help but tone down its criticism as a measure of self-restraint,” Choi said. Under the current broadcasting law, the heads of major public broadcasters ― KBS and MBC ― are selected by its board committee, dominated by pro-ruling party members. The president has to approve the appointments.Some of the TV entertainment shows, however, have thrived on screen despite their satirical elements. Among them are KBS’ “Gag Concert,” a long-running comedy show known for slapstick, as well as MBC’s “Infinite Challenge,” a variety program that uses role play and subtitles to offer satirical views. “I like ‘Infinite Challenge’ because I can watch it thoughtlessly, but it touches on important social issues,” said Jung Goo-hoon, 27, who has been watching the show since it began airing 10 years ago.The hugely popular TV shows run mildly critical segments on the government’s policies and social issues. But they still restrict themselves to safe targets, and strictly avoid the president and political elites. “Viewers react sensitively to issues that can directly affect their lives such as tax policy or health insurance,” Choi said. “The government could not crack down on such satire that people can easily relate to because it could backfire.”After all, those in power care about voter sentiment, he added. To bring more political satire to media, producers and TV personalities should become more daring to experiment with their shows and challenge the established powers. “Because that is the way to expand freedom of expression, albeit slowly,” Choi concluded. By Ock Hyun-ju and Hong Hye-jin(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com) (honghyejin@heraldcorp.com)","hosts satirized president park controversial ,gag concert long running comedy ,president park controversial cabinet appointments ,the terror attack in paris ,december after painting caricature ridiculing","['Paris', 'Charlie Hebdo', 'Lee Dong - yeon', 'french', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Korea National University of Arts', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'G20', 'Park Jeong - soo', 'korean', 'Freedom House', 'Korea ’s', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Korea', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Lee ’s', 'Korea', 'Lee HaIn', 'Park Jeong - soo', 'G20 Summit', 'Seoul', 'G20', 'korean', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Park Ju - min', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park', 'Koreans', 'Park Geun', 'Kim', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Hong Sung - dam', 'Hong', 'Park', 'korean', 'Lee', 'confucian', 'korean', 'Park', 'Koreans', 'MBC', 'Lee Ha', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Hong Seong - soo', 'Sookmyung Women ’s University', 'Park', 'Hong', 'the Korea Herald', 'Choi Jin - bong', 'Sungkonghoe Univeristy', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald', 'anti - north Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Dojjingaejjin', 'KBS', 'korean', 'LTE News', 'Yoon Chang - jung', 'U.S.', 'Moon Chang - keuk', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'KBS', 'MBC', 'Gag Concert', 'MBC', 'Jung Goo - hoon', 'Choi', 'Choi']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64677656  0.4776656

(Yonhap)A common vision problem in children is amblyopia, a condition in which poor vision is caused by the eye and brain not working together as they should. In most cases, only one eye is affected, but it sometimes affects both eyes. “If your child holds a book too closely while reading, or closes one eye when trying to see something from a distance, she or he may have amblyopia,” Im said.Many kids with the condition report having trouble participating in gym class or with their schoolwork. Experts say amblyopia, which is often called “lazy eye,” is a developmental problem of the brain rather than a problem within the eyes. However, it can cause permanent loss of vision if not treated early. Improvement in vision can be attained if treated before age 10. “It can be more difficult to treat the condition once a child reaches age 10,” said the doctor. “The earlier treatment starts, the better.”Another condition to watch out for is strabismus, which causes the eyes to look in different directions. For example, while one eye looks forward, the other eye turns either outward, inward, downward or upward.According to Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, about 2 percent of South Korean children are affected by the condition. If not treated early, strabismus can develop into amblyopia.Most children with strabismus are diagnosed between ages 1 and 4. The condition can also be present at birth, and the cause is unknown in most cases. It is recommended to see an optometrist immediately when symptoms are detected. Sometimes children can have both strabismus and amblyopia at the same time. They are often recommended to wear an eye patch over the unaffected eye. The patch forces the affected, misaligned eye to be more active. This, over time, can help strengthen the muscles of the affected eye and eventually restore proper alignment.Im explained that most children reach full visual maturation around age 8, when crucial connections between the brain and the eyes are formed. “That is why early intervention and treatment for children’s vision problems are important,” he said. Like amblyopia, it is important for strabismus in young kids to be detected and treated early. Children who receive early treatment for the condition have a higher chance of developing good vision and properly aligned eyes, studies show.

The Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues, a group consisting chiefly of Korean-American scholars and activists based in the U.S. capital, said it plans to send a letter to Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Relations, the speaker of the House, the president of the Senate and the White House, while carrying out a campaign to encourage other citizens to follow suit. Members of a civic group campaigning for the safeguarding of Dokdo march toward the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Monday to deliver a written complaint about a local ceremony in Japan on Sunday that repeated its claim to the islets. (Yonhap)With Abe expected to visit as early as late April, Tokyo and Washington are believed to be discussing a possible speech on Capitol Hill, which will be the first by a Japanese premier since 1961 and unprecedented before members of both chambers jointly. In the dispatch, the organization pointed to the ultraconservative premier’s ongoing attempts to deny atrocities during World War II, including worshipping at the controversial Yasukuni war shrine during a visit alongside other high-level officials and politicians, and earmarking massive funds for whitewashing historical records. It called the move an “insult” to U.S. veterans and those who lost their loved ones during the six-year battle, as well as the victims of Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean and other Asian women. “We’re not simply opposing his address to the Congress per se, but trying to extract a sincere apology and introspection from him,” said Lee Jung-sil, an art history professor at George Washington University who chairs the coalition. “We will deliver clearly our message that they ought not to accept his speech unless he apologizes for and reflects on the past.” The organization’s drive adds to soaring criticism of Abe’s unabashed management of sensitive historical issues among scholars at home and overseas. Early this month, a group of 19 U.S. historians staged strong protests after Tokyo was found to have pressed schoolbook publisher McGraw-Hill to alter the description of its wartime sexual slavery. In their joint statement, they said “no government should have the right to censor history” and displayed opposition to “the efforts of states or special interests to pressure publishers or historians to alter the results of their research for political purposes.”Their intensifying calls appear to have little chance of inducing a change in Abe’s position given his deep-rooted political belief but could exert pressure on the U.S., though White House officials have said that the premier will be treated in line with the diplomatic protocols for a “state visit.”In 2006, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi sought a congressional address but it did not materialize in the face of stiff resistance over his historical perception by some lawmakers including the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. But Abe could manage to push ahead with his cause if he makes concessions in other key areas as the allies are currently in negotiations on an Asia-Pacific free trade pact called the Trans Pacific Partnership, and an amendment of their bilateral defense guidelines.Only three Japanese leaders have addressed the U.S. Congress so far, including Shigeru Yoshida in 1954, Nobusuke Kishi in 1957 and Hayato Ikeda in 1961.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","staged strong protests after tokyo ,19 historians staged strong protests ,protests after tokyo was found ,protests after tokyo ,strong protests after tokyo","['japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'U.S. Congress', 'the Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues', 'korean - american', 'U.S.', 'Ed Royce', 'the House Committee on Foreign Relations', 'House', 'Senate', 'the White House', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Yonhap)With Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'Capitol Hill', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'korean', 'asian', 'Congress', 'Lee Jung - sil', 'George Washington University', 'Abe ’s', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'McGraw - Hill', 'Abe ’s', 'U.S.', 'White House', 'Junichiro Koizumi', 'the House Foreign Affairs Committee', 'Abe', 'the Trans Pacific Partnership', 'japanese', 'the U.S. Congress', 'Shigeru Yoshida', 'Nobusuke Kishi', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5237506   0.31355545

Through innovative greenhouse projects, middle school students at KIS are investigating agricultural technologies that may help provide adequate food for the world’s needs. They are conducting research to understand food supply issues in a greenhouse on the KIS Pangyo campus in Gyeonggi Province. This began two years ago when KIS middle school science teachers attended a Project Based Learning training presented by the Buck Institute for Education based in California. Four teachers ― Tara Verenna, Jason Martin, Lloyd Clark, and Matt Tyrie ― decided to change the science program to give students a deeper understanding of science through Project Based Learning. The teachers brainstormed how to involve students in real world issues as they learned science principles, and they selected the topic of world food supply. Based on that topic, KIS sixth grade students were presented with the driving question, “How can we grow enough food to feed the world?” All the students then came up with different ideas. They then used a process called “Need to know” to analyze each idea and home in on truly viable solutions. The two solutions selected were aquaponics and hydroponics systems. Students at Korea International School learn aquaponic and hydroponic systems at the school greenhouse. (KIS)Following this, materials were purchased and complete systems built to grow a number of herbs and vegetables. Three systems with different approaches were built by weekend and evening volunteers. Two systems were aquaponic using tanks with fish and water circulation pumps to provide nutrients for the plants. The third system used a hydroponic approach which provides nutrients to the plants through circulated water but without fish. Both systems provide efficient, organic methods for maximizing healthy food production in a small space using limited amounts of water. Students are excited and fully engaged in the greenhouse project which is being documented in a blog (jpmoverseas.blogspot.kr). Students have contributed most of the recent updates to the blog which tells the story of the project from start to the present. Many visitors have come to the school to see the greenhouse and to hear from students about their learning. Students typically conduct the visitor tours with pride. Middle school teacher Tara Verenna said, “When these kids think back to their middle school career, this is what they are going to remember.” Along with their learning about science and global issues, student will no doubt remember actually taking home beautiful cucumbers, squash, beans and herbs to eat.This project is part of a schoolwide emphasis on hands-on learning using real world projects. This emphasis is intended to develop 21st century skills such as creativity, innovation, problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration and global awareness. KIS is committed to helping students be ready to change the world positively and solve future problems. This has led to an increased emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math in real world contexts, and an approach sometimes referred to as STEM. It has resulted in more experiential learning and out-of-the-classroom activities such as the greenhouse project.This requires some retraining of teachers and redesign of curriculum. “Not all teachers can think outside the book,” commented Jason Martin, the middle school department head. However, at KIS this way of teaching is becoming common and expected. Coming years will offer many more opportunities for STEM projects and relevant real-world activities for students. KIS has developed this focus in several other ways including annual seminars and classroom involvement with MIT students who spend a month on campus working with students. In addition, opportunities to learn computer programming at all grade levels and to develop engineering projects in workshop spaces are being developed continuously.Why is KIS promoting this emphasis? According to School Director Stephen Cathers, “Our students deserve an education that prepares them to be competitive in the world of 10 and 20 years from now, and this is what it takes. It also explains the excellent admissions this year to schools such as Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley, Johns Hopkins, Cornell and Columbia. Those schools know this type of education is the key to the future.”Korea International School will host Spring Open Houses at Pangyo Campus and Seoul Campus.

The 13-year-old boy was the sole student to join the school six years ago.It was a stark reminder of ever-shrinking school-age population in Korea that is set to reshape the education environment across the country. The Education Ministry is projecting that there will be 160,000 fewer high school graduates than the total number of openings for freshmen in colleges in 2023.A nationwide reform to reduce the number of university places is underway, and a state-initiated evaluation of each institutes’ reform efforts is slated for August. An elementary school in Ulsan holds an entrance ceremony with only one student and her family members attending. (Yonhap)“At this rate, there will not be enough high school graduates in the country to fill all the college openings. The ministry is planning to overcome this problem by attracting more foreign students,” said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea in a recent meeting with reporters. The measures include providing jobs for families of students coming to Korea to study.But officials at local colleges are saying they are only a stopgap measure, which fails to address the underlying problems. They added that on top of these policies not being mandatary, they require extra budget and a pan-government cooperation which presents yet another challenge.“We are seeing a drastic drop in the number of students due to a decrease in the school-age population, which we suspect is induced by low fertility rate. The shift in population will have direct impact on education environment as a whole,” said an official from Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.Korea’s school-age population ― referring to those aged between 6 and 21 ― accounted for 18.1 percent of the Korea’s 50.4 million population in 2014, according to a joint report by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and Statistics Korea. The school-age share of the population has plummeted from 39.1 percent in 1970, and will continue to drop until it reaches 11.1 percent in 2060, the report said.With the school-aged population shrinking, schools are being closed. Since 1982, 3,596 schools have shut, according to Rep. Kang Eun-hee.Local news reports showed that 250 elementary, middle and high schools across Korea will have either one or no new recruits in the 2015 school year. While schools in rural parts of the country have had trouble attracting students, a recent tally indicates that Seoul ― the capital and most populous city ― is also suffering from the same issue.The number of elementary school students in Seoul was 469,000, the lowest figure since authorities started keeping track in 1965, according to the SMOE.Last year, the SMOE decided to merge Sinheung Elementary School and Heungil Elementary School, both of which had fewer than 400 pupils. While 324 schools were merged across the country from 2009 to 2013, it was the first school merger in Seoul.“The decrease in school-age population is no longer confined to rural areas, but has expanded to urban areas as well. It seems the number of school closures will continue to grow,” Kang said.Philip Graham Ryken, president of Wheaton College, said during a recent visit to Korea that the population issue was one of major issues that was discussed during his talks with heads of higher education bodies here. “I’m surprised to learn how serious population decline in Korea is likely to be, and how much that will affect the well-being of Korean colleges and universities. That’s a much more acute issue here than in the United States,” he said. Experts have long warned of the problem stemming from the fall in population, said Kim Dong-seok, the spokesperson for the Korea Federation of Teachers’ Association. But improvised solutions without a long-term plan can bring about further problems, he said.An example would be a “mismatch” between the number of new teachers and the openings due to retiring teachers. Local education offices decide how many teachers to hire in April, but the number of teachers retiring are confirmed by year-end. This is why a year-by-year solution will not work, and a long-term plan is necessary, Kim pointed out.A further decline in the school-age population will bring changes to how people approach education, said Lee Man-gi, an official from local education firm Uway. “The overall trend ― of most students feeling like they have to go to college ― is likely to change,” he said. He added that a shortage in students would affect mostly lower-ranked colleges, but the competition for top-tier colleges will become more intense. “Education in the country is likely to become polarized. Some people will spend much more money than now on private education, while others won’t spend money on it at all.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","last month icheon elementary school ,freshmen in colleges in 2023 ,000 fewer high school graduates ,first school merger in seoul ,last month icheon elementary","['Icheon Elementary School', 'Korea', 'the Education Ministry', 'Ulsan', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Korea', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and Statistics Korea', 'Kang Eun - hee', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'SMOE', 'Sinheung Elementary School', 'Heungil Elementary School', 'Seoul', 'Kang', 'Philip Graham Ryken', 'Wheaton College', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the United States', 'Kim Dong - seok', 'the Korea Federation of Teachers ’ Association', 'Kim', 'Lee Man - gi', 'Uway', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71713907  0.59536117

Once fully implemented, both sides will remove duties on nearly all export items.  Ed Fast (right), Canada’s international trade minister, poses with a vendor and a Canadian lobster at the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market in Seoul last week. (Ed Fast Flickr)“Our government believes trade and investment are the twin engines of our economic growth,” Fast said. “Most importantly, trade liberalization has an overall positive impact on the economy by setting in motion the process of innovation.”When the North American Free Trade Agreement was being negotiated 25 years ago, the minister noted, it was feared that Canada’s wine industry would be overtaken by that of California.“But over the last 20 years, our industry has adapted to new global challenges and kept on improving. Today, Canadian wine is savored by connoisseurs and sweeping the highest accolades worldwide,” he noted. Fast said the key to Canadian companies’ competitiveness on the world stage has been innovation, which requires a high level of education, creativity and a culture of entrepreneurialism. To this end, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government has preferred providing repayable loans to the industries rather than direct subsidies.“We believe the economy should be able to stand on its own two feet and the best way to (incentivize) companies to grow and invest is to keep corporate tax as low as possible,” Fast said.Canada’s corporate tax rate dropped from 29 percent to 15 percent over the past decade, making Canada the most competitive tax jurisdiction among the G7 countries, according to the minister.Fast pointed to Canada’s socially responsible corporate governance, which has laid the foundation for ethical business operations worldwide.“The Canadian government has brought in a series of laws to make our public servants more accountable to their acts; make their transactions transparent; and apply regulatory prudence to our finance industry,” he said.The Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act, which applies to oil, gas and mining companies, was recently introduced to enhance the transparency of payments to foreign governments. “This legislation was driven by the industries themselves,” Fast said. “They formulated the initiative and asked the government to implement it in legislation.” Touching on Canada’s successful immigration policy, the minister said his government prioritizes attracting “economic immigrants” who have the required skills to “plug into our economy” where there are labor shortages. “Having the most generous immigration and refugee program in the world, our government wants to make sure that our immigrants have the necessary skills to contribute to our economy and society successfully,” Fast explained. “Those Koreans who want to be part of the Canadian family moving forward are very much welcome in Canada.”Fast came with 115 individuals representing over 80 Canadian companies in diverse industries: agriculture and agri-food, aerospace, defense and security, information and communications technology, automotive, banking, shipping and sustainable technology. At a Canadian beer, wine and spirit tasting event at Lotte Hotel in Seoul last Monday, Canadian and Korean companies had a chance to network and build partnerships. The trade mission was given institutional and financial support by the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service, Export Development Canada, the Canadian Commercial Corporation and the Business Development Bank of Canada. Fast announced the appointment of Eric Walsh as the new Canadian Ambassador to Korea prior to his departure from Canada. As Canada’s first free trade agreement with an Asian country, the CKFTA covers trade in goods and services, investment, government procurement, nontariff barriers and environment and labor cooperation. It also covers provisions in intellectual property, telecommunications services, environment, labor and electronic commerce. Canadian merchandise exports to Korea are expected to increase by 32 percent, and the prices of popular items such as goose down jackets, ice wine and lobster will drop. Korean auto parts, home appliances and textile goods are expected to benefit while Korea’s agricultural industry will suffer about $3.2 million in losses annually. The Korean government said it would invest over $2 billion to enhance export competitiveness and the FTA utilization rate, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Colombia and Korea signed a bilateral free trade agreement in February last year, and the agreement is currently being reviewed by Colombia’s Supreme Court. It is expected to come into force around June, according to the embassy. The two countries currently have a trade imbalance: Colombia exported $207 million worth of goods in 2013, while Korea exported over six times more at $1.34 billion. Pinilla said the gap would narrow and more Colombian produce would be available in Korea once the FTA goes into effect. The ambassador, a former Air Force general, noted, “Political stability in Colombia has increased significantly after 2000 thanks to our military that did an amazing, amazing job of defeating the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) terrorist group.”With increased security, foreign investment has poured into Colombia, creating jobs and new middle classes, he said. Pinilla stressed that there are massive investment opportunities for Korean firms in Colombia, particularly in developing infrastructure, energy and agriculture. The country has high demand for highways, railroads, airports and ports.The Bogota Metro project, which aims to build a $7 billion subway system in the capital city, will open bidding for foreign companies in the second half of this year. The city government plans to open its first 32-kilometer line, serving 27 stations by 2020. Colombia has one of the highest economic growth rates and lowest inflation rates in Latin America, at 4.3 percent and 3 percent, respectively. The volume of foreign direct investment in the country rose from $6.8 billion in 2010 to $16.8 billion in 2013. Around 40 Korean companies operate in Colombia with their cumulative investment surpassing $70 million.Pinilla emphasized that small and medium-sized Colombian and Korean enterprises in auto-manufacturing and cosmetics have room to collaborate through joint ventures: sharing information, technology and resources.Regarding the peace process that began in November 2012 to end half a century of armed conflict between the FARC guerrilla organization and the Colombian government, Pinilla said, “Our government pressed on with aggressive assaults on the guerilla fighters and brought them to their knees. Realizing they could not keep their powers in Colombia, the FARC leaders gave in to the peace process.” FARC has killed more than 220,000 people for the last 50 years since it was founded in response to violent government repression of popular progressive movements in the 1950s and ’60s.“The FARC used to align itself with the socialist camp with financial and military backing,” Pinilla said. “But with its funding dried up after the breakup of the Soviet Union, it turned to narcotics trafficking to finance its operations.” Three parts of the five-point agenda ― land reform, political participation and ending narco-trafficking ― have been negotiated. The other two are under negotiation ― ending the conflict and compensating the victims.“FARC will exist as a nonarmed political party within our democratic system,” Pinilla explained, adding that Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon will visit Korea before the end of April to deal with the postconflict situation.The ambassador pointed to the high level of military cooperation between Colombia and Korea following presidential and ministerial visits over the last three years. Korean warships have been sent to Colombia to help patrol the seas against narco-traffickers, he said. More than 5,100 Colombian troops fought in the Korean War (1950-53) as part of the United Nations Forces; mostly between ages 18 and 21, 131 soldiers died in combat, 69 disappeared and 476 were injured. Colombia and Korea established diplomatic relations in 1962 and became strategic partners in 2013.Colombia’s Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas Santa Maria and Education Minister Gina Maria Parody d’Eecheona are to visit Korea by the end of April.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","interview last week korea perception ,korean people think about colombia ,korean firms in colombia particularly ,colombia and korea following presidential ,interview last week korea","['korean', 'Colombia', 'Juan Valdez', 'colombian', 'Tito Saul Pinilla', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'colombian', 'Maria Angela Holguin', 'Korea', 'Juan Manuel', 'Pinilla', 'Korea', 'Colombia', 'Tito Saul Pinilla', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Colombian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea Herald)Colombia', 'Korea', 'Colombia ’s Supreme Court', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'Pinilla', 'colombian', 'Korea', 'FTA', 'Air Force', 'Colombia', 'FARC', 'Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia', 'Colombia', 'Pinilla', 'korean', 'Colombia', 'Bogota', 'Colombia', 'korean', 'Colombia', 'Pinilla', 'colombian', 'korean', 'FARC', 'colombian', 'Pinilla', 'Colombia', 'FARC', 'Pinilla', 'the Soviet Union', 'Pinilla', 'colombian', 'Juan Carlos Pinzon', 'Korea', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Colombia', 'colombian', 'the United Nations Forces', 'Colombia', 'Korea', 'Mauricio Cardenas', 'Gina Maria', 'd’eecheona', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47023061  0.64864886

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Ha discussed his 10th novel, “The Republic of Uzupis,” which delves into human nature and nostalgia. “As mankind’s universal character, I believe all people have certain longings for the past,” Ha told the guests. “This novel had given shape to our nostalgia, those sentiments coming from life’s losses and deep inside our hearts.”Published in 2009, the book tells the story of a 40-year-old Asian man, Hal, who travels to Lithuania in search of his lost homeland ―the Republic of Uzupis ― to bury his father’s ashes. Uncertain about the existence of the republic, Hal wanders through streets of Vilnius, described in melancholic and surreal terms, before he eventually commits suicide in a deserted apartment. Uzupis, meaning “on the other side of the river,” is a neighborhood in the center of the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Originally a haven for bohemian artists and writers, the town declares itself a sovereign republic on April Fool’s Day.Ha first visited Lithuania in January 2000 to meet his publisher-friend Kerry Shawn Key.“I was struck by the strong impression I got on my visit,” Ha said. “Vilnius was a barren, dreary city with breathtakingly beautiful women and depressed-looking men, an independent country just waking up from Soviet rule.”Ha said that he originally wrote a screenplay for a movie, but the plan fell through for financial reasons. The novel has been translated into Lithuanian, English, French and Czech. When writing a novel, he has to finish it within 40 days due to his limited time off from teaching at a university, Ha said. “I finish a bottle of whiskey every two or three days to keep total concentration on my work.”The prominent author pointed out that in contrast to nonfiction, fiction is created almost entirely from the writer’s imagination and impression: “Novelists do observe the world with a keen eye, but the process involves composing bits of our experiences into a narrative.”Ha quipped, “As you age, it is not easy to keep your senses in tune with the times. Readers don’t want to read old-fashioned, fogeyish stories.”Ha said he thinks of himself not as a Korean writer, but one among the world’s many writers. Ha is currently the Korean ambassador to the Uzupis Republic.“Literature is an intangible asset for our spirit and culture,” Ha said. “It enriches our insights into life, stimulates our sensibilities and makes us into unique and attractive individuals.“But our education churns out students with industrial mindsets,” he warned. “A society which does not value literature is a numb, unmindful society.” After majoring in creative writing at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, Ha received his M.A. at the University of Poitiers and Ph.D. at the University of Limoges in France. His first novel, “The Road to the Racetrack” (1990), made him a star overnight in Korea for its unorthodox style and controversial critique of social conventions. “People viewed my work as immoral and idiosyncratic and cursed in detest,” Ha said. Ha wrote four more “Racetrack” novels in the next three years: “Racetracks at Crossroads” (1991), “For Racetracks"" (1991), ""An Alder Tree at the Racetracks” (1992) and “What Happened at the Racetracks” (1993). These novels embroiled Ha in a series of debates with Korea’s conservative literary critics in what became known as the “Racetrack controversy.” In a literary review in 1990, he said he always asks himself what, how and why to write ― principles that still guide his approach. “On the ‘what’ question, I try to write about human beings and their situations. They are individuals neither better nor worse than us; those who can be us,” Ha said.“On the ‘how’ question, I strive to write things as realistically as possible. If I describe things through the lens of my intentions, I end up distorting the reality. Authors must take moral responsibility for that.“On the ‘why’ question, I believe portraying reality truthfully makes beautiful and aesthetic works. Also, I write in order to free readers’ minds.”Ha has written over 12 novels, two collections of poems and several essays. He teaches creative writing at Dongduk Women’s University in Seoul, where he currently serves as dean of the College of Humanities.

Among the patients, the number of those seeking cosmetic surgery and treatments has increased by 70.5 percent annually, according to the Health Ministry. A single foreign cosmetic surgery patient on average spends 3.63 million won on treatment, while all foreign patients on average spend 1.86 million won. More than 210,000 foreigners from 191 countries were treated in medical institutions here in 2013. About 40 percent of the Chinese patients ― who account for the largest number of all foreign patients in South Korea ― visit Korea for plastic surgeries or aesthetic treatments. The number of Chinese patients increased from 1,657 in 2009 to 25,433 in 2013.Meanwhile, the number of Korean patients filing medical disputes after receiving cosmetic surgery or other aesthetic treatments increased dramatically from 439 in 2012 to 805 last year. Last year, a woman in her 50s died of dyspnea while receiving liposuction at a clinic in Seoul in September.In January, a Chinese woman who suffered a cardiac arrest while receiving plastic surgery in southern Seoul was sent to a general hospital and fell into a coma.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean patients filing medical disputes ,of korean patients filing medical ,foreigners visiting korea for treatment ,korean patients filing medical ,treating foreign patients will also","['south korean', 'the Health Ministry', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 2.          3.          0.         ... -0.2028418   0.59301275

Moon Chung-in (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)“The raison d’être of a state lies in securing the safety of its nation by reducing military tensions and preventing a war. That is why preventive diplomacy is so important. But there seems to be little effort to engage in such a diplomacy,” he told The Korea Herald.“President Park has so far been rigidly adhering to the principle of ‘only official and transparent contact (with the North).’ She needs to be more flexible with regard to the mode of contacts (either official or unofficial) with Pyongyang.”As for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s expected visit to Russia in May to attend the 70th anniversary celebration of the victory in World War II, Moon said the world needs to create more opportunities for Kim to come out onto the global stage to help induce a positive change in the isolated state.“Unlike his father, he can speak English, and his leadership style could also change by listening to what other leaders say,” he said. “When the international community recognizes the North as a legitimate member, it will behave in line with international rules, norms and standards.”Commenting on Washington’s hitherto unfruitful policy toward Pyongyang, the scholar said that U.S. President Barack Obama apparently looks at Pyongyang as a target for regime change rather than a legitimate interlocutor, given his recent remarks on the possible collapse of the North Korean regime.“Obama might think his country can demonize the North and achieve a regime change there, but that is hubris. And he thinks information can seep into the North, eventually bringing about a change, but that shows his ignorance,” he said.“His comment about regime collapse also shows the shortsightedness of U.S. policymakers including Obama who have not thought deeply about the profound consequences of a regime change in the North.”The following are excerpts of the interview with professor Moon.The Korea Herald: Some say Kim’s expected visit to Russia in May will be a move to ignore the North’s long-standing tradition of visiting China first to underscore its diplomatic priorities. What do you think about this?Moon Chung-in: China did the same thing. President Xi Jinping visited Seoul first before Pyongyang, breaking a traditional code. Given the strained ties with Beijing, Pyongyang could use the Russian visit card in order to draw China’s attention. In addition, the North has also maintained a long-standing traditional relationship with Russia. At present, Russia and North Korea are in a similar predicament; both of them are suffering from sanctions imposed by the U.S and other Western nations. From the perspective of Chinese leader Xi, it would be good to see the two countries -- both bordering China -- getting along well. It would be bad for China if the two neighbors were caught in a conflict, creating instability along its borders.KH: The inter-Korean impasse has continued for many years. How do you think the two Koreas can achieve a breakthrough to break the deadlock? Moon: On Dec. 29 last year, Ryoo Kihl-jae, unification minister and vice chair of South Korea’s presidential committee to prepare for reunification, made a dialogue offer to the North. Then, in his New Year’s policy briefing (to President Park Geun-hye), he also put forward a set of proposals including inter-Korean talks. But these proposals came unilaterally without any prior consultation with the North. What’s also noteworthy is that the ideas, put forward by Seoul, had already been included in the inter-Korean summit declarations on June 15, 2000, and Oct. 4, 2007. Had Seoul mentioned that it made these offers because there were such agreements in past declarations, then it would have been much easier for the North to accept them. The North might have been suspicious of the intentions behind Seoul’s overtures.Moreover, the Key Resolve South Korea-U.S. military exercise will begin in March with the Foal Eagle training to come later that month. The North has called for the cancellation of the drills in return for a moratorium on nuclear tests, but the U.S. rejected the offer. The North also demanded that the South lift the so-called May 24 sanctions as a precondition to hold reunions of separated families, But Seoul flatly rejected it. So chances for any immediate inter-Korean dialogue seem rather dim.In my opinion, Seoul can be more flexible. It can contact Pyongyang and say that it can’t cancel the drills, but can consider decreasing the scale, intensity, and duration of the exercises instead, and decide not to mobilize strategic weapons systems for the drills. Seoul then can reciprocally demand Pyongyang to scale down its winter military drills and agree to hold reunions of separated families. When the reunions are held, the two sides may be able to discuss the resumption of the tours to Mount Geumgangsan, which could potentially lead to the lifting of the May 24 sanctions. But these prospects seem rather far-fetched for now.Should the South Korea-U.S. drills be launched as scheduled and the U.S. forward-deploy their strategic weapons, the North would react very sensitively, which would heighten military tensions. And we never know if the North would push ahead with its fourth nuclear test in April or May. This would apparently weaken the voices of those in the South who are in favor of dialogue with the North, and escalate tension on the peninsula. Then President Park Geun-hye could end up losing a golden opportunity to improve cross-border relations in the crucial third year of her five-year term, after which she could fall into lame-duck status.KH: Seoul and Washington say that the issue of a nuclear moratorium and their military drills are unrelated. Seoul has also argued that the issue of lifting the May 24 sanctions should be separated from the issue of holding reunions of separated families. What do you think?Moon: The raison d‘être of a state lies in securing the safety of its nation by reducing military tensions and preventing the outbreak of a war. That is why preventive diplomacy is so important. But there seems to be little effort to engage in such preventive diplomacy. The two Koreas have expressed their desire to hold inter-Korean dialogue, but they have yet to meet halfway. I believe Seoul should make unofficial contact with Pyongyang for selecting the agenda and narrowing policy differences before official meetings. Without such a process official North-South meetings are bound to fail. But President Park has so far been rigidly adhering to the principle of “only official and transparent contact.” She needs to be more flexible with regard to the mode of contacts with Pyongyang.KH: The thorniest issue in the relations between Seoul and Pyongyang, and between Washington and Pyongyang is the North’s pursuit of nuclear power status. Pyongyang has adopted the policy of simultaneously developing nuclear arms and its economy, and has stated in its constitution that it is a nuclear power. Given this, can those relations be fundamentally improved?Moon: Officials as well as pundits in Seoul and Washington believe that Pyongyang has been pursuing nuclear arms for regime survival rather than for national security. But this is not a right reasoning. Pyongyang seeks to have nuclear arms for both reasons. The North believes the possession of nuclear arms is the best method to ensure its national security and regime survival, because in North Korea’s monolithic “suryong” (supreme leader) system, there is no distinction between regime’s security and national security. Conservatives in the West and South Korea do not appear to understand this. After all, North Korea’s perception of its utmost threat stems from the U.S.’ nuclear potential and possible aggression. Pyongyang regards the provision of America’s nuclear umbrella to the South through extended deterrence as the most pressing threat. The collapse of Libya and Iraq convinced the North that it should not look weak, since otherwise it could also face a fatal destiny. Thus the South and the U.S. need to address the North’s security concerns. For that, the allies should take a more proactive stance on issues ranging from improving the U.S.-North Korea relations to establishing a peace regime on the peninsula. But without taking any such stance, South Korea and the U.S. have been calling on the North to denuclearize first. Would the North do that? In early March 2012, Vice Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho of the North visited New York for a conference in which then-Senator John Kerry and Henry Kissinger participated as part of the panel. I was among them. There, Ri said to Kerry, “There are four countries that have no diplomatic ties with the U.S. in the world-- Cuba, Bhutan, Iran and North Korea. Bhutan did not want to open diplomatic relations with the U.S., and Iran and Cuba once had diplomatic ties with the U.S., although their relations were severed later on. But the North is the only country that the U.S. never recognized diplomatically.” Kerry, in response, said no senator including himself would be willing to ratify the diplomatic normalization treaty with Pyongyang unless it gave up its nuclear arms. This means the North should change first. It will be very hard for the North to accommodate such a demand unilaterally.KH: Some commentators called the U.S. policy toward the North “strategic patience.” How do you assess the U.S. policy?Moon: Last month, President Obama mentioned the possibility of the North Korean regime collapsing. I think that illustrates what Obama has kept in mind with regard to North Korea. Obama’s thoughts about the North have also been revealed in a memoir written by Jeff Bader, who served as the senior director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council.KH: Yes. I read the section of his memoir in which he said that many in the administration thought that a regime change may be the only option to make the North renounce its nuclear program.Moon: Sure. That idea still continues to prevail in the Obama administration. During his presidential campaign, Obama stated he is willing to sit down for talks with Iran and North Korea. But at the time of the presidential transition committee, Obama appeared to have no desire for dialogue and looked at the North as a target for regime change. On April 5, 2009, several hours before Obama addressed his “nuclear weapons-free world” speech in Prague, the North launched a rocket, which might have led Obama to form a negative impression. Since then, demonization of North Korea appeared to have begun. In addition, Obama was not able to pay sufficient attention to the North with so many other issues on his foreign policy agenda -- a reason why anti-Pyongyang bureaucrats took charge of North Korean issues. In the end, “strategic patience” was no different from the “malign neglect” or “hostile neglect” that the Bush’s first-term administration adopted. After all, in the Jan. 21 interview with YouTube, Obama laid bare his true intentions about the North -- that there is no option other than a regime change to resolve the nuclear issue involving Pyongyang. But in my opinion, Obama’s idea of regime change in North Korea seems very much misleading. He might think his country can demonize the North and achieve a regime change there, but that is hubris. And he thinks information can seep into the North, eventually bringing about a change there, but that shows his ignorance of North Korean society. His comment about the regime collapse also shows the shortsightedness of U.S. policymakers including Obama who have not thought deeply about the profound consequences of a regime change in the North. In a nutshell, the Obama administration’s hubris, ignorance and shortsightedness have bungled its North Korea policy.KH: Obama has about two more years left in office. Is there a possibility that Washington-Pyongyang relations might improve?Moon: Given current developments, it seems hardly plausible for North Korea and the U.S. to improve bilateral ties. But it all depends on Seoul, and how Seoul and Beijing cooperate. The U.S. appears to think that South Korea and China, not to mention Japan, are siding with the U.S. when it comes to the North Korean nuclear issue. But that seems to be a misunderstood proposition. Since the South would have to bear the full brunt of any instability or collapse in the North or military clashes on the peninsula, Seoul could become more proactive in tackling North Korean issues. Seoul could move to resume the six-party talks at an early date, and seek to enhance cross-border ties despite U.S. moves to toughen sanctions against the North. In my view, the South should take the initiative. The U.S. has been sort of a bothersome bystander. As the U.S. doesn’t respond to its calls for the unconditional resumption of the talks, China has grown sick and tired in which some sort of fatigue effects set in motion. The North should also realize that it cannot make any turnaround in the deadlock without South Korea’s help. Thus, the North should accept South Korea’s offer for talks to discuss a wide range of issues including the nuclear issue. The North has been arguing that its nuclear program can be discussed only with the U.S. But such rigid and stupid thinking has been a hindrance to productive talks.KH: China has stepped up its diplomacy with neighboring states. And it has also pushed for a variety of initiatives such as a maritime Silk Road, the initiative to build an Asian security mechanism and the establishment of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. What do you think about all these moves?Moon: During the previous Hu Jintao government, China adopted the “sanlin” foreign policy toward its neighbors, which consists of “mulin,” “anlin” and “fulin,” or an “amicable, secure and prosperous neighborhood.” But the Xi Jinping government has put forward the principles of “qin cheng hui rong” -- meaning the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in conducting its periphery diplomacy. With this policy vision, China has paid much attention to maintaining good relations with its neighbors. Why? There are reasons.Unlike the U.S., China has more than 20 neighbors with which it shares land and maritime borders. China can focus on economic development based on stable relations with these neighboring states. Should any border conflicts arise -- like the ones with Vietnam, India and Russia in the past, China may feel unnerved. Also such a neighborhood policy is an inevitable choice amid its ascent to the international stage. How can China take on a leadership role if it has shaky relations with its neighbors? So I don’t think we need to look at China’s diplomatic moves with great suspicion. Some raise concerns that these moves are intended to expand China’s sphere of influence. But what’s wrong with that? The U.S. has projected its power all the way into the Western Pacific and has been doing an offshore balancing act.KH: What do you think about Japan’s failure to fully atone for its wartime enslavement of Asian women, euphemistically called comfort women?Moon: Abe committed three fallacies regarding the comfort women issue. The first is the fallacy of technicality. Tokyo has said the victims were mobilized not by the Japanese Army but by Korean civilian brokers who brought the young women to frontline brothels. They have argued that Japan as a state did not forcibly drag them to the brothels. But that shows their lack of understanding about the wartime mobilization system from 1938 through 1944 when even all metal items including metal bowls and plates, in addition to young women and others, in all houses in rural areas across the nation were taken away to support combat missions. So it is a fallacy to argue the victims were not forcibly taken to the brothels. The second is the fallacy of legality. Tokyo says all issues concerning its colonization of Korea were settled through the 1965 deal that normalized bilateral relations, but the comfort women issue was not covered under the deal. Lastly, is the fallacy of proportionality. Some people say the number of victims is 2,000 or 20,000. Tokyo says the number is far smaller than that. But the issue involving universal norms and morality is not a matter of proportionality. Even if there had been only one victim, Japan should have apologized for that. As long as Japan does not rectify these fallacies, it would be difficult to improve Seoul-Tokyo relations.KH: What do you think about Abe’s mantra of “proactive pacifism”?Moon: I once had a chance to talk with a professor who was a policy adviser for Prime Minister Abe. I asked him if the term “positive peace” made sense to him. I explained that in international relations theory, there are two kinds of peace -- “positive peace” and “negative peace.” Positive peace is a state of durable peace in which no structural causes of war or violence exist -- an ideal state of peace where justice, equality and justice materialize. Achieving negative peace is managing unstable peace through military deterrence, alliances, confidence-building measures and arms control -- in other words, managing the status quo of unstable peace. Abe first used the term positive peace and then changed it to proactive pacifism as some had taken issue with the term. During a speech at the Hudson Institute in September 2012, Abe said, “You may call me a right-wing militarist, if you want. But we cannot help but build a military that can win a war -- amid the rise of China.” Under his proactive pacifism drive, he has sought to secure the right to collective self-defense, establish the National Security Council, enact a secrecy law, jack up defense spending and rewrite the war-renouncing Article 9 of the Constitution. This does not seem to match what Abe calls proactive pacifism, as these moves do not make neighboring states feel secure. Even though Abe says he is advocating proactive pacifism, (his campaign) appears to carry some traits of warmongering.This is the eighth and last installment in a special New Year’s series of interviews with preeminent scholars on international politics and security. -- Ed.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","reopening inter korean dialogue political ,inter korean dialogue political scientist ,korea presidential committee to prepare ,in reopening inter korean dialogue ,tackling north korean issues seoul","['Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Moon Chung - in', 'Yonsei University', 'north korean', 'Moon Chung - in', 'Kim Myung - sub', 'the Korea Herald', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Russia', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Moon', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Russia', 'North ’s', 'China', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'russian', 'China', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'U.S', 'chinese', 'Xi', 'China', 'China', 'inter - korean', 'Koreas', 'moon', 'Ryoo Kihl - jae', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North - South', 'Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'North', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'America', 'Libya', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Ri Yong - ho', 'New York', 'John Kerry', 'Henry Kissinger', 'Ri', 'Kerry', 'U.S.', 'Cuba', 'Bhutan', 'Iran', 'North Korea', 'Bhutan', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'Cuba', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Kerry', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'north korean', 'Obama', 'North Korea', 'Obama ’s', 'Jeff Bader', 'asian', 'the National Security Council', 'moon', 'Obama', 'Obama', 'Iran', 'North Korea', 'Obama', 'Prague', 'North Korea', 'Obama', 'anti - pyongyang', 'north korean', 'the Bush ’s', 'YouTube', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Obama', 'North Korea', 'Obama', 'Washington - Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'China', 'asian', 'the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'moves?moon', 'Hu Jintao', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'India', 'Russia', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'the japanese Army', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Abe ’s', 'Abe', 'Abe', 'the Hudson Institute', 'Abe', 'China', 'the National Security Council', 'Abe', 'Abe', 'Song Sang - ho']",5,"[ 5.          1.          0.         ... -0.15434918  0.37484422

Its plan consists in engaging 10 million Seoul citizens to take individual actions, including purchasing “green electricity” ― solar and wind power ― recycling and taking public transport.“If a single Seoul citizen can reduce 1 ton of CO2, together we can reduce 10 million tons of CO2 emissions,” said Yoon Young-cheol from the city government in a statement.A report last year from the International Panel on Climate Change recommended that Asia, including South Korea, reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 to 50 percent by 2050 to prevent climate change disasters. In its efforts to respond to climate change and energy crises in the aftermath of Japan’s Fukushima nuclear accident, the Seoul government in 2012 launched its flagship energy policy: “One Less Nuclear Power Plant.”The plan aims to cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 2 million tons of oil ― the annual capacity of a nuclear power plant. Through the policy, the city reduced its CO2 emissions by 5.63 million tons between 2012 and 2014, mostly by engaging its citizens in energy-saving practices ― such as switching to LED lights. An LED lamp is several times more electrically efficient than an incandescent lamp.Aside from switching to LED lights and taking public transport, the city government encourages its citizens to reduce their food waste by 30 percent, use energy- and water-efficient appliances, and make their homes energy-efficient by being sensible about energy use.South Korea is one of the world’s top 15 greenhouse gas emitters. In 2009, the central government announced it would reduce its greenhouse emissions by 4 percent by 2020.The Seoul City government is to unveil detailed plans to reduce CO2 emissions at the World Congress of the ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability in April.For more information on the campaign, visit www.seoul.go.kr.

The council directors reviewed last year’s programs leading up to the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit held in Busan last December. The summit celebrated 25 years of bilateral relations and the center’s activities since it was founded in 2009.  Participants pose for a photograph at the seventh annual council meeting of the ASEAN-Korea Center at Lottel Hotel in Seoul last week. ASEAN-Korea CenterDiscussion focused on this year’s programs: promoting intra-agency collaboration; supporting small and medium enterprises; building capacity for trade; training tourism professionals; boosting cultural exchanges and youth networking; and implementing projects outlined in the joint statement of the summit. A reception hosted by Korea’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yong was held at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Thursday. “Our friendship was founded upon humble beginnings and is now flourishing day after day,” Cho said in a keynote speech, noting that the sectoral dialogue partnership established in 1989 became a strategic partnership in 2010.Secretary-General of ASEAN-Korea Center Chung Hae-moon said, “While the European Union has been underpinned by the two pillars of the Christian civilization and democracy, the ASEAN has been guided by the value of ‘harmony in diversity.’” “It is no small feat that ASEAN has been able to achieve ‘unity in diversity’ across the diverse spectrum of cultures, ethnicities, religions, languages, ideologies and histories.”Chung said that the bilateral free trade agreement that entered into force in 2009 has made ASEAN Korea’s core partner on all fronts. “Our multifaceted, multilayered and multidimensional relations give us optimism about our future.”The ASEAN Economic Community is scheduled to launch by the end of this year and is expected to create an economic bloc of 640 million people and a combined annual gross domestic product of $3 trillion. The AEC will promote East Asia’s integration and cooperation, in addition to being a growth engine of the global economy, according to the secretary-general. From 1989 to 2013, bilateral trade volume increased seventeenfold from $8.2 billion to $138 billion. ASEAN is Korea’s top travel destination, second-largest trade partner surpassing the U.S., European Union and Japan, and the third-largest investment haven.

They've started to pass forward-looking regulations for the ride-sharing service. That's what we believe we need to do in Korea,"" he said at a press conference held in Seoul.The ride-booking app, launched here in 2013, offers a taxi or private car upon a mobile request from users. It has been under intense scrutiny from existing taxi drivers and in dispute with the government as its unregistered service is currently regarded as illegal.   The prosecution in Seoul indicted Uber chief Travis Kalanick and the head of the Korean unit last December for violation of a rule that requires all vehicles for business purposes to be licensed.  From January, the Seoul city government began offering a million won ($916) reward to those who report cars that operate using Uber.  Plouffe, however, did not further elaborate on details of such a registration system, or as to how Uber will seek to mend fences with taxi drivers. He only implied that the legalization of Uber will bring benefits to the overall economy.   ""The taxi industry (in Korea) is almost exclusively a cash industry, but Uber provides a cashless service that is good for local businesses as well as consumers that can change the overall transportation market,"" he said.    A few hundred taxi drivers staged a protest at the entrance of the hotel where Plouffe spoke, demanding Uber leave the country so they can secure their jobs.  He was also not clear on whether Uber would conform to the obligation to pay taxes in Korea if the government gives a nod to its local operation, saying the venture firm is ""in talks with officials to come up with the best solution"" as ""what's considered a valid measure is different in every city.""  Plouffe said Uber ""will eventually be a perfect fit"" for Korea, one of the most IT-savvy countries in the world, as it will benefit both riders and drivers in the long term, citing the latest partnership agreement the firm signed with a local taxi company based in the South Korean port city of Incheon.   ""We are eager to seek solutions with Korean officials at a local and national level, to offer an alternative service that works well for the city."" he said.

Osong is located near Cheongju.  She said the innovation center in Cheongju will play a key role in combing ideas of startups and channeling research and development, as well as funds of conglomerates, into the bioindustry in the region.  LG, one of South Korea's largest family-controlled conglomerates, will provide more than 27,300 patents to smaller companies to help them explore new business opportunities, according to Park's office. Last week, Hyundai Motor Group, the world's fifth-largest carmaker, also said it will provide about 1,000 unused patents to those who want to open automotive startups in an innovation center in Gwangju, a city located about 330 kilometers south of Seoul.  South Korea has so far created seven innovation centers, including one that is supported by Samsung Group, South Korea's largest family-controlled conglomerate whose flagship unit is Samsung Electronics Co., the world's top smartphone maker.  South Korea plans to set up 10 other innovation centers in major cities across the country this year as part of Park's push to build a creative economy.  Park's signature creative economy vision calls for boosting the economy and creating jobs by turning creative ideas into real businesses through science and technology and information technology.

The Tapiola Sinfonietta orchestra performed the same week in Seoul, representing the city’s vibrant cultural scene. “Our city is a seedbed of creating innovative new jobs as well as a cultural capital for the citizens, communities and companies,” said Tuula Antola, the municipal director of economic and business development. “The public sector plays an important role in facilitating entrepreneurship and start-ups’ entry into the international market in Espoo.”Espoo is Finland’s second-largest city, with a population of 260,000. It was listed as one of six European Capitals of Innovation by the European Commission last year.  Finnish Ambassador to Korea Matti Heimonen (second from left) poses with Finnish delegates from the city of Espoo, Tuula Antola (second from right), Susanna Tommila (right) and Melissa Arni-Harden. (The Finnish Embassy)“Innovation starts by combining business and culture, by using the opportunities in culture to open the doors for business and vice versa,” Antola said. The city has a thriving cultural scene, she noted, with state-of-the-art libraries, museums, art centers, exhibition and music halls. The information and communication technology, energy, and gaming industries make up the largest segment of the city’s economy, and it has high growth potential in health care and pharmaceuticals, she said. The Espoo Innovation Garden, an urban ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship, hosts over 800 companies (including 200 foreign firms), workers from 100 nations, 5,000 researchers, and 25 research and development centers.Global companies, including Nokia, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, Tekes and Dassault, have set up headquarters in Espoo. “Our universities’ multidisciplinary education and research has been one of the key elements driving the Finnish economy’s success in innovation,” Antola said. The Aalto University in Espoo and Helsinki ― created by merging the Helsinki University of Technology, the Helsinki School of Economics, and the University of Art and Design Helsinki ― fosters university-industry collaboration in science, business and the arts. The Startup Sauna, a nonprofit organization based in the city, funds and guides start-ups from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia; it has created more than 145 companies since 2010, raising over $37 million in funding. Antola said that Korea’s strength in consumer product marketing and Finland’s strength in innovation and engineering can combine for a win-win partnership.

The meeting, held at the Yido Dining restaurant and china gallery in Apgujeong-dong in Seoul, was part of year-round gatherings aimed at celebrating the 4 pleasures of seeing, eating, enjoying and talking through the 5 senses. “The direction of China’s government policy is moving from economy to culture,” Yido owner Yi Yoon-shin said. “To stand out as a desirable place to revisit, Korea needs to develop cultural products that are unique and unavailable in China.”Over 6 million Chinese visited Korea last year, a 40 percent year-on-year increase. They are estimated to have spent about $13 billion. As the economies of China and Korea become increasingly intertwined, any loss of Chinese tourists will negatively impact Korea’s economy. “There is a whole new breed of Chinese upper-classes,” said Didier Beltoise, president of hospitality consulting firm CS. “They (choose where to) travel through word of mouth and the Internet, and are particularly interested in convenient shopping, beaches, local cuisine and fine wine.”“For Korea’s tourism industry to survive, it is vital to follow the global economic trend, increasingly dominated by high-end tourism,” he stressed. Noting that Chinese tourists were less likely to return to Korea than other countries, Beltoise warned that it was critical to improve the experiences of those visitors. “Korea needs to create a sophisticated identity, offer high-quality travel options and invest in tourism infrastructure,” he said.  5.4 Club members pose in front of porcelain at Yido Dining in Apgujeong-dong in Seoul, where they discussed Korea’s tourism challenges. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)David-Pierre Jalicon, chairman of the French Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that Korea should diversify its attractions throughout the whole country. “There are many undiscovered sights in Korea, which are interesting to foreigners. Korea has great potential in green tourism.”Chinese tourist groups are becoming more fragmented and gentrified, observed Jalicon. “Those I met in posh Chungdam-dong areas said they came there not to bargain, but to revel in the experience of window-shopping, strolling the streets,” he said.Susan Lee MacDonald, media and communications professor at the Seoul Institute of the Arts, pointed out that websites were sometimes not user friendly to Chinese. “The younger generations of Chinese tourists plan their itinerary individually and online,” she said. “But many Korean websites pose barriers to their research with cumbersome regulations and poor language services.”MacDonald emphasized that developing user-friendly tourism infrastructure was crucial, and promoting the safety of travel in Korea for women should be actively promoted. Vice-chairman of the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons, Park Jae-woo, said that there were not enough hotels in Seoul, as visitors who come for medical tourism have to travel for hours from hotels on the city’s outskirts. Chinese language services should also be improved, he said. The second part of the discussion centered on raising entrance fees at attractions and museums. “Compared to our national income level, the entrance fees have been too low for too long,” said chairman of Wearfun and Opera Gallery Korea Kwon Gi-chan. “The Louvre charges around 16 euros ($18), the National Art Center Tokyo charges near $50. Cultural benefits do not increase by virtue of affordability.”Hanbok-designer Lee Hye-soon said Koreans should be more proud of their culture. “Koreans have had a self-deprecating mindset about our own culture,” she said. “If we are proud of our own culture, we would feel more confident about promoting it to the world as exclusive and classy items. “We first need an education that instills proper understanding and pride in our heritage,” she said. The venue was organized by the Corea Image Communication Institute ― a nonprofit organization specializing in promoting Korea to the world. It holds seminars, forums and receptions aimed at facilitating inter-cultural communication and public relations.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","fine wine for korea tourism ,tourism to attract chinese tourists ,they discussed korea tourism challenges ,attract chinese tourists industry insiders ,to attract chinese tourists industry","['Korea', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Yido', 'Apgujeong - dong', 'Seoul', 'China', 'yido', 'Yi Yoon - shin', 'Korea', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Korea', 'China', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'Didier Beltoise', 'CS', 'Korea ’s', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Beltoise', 'Korea', 'Apgujeong - dong', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea', 'Pierre Jalicon', 'the french Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'jalicon', 'Chungdam', 'Susan Lee MacDonald', 'the Seoul Institute of the art', 'Chinese', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons', 'Park Jae - woo', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Wearfun', 'Opera', 'Korea Kwon Gi - chan', 'the National Art Center Tokyo', 'Lee Hye - soon', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'the Corea Image Communication Institute', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",19,"[ 0.          6.          0.         ... -0.63805979  0.93141115

It is a day to celebrate our rich culture, ethnic diversity and natural beauty, as well as reflect on what we have achieved and what we can be proud of in our great nation.Australia is one of the most ethnically diverse societies in the world, with almost one in four residents born overseas.This wide variety of backgrounds, together with the culture of indigenous Australians who have lived on the continent for more than 60,000 years, has helped create a distinctive Australian identity and spirit.Korean-Australians have played, and continue to play, an important role in the Australian story.Australia welcomed its first wave of Korean immigration in the early 1970s, and it is estimated that over 88,000 people of Korean descent now call Australia home. Australian Ambassador Bill Paterson (center) poses at a gala event during Australia Day 2015 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in central Seoul on Thursday. Participants included TV entertainer Sam Hammington (right), soprano Kho Mi-Hyun (second from right) and vocalist Dami Im. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)Korea is Australia’s third-largest source of international students, third-largest source of working holiday-makers and eighth-largest market for inbound tourists. With the active Korean community in Australia and the growing number of alumni in Korea the people-to-people links between the two countries are extensive and constantly expanding. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that more young Australians have an opportunity to live and study in Korea. Under the New Colombo Plan, which will begin in Korea this year, we aim to build on the existing education, cultural and people-to-people links that exist between our two countries. Australia’s openness to new people and ideas makes it a very creative place, having produced more Nobel Prize laureates per head of population than any other country, most of whom worked in scientific research.Australia is an ideal partner for Korea in relation to President Park’s “creative economy” initiative, with strengths in medical and materials research and world-ranking universities. The country has a lot to offer the Asia-Pacific region.We have strong institutions, a multicultural and highly skilled workforce, and a productive, open and resilient economy. Australia, like Korea, is committed to economic reform, and sound decisions made by both countries have enabled us both to avoid the worst impacts of the Global Financial Crisis. We are proud to stand with Korea as being among the very few OECD countries that did not suffer a recession during the financial crisis. Australia and Korea are natural economic partners, with two-way trade valued in excess of 32 billion Australian dollars ($25 billion).On a per capita basis, Australia imports more Korean products than any other OECD economy. Our two economies are around the same size, but we have different strengths and very complementary economic structures, which allow us to both benefit greatly from bilateral trade and investment.The past year has been momentous for the relationship between Australia and Korea with the entry into force on Dec. 12, 2014, of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. KAFTA is a world-class, comprehensive agreement that encompasses many areas of our economies, and was Australia’s first free trade agreement in North Asia.With two tariff cuts in quick succession ― one on Dec. 12, 2014, and another on Jan. 1 ― KAFTA makes it even more economically beneficial to do business with each other.While the two countries share a healthy trade in goods and services, bilateral investment flows are currently smaller than the potential in both our economies.Coming at a time of slowing growth, investment can act as a kind of stimulus for both our economies. KAFTA provides improved access and protection for investors and investments. Growing investment ties will underpin the future of our economic relationship.In addition, Australia and Korea have a strong defense and security relationship, which dates back to the Korean War.Australia was amongst the first countries to come to Korea’s aid. Over 18,000 Australian troops served on the front line ― 339 of whom lost their lives.Today Australia remains an active member of the United Nations Command, works closely with Korea’s armed forces and is committed to maintaining peace and security on the peninsula.Given the ever strengthening bilateral ties between our countries, we are delighted to have an opportunity to share Australia Day with Korea, and to celebrate the many strengths of a dynamic and modern Australia.","seoul to mark australia day ,korea is australia third largest ,in seoul to mark australia ,australia day edcelebrated annually ,seoul to mark australia","['the Australian Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Australia Day', 'Australia', 'Australians', 'australian', 'korean', 'australian', 'Australia', 'korean', 'korean', 'Australia', 'australian', 'Bill Paterson', 'Seoul', 'Sam Hammington', 'Kho Mi - Hyun', 'Dami', 'Park Hyun - koo', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'korean', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'the Australian Government', 'Australians', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'korean', 'OECD', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'the Korea - Australia Free Trade Agreement', 'KAFTA', 'Australia ’s', 'KAFTA', 'KAFTA', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'australian', 'Australia', 'the United Nations Command', 'Korea', 'Australia Day', 'Korea', 'Australia']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48191968  0.36013827

According to the report by the Hyundai Research Institute (HRI), the peace index for Seoul-Pyongyang relations for the September-November period came to 44.1, the highest ever since the think tank first began conducting such studies in late 2009.The numbers have been on a downtrend since late 2013. In the past year, they dropped to below 40, a level that signifies cross-border tensions.The index ranges from 0 to 100, and higher numbers indicate better inter-Korean relations. An index ranging between 40 and 60 shows that the two neighbors face a mix of both cooperation and opposition, while an index ranging between 20 and 40 signifies heightened tensions.A survey of 103 local experts also showed that the peace index for the December-February period is expected to increase further to 51.8, the report added. Improvement in the figure was largely attributed to the growth of inter-Korean trade as well as heightened expectations for high-level talks.  In the three-month period between June and August last year, trade between the two countries came to US$682.88 million, up 16.2 percent on-quarter from the previous $587.9 million, according to the HRI report.Furthermore, in early October, a high-powered North Korea delegation made a surprise visit to South Korea to attend the closing ceremony of the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, and had agreed with South Korea's top security officials to hold another round of high-level talks. The report, however, also took a cautious stance toward the improved ratings, as local experts still view the two Koreas as somewhat in a state of tension. ""It is necessary to go ahead with temporary plans, at the least, to help recover mutual trust and deliver our sense of sincerity in the matter,"" the report said, adding that halting the launches of anti-North Korean leaflets across the border may be one example.The Korean Peninsula was divided in the aftermath of World War II, and the two Koreas have been technically in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.

What will this mean in terms of the strategic competition between the U.S. and China, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region?Rana Mitter: The growth in China’s economy means that the country has become a serious contender in the region. For most of the past millennium, of course, China was the dominant country in the region ― the so-called “Sinosphere.” It’s only in the past century and a half that China’s role has been so significantly reduced. So, now that China’s economy has once again placed it at the top of the global table, one has to wonder what this means for hegemony in the region. However, so far, China has been slow to convert its economic strength into wider influence in the region. Everyone wants to trade with China, but the U.S. remains the dominant security power, whether it’s formal agreements with the likes of the ROK (Republic of Korea) or Japan, or else more informal support to (ironically, as a former enemy) Vietnam. China has to make the transition that the U.S. made in the region a generation ago: economic strength is a starting point, but creating a regional system that other powers will willingly sign up to is a longer-term task and can’t be achieved without time and effort.KH: In recent years, China has apparently been moving to alter the regional security and financial orders: It has sought to create a new regional security mechanism that excludes the U.S., pushed for a “maritime silk road” policy and pursued the establishment of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. What do you think about China’s intentions behind all these moves?Mitter: China is keen to create a new regional order that will enable it to take the leading role in the region. There is nothing wrong with the idea of a greater Chinese presence in the region, nor is there anything wrong with healthy strategic competition. Other powers in the region may do better if they have a choice of leading powers to engage with. However, at the moment, China has not worked out how to create a policy that will attract regional powers away from the security embrace of the U.S. The U.S. learned painfully that sometimes, to engender confidence in smaller powers, it was necessary to give up aspects of its own power. (So, Japan was allowed to run a trade policy highly disadvantageous to the U.S. for much of the Cold War, as a means of cementing the U.S.-Japan security alliance). At the moment, regional perceptions are that China is a purely pragmatic power in the region. It’s time for some big, counter-intuitive gestures that show that Beijing wants the regional order to serve the interests of all its members. KH: The U.S. Forces Korea is hoping to bring in the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, an advanced missile defense asset, to the Korean Peninsula. China has expressed its concerns about the potential deployment of the THAAD as its radar system could put China within its monitoring range. What do you think about China’s concerns?Mitter: China has a reasonable concern if there are nuclear missiles within reach of its territory; the United States was not enthusiastic about the prospect of missiles in Cuba more than half a century ago! That said, the best answer to the proposal is for Beijing to step up its efforts to make the Pyongyang regime evolve faster. China has much more influence in the DPRK (North Korea) than the U.S., and helping to resolve the regional crisis would be a real bonus for China’s stated desire to be a “good citizen” in the region.KH: Can you be more specific about how the North should evolve?Mitter: Broadly speaking I mean ... that the DPRK should socialize into the major global and regional forums more actively. This would include getting rid of nuclear weapons but also becoming part of international structures on everything from trade to human rights.KH: China has been striving to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula as it faces a slew of challenges such as income disparities, a slowing economy, political reform, maritime disputes and etc. Do you think China will allow North Korea to continue developing its nuclear capability?Mitter: I suspect that North Korea is as much of a problem for Beijing as it sometimes is for the U.S. I also suspect that Beijing is not enthusiastic about the DPRK’s attempts to achieve nuclear status. However, I think it is also highly unlikely that China would support a unified Korea in the short term, as having a pro-Beijing regime on its borders is helpful for China’s security. So it may be that China seeks to rein in Pyongyang’s more extravagant demands and threats to reduce the danger of regime collapse in the face of a ratcheting up of tension in the region.KH: What do you think about North Korea’s strategic value for China?Mitter: Having a pro-Chinese regime on its borders is a strong security asset for China. Although the specific actions of the Kim Jong-un regime are no doubt deeply annoying to Beijing, it still seems to me most likely that China will attempt to keep the DPRK regime reasonably stable.KH: Democracy protests in Hong Kong reaffirmed that there has been a growing public desire for political freedom and democratization. Do you think these movements pose a grave threat to the Chinese government?Mitter: The Hong Kong democracy movement is unlikely to pose any threat to the Chinese government. The protesters have always emphasized that their interest is in more popular suffrage in Hong Kong, not the mainland. Nor is there evidence of much stimulation of democratic sentiment in the mainland on the back of the Hong Kong protests. The Hong Kong democratization debate will, in the end, be about the direction of Hong Kong ― as in the term “one country, two systems.”KH: East Asia has been engulfed in historical and territorial disputes ― although the region is quite integrated in terms of trade, tourism and cultural exchanges. Do you have any suggestions on ways to promote regional multilateral cooperation for peace and stability?Mitter: I’ve long argued that 1945 ― the end of World War II ― was “unfinished business” in East Asia. Unlike in Europe, there was never a real consensus about the postwar order in the region, not least because China was excluded from the dominant settlement in the region that included the division of Korea, the maintenance of the Republic of China on Taiwan, the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Now that China is more powerful than during the Cold War, and is more aware of its historical past, there is an urgency in the region about reassessing the past. At the moment, however, every country in East Asia tends to see recent history only through its own eyes ― so China sees it through Chinese eyes, Japan through Japanese, and Korea through Korean eyes. My suggestion is that we need much more empathy for each other’s histories. Students and politicians alike should learn how the view looks from the other side: Chinese should understand more about why the Japanese think as they do; the Japanese need to understand Korea’s viewpoint more than they had. If we could create a truly transnational understanding of history across the region, that would be a great addition to mutual understanding, an understanding which simply is not there as it is between France and Germany today.KH: South Korea has a security alliance with the U.S. and at the same time, it wants to maintain a close partnership with China for trade, business and tourism. This could put South Korea in an increasingly tricky diplomatic position. What would be a wise way for South Korea to maneuver in this rough diplomatic field?Mitter: South Korea is not the only country in that odd position; for instance, Australia’s economy is highly dependent on sending minerals to China, but is very much within the diplomatic embrace of the U.S. South Korea needs to draw on one of its greatest qualities: the move to democracy in the past three decades. By affirming that whatever strategic choices are made must be confirmed by the Korean people, South Korea’s leaders should find themselves in a good position to balance interests.KH: Can you elaborate further on how Korean leaders should “balance interests”?Mitter: In a democracy, it is very hard for politicians to undertake policies that their citizens do not support. That provides both a positive and a negative strength. The positive strength is that governments can seek support through the ballot box for their policies. The negative strength ― but it is a strength not a weakness ― is that elected governments can resist pressure from external powers by showing that there are certain policies that their populations would not accept.KH: Japan has been pushing for a stronger military to undertake a greater security role under the slogan of “active pacifism.” This has triggered security concerns for South Korea and China as it has come as Japan still denies its wartime atrocities. What kind of security role do you think Japan seeks to play through its heavier armament? Mitter: These moves are really driven by the political concerns of the current Japanese Prime Minister Abe, who sits on the right wing of the governing LDP (Liberal Democratic Party). However, people should remember that there are many different groups and viewpoints in Japan, which is an established and pluralist democracy. It’s not true that “Japan” denies its wartime atrocities ― there are right-wingers who do this, but also plenty of liberal and moderate voices who not only have acknowledged Japan’s violent wartime past but offered very sincere regrets. Don’t forget that the Japanese historical profession is one of the most important sources of the historical research that exposed issues ranging from the Nanjing Massacre to the sexual exploitation of the comfort women.KH: The U.S. has been seeking to enhance the trilateral security cooperation with South Korea and Japan. The triangular partnership has lost traction due to the diplomatic tension between Seoul and Tokyo. What do you think about the prospect of the trilateral relationship?Mitter: The tension lies in the fact that the current elected leaders of South Korea and Japan do not get on well with each other. But the benefit of democracy is that leaders change peacefully in time. This issue, too, will change with time. It seems to me likely that Seoul will continue to strengthen its trade and cultural ties with Beijing while relying on Washington for defense. This sort of triangulation is useful to Korea to prevent it being too tied to any one power. KH: What do you think are the major differences between the Soviet-U.S. rivalry during the Cold War and the current Sino-U.S. rivalry? One of them could be deep economic interdependence. Mitter: The real difference is ideology. The USSR and U.S. had very different visions of the world in the Cold War. China does not really seek to impose its own system on any other society, and the U.S. too is more concerned with security than nation-building, particularly after the disaster of Iraq. So I think we need to think of the current era as one of great power relationships rather than of a new Cold War.KH: Do you have any projections of your own about the future of the Kim Jong-un regime in Pyongyang? Do you think it can continue to remain in power when its people are starving and its isolation is deepening?Mitter: The Kim regime is one of the most brutal in the world. However, it has shown a shrewd cunning about knowing how far to push things. Despite an appearance of crisis and instability, it has shown a remarkable capacity to survive and I don’t see an immediate crisis point in prospect.Rana Mitter● Mitter is the director of the University China Centre at the University of Oxford, where he lectures on the history and politics of modern China.

North Korea is expected to dispatch its delegation to the 48th standing committee meeting of the Ramsar Convention on wetlands as an observer country. The South Korean delegation is scheduled to meet with the convention’s Secretary-General Christopher Briggs, as well as Marco Lambertini, the director general of the World Wide Fund for Nature, during the five-day gathering, the officials said. It remains, however, to be seen whether the North will accept the plan, given the communist country’s previous criticism of the DMZ park plan. The DMZ, which is about 250 kilometers long and 4 km wide, is a mine-filled buffer zone, with the rival Koreas technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

But Kim Yeon-su, a professor of security policy at Korea National Defense University, said the moves could be intended to grab Beijing’s attention, to a certain degree.“North Korea’s annual trade volume is around $7 billion, and China remains its largest trading partner, accounting for some 90 percent of all of its trade,” Kim said during an interview with The Korea Herald.“Its trade volume with Russia is only a little over $100 million. So this indicates that when it comes to trade and economic relations, no other country can replace China. Well, South Korea could perhaps do so, but China is still the most important partner for the North.”Professor Kim Yeon-su. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)Touching on the issue of “strategic culture” ― the orientation of a country’s thoughts, perceptions and preferences regarding the use of force and its overall security stance, Kim noted North Korea is uniquely characterized by its bellicosity, strong resistance to external interference, self-reliance and military-first policy line.“This culture has been formed through formative historical experiences such as of being in a geopolitically vulnerable position stuck among big powers. To change it would obviously take a long time, and to do so the North would have to redefine its national interests,” he said. The following is the interview with professor Kim.Korea Herald: What is your assessment of the last three years of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s state management?Kim Yeon-soo: We first need to examine Kim’s disposition as a leader, namely his identity, given that a leader’s disposition determines his areas of interest and policy priorities. That said, I think Kim has presented himself as a military ruler … as a hereditary successor for the military-first policy. His father Kim Jong-il did not reveal himself too much during his on-site military inspections. But Kim Jong-un has gotten down to the real nitty-gritty of military drills and made hostile comments against the South too explicitly, as we have recently seen him posing on a tank, submarine and combat plane. I think he enjoys it. With him deeply engrossed in the military, economic issues seem to have been put on the back burner, although he has said he will see to it that his people don’t have to tighten their belts anymore.Another thing to note is his capability. One aspect of a leader’s capability is the ability to manage the ruling elites. The North’s ruling class is a mixture of young and older generations and for this, a North Korean leader needs finesse to lead the top echelons. … His father, Kim Jong-il, was able to directly control and secure a firm grip on the elites, with whom he built and maintained close ties through thick and thin as he was being groomed as a successor for a long period of time. But Kim Jong-un did not have that kind of capability upon taking power. The problem is that the internal and external realities facing the North call for a more flexible, shrewd (style of) leadership. If we look at the process through which Jang Song-thaek (Kim’s once-powerful uncle) was executed, we can get a sense of Kim’s leadership style. Jang was tried at a military court, beaten and bruised. This is apparently an immoral behavior, which may have flabbergasted and petrified the elites. For his regime to fare well, particularly in its beginning stage, it needs to maintain stable relations with China and South Korea, and for that, there should be a figure who can manage external relations well. The North has sent Choe Ryong-hae overseas instead of the ill-fated Jang, but Choe can’t compare to Jang in terms of diplomatic skills and level of credibility from an outsider’s perspective. Thus, the way Jang was purged illustrates Kim Jong-un’s lack of personnel management capability. We also need to look at his policy management capability. Internally, there appeared to have been some changes: He brought his wife Ri Sol-ju to the fore, talked of catching up with the world trends and (acheiving) economic recovery. But these moves appeared to have receded following the execution of Jang. On the diplomatic front, the North reached the Feb. 29 agreement with the U.S. in 2012, but reneged on the deal. What matters most was that the North failed to improve relations with China. In terms of inter-Korean relations, the North brought the situation to the brink of war in early 2013 and attempted to shut down the joint industrial park in Gaeseong, and these moves have restricted South Korea’s policy options. After all, Pyongyang has compromised its own interests through such policy flip-flops. With an immense desire for power, Kim exercises his leadership in a very repressive, coercive fashion, which might have had an impact on the elites ― mostly a negative impact in terms of eliciting voluntary loyalty from the elites.KH: What is your forecast for how Kim will rule the communist state following the end of the three-year mourning period for his father?Kim: Given its deepening isolation, some change is apparently needed. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, and the elites and common people will have higher expectations about what the regime can do. So, the regime is facing pressure to live up to these expectations by improving relations with the outside world and the economy as well. To this end, the regime should seek a change in its ruling ideology or style. But the prospect of such a change remains dim for those who heard his New Year’s address.(In the address) Kim clarified his stance of … simultaneously pursuing economic and nuclear development. Thus, we can hardly expect Kim to change his military-centered ideology. But when it comes to his ruling style, there could be (some changes) should a situation arise ― a situation where he has to manage external relations in his own favor. Speaking of governing style, Kim is more open and in touch with the public than his father, which appears to be a way for him to overcome the weaknesses of his leadership. He may attempt to get closer to the people to create an image of a friendly leader and reinforce his legitimacy, and in this process, he may consider a change in his ruling style. But we can’t expect any change regarding his governing ideology.KH: What do you think about the likelihood of the North pushing ahead with a fourth nuclear test this year?Kim: The North has already made it clear that it will continue to increase both the quality and quantity of its nuclear capabilities. This appears to be a steadfast policy, and for the North (to carry out this policy) it will have to continue its nuclear tests just as the existing nuclear powers did. Thus, we can say that another nuclear test remains a possibility. But to successfully carry out various political events slated for this year and further strengthen his legitimacy, he needs to disentangle the strained ties with the outside world. The key to that is (progress on) the nuclear issue. How Kim meets the international community’s expectations regarding its denuclearization is of paramount importance, and should he press ahead with another test, that would shatter all these expectations. Thus, there is a need for restraint, but there is a possibility of a nuke test according to changes in domestic politics and external relations. So uncertainty reigns.KH: Tension has escalated between the U.S. and North Korea as Washington slapped Pyongyang with new sanctions for the alleged cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Do you think the frayed ties between the two will work to the detriment of inter-Korean dialogue and relations?Kim: In retrospect, for the inter-Korean relations to fare well, the Washington-Pyongyang ties also had to be stable, not to mention the Seoul-Washington relations. Thus, all three relationships should move along well, so to say, to create some sort of a virtuous circle. Currently, the North-U.S. relations are faltering, and under these circumstances, it would be difficult, in realistic terms, for the South to unilaterally push for its own policy without factoring in the deterioration in the Washington-Pyongyang relationship.This is partly because of the need for policy coordination between the allies. The South has requested that the U.S. delay the transfer of wartime operational control, and that the U.S. reinforce its extended deterrence in light of the evolving nuclear threats from the North. Thus, considering the need for closer security cooperation between the allies, there are many areas in which they should work closely together. Also of note is that should there be any potential progress on the North’s denuclearization, inter-Korean relations could move forward considerably. To forge a positive outlook for the nuclear issue, U.S. cooperation is of great importance, as we need to persuade China to move. Thus, strategic cooperation between the allies on the nuclear issue is very crucial. Some people say that we can make a “detour,” meaning that rather than directly tackling the sensitive nuclear issue, we can deal with other issues first to forge the mood for dialogue (on the nuclear issue) and so on. But after all, we will converge on the nuclear issue at some point anyway (even if we initially sidestep the issue). The two Koreas may be able to create the mood for dialogue, and start holding working-level talks, and then higher-level dialogue. But for the inter-Korean summit to occur, they cannot help but touch on the nuclear issue. Without moving toward a resolution of the issue, public sentiment could also work against the summit. In short, for now, it is difficult to paint any positive outlook for Washington-Pyongyang relations and this could work as a risk factor for inter-Korean relations.KH: how do you predict the North will deal with its external relations? It seems that the North should improve these relations to ease its global isolation.Kim: North Korea’s annual trade volume is around $7 billion, and China remains its largest trading partner, accounting for some 90 percent of all of its trade. Its trade volume with Russia is only a little over $100 million. So this indicates that when it comes to trade and economic relations, no other country can replace China. Well, perhaps South Korea could, but China is still the most important partner for the North. So enhancing ties with China will be one of the North’s main foreign policy goals for this year. Although the North has recently ramped up its diplomacy with Japan and Russia, that doesn’t mean that it will put all its energy into (improving its ties with) these countries, while nudging China off its list of priorities. I think the recent diplomatic moves have more to do with Pyongyang’s intentions to grab the attention (of China). The biggest foreign policy task for the North is to gain China’s recognition of Kim’s legitimacy, perhaps through a bilateral summit. China has yet to offer any clear recognition of Kim’s legitimacy, as Kim seeks security autonomy from China and moves forward in his own way, while China wants the North to move in the direction of denuclearization, reform and openness. Having said that, the North will focus more on improving its relations with China. For better relations, the North should show that it has been trying to live up to China’s expectations. China wants the North to negotiate over its nuclear program and move toward reform and openness. KH: International pressure on North Korea to improve its human rights conditions has increased. Do you think this pressure will have a positive influence?Kim: I remain positive about it. The universal principle of human rights is one of the rare effective means to influence North Korea, a country that has long been advocating for its own uniqueness and distinct position. I think that the fact that the North has started to respond to the pressure is important in itself. The human rights issue has been brought to the fore on the international stage through a U.N. resolution and other efforts. And this has contributed to encouraging the North to talk with the international community and engage more deeply with the outside world. For South Korea, such pressure is an addition to its list of tools to persuade the North to change.KH: How would you describe North Korea’s strategic culture, and how will it affect its foreign policy decisions?Kim: Strategic culture is about a country’s orientation of thoughts on security, and North Korea has its own unique culture characterized by bellicosity, fear of encirclement, strong resistance or an allergic response to outside interference, self-reliance and a military-first policy line. This culture has been formed through its historical experiences: It was once put in a suzerain-tributary relationship in a Sino-centric order and has been in a geopolitically vulnerable position among big powers. The turbulent process whereby its national founder Kim Il-sung consolidated his leadership and internal political legitimacy, and established his self-reliance principles has also influenced the strategic culture. Then the question is whether this culture can change. Well, we can approach this question from a constructivist view. The North should first redefine its national interests, meaning that it should believe that not self-reliance, but engaging with the outside world would better serve its interests. The North should not see the U.S. as its archenemy, and should confidently allow a U.S. embassy to be established in the heart of its capital Pyongyang. To change its strategic culture, the North should redefine its interests at the leadership level and the level of the elites. Should they churn out thoughts about what would best serve their national interests, they could lead to a change in behavior, then in political culture, and then in their thoughts about security, and then finally a shift in its strategic culture. This is a very fundamental question, and something that takes a lot of time. Should there be a political leader like Mikhail Gorbachev (of the former Soviet Union), well (such a change) could transpire. Who knows?KH: Do you think the way China looks at North Korea has changed? China apparently saw the North as a buffer zone state, but that kind of perception seems to be fading as China emerges as a major power seeking diplomatic clout that matches its enhanced global status.Kim: From the standpoint of military strategists, geopolitical variables are still important, although some scholars may say that the idea (of North Korea as a buffer zone state for China) is no longer relevant. For the U.S., Taiwan is still something it cannot give up ― a reason why some call it a “floating aircraft carrier.” Without Taiwan, Japan may feel very vulnerable, and the efforts to maintain the sea lines of communication around Taiwan could be undermined. If we also consider the U.S.’ strategic rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific, China may continue to pay strategic attention to these geopolitical variables. But what is noteworthy is that the Xi Jinping generation appears somewhat different from the Hu Jintao generation. For the Xi generation, “China’s dream” appears to mean getting closer to the code of conduct and rules that are in line with international standards ― a reason why Beijing is striving to stamp out corruption. … What the Xi government wants Pyongyang to do is to move toward denuclearization, reform and openness. And this is actually what China has called for since the era of Deng Xiaoping, who was against the North’s dictatorial ruling system and encouraged it to focus on economic development. But the intensity of such demands from China appears to have increased under the Xi government. This is because China’s status has changed and also because China is pursuing a different status. Thus, there appears to be some change in the level of China’s expectations for the North and this is apparently putting considerable pressure on the North. Well, this may be a reason why the North has sought to secure more security autonomy in a preemptive manner, and it is therefore difficult to predict how North Korea-China relations will develop this year.Kim Yeon-su● Kim, a professor in the security policy department of Korea National Defense University, has focused his research attention on North Korea’s foreign policy, inter-Korean relations and the overall East Asia security.● He has assumed various advisory posts for key government agencies including the presidential office’s National Security Council and the Defense Ministry.

Korea, making a transition into a multicultural society, can learn from ASEAN’s value of ‘harmony in diversity.’” Eleven award-winners pose for a photograph with ASEAN-Korea Center staff at the ASEAN-Korea Multimedia Competition Exhibition at Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Seoul, on Jan. 8. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The exhibit featured 22 award-winning photographs from a competition held last year. By highlighting fashion, food, craftwork, architecture, religion and customs under the theme “Lifestyle of ASEAN,” it gave the Korean public a unique peek at the rapidly developing region.“This exhibition attempts to spotlight ASEAN’s new cultural values by dealing with daily subject matters. Art and culture can open people’s hearts better than politics and business. Our curiosity and interest can move beyond national borders,” said Kim Mi-jin, a professor of curatorial studies and art management at Hongik University, who helped select the works. “ASEAN Unity” by Korean artist Lee Seung-jun, one of winning artworks, represents the union of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Korea based on their common staple of rice.

The artworks were recognized for their unique identities, Kim stressed, not as “peripheral works” according to Western art standards. At the same time, she noted, Asian artists should avoid the “cliche” of presenting “Asianness” without taking into account art history and theory.

It was the first time that Samsung failed to land in first place. “It was a bit surprising to see that young job-hunters are no longer looking at Samsung as the place they would most like to work at,” said Jang Jae-sup, head of the brand communications team at Incruit. Younger job hunters were found to be less attracted to Samsung because while it offered better wages, it also had a reputation for being too demanding, according to industry watchers. Another trend that was seen in the survey was that students appeared to lean toward companies with more welfare options, a phenomenon seen to reflect the unstable economic conditions. Korean Air took first place for the same reasons, as more than one-fifth of the potential job-hunters who chose the airline said they believed the company had good welfare policies. In 2013, the airline ranked third. In a separate survey by Job Korea, Samsung Electronics was still at the top, followed by Korean Air. But in a survey taken only by women, Korean Air was the top pick.“Airline companies are known to provide excellent welfare for women, whether they are flight attendants or working in offices,” said Chung Joo-hee, a spokeswoman for Job Korea.However, she added that Korean Air may take a fall in the next survey due to the so-called “nut row” caused by its heiress Cho Hyun-ah, who forced a cabin crew member to deplane for failing to properly train flight attendants how to serve nuts. “These days, it’s not just about the work itself. It is also about the vision and reputation of the company,” Chung said. In the Incruit survey, Kookmin Bank ranked third, followed by AmorePacific, a cosmetics company that has recently been expanding globally. The fifth-most-favored company to work for among college students was CJ CheilJedang, while in sixth place was POSCO, the world’s sixth-largest steelmaker by output. Hyundai Motor Group, on the other hand, tumbled to ninth place from seventh in 2013, according to the survey.The main reason it fell, according to Incruit, was that female college students were not eager to join a workforce that was rumored to resemble the military hierarchy. Meanwhile, the government last year announced a list of new high-potential jobs for the future. Occupations such as reputation managers, retirement planners, leisure activity planners and job relocation experts were among the jobs that the government said would become popular. Some jobs, however, may become rare, according to a United Nations report that predicted a phaseout of mail carriers, farmers and reporters, among others.

""The government expects the Park side to review the matter seriously and decide (to end the campaign),"" the spokesman said.Park, however, did not immediately give his stance on the matter, he added. The stronger-than-usual government guidance was made in consideration of possible safety risks the campaign could inflict on South Korean residents in the border area, as well as the possible rise of social division over the controversial issue, the spokesman also noted. The unidentified ministry official also delivered a similar guidance to another activist group involved in the leaflet campaign, the spokesman said. The latest move reflects the government's previously stated intention to intervene in the activists' border campaigns on safety concerns, although in principle this is a matter of freedom of speech.The North has repeatedly threatened to retaliate if such campaigns are carried out.The communist country has also strongly denounced the release of the U.S. comedy film that revolves around a trip by two TV producers to North Korea to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

Ruling partially in favor of the plaintiffs, the Seoul Central District Court said that management should count regular bonuses paid to two unionists, who were from Hyundai Auto Service, as part of their ordinary wages.The ruling comes after the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling in December 2013 on a prolonged dispute over the issue, saying that non-monthly bonuses should be viewed as part of a worker's standard wages if given on a regular, uniform and periodic basis.The Seoul court ruled on Thursday that bonuses paid to 21 other plaintiffs lacked regularity.Of the 23 plaintiffs representing some 51,600 Hyundai unionists, five plaintiffs represented some 5,700 unionists from Hyundai Auto Service.Hyundai Motor merged with Hyundai Auto Service and Hyundai Mobis, formerly known as Hyundai Precision, in 1999. Industry watchers said that the Thursday ruling represents an effective win for the management since it only has to pay an additional 3.89 million won and 220,000 won, respectively, to the two unionists. Hyundai Motor's labor union expressed regret over the ruling, saying that the verdict should be applied equally to all affiliates.""It is regrettable that the court only recognized ordinary wages of unionists from Hyundai Auto Service,"" Lee Kyung-hoon, a union member, told a press briefing, adding that the union will have an internal discussion before deciding whether to appeal the ruling.

The skyscraper’s lower floors opened in October amid public skepticism over its safety.Wrapping up a weeklong inspection, however, officials said experts have found these cracks and subsidence to be “like any other cracks you see on normal streets” and not indicative of sinkholes.Several road sections affected by subsidence will be inspected further and repaired, they added.This was the latest in a series of incidents that have sparked public concerns over the tower, which will be the tallest structure in South Korea when completed in 2016. Last year, reports of sinkholes and the falling water level of a lake nearby spurred questions over the tower’s safety, but authorities have yet to determine a clear link between the facility and either issue.In December, the aquarium in the lower floors was found to be leaking and a construction worker died while apparently trying to climb a scaffold, an incident over which Lotte Group apologized.

347,347,‘U.S. to shift focus to air and sea for Korea defense’,"This is the fourth installment in a special New Year’s series of interviews with preeminent scholars on international politics and security. ― Ed.The U.S. security commitment to South Korea will come more in the form of air and naval power than ground troops in the future, a U.S. security expert said, noting the need for America to maintain highly mobile forces to handle evolving security challenges around the worl...","This is the fourth installment in a special New Year’s series of interviews with preeminent scholars on international politics and security. ― Ed.The U.S. security commitment to South Korea will come more in the form of air and naval power than ground troops in the future, a U.S. security expert said, noting the need for America to maintain highly mobile forces to handle evolving security challenges around the world.In an interview with The Korea Herald, Aaron Friedberg, professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, also indicated South Korea needed to understand America’s new warfighting “AirSea Battle” concept to ensure joint combat capabilities.“American military planners must reserve the option of shifting these highly mobile forces between theaters should circumstances demand it (rather than maintaining only static ground forces here),” said Friedberg, who was security adviser to then-Vice President Dick Cheney from 2003-2005. “In order to preserve relations with its allies, Washington must also make clear that it would consult with them before making any such move.”Aaron L. Friedberg (Jon Roemer/WWS 2005)His remarks came as the U.S. has been pushing for a reorganization of its troops with a focus on air and naval power, after some 13 years of ground warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. currently maintains some 28,500 troops in Korea, mostly ground forces.Touching on the concerns that the U.S. could be reluctant to immediately intervene in a contingency on the Korean Peninsula ― as it was in the Libyan and Syrian cases ― the scholar said that the U.S., a longtime treaty ally of South Korea, has a “legal, strategic and moral obligation” to come to South Korea’s defense should it be attacked.As to the strained ties between Seoul and Tokyo, the professor said the persistent animosity between them was not inevitable. He described the worsening ties as “deeply unfortunate, unnecessary and not in the best interest of either country.” He called for joint efforts toward a mutually acceptable understanding of the past.The following is the interview with Dr. Friedberg.The Korea Herald: Do you think South Korea should learn about the U.S.’ “AirSea Battle” concept, given that in the event of war on the Korean Peninsula, it will fight with the U.S. employing the concept? What do you think about the potential for friction with China, which thinks the concept could potentially target it?Aaron Friedberg: AirSea Battle is an operational concept whose aim is to ensure that the United States can continue to project military power to support its allies and defend its interests in various parts of the world, despite the anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities being developed by some states. It is important for South Korea’s military planners to understand how their American allies intend to fight a future war. But they also need to assess the evolving threat to their own interests posed by A2/AD capabilities and to consider what role they might wish to play in countering it, should the need ever arise.KH: What do you think about the importance of trilateral security cooperation among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan? Which direction should the security partnership go?Friedberg: Closer trilateral security cooperation among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan is in the best interests of all parties. Increased cooperation can help to reduce misunderstandings and possible mistrust among the three nations and enable them to better prepare for possible crises or contingencies that could threaten all of them. Such cooperation is not aimed at China and should not prevent better relations with that country. Beijing’s possible objections should not be allowed to stand in the way of closer trilateral strategic cooperation. KH: How do you think the U.S. and China would respond to serious instability in North Korea, such as a sudden collapse? Would China immediately intervene to secure or promote its own interests?Friedberg: In the event of the sudden collapse of the Pyongyang regime China would certainly move quickly to secure its interests, perhaps taking steps to seal its border with North Korea in order to prevent mass refugee flows and possibly intervening directly in North Korea itself. It would certainly be preferable if the U.S. and China could coordinate their actions, together with the Republic of Korea, in order to prevent chaos in the North or even an unintended great power conflict. Despite some efforts to promote discussion of this topic, however, Beijing has thus far been extremely reluctant to engage in an exchange of views on how best to handle a serious crisis in the DPRK, perhaps for fear of offending or provoking its longtime ally.KH: Amid the intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry, South Korea is put in an increasingly difficult diplomatic position as it seeks to maintain the security alliance and the deepening economic relationship with China. What is the best way forward for Korea?Friedberg: There is no reason why South Korea cannot maintain close strategic ties with the United States even as it continues to develop mutually beneficial economic relations with China. Bilateral trade and investment is in China’s interests as much, or in some cases more, than those of its economic partners. While Beijing may try to persuade South Korea or other countries that they need to choose, it is extremely unlikely to disrupt economic relations from which it benefits in an attempt to exert leverage over its trading partners. As it pursues deeper economic relations with China, South Korea should continue to take steps to preserve its alliance relationship with the United States while at the same time strengthening economic ties by removing many of the remaining barriers to U.S.-ROK trade and investment. This is a wise and prudent combination of policies that will help South Korea to preserve its security and diplomatic independence, even as it enhances the well-being of its people.KH: In recent years, the relationship between South Korea and China has improved a lot. What do you think about this relationship? Would this cause some concerns to American policymakers? Friedberg: Good diplomatic and economic relations between Seoul and Beijing do not, in themselves, run counter to the interests of the United States. What would be troubling from an American perspective would be if decision makers in South Korea were to conclude that a strong relationship with China requires a weakening of the historic partnership with the United States. South Korea and Japan are both allies of the United States and they are both democracies that share important values in common. From a U.S. perspective, ROK-PRC cooperation targeted against Japan is worrisome and could weaken the security architecture that has helped to preserve peace and stability in Northeast Asia. Instead of taking sides with China against Japan it would be preferable if South Korea and Japan were able to resolve their differences over history and other issues with one another directly, and perhaps with the participation of the United States.KH: South Koreans feel uncomfortable about Japan’s military buildup and use of collective self-defense. What do you think about the role of Japan‘s collective self-defense in terms of stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula?Friedberg: As an independent nation-state that has lived in peace with its neighbors for almost 70 years, Japan is entitled to participate in collective self-defense efforts. Exercising the right of collective self-defense would enable Japan to cooperate more closely with the United States, and potentially with South Korea, in planning for crises and strategic contingencies that could threaten the interests of all three nations. A Japan that chooses to participate in collective self-defense efforts will be aligned even more closely with the United States, and this fact should be reassuring to South Korea as well as to other countries in the region.KH: Why do you think the negotiations to denuclearize North Korea have failed? Do you think would Pyongyang be ever willing to renounce its nuclear ambitions?Friedberg: If all the members of the international community, and especially China, had been willing to apply greater economic and diplomatic pressure a decade ago it is possible that Pyongyang could have been deterred from taking the final steps toward acquiring nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, instead of pressing it to the maximum extent, Beijing chose to shield North Korea, providing it with economic assistance that enabled it to continue to function and to pursue nuclear weapons. Now that it has them, it is extremely unlikely that the North Korean regime will surrender these weapons. Like his father, Kim Jong-un appears to regard nuclear weapons as the ultimate insurance policy against attack or attempts at regime change. Offering inducements or concessions to Pyongyang in the hopes that these will persuade it to change course is extremely unlikely to work and could serve to bolster the current regime. Tighter financial sanctions are the best measure available to help slow the progress of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.KH: What would occur in the security landscape of East Asia should North Korea succeed in fully developing nuclear weapons? Would China and the U.S. let the North possess nuclear arms?Friedberg: North Korea already possesses an unknown number of nuclear devices. The critical next step in its evolution into a true nuclear weapons state will come when it succeeds in miniaturizing these devices and placing them on delivery vehicles such as ballistic missiles. If and when this happens, North Korea will be able to pose a far greater threat to South Korea and Japan, to U.S. forces and bases in Northeast Asia, and potentially to the United States itself. This could weaken the credibility of America’s extended deterrent guarantees and increase pressure on its allies to acquire nuclear forces of their own. China ought to have a strong interest in preventing this from happening. To date, however, Beijing’s concerns over further proliferation of nuclear weapons have not been sufficient to induce it to take strong action against Pyongyang.KH: South Korea has concerns about the U.S. Forces Korea becoming an increasingly expeditionary force, rather than remaining a traditional static force to deter North Korean aggression. What do you think about the future role of the U.S. Forces Korea and South Korea’s concerns?Friedberg: In the future, as in the recent past, the U.S. contribution to the defense of South Korea will come more in the form of air and naval power than large forward-deployed ground forces. This makes good strategic sense. South Korea has a large population and a highly capable army, as well as very good air and naval forces of its own. The United States has unmatched capabilities in the air and on the sea, but it also has security commitments throughout Asia, as well as in Europe and the Middle East. American military planners must reserve the option of shifting these highly mobile forces between theaters should circumstances demand it. In order to preserve relations with its allies, Washington must also make clear that it would consult with them before making any such move.KH: The U.S has shown some reluctance to immediately intervene in recent overseas conflicts, including those in Libya and Syria. This has triggered concerns here, with some arguing that the U.S. could also be reluctant to step into a conflict in Korea. What do you think about this?Friedberg: It is understandable that recent U.S. reluctance to intervene in conflicts in the Middle East should cause some concern about American resolve in South Korea and elsewhere in Asia. But these situations are very different. American interests in Libya and Syria were unclear and subject to debate, and the U.S. had no prior commitment to become involved in conflicts there. By contrast, the United States and South Korea are treaty allies and the U.S. therefore has a legal, strategic and moral obligation to come to the ROK’s defense should it be attacked. Moreover, as long as some American forces are deployed on the peninsula, it seems quite likely that an attack on South Korea would target U.S. forces. Attacks on its overseas bases and personnel would be acts of war against the United States to which an American president would have no choice but to respond.KH: The relationship between South Korea and Japan has been worsening. Do you think the two sides would be able to restore their ties?Friedberg: The recent deterioration in Japan-ROK relations is deeply unfortunate, unnecessary and not in the best interest of either country. Tension and animosity are not inevitable, however. To the contrary, Japan and South Korea have enjoyed periods of greater warmth and closer cooperation in the past. Domestic political forces in both countries present the greatest obstacle to improving bilateral relations. For the relationship to improve, the two countries will need to continue to work towards some mutually acceptable understanding of the past, one in which Japan acknowledges the pain it caused to the Korean people and Koreans accept the sincerity of Japan’s expressions of regret. At a minimum, political leaders on both sides will have to refrain from using the history issue to stir emotions and mobilize domestic support. KH: Do you think the establishment of a multilateral security mechanism in East Asia ― like what Europe has achieved ― would be possible?Friedberg: A multilateral security mechanism might be useful if it helped to promote dialogue, transparency and confidence-building measures. But in East Asia, as is still the case in Europe, traditional alliances will remain essential to maintaining a stable balance of power and preserving the peace.KH: There has been increasing international pressure on North Korea to improve its human rights conditions. Do you think this pressure can bring about any change in North Korea?Friedberg: The North Korean regime systematically abuses its population and for decades has denied them the most basic human rights. Because of the likely costs, however, these facts are insufficient in themselves to warrant direct international intervention. (The one exception might be a situation in which the regime had already begun to collapse and intervention was necessary in order to prevent disorder and even greater loss of life.) Pyongyang sadly shows no signs of sensitivity to international condemnation and moral pressure and these are unlikely in themselves to cause it to change its behavior. However, the international community has an obligation to continue to shine a light on the regime and its reprehensible practices, to assist those who seek to escape its clutches, and to prepare for the day when North Korea’s leaders can eventually be called to account.KH: After his electoral victory in December, Prime Minister Abe is expected to push for a nationalist security agenda. What is your forecast on Japan‘s future direction as a militarily stronger state?Friedberg: The concerns of other Asian states are understandable, in light of the tragic history of the first half of the 20th century. But Japan today is a very different country than it was in 1900 or in the 1930s and 1940s: It is a democracy with a long history of peaceful behavior and a demonstrated commitment to international law. It is also a country with a shrinking population and a slow-growing economy. Japan is strengthening its defense capabilities, not because it has any intention of invading and conquering others as it did in the 1930s and 1940s, but because it faces what it sees as increasing threats from other countries, most notably China. Japan is seeking to expand its security cooperation with other countries, including the United States, but also India and Australia, among others, in order to preserve a balance of power with an increasingly capable China. A Japan that is well-integrated into a network of alliances and cooperative relationships, especially with other democratic states, is extremely unlikely to pose a threat to the peace and stability of East Asia.KH: Some people say economic interdependence, cultural exchanges and other liberalist and constructivist ideas would help promote peace and stability in East Asia. Do you agree?Friedberg: While enhanced economic integration and greater cultural exchange can help to preserve peace they provide no assurances. In the near term, it will continue to be essential to ensure that the balance of “hard” power is sufficient to deter those who might harbor revisionist designs and aggressive ambitions. In the longer run, a convergence of all the major Asian powers towards shared liberal democratic values and political institutions is probably the best guarantor of an enduring peace. Aaron L.

The study ends in August. “Once the research is finished, we will be talking about whether we should pursue this project, and the size of the budget required,” he told The Korea Herald. In March, the city government will demolish the Seoul Regional Tax Office Namdaemun Annex building, which was built in 1937 by the Japanese to block the view of Deoksugung Palace during the colonial era. After the demolition of the building, which is close to the building of the Seoul Metropolitan Council in central Seoul, the property will be used as a public park. The city government plans to connect the park and the City Hall building underground, and Lee expects the project to take about two years. “The point is to provide a public cultural space that is also connected to City Hall,” Lee said. Meanwhile, Seoul’s Jongno District Office is currently building an underpass that connects Jonggak subway station to Gwanghwamun subway stations, as well as the Kyobo Tower building near Gyeongbokgung Palace. The property of the Kyobo Group is currently connected to Gwanghwamun Station. The underpass connecting the two stations is scheduled to open by the end of this year.

This year’s event was organized by the Seoul Design Foundation and supported by the Seoul Metropolitan Government to become the first comprehensive design festival held in Korea. Organizers combined all of the design-focused programs to be held in Seoul so far, such as the Seoul Design Festival, Herald Design Forum, and Design Market, into one great festival event, turning Seoul’s entire downtown area into a huge festival venue.Seoul Design Week 2014 was planned to increase synergy in the design industry by combining all of the diverse design-related programs held in the citizen sector and promote the brand of Seoul as a global design city.The event provided the citizens of Seoul with exciting opportunities to relish bountiful feasts of design through a variety of events, including seminars, exhibitions, and markets, prepared by some of the world’s most celebrated designers and successful business people.The Seoul Design Festival, held in COEX Mall, for instance, attracted wide public attention thanks to its special exhibitions focused on future-oriented design, such as “3D printing.” A total of over 90 thousand citizens visited the venue and participated in the various festival programs held for five days, making it the most popular of all the design-related events held in Korea today. Participants were particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity offered to them to participate in a seminar that included some of the world’s most famous designers and leading figures in design entrepreneurship, such as Paul Cocksedge and Francesca Veronesi. Citizens also showed great enthusiasm for the Seoul Design Spot Tour as it effectively offered open studios for the the designers, in many parts of downtown Seoul. These “design spots”, fifteen in total, provided citizens with experience-focused events on a variety of topics, including urban beekeeping and calligraphy.As for design students, the Herald Design Forum was a dream come true as it was included the participation of some of the world’s most celebrated designers and architects, such as Remment Koolhaas, Jeff Vandeberg, Olivier Theyskens, and Chris Riggs. The Herald Design Market, opened in connection with the forum, appealed to those interested in design intended to aid in a more comfortable and practical lifestyle, with food and kitchenware promoting health and well-being. In his congratulatory speech for the Herald Design Forum, Mayor of Seoul Park Won-sun stressed the importance and value of design, saying: “‘Design thinking’ based on humanism, empathy, creativity and innovation can produce solutions to various problems.”Organizers of Seoul Design Week 2014 found their event very successful in that its various design-focused events helped to create synergy through cooperation, which would have lasting influence. Experts now believe that if Seoul Design Week continues to develop at its current rapid pace it will soon grow into one of the top design festivals in East Asia and turn Seoul into one of the region’s top tourist attractions for those interested in design. Baek Jong-won, CEO of the Seoul Design Foundation, stressed at an interview with the media he had after the event, “Our mission is to create an environment in which we can develop synergy between all the existing events, forums, festivals and Design Spots.” He insisted, “What is more important for the creation of ‘an environment for a creative economy’ is not hardware production but how to use such hardware.” He then concluded, “We need to make DDP a means to experience, communicate and exchange what is new.”By online news team(onlinenews@heraldcorp.com)","seoul design week 2014 consisting ,festival event turning seoul entire ,run seoul design week 2014 ,seoul design week 2014 turned ,great festival event turning seoul","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Herald Design Forum', 'Seoul Design', 'Seoul', 'DDP', 'Dongdaemun Design Plaza', 'the Seoul Design Foundation', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Herald Design Forum', 'Design Market', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Design', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Design Festival', 'Korea', 'Paul Cocksedge', 'Francesca Veronesi', 'the Seoul Design Spot Tour', 'Seoul', 'the Herald Design Forum', 'Remment Koolhaas', 'Jeff Vandeberg', 'Olivier Theyskens', 'Chris Riggs', 'the Herald Design Market', 'the Herald Design Forum', 'Seoul Park Won - sun', 'Seoul Design', 'Seoul', 'Baek Jong - won', 'the Seoul Design Foundation', 'DDP']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62450159  0.07717723

The 20.7-square-meter landfill does not fall in any district in Seoul.The Sudoggwon Landfill opened in 1992 to replace the now-closed Nanjido Landfill in western Seoul.Regardless of the possible extension, Incheon City and the Environment Ministry have opened discussions on whether to relocate the metropolitan landfill after several years.An island in Ongjin-gun county, located in western Incheon, is being mentioned as a strong candidate for the next landfill location to take waste from Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province.A large number of Ongjin residents have expressed their opposition to the plan.Meanwhile, city authorities have already assessed Yeongheungdo Island in Ongjin. Other candidates include Muuido-Silmido islands in Jung-gu district, Incheon, and Modo-Sido-Sindo islands in Ongjin-gun county.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","landfill ministry official said extension ,the two parties on friday ,sudoggwon landfill extended after yielding ,two parties on friday ,scheduled 2016 to 2044","['Seoul City', 'Incheon City', 'Incheon City', 'the Ministry of Environment', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Incheon', 'Gimpo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gimpo City', 'Seoul', 'the Sudoggwon Landfill', 'Nanjido Landfill', 'Seoul', 'Incheon City', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Ongjin', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Ongjin', 'Ongjin', 'Muuido - Silmido', 'Jung - gu district', 'Incheon', 'Modo - Sido - Sindo', 'Ongjin', 'Kim Yon - se']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25263348  0.13262494

Nine started their career as executives at companies founded by their grandfather. It took a non-family employee an average four years to be promoted to the lowest-level management position.  Statistics indicate an economic slowdown has dimmed the local job market, making it more difficult to land permanent positions.According to the Korea Employment Information Service, 21.1 percent of new employees in their 20s began working as irregular workers, whose job contract is normally shorter than one year, sharply up from 8.7 percent in 2006. The fast rise of chaebol scions has raised concerns as some untested heirs have sparked public backlash with bratty behavior.For Cho Hyun-ah, the eldest daughter of Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho, it took 6.5 years to be elevated to an executive position at Korean Air Lines Co., the nation's largest air carrier. The 41-year-old last month stepped down as a vice president of Korean Air after a national uproar over the ""nut rage"" incident.Cho forced the chief purser of a flight to deplane, angered that she was serviced her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a plate.She was indicted Wednesday on charges of obstructing aviation safety.Cho's younger brother worked 3.4 years before becoming a vice president, and her younger sister spent 3.9 years before reaching a senior managerial position at the company.  Lee Jay-yong, the only son of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee, took 9.4 years to move to the top-level managerial position. The 47-year-old is now serving as the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. and is widely expected to inherit South Korea's largest conglomerate.Chung Eui-sun, 45, the eldest son of Hyundai Motor Chairman Chong Mong-koo, worked 5.8 years before becoming an executive.Junior Chung, the vice chairman of Hyundai Motor Co., was also seen preparing to take over the nation's top automaker from his 77-year-old father.

The bill for the cruise tour segment was initiated by President Park Geun-hye.The bill on state-led promotion of the cruise industry features tax relief for cruise tour operators, state support for increasing the workforce and establishment of a lobby for operators. A core focus of the bill is to allow Korean-owned vessels, to have casinos for foreign tourists.Local cruise liner Harmony Cruise, with a 1,000-passenger capacity, launched in 2012, but went bankrupt at the end of last year, allegedly due to its failure to get a license for onboard casinos.An official of the Prime Minister’s Office stressed that the profitability of a cruise line heavily depended on income from the operations of an onboard casino. “As an example, about 30 to 40 percent of total sales of a cruise ship in Malaysia come from its onboard gambling business,” he said.According to government officials, President Park’s attention to building the country’s tourism sector is reminiscent of the efforts of her late father ― former President Park Chung-hee ― who had planned to raise tourism as one of the country’s strategic industries by conjuring up support measures to go hand-in-hand with the nation’s export industry.The Park administration reiterated the urgent need to activate the prospective cruise industry, which is also among her campaign pledges.Prime Minister Chung met with chairmen of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee and the Strategy and Finance Committee of the Assembly and some other key lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties.Chung also asked the political leaders to push forward discussions on promoting the tourism industry.The incumbent government hopes to attract some 16 million foreign tourists by 2017 and raise the yearly tourism revenue to $24 billion. The number of those who work in Korea’s tourism industry was expected to rise to 1 million by 2017, the ministry also said. Last year, the number of jobs in the industry was 850,000.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","activating the cruise businesses expansion ,tax relief for cruise tour ,in yeouido seoul on wednesday ,bill for the cruise tour ,korea tourism industry was expected","['Chung Hong - won', 'the National Assembly', 'Yeouido', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Korean', 'Harmony Cruise', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'Malaysia', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park', 'Chung', 'the Legislation and Judiciary Committee', 'Finance Committee of the Assembly', 'Chung', 'Korea', 'Kim Yon - se']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43968198  0.53196251

The city also advised the retail giant to invite experts from outside the group to beef up its safety management plan over the high-rise and to communicate with the public to allay the safety concerns. Responding to the latest announcement, Lotte Group said that it will hold a monthly meeting with experts to fully explain the building's safety conditions to that end.

But before that, a series of annual Japanese events are expected to negatively influence the relationship.On Feb. 22, the Japanese prefecture of Shimane is to observe its Takeshima Day to assert Japan’s claim to Dokdo, which South Korea has effectively controlled with a small police detachment since its liberation from Japan in 1945. Takeshima is the Japanese name for the islets.Since 2013, the Abe government has sent senior officials such as a vice ministerial figure to attend a ceremony to mark the day, prompting a strong protest from Seoul. It is expected to send its officials to the event again.In addition to the celebration of the day, Tokyo has also created a video clip renewing its claim to Dokdo. A state agency in charge of territorial issues reportedly posted the 17-minute clip on YouTube on Dec. 24 to argue that Japanese people fished in waters surrounding Dokdo in the past.Another obstacle to bilateral relations will be the results of Tokyo’s state approval process for middle-school textbooks, expected to be announced in late March or early April.Last January, Tokyo announced a revision to the state teaching guidelines for middle- and high-school textbooks to reinforce its claim to Dokdo, further aggravating its diplomatic friction with Seoul.Under the revision, Japan’s claim to Dokdo and a chain of disputed islands in the East China Sea, also claimed by China, is to be spelled out in school textbooks for history, geography and social studies.The relationship between the old foes could also deteriorate in April when Japan is set to issue its annual foreign policy white paper. Last year, the document said that Dokdo was part of Japan’s inherent territory according to historical fact and international law, and that the issue of its wartime sexual slavery should not be treated as a political or diplomatic problem.In April, Japanese conservative politicians are also expected to pay respects to the war dead enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a place Seoul and Beijing see as a sign of Japan’s failure to atone for its wartime atrocities.Despite all these hurdles, ties between Seoul and Tokyo could improve should Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe renew Tokyo’s repentance for its wartime wrongdoings and make reconciliatory gestures toward its neighbors in a statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in August, analysts said.Lee Won-deog, Japan expert at Kookmin University, said that Seoul and Beijing needs to push Abe to produce a statement in August to lead Northeast Asia in a direction of reconciliation and cooperation.“The foreign ministers of South Korea, China and Japan are to meet this month to discuss their differences. I hope that their meeting can lead to a three-way summit where the leaders could talk heart-to-heart over a range of bilateral and trilateral issues,” he said.“It is also important for Seoul and Beijing to push Tokyo to include the content concerning the future three-way cooperation for reconciliation and regional peace in Abe’s statement to be released in August, rather than letting Abe write the statement only with his own historical views.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","coming events including japan celebration ,annual japanese events are expected ,relations seoul and tokyo may ,their diplomatic relations in june ,august to lead northeast asia","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Shimane', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'YouTube', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'China', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'the Yasukuni Shrine', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Lee Won - deog', 'Japan', 'Kookmin University', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'Abe ’s', 'Abe', 'song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 3.          1.          0.         ... -0.36845019  0.94255173

Sony’s Walkman was another hot seller among youngsters and hipsters, eager to free themselves from the confines of classrooms and cubicles. These items were so popular in Korea, and such a threat to nascent domestic companies, that they were banned from being imported. The painful structural reforms that were part of the International Monetary Fund loan conditions in 1997 involved lifting this ban, leading to Korea’s market being flooded with Japanese products.Ultimately, this had the effect of making Korean companies more globally competitive. Nowadays, Chinese tourists who roam shopping malls in Seoul stuff their oversized bags with Korean products, including Cuckoo rice cookers ― now must-have items. Amid the accelerating pace of global economic integration through free-trade pacts and World Trade Organization treaties, mega-sized trade agreements will dominate East Asia’s economic landscape in 2015 and beyond, experts say. The agreements are expected to be a catalyst for technological innovation, commercial vitalization and institutional upgrading, despite the prospect of a handful of sectors and small-and-medium-sized enterprises losing out. In the international academic symposium “The First China-Japan-Korea Cooperation Dialogue” hosted by the East Asia Foundation in November last year at Plaza Hotel in Seoul, leading East Asian scholars discussed ways to “find measures to solve common problems faced by (the three countries), to disseminate them for policy impact and promote peace and prosperity in the region.” Professor Ahn Duk-geun of Seoul National University’s Graduate School of International Studies (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Professor Ahn Duk-geun, who teaches international trade law and policy at Seoul National University’s Graduate School of International Studies and participated in the seminar, said that Korean companies should reap the benefits of free trade by enhancing their productivity and competitiveness, and turn the threat of global competition into an opportunity. “There has never been a case in the last half a century where our economy progressed by preventing, not facing, global competition from entering our market,” Ahn said in an interview with The Korea Herald in his office in late December. “Free trade is not merely about lowering or eliminating tariffs. It is equally about facilitating the movement of capital, people, ideas and services.” The benefits of an enlarged market may not be as visible or impressive in the short term, Ahn added, but its main long-term advantage lies in forcing companies to reinvent themselves following global standards, Ahn stressed. “The days of making copycat counterparts are over. With Chinese and emerging economies rapidly upping their capacities to chase and converge with Korea, we have no other option but to upgrade our technologies and business practices,” Ahn said. Leading scholars from China, Korea and Japan discussed the costs and benefits of a trilateral free trade pact at the international academic symposium “The First China-Japan-Korea Cooperation Dialogue,” hosted by the East Asia Foundation on Nov. 13, 2014, at Plaza Hotel in Seoul. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)With the “very realistic possibility” of Korea following Japan’s “lost 20 years, soon to become the lost 30 years” ― characterized by an aging society, low growth and depressed consumer sentiments ― Korean President Park Geun-hye’s much-touted “creative economy” road map hinges on integrating the Korean and world economies, and inventing high-value-added products and services, according to Ahn. “A free-trade pact between China, Japan and Korea will come after the signing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a regional trade and investment treaty involving 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region), expected to reach an agreement early this year,” Ahn said. “The China-Korea FTA, made official last November, will be the mainstay of the trilateral pact, with Japan playing a minor role to protect its agricultural industry.”Panelists at the seminar said that the steel, transport, machinery, automobile and electronics sectors in Japan and Korea are expected to benefit from the trilateral trade, while many agriculture and small and medium-sized firms are likely to suffer losses. To minimize the damage, establishing a safety net and providing subsidies are necessary, they said. Rep. Choo Mi-ae of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy party called the FTA a “double-edged sword,” noting that “the South Korean government’s rush to ink as many free-trade deals as possible without objectively considering their consequences shattered the rosy expectations of financial rewards.”“The biggest victim of Korea’s free-trade (pacts) has been the agricultural sector,” Choo said. “But our government treated farmers as rebels or free riders, while failing to provide a long-term framework for their survival.” Choo added that the industry, as a “valuable public good,” provides a number of benefits, including food security, national land management and environmental protection. “Trade and agriculture need not be traded off against each other. The Korean government must break from its conventional approach to achieve sustainable growth,” Choo cautioned. Meanwhile, Ahn emphasized that “FTAs are not only about economic gains and losses. Politics, diplomacy and security concerns are intertwined.” He added, “New geopolitical dynamics have become more complicated with the rise of China; Korea, which has managed to tread the middle ground, is now pressured to choose sides between China and America.” Academics have long pointed to the “Asian Paradox” ― a plethora of commercial exchanges despite a dearth of political trust ― as a product of historical discord between China and Japan, and China and Korea.“Unlike the European Union, which put its bloody history behind it for a common prosperous future, China, Japan and Korea wasted the last 70 years in terms of genuine reconciliation and progress,” Ahn said. “Politicking demagogues have exploited the people’s sentiments by arousing nationalism. Regional cooperation has been nonexistent on their agenda.” Ahn noted that following the 2008 global financial crisis, which deepened the global income divide, there has been an upsurge of resistance to neoliberal policies aimed at eliminating government intervention in the economy. “As amply demonstrated by the popularity of the argument of French economist Thomas Piketty, or people’s outpouring of rage over the Korean Air ‘nut rage’ incident, people are not so forgiving about the privileged and better-off,” Ahn said. “It is necessary to protect the vulnerable sectors, but the compensation must lead to gradual restructuring of the economy, to make it more efficient and competitive, rather than doling out no-strings-attached subsidies.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","90s housewives from korea traveling ,class korean families sony walkman ,90s housewives from korea ,depressed consumer sentiments korean president ,korean products including cuckoo rice","['Korea', 'Japan', 'Zojirushi', 'korean', 'Sony ’s Walkman', 'Korea', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'World Trade Organization', 'the East Asia Foundation', 'Seoul', 'east asian', 'Ahn Duk - geun', 'Seoul National University ’s Graduate School of International Studies', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea', 'Ahn duk - geun', 'Seoul National University ’s Graduate School of International Studies', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'Ahn', 'Ahn', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Ahn', 'China', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'the East Asia Foundation', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea', 'Japan', '― korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'korean', 'China', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'China', 'FTA', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Choo Mi', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'FTA', 'south korean', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Ahn', 'China', 'Korea', 'China', 'America', 'China', 'Japan', 'China', 'Korea', 'the European Union', 'China', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'french', 'Thomas Piketty', ""the Korean Air '"", 'Joel Lee']",19,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.70729834  0.61438692

Walt of Harvard University expressed skepticism about the R2P’s applicability to the North Korean situation, noting Pyongyang has built a strong mechanism to fend off any outside intervention.“R2P is not applicable to the North Korean case, because one of the conditions is that there be a feasible option for outsiders,” he said.“The North Korean government has gone to great lengths to make it difficult to impossible for outsiders to interfere there, and using force to try to change their human rights behavior would probably hurt as many people as it would help.”The R2P calls on the international community to take responsibility to protect citizens of a country that fails to safeguard its people from atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The interventionist concept was first brought up after concerns rose over the international community’s failure to properly handle genocides in Rwanda in 1994 and in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica the next year. Following a heated international debate on the concept, the U.N. adopted the R2P in 2005. The R2P was first applied in conflict-laden Libya in 2011, when the U.N. Security Council approved military action based on the norm. On the issue of the intensifying competition between the U.S. and China over regional dominance, the political scientist forecast that the risk of military confrontations between the two would increase in the years ahead should China’s economic and military clout continue to grow ― a situation that would put South Korea in a tricky diplomatic position.The following are excerpts from the interview with Walt: Korea Herald: The international community has been struggling to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear program over the last two decades, but to no avail. Would there be a way to denuclearize the North, other than a regime change? Stephen M. WaltStephen M. Walt: The negotiations have failed because the North Korean regime is unwilling to give up a powerful source of protection against outside pressure. As long as it has a few nuclear weapons, other states ― including China, the United States, Japan and South Korea ― will be very careful not to put too much pressure on them. It is really the only source of leverage they have, and they are not going to give it up readily. This situation will not change until the government in North Korea decides it wants to have a fundamentally different relationship with the outside world.KH: If North Korea fully develops nuclear arms, what kind of situations do you think will unfold? Do you think South Korea and Japan would opt to have their own nuclear arms to touch off a nuclear domino effect? Walt: North Korea cannot use its small nuclear arsenal to coerce its neighbors; it can only use it to deter attack. If the North used its nuclear arsenal, it would almost certainly face devastating retaliation. The United States has a much more effective arsenal, and it is committed to defending both Japan and South Korea. Moreover, U.S. leaders would not want to let a nuclear attack on a U.S. ally go unpunished. I believe that North Korea’s leaders understand this reality. KH: Pyongyang has adopted a policy of simultaneously developing its economy and nuclear weapons. What do you think about this two-pronged policy?Walt: North Korea’s nuclear program is intended to prevent the United States (or others) from conducting a “regime change” in Pyongyang. Because remaining in power is the regime’s top priority, it has been willing to sacrifice economic development and full engagement with the outside world. KH: Washington seems to have prioritized preventing North Korea’s spread of nuclear arms to other nonnuclear nations ― the “horizontal” nuclear proliferation ― while Seoul has prioritized the complete dismantlement of the nuclear arms ― the “vertical proliferation.” So there could be a policy gap in that regard. What do you think about this? Walt: The United States opposes both vertical and horizontal proliferation, so there is no significant gap between Washington and Seoul. Preventing horizontal proliferation is a somewhat easier task, but both are important.KH: North Korea has reportedly been developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile that will allow it to have a second-strike capability. How would you assess the SLBM threats?Walt: I am not that concerned about this possibility, because a submarine-launched missile provides a second capability only if the submarine itself cannot be detected, tracked and attacked. That is unlikely to be true of any small submarine force that North Korea might develop.KH: The relationship between South Korea and Japan has been worsening due to escalating territorial and historical disputes. What do you think about the current relationship between the two and would there be a way to improve the strained ties? Walt: The current state of relations is deeply regrettable, and is not in either country’s interest. In my view, this is one area where the United States should be engaged in more active diplomacy, to try to smooth out these differences. I would also encourage South Korea and Japan to begin a “track II” process of academics, journalists and former officials, to begin to address some of the contentious historical issues that are disturbing the relationship.KH: East Asia has long been suffering from distrust, and historical and territorial antagonisms. Do you have any suggestions to address them and promote peace and stability, like what Europe has done?Walt: I would not be too pessimistic: Asia has made enormous economic and political progress over the past 40 years or more. But reconciliation in Europe was partly aided by a genuine multinational effort to come to terms with past history, and to “denationalize” its teaching. After World War II, European government and historians from different countries worked to correct the teaching of history in different European countries, in order to remove biased and nationalistic curriculum in schools and create a shared understanding of Europe’s past.KH: Professor John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago said in his latest version of the “The Tragedy of Great Power Politics” that China would not rise peacefully. Do you agree with that?Walt: I believe professor Mearsheimer is mostly correct: China’s rise will increase the level of security competition in Asia. If China continues to grow economically, it will also increase its military power and it will gradually try to push the United States out of Asia, mostly by trying to convince other Asian states to distance themselves from Washington. The United States will resist these efforts. I do not know if there will be a war, or even serious military confrontations, but I do think the risk of both will increase in the years ahead.KH: South Korea has been striving to maintain both its strategic partnership with China and security alliance with the U.S. Amid the intensifying rivalry between the two major powers, Korea may be put into a tricky position. What do you think about the future course of Korea’s diplomacy? Walt: You are correct that South Korea will face a delicate balancing act. But in international politics, ensuring a state’s security and sovereignty has to be the top priority. Without adequate protection, smaller states are forced to accommodate powerful neighbors and that is rarely a comfortable position to be in.KH: China has recently been seeking to initiate a new regional security apparatus excluding the U.S., a “maritime silk road” vision and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. How do you assess all these moves?Walt: These proposals suggest that China does want to challenge American leadership of key international institutions, but it has a long way to go before it is in a similar position of power. If China does move in this direction, it will also have to be willing to take on other global responsibilities, and that is something Beijing has been reluctant to do so far. KH: How do you think China will strategically use both South Korea and North Korea in its quest to become a great power?Walt: China faces potential threats from many directions and tends to be very sensitive to events on its borders. I believe it sees the Korean Peninsula more as a potential source of trouble than as an opportunity. Indeed, the main reason Beijing continues to support North Korea is to keep the peninsula divided and to preserve a “buffer state” there.KH: There has been a growing concern here that the U.S. may not make all-out efforts to intervene in a possible conflict on the Korean Peninsula given that Washington has shown some reluctance to get promptly involved in crises in Libya and Syria. America’s reduction of ground troops has also triggered concerns that the U.S. ground-based military support for South Korea could weaken. What do you think about these concerns?Walt: These concerns are misplaced. The United States does not improve its global position or its military strength when it gets involved in costly conflicts such as Iraq or Afghanistan. The United States does not in fact have vital interests at stake in Libya, Syria or even western Iraq today, and it would be a mistake to divert more attention and resources towards these issues. These conflicts must ultimately be handled by local forces, so that the United States can concentrate on more important issues, most notably Asia.KH: South Korean President Park Geun-hye has paid much attention to the issue of national reunification. Do you have any suggestions to help lay the groundwork for unification?Walt: Unfortunately, no. Reunification will depend first and foremost on a change of heart inside the North Korean government, and it is impossible to say when that will occur.Stephen M. Walt● Walt, the Robert and Renee Belfer professor of international affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, is a leading theorist in the realist school of thought. He previously taught at Princeton University and the University of Chicago. ● He is internationally acclaimed for his creation of the international relations theory of the “balance of threats” ― a modification of the prevailing rule of the “balance of power” developed by Kenneth Waltz, the late founder of neorealism, or structuralism. ● He is the author of several award-winning books, including “The Origins of Alliances,” which received the 1988 Edgar S. Furniss National Security Book Award. ● His publications also include “Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy” and articles for Foreign Policy and Naval War College Review. ● He serves on the editorial boards of Foreign Policy, Security Studies, International Relations, and Journal of Cold War Studies, and as coeditor of the Cornell Studies in Security Affairs, published by Cornell University Press. ● He received a bachelor’s degree in international relations from Stanford University in 1977, a master’s degree in political science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1978 and a Ph.D. in political science from Berkeley in 1983.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","year following heated international debate ,south korean president park geun ,protect last year investigation report ,new year series of interviews ,the korea herald professor stephen","['Ed', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.N.', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korea Herald', 'Stephen M.
