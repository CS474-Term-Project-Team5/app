It seems to be possible to sign it around Dec. 28,"" the agency official said on the condition of anonymity.South Korea hopes to produce its own fighter jet to replace the aging fleet of F-4s and F-5s by mid-2020.Last month, KAI secured Indonesia's assurance that it will pay for 20 percent of the total cost expected to reach $15 billion.Under the contract between the DAPA and KAI, six test planes will be manufactured by 2025, according to the official.The KF-X project received a boost from the U.S. pledge to transfer some of its jet technologies. But South Korea faces a daunting task of finding an alternative as the U.S. made it clear that four core technologies will be excluded.Those are the active electronically scanned radar, infrared search-and-rescue system, electro-optical targeting pod and radio frequency jammer.South Korea, meanwhile, plans to launch a task force for the project on Jan. 1 next year that will be composed of 70-80 officials and experts.

The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations this week. A total of 119 nations voted for the resolution and 19 nations, including China, against it, with 48 abstentions.In an editorial, the state-run Global Times said the Chinese vote against the U.N. resolution ""does not mean we endorse the human rights situation in North Korea.""It said the Chinese vote was based on Beijing's long-standing policy of non-interference.Last week, an all-female propaganda band formed by North Korean leader Kim Jong-il abruptly canceled a three-day concert in Beijing. Both China and North Korea remain tightlipped over the reason of the cancellation. ""The abrupt canceling of a North Korean girl band's planned show in Beijing has also created some sentiments among the Chinese people,"" the editorial said. ""North Korea should be aware of the fact that the Chinese government made the vote under certain domestic pressures. It should also be grateful,"" it said. ""North Korean authorities should also strive to provide a positive environment, so that the Chinese public can better appreciate the country,"" it said. China, a key ally of North Korea, has expressed displeasure about the North's nuclear weapons program, but defended Pyongyang at the U.N. on other issues, including human rights. Despite this week's resolution, chances of an actual referral are slim because it is not legally binding. An actual referral should be blocked by China. North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.

The official declined to give his name.Â  Â In a brief notice posted on the Chinese theater's website, the theater confirmed the cancellation of the performances by the North Korean band, expressing ""deep regret"" over the cancellation.Â Â China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing a ""relevant department,"" that the concert ""cannot be staged as scheduled due to communication issues at the working level.""Â Â Officials at China's foreign ministry were not immediately available for comments on Saturday. Â Â Chinese and Japanese media reports say members of the North Korean band were seen departing for Pyongyang earlier in the day. Â Â It was not immediately known why the North Korean band returned home hours before the performances, which are not open to the public and an invitation-only, were to begin. Â Â Some North Korean watchers speculated that Pyongyang might have canceled the performances because top Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, declined to attend. Â Â Others said there might have been complaints from North Korea over media coverage of the band's leader, Hyon Song-wol, who is reportedly a former girlfriend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Â Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said the abrupt cancellation of the performances might have been due to stories about Hyon that undermine the ""dignity"" of the North Korean leader. Â Â ""Possibility is high that the abrupt cancellation may be related to the 'top dignity,'"" the professor said, referring to the North Korean leader's dignity and authority. Â Â Yang Moo-jin, a professor of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said that if the cancellation is related to news stories about the band's leader, ""There might have been prior consent between the two sides."" Â Â ""If so, it would have little impact on bilateral ties between North Korea and China,"" Yang said.Â Â However, Yang said news coverage about Hyon by the South Korean media might have had a negative impact on inter-Korean talks that were being held at North Korea's border city of Kaesong.Â Â The band's ""friendship performances,"" described by North Korea's state media, were seen as the latest sign that Pyongyang is trying to mend ties with Beijing after years of strain following the North's third nuclear test in early 2013.Â Â Since Liu Yunshan, the Chinese Communist Party's fifth-ranked official, visited Pyongyang in October and held talks with North Korean leader Kim, there have been signs of improvement in bilateral ties.Â Â The band, known for its interpretive performances of the totalitarian state's propaganda songs and Western pop music, including the ""Theme from Rocky,"" was formed in 2012 following an order by North Korea's young leader Kim.Â Â At the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing, some Chinese guests who were invited to the North Korean band's concert voiced complaints over the cancellation.

Ji Jae-ryong, North Korea's ambassador to China, made the remarks during a meeting with Luo Baoming, Hainan's Communist Party chief and provincial governor, on Monday, the Chinese Communist Party said in an article posted on its website. North Korea is seeking to attract foreign tourists to the Mount Kumgang resort on its east coast after unveiling a project to build the ""Wonsan-Mount Kumgang international tourism zone"" earlier this year. The North's mountain resort, developed by the South Korean company Hyundai Asan, opened in 1998 as a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation, but Seoul halted tours in July 2008 after a North Korean soldier shot and killed a South Korean tourist who had strayed into a restricted military zone there.

Other participants are Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, India and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations â Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. They have so far held 10 rounds of negotiations since 2012.

It is composed of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus its eight dialogue partners â South Korea, China, Japan, the United States, Russia, Australia, India and New Zealand.

All expenses of the ceremony will be paid by the National Treasury in line with the State Funeral Act, the Ministry of the Interior said Sunday.A National State Funeral Committee will be established for Kimâs funeral. The six-member body, to be headed by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, will be responsible for organizing the funeral parlor, supervising the carrying of the coffin and running the funeral and burial ceremonies. Kimâs family members will have the right to recommend members of the committee. Sohn Myung-soon (second from right), the former First Lady and the wife of the late former President Kim Young-sam, pays a tribute to her late husband at the funeral hall set up at the Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul, Sunday. YonhapAfter a five-day mourning period, Kimâs funeral ceremony will be held in front of the National Assembly Building in Seoul on Thursday at 2 p.m. Following the ceremony, Kimâs remains will be moved to and buried at the Seoul National Cemetery, where late Presidents Syngman Rhee, Park Chung-hee and Kim Dae-jung are interred. The burial site was selected after the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs discussed the matter with Kimâs family members. The Ministry of the Interior also announced that memorial altars will be set up nationwide, including at the National Assembly and South Korean embassies overseas, so mourners can pay tribute to the late leader. âLate President Kim Young-sam devoted his entire life to the establishment of democracy of this country,â said Prime Minister Hwang. âThe government will do everything it can to support this funeral ceremony to pay respect to the late leader and his legacies.âAccording to the current State Funeral Act, which was revised last year, a state funeral may be given to a former or incumbent president, a president-elect or any person who was respected for having rendered distinguished service to society, after consulting with their family. Kim will be the first former president to be given a state funeral since the law was revised. Under the former law, which was enacted in 1967, family members of former presidents had an option of holding a âstate funeral (gukjang),â which lasted for less than nine days, or a ânational funeral (gukminjang),â which lasted for less than seven days.The revision combined the two types of funerals into one -- a state funeral (gukgajang) that lasts five days with all associated costs covered by the government.In the past, late former presidents were given different types of funerals. Former President Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated in 1979, was given the nationâs first state funeral (gukjang) and was buried at the Seoul National Cemetery in Seoul. Some 1,700 memorial altars were established nationwide during the nine-day mourning period, including at Cheong Wa Dae, and some 480 million won ($414,000) was spent for the funeral.Late former President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kim Dae-jung (1924-2009), who died to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, was also given a state funeral (gukjang). He was the second person in South Korean history after Park to be given a state funeral before the lawâs revision. The ceremony was held in front of the National Assembly building and he was eventually interred at the Seoul National Cemetery according to Catholic traditions. Some 2.09 billion won worth of state funds were spent for his funeral.Former Presidents Roh Moo-hyun (1946-2009), who died of self-inflicted injury, and Choi Kyu-ha (1919-2006), who died of heart disease, were given national funerals (gukminjang). Rohâs body was cremated and interred in his hometown of Bongha, located in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province. Choi, on the other hand, was buried at the Daejeon National Cemetery. Not all presidents were given public funerals. South Koreaâs first President Syngman Rhee (1875-1965) died of a stroke in 1965 while in exile in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was given a private funeral, although his body was eventually returned to Seoul and buried at Seoul National Cemetery.Koreaâs second President Yoon Bo-seon (1897-1990), who died of old age, was given a relatively small private funeral, according to his family membersâ wishes. The ceremony was held at the Andong Presbyterian Church in Anguk-dong, Seoul, where he had been a devoted member. Only a single memorial altar was established during the mourning period, which was at his home in Anguk-dong, Seoul. Yoon was buried in his native Asan, South Chungcheong Province.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","five day state funeral for ,funerals south korea first president ,given public funerals south korea ,five day state funeral ,arrange five day state funeral","['South Korea', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Seoul', 'the National Treasury', 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'National State Funeral Committee', 'Kim', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Kim âs', 'Sohn Myung - soon', 'Kim Young - sam', 'the Seoul National University Hospital', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly Building', 'Seoul', 'Kim âs', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'the Ministry of Patriots', 'Veterans Affairs', 'Kim âs', 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'the National Assembly', 'south korean', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Hwang', 'State', 'Kim', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Seoul', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'south korean', 'National Assembly', 'catholic', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Choi Kyu - ha', 'Roh âs', 'Bongha', 'Gimhae', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Choi', 'the Daejeon National Cemetery', 'South Korea âs', 'Syngman Rhee', 'Honolulu', 'Hawaii', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Yoon Bo - seon', 'the Andong Presbyterian Church', 'Seoul', 'Anguk - dong', 'Seoul', 'Yoon', 'Asan', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Claire Lee']",7,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.56054503  0.26628831

Unification Ministry spokesperson Chung June-hee speaks during a press briefing on Friday. (Yonhap)Seoulâs Unification Ministry said that it accepted Pyongyangâs proposal earlier in the day to hold the meeting at Tongilgak, a building on the North Korean side of the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjeom.âOur acceptance of the proposal reflects our resolve to conscientiously execute the Aug. 25 agreement,â a ministry official told reporters, referring to the bilateral deal to defuse tensions and improve frosty relations.âAt the working-level talks, the two sides will discuss details about the higher-level talks: who will attend the talks, when they will be held and what kind of issues will be included in the agenda,â the official added on customary condition of anonymity.In the morning, the Northâs Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland proposed the talks. The proposal came after Pyongyang rejected Seoulâs overtures for dialogue three times in September and October. At the talks, the Northâs three-member delegation will be led by a senior official of the committee, while the South will be represented by Kim Ki-woong, director-general of the Unification Ministryâs Special Office for Inter-Korean Dialogue.Seoul had been pushing for the high-level government talks to address a series of thorny issues including the humanitarian issue of families separated by the border, in line with the Aug. 25 deal.Under the deal, which was reached after tensions spiked due to the Northâs landmine provocation on Aug. 4 and an exchange of artillery fire on Aug. 20, the two sides agreed to ease military tensions, seek regular high-level talks and bolster civil-sector exchanges.Before Pyongyangâs proposal for the talks on Friday, Seoul proposed dialogue three times -- on Sept. 21 and 24, and Oct. 30. Seoul made the proposal to Kim Yang-gon, the director of the ruling Workerâs Partyâs United Front Department, in the name of its Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.Pyongyang rejected the offers, arguing that Seoul was not sincere about the talks.When the North first rejected the offer, it criticized South Korean civic groupsâ dissemination of anti-Pyongyang leaflets, lawmakersâ moves to enact a North Korea human rights law and news reports on North Korean provocations.On the agenda for the high-level government talks are expected to include the lifting of Seoulâs âMay 24â economic sanctions against Pyongyang, the resumption of tours to Mount Geumgangsan and Seoulâs push for building a peace park in the Demilitarized Zone.For the North, the lifting of the May 24 sanctions is critical as it seeks to improve its economy, while the South prioritizes addressing the issue of separated families.Seoul maintains that the economic sanctions, which were imposed after Pyongyangâs attack on the Cheonan in March 2010, can only be terminated if the regimeâs apologizes for the attack, takes steps to prevent a recurrence and punishes those who carried it out.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","koreas agreed friday to hold ,meeting next thursday to arrange ,press briefing on friday yonhap ,briefing on friday yonhap seoul ,the two koreas agreed friday","['Koreas', 'unification Ministry', 'Unification Ministry', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'the North âs Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ki - woong', 'the Unification Ministry âs Special Office', 'Seoul', 'North âs', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'Worker âs Party âs', 'United Front Department', 'Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'anti - pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62055355  0.84279954

The incident maimed two South Korean soldiers near the border.In a move to implement the deal, the two Koreas held the reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War in late October.But North Korea remained silent on the South's repeated dialogue offer, without revealing clear reasons.""The North's offer for dialogue appears to be aimed at taking the initiative over inter-Korean affairs,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. ""Ahead of a planned party congress in May, the North seems to show that it is leading efforts to bring peace to the peninsula.""The North's decision also came as discussion is underway for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to visit North Korea. It is not clear if or when Ban will make a rare trip to the North, but if realized, his visit is likely to help improve Seoul-Pyongyang relations.President Park Geun-hye said last week that she is open to a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un if the North shows sincerity in giving up its nuclear weapons program and improving inter-Korean ties.Pyongyang has attached preconditions to high-level talks in response to Seoul's previous similar offers.North Korea has urged Seoul to lift its punitive sanctions on the North and to resume a now-suspended joint tour program at Mount Kumgang on the North's east coast.But the South has called on the North to hold the talks without strings attached, saying that pending issues can be discussed if the North comes to the dialogue table.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's upcoming visit to North Korea is yet more evidence of Pyongyang's shift toward re-engagement with the international community for possible economic reasons, a U.S. expert said Monday.Ban's scheduled visit to Pyongyang this week is expected to include a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a high-level U.N. source told Yonhap News Agency. The surprise visit has spurred hope Ban might broker progress in the North Korean nuclear standoff or inter-Korean relations.""A visit by the U.N. secretary-general, if it were to occur, would provide further evidence following Liu Yunshan's October visit to Pyongyang of a shift by North Korea toward re-engagement with the international community under Kim Jong-un,"" said Scott Snyder, a senior researcher for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.Liu, the fifth-ranked official of the Chinese Communist Party hierarchy, visited Pyongyang last month and attended celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the North's ruling Workers' Party in a possible indication of improving ties between the North and China.""Re-engagement most probably has an economic motive,"" Snyder said.American experts have noted that one of the top priorities for Kim Jong-un has been to revive the country's broken economy under his trademark ""byeongjin"" policy of simultaneously seeking nuclear and economic development. That compares with the ""songun"" or military-first policy that his father and late leader, Kim Jong-il, pursued.When North Korea backed off and proposed peace talks with the South during the August military standoff, some experts also said Pyongyang could have started the confrontation to get inter-Korean talks started so as to win economic cooperation and investment necessary to rebuild its broken economy.U.S. analysts have also said the North's leader needs economic assistance in order to consolidate his power and that's why the regime has been refraining from provocations. Unless Pyongyang gets what it wants, however, it could again resort to bad behavior, they said.Indeed, the North neither conducted a nuclear test nor launched a long-range rocket around the Oct. 10 anniversary of the Workers'Party despite widespread concerns that it would.Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, also said that Pyongyang ""typically uses engagement to either gain benefits or undermine international support for sanctions,"" adding that the North could use Ban's visit to push for a peace treaty with the U.S.""Such effort (for a peace treaty) will not be successful, however, since both Washington and Seoul have rejected a peace treaty without steps to reduce North Korea's conventional threat to South Korea,"" he said.Ban's meeting with the North's leader would be ""significant"" itself in that it would be Kim's first meeting with a major world figure, Klingner said.""Hopefully Ban will use his visit to press Pyongyang to improve its human rights record and begin compliance with numerous U.N. resolutions,"" he said. ""Ban should press Kim to open North Korea to inspections of its gulags and to begin denuclearization efforts as required by the UN resolutions.""Richard Bush, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution, said that the North's leader appears to be ""trying to extricate North Korea from the isolation that it created for itself the last two years"" and inviting Ban is the latest example.""But the important variable is the policies of North Korea, especially on nuclear issues and whether there is any evidence of a change. High-level meetings may reveal that a change is underway, but for enduring engagement and improvement of relations, it is North Korea that will have to change,"" he said.

The source spoke on condition of anonymity because the trip has not been formally announced.It was also unclear whether Ban asked to make the trip or Pyongyang invited him.Ban will be the third U.N. secretary-general to visit North Korea after Kurt Waldheim in 1979 and Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1993. Both Waldheim and Boutros-Ghali met with North Korea's founding leader Kim Il-sung during their visits to Pyongyang.Ban is also expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.""There can't be such a situation where the U.N. secretary-general visits North Korea and does not meet with the supreme leader of the U.N. member state,"" the source said. The source said Ban won't be coming back from the trip empty-handed, adding that there is a high possibility that the trip could produce an important opportunity for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and other Korean Peninsula matters.In May, Ban planned to visit the North Korean border city of Kaesong, where South Korea runs an industrial complex, but the trip was called off at the last minute because Pyongyang abruptly withdrew its invitation for him for no clear reason.Some analysts said at the time that Pyongyang appeared to have taken issue with Ban's remarks that North Korea's missile launches represent a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, has repeatedly said that he will do everything possible to promote inter-Korean reconciliation and a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.

The forthcoming delegation includes the local unit of World Vision and other active domestic North Korea aid groups. The visit to Pyongyang is the largest in scale by the council, which was founded in 1999 with the goal to spur cooperation among local assistance providers for North Korea. The Unification Ministry is expected to approve the North Korean trip one or two days before the planned visit.The traveling officials plan to meet with their North Korean counterparts from the National Reconciliation Council, a government body in charge of dealing with inter-Korean affairs. Since the private-level humanitarian assistance between the Koreas has been on a hiatus, the officials may delve into general issues rather than specific matters, an official from the local council noted. This upcoming visit carries special significance because the result of it could determine the course of inter-Korean exchanges down the road.Exchanges and humanitarian assistance between the Koreas have been on the upturn since the countries struck a rare agreement on Aug. 25 to end military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Assisted by the agreement, the monthly tally of South Korean visits to the North soared to 880 in October from the monthly average of just 46 from January to September. The amount of South Korean private groups' humanitarian aid to the North also grew to 1.1 billion won ($943,499) in October, a remarkable increase given North Korea's previous reluctance to accept aid from the South.

During the apartment construction work in 1997, a large amount of ancient remains and relics from the Baekje era were dug up, including earthenware and remains of public and residential buildings. Currently, some 30,000 residents are residing in the inner part of the oval wall, and the city may need 2 trillion won in total to move all of them out of the relic site.The city is now quickening efforts to relocate the residents and speed up the excavation project, the officials said, adding that Seoul is also planning to include the ancient site on the world heritage list of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization by 2020.

30,30,30,Minister Yun calls out on N.K. in Iran,"Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se set foot in Tehran on Saturday as Seoulâs first top diplomat in about 14 years, meeting with top officials and urging North Korea once again to follow its path to forsake nuclear weapons and regain international confidence. Yunâs trip comes after that of former minister Han Seung-soo in 2001 and three previous rounds of bilateral talks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif ...","Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se set foot in Tehran on Saturday as Seoulâs first top diplomat in about 14 years, meeting with top officials and urging North Korea once again to follow its path to forsake nuclear weapons and regain international confidence. Yunâs trip comes after that of former minister Han Seung-soo in 2001 and three previous rounds of bilateral talks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif on the sidelines of international conferences over the past year. The ministerial meeting took place for the first time in nearly six years in September 2014 in New York. Yun was the latest in a string of high-flying officials from around the globe to travel to the Islamic republic since it reached a historic agreement last July on sharply curbing its nuclear activities with the so-called P5+1 world powers â the U.S. China, Russia, the U.K., France and Germany. The two officials concurred that the breakthrough is bringing about a âcrucial turning pointâ in bilateral ties, with international sanctions set to be lifted to pave the way for South Korean companiesâ investments especially in energy and infrastructure. They also agreed to expand high-level meetings and other formal back-to-back talks to step up cooperation in nonconventional areas including health, culture, tourism, development and academic exchanges.Â  Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (left) and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif shakes hands at their talks in Tehran on Saturday. (Foreign Ministry)While acknowledging the differences between North Korea and Iran, such as in political and economic circumstances, Yun stressed the significance of âtenacious dialogue and negotiationsâ that made possible what he called a âpivotal landmarkâ in reinforcing the global nonproliferation regime. âDuring the ministerial talks, Yun expressed hopes that the Iranian accord will have a positive impact on tackling the North Korea nuclear issues, and North Korea will take lessons from the negotiation process that helped Iran restore trust from the international community,â Seoulâs Foreign Ministry said in a statement. âZarif, for his part, reiterated Tehranâs stance against North Koreaâs nuclear program, saying that nuclear weapons will never improve its security, and the recent agreement marks a good example that any sensitive problem can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy.â The two diplomats also assessed the âcomplex, multilayeredâ crises unfolding across the Middle East, with Yun calling for Iran to play a âconstructiveâ role in fighting challenges stemming from Syria and its refugees, the Islamic State terrorist group and other causes of instability. During his stay, the minister also paid a courtesy visit to President Hassan Rouhani and held meetings with South Korean businesses and residents there, the ministry added. The meetings reflect Seoulâs ongoing efforts to mend fences with Tehran, which has long been suspected as a partner of Pyongyang on clandestine arms trade and collaboration on missile and bomb development. Iran has consistently denied the allegations. Iran was South Koreaâs fourth-largest crude oil provider after Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar until the U.S. and Europe slapped sanctions on Iranian oil imports and tanker insurance in 2012 as a way to press Tehran to drop its nuclear bid by axing transactions with the Iranian central bank and squeezing oil revenues, a mainstay of its economy. Iran accounted for 9.4 percent of total oil imports here estimated at 930 million barrels in 2011, government data shows. As for South Korea, Iran was its third-largest market in the Middle East, with almost 3,000 firms selling steel sheets, synthetic resins, home appliances and other items. Exports to the country stood at $6.07 billion in 2011, representing a 32 percent on-year increase. With Iran coming under the crippling sanctions, however, South Korea drastically cut its oil imports and froze transactions with some of its banks. In retaliation, Iran threatened to cease bringing in Korean products. Powered by the lifting of some bans and the diplomatic compromise, Iran is forecast to jack up its oil production from the current 2.9 million barrels per day towards the pre-sanctions level of 3.6 million, according to the International Energy Agency in its monthly oil market report released on Oct. 13. This, in turn, will likely lead to more shipments to Korea. âSome former customers in the Mediterranean would prefer to use Iranian crude as their baseload feedstock once sanctions are lifted and South Africa, Greece, Turkey and South Korea have reportedly shown interest,â the report said. âHow quickly Iranâs oil is available to the market will make a big difference to our 2016 market dynamics.â By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","seoul first top diplomat in ,saturday as seoul first top ,as seoul first top diplomat ,seoul first top diplomat ,on saturday as seoul first","['Yun Byung - se', 'Tehran', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Han Seung - soo', 'iranian', 'Mohammad Javad Zarif', 'New York', 'Yun', 'islamic', 'the U.S.', 'China', 'Russia', 'U.K.', 'France', 'Germany', 'south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'iranian', 'Mohammad Javad Zarif', 'Tehran', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'Yun', 'Yun', 'iranian', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'Seoul âs Foreign Ministry', 'Zarif', 'Tehran', 'North Korea âs', 'Iran', 'Syria', 'Islamic', 'Hassan Rouhani', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Tehran', 'Pyongyang', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'South Korea âs', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Kuwait', 'Qatar', 'U.S.', 'iranian', 'Tehran', 'iranian', 'Iran', 'South Korea', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'South Korea', 'Iran', 'korean', 'Iran', 'the International Energy Agency', 'Korea', 'iranian', 'South Africa', 'Greece', 'Turkey', 'South Korea', 'Iran', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.78575242  0.56790197

Â Â Indonesia is a foreign partner for the project to build combat jets with stealth capabilities with indigenous technologies. Â Â Indonesia has agreed to shoulder 20 percent of the development costs for the project and acquire about 50 new planes.

President Park Geun-hye and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pose for a photo before their talks at Cheong Wa Dae last week. (Yonhap)The ministry revealed its proposal in a press release on its website. Seoul did not mention the proposal in its announcement of the outcome of the summit, which was held on the sidelines of the trilateral summit that also involved Japan.Beijingâs proposal came at a delicate juncture when Seoul has been under increasing pressure to clarify its stance over Chinaâs moves to turn rocks and reefs in the South China Sea into artificial islands that would potentially be used for military purposes.Â Observers say that should the talks proceed, the dispute over Ieodo â which is submerged but acts as the base for a South Korean research station -- in the overlapping exclusive economic zones of the two countries, could resurface to the detriment of the bilateral relationship.The EEZ is a sea zone over which a country has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources. It stretches out to 200 nautical miles from the coastline.Â During a bilateral summit last July, the two sides agreed to reopen negotiations over the EEZs this year. In January, they held consultations in Shanghai to prepare for the negotiations. They plan to hold director general-level preparatory consultations on Nov. 16.Since 1996, the two sides have held more than a dozen rounds of talks over the EEZ, but no agreement has been reached. Seoul has demanded that the EEZ be demarcated by drawing a median line, while Beijing argues that the coasts and the population along them must be taken into account in EEZ demarcation.Ieodo is 4.6 meters below sea level south of Jejudo Island and has long been a source of tension between the two neighbors.Although a reef cannot be the subject of territorial dispute under U.N. maritime law, the Seoul government believes that the rock belongs to it as the reef and its adjoining waters are part of its continental shelf.In 2003, Seoul built the Ocean Research Station on Ieodo to measure ocean currents and accumulate data for weather forecasting, fishery and environmental protection, and prevention of natural disasters such as tidal waves and tropical storms.China calls Koreaâs activities on the rock illegal.In 2012, a Chinese senior official was reported to have renewed a jurisdictional claim to the rock, rekindling the dispute over Ieodo. The official was said to have claimed that it would be included in areas subject to Chinaâs surveillance and patrol.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","in seoul on friday beijing ,seoul on friday beijing foreign ,summit in seoul on friday ,seoul on friday beijing ,on friday beijing foreign ministry","['China', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Beijing âs Foreign Ministry', 'Ieodo', 'Park Geun', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'Cheong', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Ieodo', 'south korean', 'EEZ', 'Shanghai', 'EEZ', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'EEZ', 'Ieodo', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Ocean Research Station', 'China', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'Ieodo', 'China', 'Song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.74483895  0.40992174

Under the agreement, the measurement information will be transmitted through an exclusive file transfer protocol, officials said. This is the first time Beijing is sharing the data through an exclusive file transfer line with a foreign country, they added. The data will include the air quality information of three Korean regions â Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon â and 35 Chinese sites including Beijing, Hebei, Jilin and Tianjin. The two states will also share the measurement data of the yellow dust of 40 Chinese cities, including the source sites, such as Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. Seoul has voiced the need to share such information as part of its efforts to improve the accuracy of the forecast of the level of yellow dust and fine dust. Previously, Korea was able to gain yellow dust data of only four sites from the Chinese meteorological agency, having difficulties in raising the forecast accuracy. The number of sites will later be expanded to 74 Chinese cities, the authorities said. Seoul and Beijing have closely put efforts into preventing the dust over the years. In June, the two parties launched a joint fine dust research group to better determine the cause of the fine dust and improve the forecast system. According to the environmental ministry, about 30 percent to 50 percent of local air pollutants come from China. While the yellow dust mostly originates from Inner Mongolia, dry regions, and deserts in China and Mongolia, very fine particles are generated by human activities, such as running factories, cars and heating in China. Korea has seen a rise in the frequency of yellow dust and fine particulate polution in recent years, especially, when the neighboring country started heating activities. Earlier last month, fine dust from China blanketed the peninsula for a week. The yellow dust was spotted last week in the West Sea, Seoul and the surrounding area, which is the first yellow dust detected in the fall in six years, officials said.

The issue has gained urgency in recent years as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.Park also said the wrong perception of history is to blame for bilateral friction, noting South Korea is not holding back the ties.The summit was set up as South Korea hosts a trilateral summit with Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday.A trilateral summit has not been held since 2012 due to a territorial dispute between China and Japan, as well as Japan's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation.Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910-45 and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.

The leaders of the three countries will be sitting down for first time in three and a half years after a previous one held in Beijing in 2012.âTaking the summit as an opportunity, efforts will be restored to expand (regional) cooperation by the three countries and to carry out joint works in various fields of mutual interests,â he said.After the summit, the leaders will hold a joint press conference and attend a meeting of business representatives from the three countries as well as a welcoming banquet in the evening.The three are expected to issue a joint statement after the summit as a customary procedure, but the officials are still in the course of negotiations before finalizing the agreements.Prospects, however, remain bleak over the outcome of the Park-Abe summit, as the talks are being held without any immediate progress in the working-level negotiations on sex slaves.Experts raised concerns that Abe is unlikely to address the critical issue of its wartime atrocities, particularly Korean women forced into sexual slavery during World War II.The relationship between the two countries has been sour for years over issues deeply rooted in history. South Korea demands Japan to take steps toward what Seoul regards as proper atonement for its wartime atrocities, while Tokyo insists all issues related to its 1910-45 colonial rule were settled in 1965 under a treaty that normalized bilateral ties in return for an economic aid package from Japan.Despite dominant pessimistic views that Seoul wonât be able to get what it wants from Tokyo from the summit, citing the complexity of sex slave issue, experts said the meeting would help the two country expand economic and regional security ties. Seoulâs push to revive the trilateral meeting is also significant in terms of improving ties for regional security and economic cooperation, they said, adding that the relationship between China and Japan is as important as that between Seoul and Tokyo.Cho Sei-young, a former career diplomat and an international relations professor at Dongseo University, said that the two sides should not press each other to produce a substantial outcome in their first summit.âThe two sides should not overdo themselves, they should rather maintain their composure in order to make the summit an opportunity to continue efforts for improved ties in the future. â¦ If they press each other too hard, things could go wrong,â he said.Professor Park Young-joon of Korea National Defense University agreed.âFor years, the bilateral relations have remained weak over the issue of sex slaves, but this summit is an opportunity for the two to start work again to promote trade and expand investment,â he said.The summit between Park and Abe had been widely predicted for several weeks, and was further confirmed during her official trip to Washington two weeks ago. There, Park said she was open to a one-on-one meeting with Abe on condition that it should be âmeaningfulâ in resolving pending issues including a proper apology to sex slaves.Parkâs proposal was welcomed by U.S. President Barack Obama, as Washington has been eager for the development of bilateral ties between Seoul and Tokyo, amid the growing economic and military power of China and North Koreaâs continued nuclear ambitions.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","bilateral summit monday in seoul ,summit monday in seoul paving ,first ever bilateral summit monday ,summit monday in seoul ,monday in seoul paving the","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Kim Kyoo - hyun', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'NHK', 'Kim', 'Beijing', 'Abe', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Cho Sei - young', 'Dongseo University', 'Park Young', 'Korea National Defense University', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Washington', 'Abe', 'Park âs', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'North Korea â', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.23729642  0.26115602

If they meet next week, a key focus of public attention will be the issue of Korean ""comfort women"" who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II.Seoul demands Tokyo acknowledge state responsibility for the crime and offer an apology and compensation to the victims, while Tokyo insists all issues related to its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula were settled under a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties in return for an economic aid package from Japan.Haruki Wada, emeritus professor of Tokyo University, called on Abe to clearly state his intention to resolve the issue during his meeting with Park.""If Prime Minister Abe says, 'Let's work for a solution. Let's hold talks,' I think our foreign ministries will be able to find a solution as there have been various proposed solutions in the past,"" Wada said in a phone interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""If Prime Minister Abe says so, Japanese public opinion may also change. The right wing may become angry, but I think others will react positively.""Tadashi Kimiya, a professor at Tokyo University, said he believes Abe should use his meeting with Park to explain why he raised the issue of wartime violations of women's human rights in his August address marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.""He should also talk about specific ways to resolve it,"" the professor said. ""The comfort women issue requires an apology in the sense that it was a violation of women's human rights in wartime.""Kan Kimura, a professor at the Graduate School of International Cooperation Studies at Kobe University, pointed out the irony in Abe's repeated pledges to uphold the apologies of previous Japanese administrations without offering his own.""The Japanese government's real wish is probably not to discuss the comfort women issue at all, but as it can't be left as it is forever, they should be thoroughly prepared,"" he said.

Speaking at a forum on public diplomacy among South Korea, China and Japan, Wang said cooperation among the three nations has been significantly undermined because of Japan's ""retrogression toward history."" ""If the issue of history is properly dealt with, cooperation among the three nations will move forward. If not, it will be inevitably halted,"" Wang said. ""We hope that the Japanese side can sincerely reflect upon all its past mistakes, directly make a clean break with its unbeautiful past, and take an entirely new approach to join hands with the people of China and South Korea,"" Wang said. South Korea, China and Japan last held a trilateral summit in May 2012. The annual event has been stalled since then, mainly due to a then-simmering territorial dispute between China and Japan, as well as Japan's lack of apologies over its atrocities during World War II.The upcoming trilateral summit paved the way for Park to hold her first one-on-one meeting with Abe. South Korean officials said Seoul has offered to hold a bilateral summit between Park and Abe on next Monday. Park and Abe have not held a one-on-one meeting since they took office about three years ago and one of the big obstacles is Abe's lack of apology for the sexual enslavement of Korean women by the Japanese military during World War II. Park has said she was open to holding a bilateral summit with Abe, but stressed that Japan must make progress in its efforts to resolve a long-standing grievance regarding the former sex slaves.Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Korean, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during the war. From 1910 to 1945, the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony.

It could also serve as a turning point in relations between the two countries that have frayed badly over history and territorial tensions.""We believe strong and constructive relations between all states supports regional peace and prosperity,"" Katina Adams, a spokesperson of the State Department's East Asia and Pacific Affairs Bureau, said in response to a Yonhap News Agency request for comment on Seoul's proposal of a summit.She did not elaborate.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have been badly strained for years, due mainly to Tokyo's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation, especially its sexual enslavement of women for its troops during World War II.The two countries held their last summit between then-President Lee Myung-bak and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in May 2012. Park and Abe have never held such a meeting as Tokyo has refused to accept Seoul's demand that it formally apologize to and compensate victims of its wartime sexual slavery.Frayed relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation, seen as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" initiative, aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.

The two-day consultations are being held with the three countriesâ one-star-level officials within the framework of their Defense Trilateral Talks, following a deputy-minister-level session last April. Seoulâs Defense Ministry dispatched Brig. Gen. Park Chul-kyun, director general for international policy, to the latest meeting. While assessing North Koreaâs rising nuclear and missile threats, the participants were expected to discuss the extent, conditions, procedure and other formalities linked with Japanâs possible exercise of its right to collective self-defense on the peninsula.The talks came two days after Seoulâs Defense Minister Han Min-koo and his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani clashed during their bilateral meeting over whether North Korea should be viewed as South Korean soil in case of a contingency. Han stressed the North is stipulated as South Korean territory under the Constitution and, thus, Tokyo must seek Seoulâs approval if the Self-Defense Forces were to carry out any operation there. In contrast, Nakatani argued that Seoulâs effective control is confined to the southern part of the truce line. âThe Japanese side reaffirmed that if it was to enter a foreign territory, it will get the countryâs consent, and our position is crystal clear that (North Korea) is South Korean land,â Seoulâs Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing Thursday. âDuring the working-level session in Tokyo, the three countries plan to confer on security issues of mutual interest,â he added, declining to mention the detailed agenda. The stark disparity in the two nationsâ views reflect unabated concerns here over Japanâs drive to expand its military role in line with a recent overturn of its pacifist constitution, which failed to entail any repentance toward its World War II atrocities.Seoulâs dilemma is deepening given Washingtonâs growing pressure â and its own needs â for greater three-way security collaboration to better counter Pyongyangâs threats. Another key issue will be how to prop up logistics support between the three partners such as by signing an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement, which enables militaries to provide services and supplies to each other more efficiently while on overseas missions.After efforts foundered to forge a two-way accord on intelligence sharing, the General Security of Military Information Agreement, South Korea and Japan clinched a trilateral arrangement involving the U.S. last December. During the ministerial talks, Nakatani once again floated the need for an ACSA, including within a trilateral structure, though Han dismissed it, saying it is premature given the lack of parliamentary and public support.

She is set to hold a summit with her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama on Friday to discuss ways to curb North Koreaâs nuclear ambition and to bolster the alliance to a higher level.The Pentagon visit was to include a meeting with Secretary of Defense Ash Carter to exchange their views on security of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia.Park is the second South Korean President to visit the Pentagon, after her predecessor President Lee Myung-bak. President Park Geun-hye pays a visit to NASA`s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland on Wednesday. YonhapLater in the afternoon, the South Korean leader was invited to the residence of U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden for an official lunch to reaffirm the solid alliance and forge fresh partnership for future. North Koreaâs nuclear weapon and its provocative actions are expected to be on the agenda.Since arriving in Washington on Tuesday, Park has been seeking a fresh momentum in the alliance to wipe off growing fears about Seoulâs cozy relationship with Beijing after she attended a Chinese military parade shunned by most of Western leaders.At a friendship dinner on Wednesday evening, Park stressed that South Korea is a reliable partner of the United States, calling the alliance a core of Washingtonâs rebalancing strategy toward the Asia-Pacific region.âSouth Korea and the U.S. are strongly bound to each other by common values and ideals of freedom, democracy and human rights,â Park said at a South Korea-U.S. friendship gathering in Washington.âThe alliance has been evolving and is dynamic, and together we are moving toward a brighter future.âSecretary of State John Kerry chimed in saying that the bilateral partnership focuses on shared values in a wide range of fields.âWe also recognize that ours has to be a dynamic partnership that focuses, as our citizens do, on issues of the future and particularly issues like clean energy, the need to address the challenge of climate change, and ensuring that we have smart rules in place to guarantee the preservation of open space and also a reliable and secure Internet,â he said in a speech at the gathering.Kerry also thanked Park for showing her commitment to the future, referring to her visit to NASAâs Goddard Space Center. Cheong Wa Dae said Park hopes to expand cooperation with the U.S. in space industry, particularly on South Koreaâs plan to develop a homegrown space rocket by 2020.In a separate meeting Park also called for close cooperation in research and development and engineering, stressing that Seoul is seeking innovation in manufacturing.âThe two countries can build up the technology and experiences that can lead to manufacturing innovation if they combine technology and excellent manpower,â Park said at a forum held to promote a bilateral partnership in the high-tech industry.Park also called for strengthened cooperation with the U.S. in space, new energy as well as health care and other high-tech areas.âI hope that South Korea will actively participate in space developmentâ by signing a deal with the U.S. on space cooperation, Park said.Consultations are underway between the two sides over a space cooperation agreement, according to the presidential office.By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent (christory@heraldcorp.com)","obama on friday to discuss ,south korean president to visit ,the pentagon on thursday morning ,president to visit the pentagon ,korean president to visit the","['WASHINGTON', 'south korean', ""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Pentagon', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Park âs', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'North Korea âs', 'Pentagon', 'Defense', 'Ash Carter', 'Park', 'south korean', 'Pentagon', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Park Geun', 'Goddard Space Flight Center', 'Maryland', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Joseph Biden', 'North Korea âs', 'Washington', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Kerry', 'NASA', 'Goddard Space Center', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'South Korea âs', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Korea Herald']",0,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.63690352  1.31222129

It will also involve heads of ethnic Korean groups there.It represents a sense of urgency among government officials here over unrelenting local crimes against Korean residents in the Philippines.Around 88,000 South Koreans live in the Southeast Asian country on a permanent basis, with more than one million others traveling there every year, according to official data.In particular, a number of elderly Koreans have headed to the English-speaking nation with lower consumer prices after retiring.They have become a target of such heinous crimes as burglary, kidnapping and murder.Nine Koreans have been murdered there this year alone. In the latest case, a couple was shot dead last week by an unidentified gunman who broke into their house in the Calabarzon region, south of Manila. A dilemma is that illegal guns are widespread in the Philippines. Some reports put the number at as many as one million.

""The visit will not improve the relationship, but they cannot afford to completely ignore each other,"" Sung was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Cui Zhiying, a professor of Korean affairs at Tongji University in Shanghai, also told the newspaper that Liu's visit suggested that the relationship between the two allies ""is not as bad as people had speculated."" ""Other than Pyongyang's nuclear program, the two nations do not have many grudges against each other,"" Cui said. Political ties between China and its only treaty ally, North Korea, remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in February 2013. However, few analysts believe that China will exert enough pressure on the North to give up its nuclear weapons because it could lead to the collapse of the North's regime and hurt China's national interests.Kim, who took power in 2011 following the death of his father, has yet to visit China.

The city will gather public opinion from visitors on how to use the mysterious site ahead of the expected official opening in October next year.Â  One of the bunker rooms, in Yeouido, Seoul, is arranged in its original setup in the 1970s complete with the sofa discovered at the scene. Photos and the video on the wall are displayed to show the history of the bunker. (Choi Jin-sung/The Korea Herald)Accidentally found in 2005 during the construction of a bus transfer station in Yeouido, the site has remained mysterious, as no official records are left to indicate who constructed the concealed bunker and why.The city, however, assumed that the bunker was used for security purposes for the president around 1977. The location of the bunker is where then-president Park Chung-hee stood during an Armed Forces Day event in 1977, officials said.The secret bunker comprises a 66-square-meter room with a sofa, shower room and restroom and a 595-square-meter machine room. Upon discovery, Seoul City designated the site as a future cultural asset in 2013, but actual monitoring and management have not been conducted. The city will also strengthen safety measures and install a heating system before the official opening. During the on-site safety check in March, the bunker received a âCâ grade, which indicated that the safety level was moderate and that it needs mild repairs and reinforcement.âBased on public opinion over how to utilize the bunker, the city will make the site a civic space while preserving the historical characteristics,â city officials said.About 1,200 citizens are expected to visit the site in the temporary opening event, they added.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","thursday the seoul metropolitan government ,historical underground bunker in seoul ,said thursday the seoul metropolitan ,thursday the seoul metropolitan ,the korea herald accidentally found","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Yeouido', 'Yeouido', 'Seoul', 'Choi Jin - sung', 'the Korea', 'Yeouido', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Armed Forces Day', 'Seoul City', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65203422  0.63136071

YonhapAlso attending were Serbian human rights advocate Srdja Popovic, Jimmy Wales Foundation CEO Orit Kopel, Venezuelan human rights advocate and film producer Thor Halvorssen, North Korea defector Ji Seong-ho and Korean lawyer Kim Tae-hoon.The group collectively stressed the âuniversalâ nature of the issue, arguing that it is everyoneâs responsibility to speak against the grave rights violations in North Korea and demand the South Korean government deal with the issue apolitically. âOur coalition aims to unite all efforts to get this long overdue bill approved, and provide moral and material support to those willing to make changes,â Kasparov said.Since being proposed by former Gyeonggi Provincial Gov. Kim Moon-soo in 2005, a bill for the Act has been gathering dust at Koreaâs parliament amid political gridlock. The opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has opposed the bill out of worries that it might provoke the hostile Pyongyang regime, proposing instead humanitarian assistance. According to lawyer Kim Tae-hoon, who leads a civil group dedicated to the cause, most of the billâs content has been agreed upon by the National Assemblyâs Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, but the key issue of establishing an archive center dedicated to recording Pyongyangâs human rights violations, similar to West Germanyâs Salzgitter Center, is at an impasse between the two parties. Over the last decade, Japan and the United States passed North Korean human rights acts, Canada established a North Korea human rights day and the United Nations has created a Special Rapporteur and Commission of Inquiry on the matter.(From left) Korean lawyer Kim Tae-hoon; North Korea defector Ji Seong-ho; Russian chess grandmaster, writer and political activist Garry Kasparov; Venezuelan human rights advocate and film producer Thor Halvorssen; Serbian human rights advocate Srdja Popovic; and Jimmy Wales Foundation CEO Orit Kopel. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldHalvorssen claimed that the South Korean government has been largely absent in the international coalition on this universal issue, adding that nonviolent action in the form of information, education and global attention can initiate bottom-up developments. If enacted, the act would institute a monitoring and documentation program modeled after Germanyâs unification experience, launch a campaign to educate South Koreaâs public and defector groups, increase humanitarian aid, dramatically boost the flow of information into the reclusive country and create high-level posts in the government for financial and administrative support.Halvorssen added that the National Human Rights Commission, the Ministry of Unification, the North Korean defector community and President Park Geun-hye have supported the bill. âI lived half of my conscious life under the bloody dictatorship of Slobodan Milosevic. My compassion for North Koreans comes from my knowledge of how it is to live in a country of fear,â said Popovic. âExactly 15 years ago, Serbian people launched a nonviolent movement that successfully ended the rule of Milosevic. My country is a very different place now as a democracy.âPopovic underscored that while it is the duty of people inside the country to topple their dictator, the job is much easier âwhen you know that you are not alone.âSerbiaâs successful transition to a democracy and market economy could not have been possible without the Serbian diaspora and defectors from the military who financially and politically supported their compatriots, he pointed out. Democratic allies provided radios that helped spread information about freedom outside, and in the end, the International Criminal Court prosecuted Milosevic and his gang, Popovic added.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speaks at a U.N. General Assembly session on Monday. (Yonhap)During a brief encounter with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of a luncheon at the U.N. headquarters in New York, President Park Geun-hye expressed her hope that they can meet in Seoul for a trilateral meeting that also involves their Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.âI am expecting (us) to meet in Seoul,â she said, after Abe said that he himself was looking forward to the trilateral summit, which is expected to take place in the South Korean capital in late October or early November. Abe also congratulated Park on the âsuccessfulâ summit between her and Chinese leader Xi earlier this month, and expressed his anticipation that her summit with U.S. President Barack Obama, slated for Oct. 16, would also be successful.The two leaders are expected to hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of the envisioned trilateral summit. Park has shunned the talks on the grounds that the summit would only reconfirm the yawning gaps in perception over history issues amid the lack of Tokyoâs will to settle them.Despite Washingtonâs calls for improvement in their relations, Park and Abe have not held a bilateral summit. They met for a trilateral summit, arranged by Obama in March 2014, and had brief encounters on several occasions, including one at the funeral of former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in March. While the mood was growing positive for her summit with Abe, Park maintained her stern position over Tokyoâs wartime misdeeds, including the sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.There is no path to unlocking the future, if the past is not acknowledged,â she said during her keynote speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, calling for a quick solution to bring âhealingâ to the surviving victims of wartime sexual slavery.âThis year marks the 15th anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, and the international community should do justice to the occasion by paying greater attention to sexual violence against women in conflict situations,â she said.âThe most compelling reason is the fact that only a few of the victims of brutal sexual violence during World War II are still alive today.âSeoul and Tokyo have held nine rounds of director-general-level talks over the victims of Japanâs sexual slavery, euphemistically called âcomfort women,â since April 2014. But they have yet to reach any agreement to address the issue.During her U.N. speech, Park also touched on Japanâs recently passed security legislation, stressing that it should be implemented transparently and in a way that is conducive to friendly relations among regional countries, and to peace and stability in the region.Â  Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan were to hold a trilateral meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. High on the agenda were joint efforts to deter North Korea from setting off additional provocations, including a long-range rocket launch and a fourth nuclear test.Pyongyang has hinted that it would launch a âsatelliteâ around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workersâ Party. It also vowed to continue to strengthen ânuclear deterrence,â raising speculation over its atomic test.On Wednesday, Seoul and Tokyo are to hold a bilateral meeting of their foreign ministers to discuss bilateral and regional issues including North Koreaâs nuclear and missile threats.

On Monday night, the North's space agency, the National Aerospace Development Administration, issued a statement laden with strong hints that the country could forge ahead with a satellite launch to mark the anniversary. That marks the first time Pyongyang's has mentioned such a possibility.The agency said its rocket and satellite scientists, who succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit aboard a long-range rocket in late 2012, are working hard to commemorate next month's anniversary with even greater scientific achievements than the 2012 launch.""The world will clearly see a series of satellites of (North) Korea soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea,"" the KCNA reported in an English statement.The North's agency also said that it is putting final touches on efforts to develop a new earth observation satellite for weather forecasts, and claimed it made big strides in efforts to research into geostationary satellites that are considered more difficult than other satellites.""The DPRK's satellite launch is also a peaceful project, pursuant to its sci-tech development plan for building an economic power and improving the people's standard of living,"" the North said. ""Space development for peaceful purposes is a sovereign state's legitimate right recognized by international law and the Party and the people of the DPRK are fully determined to exercise this right no matter what others may say about it,"" it said.In Washington, the U.S. said any satellite launch by the North would be a violation of U.N. resolutions.""There are multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that require North Korea to suspend all activity related to their ballistic missile program, and establish a moratorium on missile launches, stop conducting any launches using ballistic missile technology and abandon its ballistic missile program in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said.""So any satellite launch using ballistic missile technology is a clear violation"" of U.N. resolutions, he said.Pyongyang has long been accused of using long-range rocket launches as a pretext for test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same with differences only in payloads.A satellite launch, if carried out, is sure to increase tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula, spark international condemnations and pour cold water on the recent conciliatory mood created between the two Koreas, including their plans to hold reunions of families separated by the Korean War.But a diplomatic source in Washington said that chances of the North launching a satellite around the anniversary are not high as there is not much time left to make preparations. The North has not brought a rocket into the launch site yet, he said.""As of September 6th, it appeared that there was no rocket present at the launch tower,"" the source told Yonhap News Agency on condition of anonymity, referring to the North's recently upgraded Sohae Satellite Launching Station on the country's northwest coast.""There is an outside chance it is being hidden there under an environmental cover but odds are there is nothing there. Nor are there any other signs at the facility of launch preparations. And it's only three weeks until the anniversary,"" he said.It is also unclear why the North bothered to issue the statement.Joel Wit, editor of the website 38 North, said that Monday's statement could be just designed to ""stir the pot and to continue to assert the DPRK's right to peaceful exploration of outer space.""Ken Gause, a senior North Korea analyst at CNA Corp., said the statement could be part of an attempt to gain an upper hand ahead of reconciliation talks with South Korea.""This is to put pressure on the upcoming talks with the ROK,"" the expert said, referring to the peace agreement the two Koreas reached last month, where the sides agreed to end the military standoff and hold government-to-government talks to discuss improving relations.

Friday night's performance will be attended by Hwang, France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius and culture minister Fleur Pellerin, among others.The music that Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) kings used in ancestral memorial ceremonies at Jongmyo Shrine in downtown Seoul became the first Korean item on UNESCO's list of intangible world heritage along with the ancestral ritual in 2001.South Korea plans to play the ritual piece in full, employing 120 people, including 50 musicians and 35 dancers. This will be the first time that the musical piece is performed in full outside of South Korea, although a brief version of it was staged in Japan in 2000 and Italy and Germany in 2007.The performance of Jongmyo Jeryeak was also designated as the national theater's 2015-2016 season opener. It will be performed at the 1,250-seat theater before audiences.Also on Friday, there will be a spectacular light show that projects colorful lights featuring the Korean national flag Taegukgi on the iconic Eiffel Tower.The opener will be followed by performances of traditional and contemporary Korean music ranging from pansori, a traditional Korean narrative song, to jazz and electronics and exhibitions of visual artworks ranging from crafts, fashion and design to photographs in public theaters, museums, exhibition halls and various other places in major French cities, such as Paris, Nantes, Marseille, Lyon and Nice.The Forum Des Images, the centerpiece of Paris' film archives, will screen 76 Korean films that have the South Korean capital Seoul as a main theme.There also will be a festival of Korean street food and culture in Paris on Sept. 25-27.""We prepared to raise the French people's understanding of Korea's unique and deep-rooted culture and to enable them to experience Korean culture in their daily lives,"" Choe Jun-ho, music director of the South Korean organizing committee, was quoted as saying in a release from the culture ministry.

(Graphic by Han Chang-duk, The Korea Herald)With screaming children becoming the bane of many restaurants, South Korea is seeing a growing number of child-free venues in recent years. Many of them impose an outright ban on children by putting up signs like âNo children under age 7 allowedâ on their doors.The emergence of child-free venues dates back a few years, when restaurants and cafes in the capitalâs hip districts such as the Hongdae and Gangnam areas began to close doors to children, mostly due to growing complaints about noisy kids in the public space.Â Soon, the trend spread to other metropolitan cities.âSome mothers changed their babiesâ diapers in the cafe and the children spilled drinks on the floor, which turned other customers away,â the owner of a child-free cafe in Daegu said. âI couldnât satisfy all the customers. I had to make a choice.â The cafe lost some customers, but gained a regular clientele. âOur cafe respects those without children who come to get their work done or relax,â she said.An owner of a top-notch restaurant in Cheongdam-dong, an affluent part of Seoul, said that it shut kids out for the sake of other customers paying large sums of money for an exclusive, romantic experience.Indeed, a poll by Albamon, an online part-time job recruitment site, on the staff members of eateries showed that 7 out of 10 of them were in favor of kid-free establishments.While the current Korean law does not stipulate regulations on businessesâ choice of selectively accepting customers, a series of past court decisions were deemed to have contributed to the growing number of kid-free venues.Â  In 2013, the Busan Central District Court ruled that a restaurant owner and waiter should take 70 percent of the responsibility for a 10-year-old child, who had suffered a burn after the waiter bumped into the kid and spilled hot soup on him. They were ordered to pay 41 million won ($34,700).The ruling stoked debate, with some suggesting the childâs parents should also be held accountable for not looking after him.Now, the spreading no-kids zone is sparking further controversy, with some raising concerns about it egging societal aversion toward children, while others welcome the concept as an inevitable guideline not particularly against children, but their parents.âI am also a parent, but I see the need for kid-free venues as there is an increasing number of parents who disturb others in public by failing to properly discipline their children,â said Joo Hee-sun, a working mother of two aged 5 and 7 residing in Seoul. The 36-year-old mother said she could easily sympathize with others irritated by the sound of infant tantrums when dining in expensive restaurants.âI back the idea, though I am against generalizing all mothers for the few problematic ones. I am also a little bit bitter that only children are subject to such exclusion from the public space,â she said.Â âIf we are to openly discuss no-kid zones, we should also bring in âno-drunk zonesâ against drunken adults creating a ruckus and disturbing others.â Kim Min-kyung, a 37-year-old mother of two children aged 2 and 6, also supported the concept of kid-free zones.âNo-kid zones should be called more like a no-irresponsible parents zone,â Kim said, lashing out at ill-mannered parents turning a blind eye to their childrenâs misbehavior.âThe self-centered parents do not seem to make enough efforts to teach their children how to behave in public, and they get often offended when others ask them to keep their kids quiet,â she said.âThey should take the blame for making their own innocent kids be treated like a nuisance in society.âThe reason behind parents overly respecting their children, or âhelicopter-parentingâ them, is related to the chronically low birthrate with more parents having children less and later in their lives, an expert said.Â  âWith over-parenting becoming a common culture in society, people started to take matters into their own hands by supporting kid-free zones,â said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor at Cheonbuk National University. The number of children the average Korean woman can expect to have during her lifetime â the fertility rate â currently stands at 1.25, the lowest among OECD countries. âThe problem of overprotection also stems from young parents lacking a chance to learn about traditional Korean manners and etiquette as they grew up in smaller, nuclear families,â he added.The phenomenon has even brewed an infamous moniker âMomchoongâ on cyberspace, referring to the moms refusing to discipline the children in consideration of others. It is a combined word of mother and insect. The term is quite controversial not only because it disparages overprotective mothers but also because it doesnât reflect the existence of mollycoddling fathers, the motherÂ Kim Min-kyung noted.âI cannot deny that some mothers tend to overprotect their children, but I think that the term reflects prevalent discrimination against women online,â she said. âThere are also fathers who are more aggressive when it comes to protecting their children.âWith such negative connotation more liberally being placed on children in general, some have also started to voice concerns about the impact.âHow is a kid-free venue different from an apartheid?â said Kim Hwi-rin, a mother of two kids aged 2 and 7. âIt is discrimination against children.â Rather than excluding children from the public life, businesses should become more kid-friendly to keep them from causing a scene, the 37-year-old working mother suggested. âFor instance in the U.S., restaurants would offer my children a kit full of crayons and papers to keep them occupied and happy,â Kim said.Kwak Keum-joo, a psychology professor at Seoul National University, also pointed out that presence of kid-free zones segregating children is a reflection of societyâs immaturity.âThe existence of child-free zones itself could signal that children are not welcome in this society, deterring the younger generation from having babies,â Kwak said. âIt is worrisome as such segregation could evolve into other types of discrimination against certain genders, age groups and the physically disabled.âBy Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","child free cafe in daegu ,babies diapers in the cafe ,sunny saturday afternoon kim min ,kid and spilled hot soup ,other metropolitan cities some mothers","['Kim Min - jin', 'Samcheong - dong', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Graphic', 'Han Chang - duk', 'South Korea', 'Hongdae', 'Gangnam', 'Daegu', 'Cheongdam - dong', 'Seoul', 'Albamon', 'korean', 'the Busan Central District Court', 'Joo Hee - sun', 'Seoul', 'Kim Min - kyung', 'Kim', 'Seol Dong - hoon', 'Cheonbuk National University', 'korean', 'OECD', 'korean', 'Momchoong', 'Kim Min - kyung', 'Kim Hwi - rin', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'Kwak Keum - joo', 'Seoul National University', 'Kwak', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.6665585   0.43457296

In her keynote speech to the Seoul Defense Dialogue, she pointed to what she called the Asian paradox as a threat to global peace â regional instability stemming from the perennial standoff on the peninsula and persistent territorial and historical spats between neighbors, despite growing economic interdependence. âThere have been efforts to promote closer exchanges among the countries in the region with a focus on the economy, but still not in the making is a mechanism for security cooperation that could help tackle tension and establish peace and stability,â Park said. âToday we cannot achieve peace and stability with the efforts of some countries, but only through international cooperation built on trust.â In a bid to resolve the challenges, Seoul has been seeking to foster global partnerships, chiefly on emerging unconventional security issues such as climate change, health, nuclear nonproliferation and antiterrorism. The drive is in line with its Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative, a long-term confidence-building process among neighbors including North Korea, envisioned to deal first with nonpolitical matters and ultimately progress to hard security cooperation.But the division of the peninsula and persistent cross-border threats remain the biggest stumbling block, highlighted once again by a recent flare-up in tension. âA unification of the two Koreas will mark a fundamental solution to North Koreaâs nuclear and human rights problems, end the history of the Cold War in the 20th century and provide a groundbreaking growth engine for global prosperity by making it possible to link Northeast Asia and Eurasia,â Park added, calling for multinational security cooperation to realize the vision. Launched by the Defense Ministry in 2012, the vice-ministerial conference brought together Some 250 senior defense policymakers, military executives and academics from around 30 countries and four international agencies for a three-day run. Under the theme, â70 years of the Post-WWII Era and the Division of Korea,â the participants will explore the prospect of the peninsulaâs unification and its potential impact on regional security, as well as unabated historical and territorial tensions in Northeast Asia and ways to defuse them.They are also forecast to analyze emerging cybersecurity challenges and the outlook for global cooperation, while addressing constant regional maritime conflicts such as over islands in the East China and South China Seas, exclusive economic zones, continental shelf delineation, and air defense zones.âReunification would set the conditions for an enduring peace on the peninsula by removing a source of potential regional conflict,â David Helvey, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, said in a speech summary released ahead of the event.â(Following Korean reunification) the emerging security architecture might be a hybrid mechanism designed to promote cooperative solutions to nontraditional or transnational threats existing alongside/on top of a more traditional, self-help and alliance-based architecture for managing hard security adapted to the new realities of Northeast Asian security dynamics.â Lim Jong-in, President Park Geun-hyeâs special adviser on security and dean of Korean Universityâs Graduate School of Information Security, stressed the rising need for states to beef up their cybersecurity capabilities while fostering international cooperation for better responses. âAs one of the most serious threats that most states face, cyberthreats are getting more sophisticated and targeted,â he said. âTo deter the rapid growth of cyberthreats, it is important for each state to build its own capacities and yet cooperate internationally.â Other attendees include Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong, former Japanese Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto, Edmond Mulet, assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations at the U.N.; and Martin Libicki, a professor at the RAND Graduate School in the U.S. Han Min-koo, Seoulâs defense minister, also delivered an address. Three special sessions are scheduled to take place to discuss defense cooperation for global health security, violent extremism, and nuclear nonproliferation, respectively. On the sidelines, working-level officials from the 30 countries plan to hold separate talks on cybersecurity, while another meeting on Northeast Asia will bring together six countries â South Korea, the U.S., China, Japan, Russia and Mongolia.

The other ministers were from the U.S., Finland and Indonesia. The event, attended by public health authorities from 47 countries as well as the World Health Organization, was held about a month after Korea announced the de facto end to its Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. The health crisis claimed 36 lives here.Â The announcement of the action packages came a day after Korean President Park Geun-hye shared her plans to spend $100 million to support 13 developing countries to fight infectious disease in the next five years. South Korean Health Minister Chung Chin-youb (second from left) speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapâRecent global outbreaks have enlightened the world that infectious diseases are not solely a public health problem of developing countries,â the announcement of the action packages, officially titled the Seoul Declaration, said.âRather, public health crisis can have serious social, economic, and political implications on a national, regional and international scale. Therefore, global health security should be understood as a shared, multisectoral responsibility that no single country, organization or sector can achieve alone in every area of our lives.â The 11 action package targets include antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic disease, biosafety and biosecurity, immunization, a national laboratory system, real-time surveillance, reporting, workforce development, emergency operations centers, linking public health law and multisectoral rapid response and medical countermeasures and personnel deployment.Upon the release of the declaration, each and every participating country vowed to eventually provide at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine to 95 percent of their 15-month-old population and establish a public health emergency operations center to better detect public health emergencies. Korea recently announced the formation of such an agency as the nationâs post-MERS plan to better deal with infectious disease threats.The declaration also recommended the participating country have at least one trained field epidemiologist for every 200,000 people.The Korean government had been heavily criticized for its initial response to the MERS outbreak earlier this year, especially for refusing to share the list of MERS-affected hospitals for more than two weeks after the index case was confirmed in May. The Seoul Declaration required participating countries to adopt timely and accurate disease reporting according to WHO requirements.On Monday, Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stressed the importance of timely and transparent information release when dealing with health emergencies. âThe CDC is one of the most trusted organizations in the country (the U.S.),â he said. âAnd thatâs because people know we are going to tell the truth even if itâs going to make them feel uncomfortable. ... And if we donât know something we are not afraid to say we donât know and hereâs how we are going to find out.âBy Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","conference in seoul on wednesday ,health emergencies korea recently announced ,wednesday announced 11 global health ,day after korean president park ,in seoul on wednesday yonhap","['Korea', 'the Global Health Security Agenda High - Level Meeting', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Finland', 'Indonesia', 'the World Health Organization', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Park Geun', 'south Korean', 'Chung Chin - youb', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'korean', 'who', 'Thomas Frieden', 'the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'U.S.', 'Claire Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16518407  0.61673617

An applicant consults officials at the Korean Red Cross headquarters in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)The talks at South Koreaâs Peace House in the border village of Panmunjeom came after they agreed last month to hold the reunions around Chuseok, a major Korean holiday that falls on Sept. 27, as part of a comprehensive deal to defuse military tensions.Lee Deok-haeng, an executive committee member of the South Korean Red Cross, led his three-member delegation, while the other side was represented by Park Yong-il, a senior member of the North Korean Red Cross.âWe will do our best to live up to your expectations and hopes,â Lee told the press before the talks began in the morning to determine the date, venue, scale and other details of the reunions that have not been held since February 2014 amid cross-border tensions.The South Korean side pushed to put a series of issues on the agenda, including exchanging lists of the surviving members of families divided after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, allowing the families to exchange letters and meet through video links and holding the reunions on a regular basis.Seoul has regarded the issue of the separated families as an urgent humanitarian one, a reason President Park Geun-hye proposed during her Aug. 15 Liberation Day speech that the two Koreas work together to identify those with loved ones across the border. Last Tuesday, the Southâs Red Cross began its survey of surviving members of the separated families. It presumes more than 66,000 people, including around 1,060 South Korean nationals living abroad, remain alive.Seoul apparently hoped to hold the reunions at Mount Geumgangsan before Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Northâs ruling Workersâ Party, around which time observers say the North could set off provocations to strengthen national unity and show off its military presence.As the Red Cross talks began, hopes rose that the talks would lead to more cross-border dialogue to help improve bilateral ties that have continued to deteriorate with Pyongyangâs provocative acts and adherence to its nuclear program, and Seoulâs harsh reactions to them.The meeting was the first since the Aug. 25 deal under which the two Koreas agreed to conduct a set of measures to reduce tensions and improve relations, including holding government-level talks and bolstering exchanges in various civil sectors. Calling for the withdrawal of U.S. forces in the South, Pyongyangâs Foreign Ministry said Monday that the Aug. 25 deal showed the ability of the two Koreas to safeguard peace on the peninsula by themselves.âWe will gravely hold the U.S. responsible should another armed clash take place again for no reason in the future due to the U.S. refusing to withdraw its forces and staging provocative military acts,â said the Northâs ministry in a statement carried by the Northâs official Korean Central News Agency.Meanwhile, Kim Gunn, director general for North Korean nuclear affairs at Seoulâs Foreign Ministry, met with his visiting Chinese counterpart Xiao Qian to discuss an array of North Korea-related issues including the reclusive stateâs persistent pursuit of nuclear arms.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","monday to arrange the reunions ,in seoul on monday yonhap ,cross talks monday to arrange ,headquarters in seoul on monday ,reunions on regular basis seoul","['Koreas', 'Red Cross', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'Seoul', 'South Korea âs', 'korean', 'Lee Deok - haeng', 'the south korean Red Cross', 'Park Yong - il', 'the north korean Red Cross', 'Lee', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Koreas', 'the South âs Red Cross', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'North âs', 'Workers â Party', 'the Red Cross', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'North âs', 'North âs', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'Kim Gunn', 'north korean', 'Seoul âs Foreign Ministry', 'chinese', 'Xiao Qian', 'North Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50890714  0.26213422

Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldOver the years, Malaysia and Korea have advanced cooperation through ASEAN, the United Nations, commerce and culture. People-to-people relations have become closer through tourism, marriage and Korean TV dramas, songs and fashion that have become sensational across much of Asia. Shin Dong-ik, the Ministry of Foreign Affairsâ Deputy Minister for Multilateral and Global Affairs, said: âMalaysia holds a special place in my heart because it was my second post abroad in the early 1990s, a time when Malaysia announced its âVision 2020â to become an advanced industrialized nation.âShin added, âSince then, Malaysia has transformed itself as a financial and economic hub of Southeast Asia. Endowed with excellent human and natural resources, Malaysia is set to become a major regional powerhouse with a vibrant multiracial, multiethnic and multicultural society.âMalaysia this year was ranked the 18th top country in the world by the World Bank Group for ease of doing business. Bloomberg rated Malaysia the worldâs fifth-most promising emerging market, the only ASEAN country included in the top 10 list. Malaysia is Koreaâs fourth-largest trade partner and third-largest investment partner from ASEAN. The two-way trade, currently over $20 billion, is expected to grow, bolstered by the ASEAN-Korea free trade agreement that entered into force in September 2009 and the ASEAN Economic Community scheduled to be launched in December this year. Korean President Park Geun-hye and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Rajak met at the ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit in Busan last year.The deputy minister pointed to the âsecond waveâ of the Look East Policy launched by the government of Prime Minister Najib last year, which seeks to boost trade and industrial cooperation with Korea in information and communications technology, green technology, health sciences, automotive and research and development. Concerning the disappearance and shoot-down of Malaysian airlines MH370 and MH17 last year, Shin also conveyed the âgreat sympathy and sorrowâ felt by the Korean government and people, as Korea had experienced similar calamities in the past. Malaysia is a major international travel destination with tourism making up the third largest source of foreign exchange. Malaysia offers sun-drenched beaches, tropical weather and abundant wildlife, as well as shopping, gastronomy and modern attractions in bustling megalopolises. According to the World Tourism Organization, Malaysia had 27.4 million tourists last year, making it the 12th most visited nation in the world. It was also chosen as one of the worldâs top retirement destinations, thanks to generous visas granting up to 10 years of residence to foreigners, kind local culture and year-round sunshine.

Sara Raza Khan, who flew from Lahore for the event, sang various national songs throughout the three-hour affair, joined by her compatriots who tirelessly sang and danced.Â  Participants pose at the Pakistani national day reception in Seoul on Aug. 30 (Pakistani embassy)2015 marks the 68th anniversary of Pakistanâs independence and the 70th for Korea. The two countries celebrate it one day apart -- Pakistan on Aug. 14 and Korea on Aug. 15. âWe deeply appreciate the generosity and hospitality of the Korean government toward the Pakistani community here of 11,000 people,â the ambassador told The Korea Herald. âOur community happily lives in Korea, with many Pakistani men married to Korean women. Our multicultural families are the strongest bridge between our countries.âPakistan and Korea have an âexcellent relationshipâ that is moving on an upward trajectory, the ambassador stressed, noting that a prefeasibility study for a bilateral free trade agreement will be carried out. To boost trade and tourism, the embassy is also making efforts to create a direct air link between the two countries, he added. Pointing to the principles of âunity, faith and disciplineâ advocated by Pakistanâs founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Khan said he urged his countrymen to adhere to these values here and bring the two countries closer. Lee, 38, of the ruling Saenuri Party, said in a speech, âPeople who donât know me may wonder how a non-Korean-looking person can be a member of Koreaâs parliament.ââItâs been a very difficult and adventurous life for me, but I hope there will be more people like me who will represent Koreaâs immigrant communities either through the National Assembly or local council,â she added.Lee was born in the Philippines and became the first foreign-born naturalized lawmaker in April 2012. Before her political career, she worked as an actress and TV host. A multiculturalism advocate, she regularly gives public lectures on the subject.

The United States decided to have its ambassador to China attend the ceremony, rather than sending a senior official from Washington.Â Â During the ceremony, Xi spoke of China's commitment to peaceful development as he announced that China will slash the number of its troops by 300,000.Â ""We Chinese love peace. No matter how much stronger it may become, China will never seek hegemony or expansion. It will never inflict its past suffering on any other nation,"" Xi said, according to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency.Â Â After the parade, Park attended a luncheon reception Xi hosted for heads of state and other dignitaries. China provided an exclusive waiting room for Park ahead of the reception, in the latest sign Beijing is taking extra care of Park.Â Â She later left for Shanghai, the second and last stop on her trip to China.Â Â Park's decision to attend the ceremony has drawn some criticism that South Korea may be tilting toward China, but it underscores Seoul's latest attempt to secure Beijing's cooperation in persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.Â Â China is believed to have significant leverage over North Korea, which has long been dependent on Chinese diplomatic support and economic aid.Â Â At Wednesday's summit talks, Park and Xi warned North Korea against conducting missile and nuclear tests, in the latest strong message against Pyongyang. Â Â Choe Ryong-hae, a key confidant to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was in Beijing for the military parade.Â Â Kim has never visited China since taking power in late 2011, following the sudden death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in a symbolic move that reveals the strained relations between the two traditional allies.Â Â On Wednesday, Park and Choe attended a welcoming banquet hosted by Xi for dignitaries, though Park did not encounter Choe, presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said.Â Â Park met Putin at the banquet and exchanged opinions on bilateral relations and the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office, said, without elaborating.

""The alliance is evolving into a global partnership, and my government is very happy about the state of affairs between the two countries.""The senator agreed that the alliance is strong, saying he looks forward to an even stronger partnership from an economic and security perspective.""I'm excited about the opportunities we have for global leadership opportunities together,"" he said.Cho noted Park's upcoming visit to Washington in October, saying the two countries are ""working together to make the most of this visit.""Gardner recalled that Park's first visit to the U.S. in May 2013 was ""very well received"" during his term in the House of Representatives.""Certainly the people of the United States are looking forward to the visit as well,"" he said.Aside from alliance issues, the two sides discussed the situation with North Korea, including its nuclear weapons development, officials said.Cho expressed concern over North Korea's recent landmine explosion inside the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas, saying South Korea and the U.S. have maintained a strong joint defense posture against the communist state and remain in close cooperation over the North's nuclear threats, according to the Foreign Ministry.The Aug. 4 explosion left two South Korean soldiers seriously injured, raising tensions on the Korean Peninsula to a new high.Cho also noted South Korea's efforts to join the international campaign against human rights violations in the North, saying it plans to actively support the work of a U.N. office that opened in Seoul in June with the aim of monitoring and documenting human rights abuses by Pyongyang.Gardner agreed on the importance of resolving issues related to North Korea, adding that his subcommittee will continue to take an interest in them.In May, Gardner introduced a bill calling for redesignating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism and additional sanctions on the communist regime.The following month, he also initiated a resolution welcoming Park's visit to Washington, which was scheduled for mid-June before being postponed due to the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea.Garner said he plans to reintroduce the resolution ahead of Park's October visit.On the continued historical and territorial disputes between South Korea and Japan, Cho explained the government's policy of maintaining a principled approach to historical issues while actively pursuing cooperation in other areas.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's statement last week marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II left much to be desired, but South Korea will continue to work to develop future-oriented ties with the neighboring nation, Cho added.Gardner took note of South Korea's leadership in improving ties with Japan by exercising restraint over the Abe statement, the ministry said.

The Korea-China free trade deal, which has yet to be ratified, will cover goods produced at the Kaesong complex, which was opened in 2004 as a landmark symbol of rapprochement between South and North Korea.

(Yonhap)In her Liberation Day speech, she said the much-anticipated statement âdid not quite live up to Koreansâ expectations.â But she noted that it was âhigh timeâ for the two neighbors to move forward to a new future âguided by a correct view of history.ââWe sincerely hope that Japan will come forward and forge shared peace in Northeast Asia, as an open-hearted neighbor,â she told a gathering of some 3,000 attendees including bereaved families of the nationâs independence fighters, political leaders and foreign dignitaries.âWe look to the Japanese government to match with consistent and sincere actions its declaration that the view of history articulated by its previous cabinets will be upheld, and thereby win the trust of its neighbors and the international community.âHer tone reflected a subtle change from her previous major public speeches regarding Tokyoâs views of history. In the past, she used to press Tokyo to âsquarely face historyâ and warn that its lack of atonement for wartime atrocities would lead to its diplomatic isolation.Touching on the issue of Korean victims who were forced into sexual servitude by Japan during World War II, Park urged the Japanese government to resolve the issue in a âspeedy and proper way.â The number of surviving Korean victims, whose average age is 89, stands at only 47 -- the reason why Seoul has stressed the urgency of the wartime human rights issue.âHistory cannot be hidden, but rather lives on through the testimony of surviving witnesses,â she said.Abeâs statement on Friday has been discounted by South Koreans as insincere and vaguely worded as he used the past tense while referring to the four key expressions they wanted to see in his speech: colonial rule, aggression, apology and remorse.The day after the statement was issued, Seoulâs Foreign Ministry issued a thinly-veiled criticism of Abe, saying that his statement laid bare the kind of historical views the Japanese government holds on its past colonial rule and aggression.Park also used her speech to call on Pyongyang to come out for a dialogue on its denuclearization and stop its provocative acts. She urged the North to work together to address the humanitarian issue of the families separated across the border, and proposed exchanges of the lists of separated family members.âThe government will respond firmly to any and all North Korean provocations that jeopardize the safety and security of our people,â she said. âNorth Korea must break free of the delusion that it will sustain its system through provocative acts and belligerence.

Two years later, then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama acknowledged and apologized for the suffering his country inflicted on neighboring nations, including Korea, through its aggressions in the early part of the 20th century.Park's comments came a day after Abe said Tokyo ""has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war.""Park also pressed Japan to resolve the issue of the elderly Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan's World War II soldiers -- one of the knottiest issues between the two countries.Â (Yonhap)The issue of the sex slaves has gained urgency as the victims are dying off. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were sexually enslaved by Japanese troops during World War II.In Tokyo, Haruko Arimura, the minister in charge of women's empowerment, visited a controversial shrine, which honors millions of Japan's war dead, including 14 convicted World War II criminals.Abe instead sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine through one of his aides to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, Japanese media reported.South Korea and China view the Yasukuni Shrine as a symbol of Japan's past imperialism. Japan controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.Also Saturday, Park warned of retaliation against North Korea for its possible provocations, but she also called for cooperation to promote peace on the divided peninsula.South Korea ""will sternly deal with any North Korean provocations,"" Park said in the speech, adding that provocations and threats will only result in North Korea's isolation and destruction.Park's warning came hours after North Korea threatened to carry out ""indiscriminate strikes"" on South Korea unless Seoul halts anti-Pyongyang broadcasts along their border.South Korea resumed the propaganda broadcasts on Aug. 10 in retaliation against a land mine explosion inside the demilitarized zone that left two South Korean soldiers severely injured. South Korea has accused the North of planting the mines in violation of the Armistice Agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.On Friday, North Korea's powerful National Defense Commission denied Pyongyang's involvement in the land mine attack and demanded that Seoul provide solid proof.

He did not offer a fresh apology of his own, saying ""Japan has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war.""In 1995, then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued a landmark statement in which he expressed ""deep remorse"" and a ""heartfelt apology"" for the suffering his country caused to many nations, especially those in Asia.Two years earlier, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono acknowledged the military's involvement in forcing hundreds of thousands of Korean and other Asian women to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during the war.Abe's statement revealed to the international community ""the historical view with which the current Japanese government sees its past of colonial rule and aggression,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement released a day after the premier's speech.South Korea, however, ""takes note"" of the fact that Abe upheld the position of previous Cabinets and will watch how Japan demonstrates that position through action, it said.The ministry also urged the Japanese government ""to work more actively"" for the quick resolution of pending historical issues between the two countries, including the issue of the sex slaves.South Korea has demanded that Japan acknowledge state responsibility for the sex slavery and properly compensate the 47 surviving South Korean victims, but Tokyo insists the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties.""The government plans to continue its firm response to issues related to history, while continuing to strengthen cooperation on reciprocal areas such as the North Korean nuclear issue, the economy and society and culture as well as regional cooperation for the peace and prosperity of Northeast Asia,"" the ministry said.

Abe is to deliver a major speech in Tokyo on Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.Â Â Keen attention is being paid to Abe's wordings on Japan's wartime past amid doubts about his perception of history.Â Â ""It's important to speak from the heart,"" Hatoyama, who once led the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan,told Yonhap News Agency while in South Korea for an international forum on East Asia peace. The DPJ is a rival of Abe's governing Liberal Democratic Party.Â Â Hatoyama urged Abe to honor the 1995 Murayama Statement and repeat key words in it himself.Â Â Commemorating the 50th anniversary, then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued a clear apology for what Japan did during its imperialistic era.Â Â ""Through its colonial rule and aggression, (Japan) caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations,"" he said. ""In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.""Â Â It has been the clearest expression of contrition by Japan's government for its wartime wrongdoings. But Abe's stance on the statement remains dubious.Â Â Abe needs to use his address to dispel doubts about his historical views, Hatoyama said.He also voiced concern over the lack of trilateral summit talks among South Korea, Japan and China.Â Â ""Japan's leader is quite responsible for that, albeit not entirely,"" he said. ""Japan and South Korea also should hold a summit as early as possible to improve their relations.""Â Â Hatoyama added that the ""comfort women"" issue has not been resolved yet. Â Â ""Japan has to push for new measures, in any form, to address the human rights and ethical matter,"" he said.Â Â Hundreds of thousands of women, mostly from Korea but also from other Asian countries, were forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese troops during World War II, while Korea was under Japan's colonial rule.

(Yonhap)But it is still not clear whether she will meet with the North's leader who invited Lee to visit.Lee's visit is in the spotlight on the hopes that it may help ease lingering tension on the divided peninsula, sparked by the North's nuclear and missile tests. The two Koreas have not held high-level talks since February 2014.As her visit to the North is for humanitarian purposes, Lee delivered knitted scarves and medicine to North Korean children, according to the peace center.There is still the expectation that she could deliver a message of peace and reconciliation if she meets with the North's young leader during her visit, experts say.Lee's late husband, who died in 2009, was the architect of the ""sunshine"" policy that actively pushed for cross-border exchanges and reconciliation. He held the first inter-Korean summit with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2000. At that time, she accompanied her husband to Pyongyang.She briefly met with the North's current leader in December 2011 when she visited Pyongyang to pay tribute upon the death of his father Kim Jong-il. But the trip was limited to offering condolences and no other matters were discussed at that time.The two Koreas are set to celebrate Liberation Day which falls on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of their liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.But it is highly likely that the two sides will not hold a joint event to celebrate the anniversary.The North has rejected the South's proposal for inter-Korean talks, calling on Seoul to end its joint military exercise with Washington and lift its economic sanctions against the North.

South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (left) shakes hands with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov before their talks on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Malaysia on Wednesday. (Yonhap)During the separate meetings with Wang Yi of China and Sergey Lavrov of Russia, Yun called for their active roles to bring the North back to the dialogue table and pressure it to take the path of denuclearization.Lowering the bar for the resumption of the long-stalled multilateral denuclearization talks, Seoul has called on Pyongyang to show up for unconditional âexploratory talks,â but the communist regime has rejected the overture. Seoul previously demanded that Pyongyang first take âsincere stepsâ toward its denuclearization for the resumption of the six-party talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia.Following last monthâs landmark deal over Iranâs nuclear program, Seoul has been striving harder to create momentum to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, with U.S. and Chinese officials citing the deal as a good model for resolving complicated international issues âthrough diplomacy.âDuring Yunâs meetings with the Chinese and Russian counterparts, the issue of the U.S.â potential deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense asset might have also been discussed, observers noted, given that Beijing and Moscow have repeatedly voiced opposition to it, citing an impact on their security interests. The issue of the escalating territorial disputes in the South China Sea, involving China, could also be touched on during bilateral and multilateral meetings there as it is one of the thorniest regional issues.Apart from the denuclearization issue, Yun also focused on deterring North Korean provocations as speculation is growing that the North may engage in provocative acts such as a long-range rocket launch around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Northâs ruling Workersâ Party.North Koreaâs Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong also attended the ARF and other ASEAN-related meetings. Ri held bilateral talks with his counterparts from Russia, Pakistan and other nations. He was also expected to meet with Chinese Minister Wang Yi and others while in Malaysia.At a dinner reception on Wednesday, the South Korean and North Korean ministers were expected to have an encounter, albeit unofficially. Surrounded by a throng of reporters, Ri indicated the possibility of his meeting with Yun, saying, âDonât be too hasty as we have ample time, much work to do.âThe same day, Yun also had bilateral meetings with his Indonesian and EU counterparts.

(Yonhap)South Korea and Poland will work together to establish peace and reconciliation on the divided Korean Peninsula, their foreign ministers agreed during a meeting in Warsaw, according to the Foreign Ministry on Thursday.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his Polish counterpart, Grzegorz Schetyna, held talks in the Polish capital Wednesday, during which they discussed a wide range of bilateral and global issues, including an inter-continental rail project involving both sides, the ministry said in a press release.The Eurasia Express, which departed from Beijing and Vladivostok earlier this month, arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday after the two tour groups combined in Irkutsk.Yun will join the final leg of the 14,400 kilometer journey to Berlin later Thursday.During their talks, the South Korean minister explained the motivation behind the Seoul-led project, saying it is part of the Park Geun-hye administration's efforts to forge closer ties across Eurasia, the ministry said.He also thanked Poland for its cooperation on the project, stressing the significance of Poland's participation as a gateway to Europe and a symbol of post-war reconciliation and prosperity.""(Yun) expressed hope that just as Polish-German reconciliation served as a catalyst for peace and prosperity in Europe, peace and reconciliation would soon be established on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, and asked for the Polish government's interest and support,"" the ministry said in the release.Schetyna said he would work to contribute to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, noting that Poland has shared the Polish-German experience with South Korea.The two sides also discussed their countries' growing economic ties.Yun asked for the Polish government's support for South Korean businesses operating in Poland's special economic zones and greater interest and support for cooperation in defense, health and transportation.Schetyna said Poland considers South Korea a ""key partner"" in Asia, encouraging more investment from South Korean firms and new areas of cooperation in science and technology.Their meeting was the first between the two countries' foreign ministers in seven years.During his visit to the Historical Museum of Warsaw, Yun said North Asia should learn lessons from post-war reconciliation efforts by Germany and Poland to face the dark history and to take steps toward peace, in a thinly-veiled remark pointed at Japan's denial of its wartime atrocities. ""The case of reconciliation between Poland and Germany gives a clear lesson,"" Yun said in a speech at the forum held at the museum.

The ratifications would then be submitted to the U.N. to go into effect. âIf the new convention is introduced and adopted, it will facilitate the joining of new member countries including South Korea,â the chairman of the OSJD Committee said in an interview with some visiting reporters at its office in Warsaw.Â  Tadeusz Szozda. Shin Hyon-hee/The Korea HeraldâConsensus is not required in order for the new convention to be ratified, but we do need endorsement by many countries. It is to be seen how long the process will take but hopefully not long.â The interview took place on the sidelines of a seminar jointly organized in Warsaw by the OSJD, South Koreaâs Transport Ministry and its railroad agency, KORAIL. The event is one of the key features of the âEurasia Expressâ that embarked July 14 on a 20-day journey through Berlin via China, Mongolia, Russia and Poland with some 250 passengers from home and overseas. North Korea, too, will benefit greatly from South Koreaâs participation, Szozda said, citing âmassive transit feesâ it will collect when the Trans Korea Railway and Trans-Siberian Railroad are connected. If Busan and Rotterdam are linked, cargo could be delivered in 17-18 days, nearly half of what it takes through a traditional maritime voyage, he noted. The Dutch city currently transports some 90 percent of its freight by sea. âAlmost all regular member countries and I, as the OSJD chairman, are truly wanting South Korea to sign up,â he said. âWe support its enlisting for the coprosperity and development of all member countries regardless of any political interests.â In March 2014, KORAIL became an affiliate member of the organization. Seoulâs membership was on the agenda during the OSJDâs ministerial conference, its top governing body, in Ulaanbaatar last May, but did not come through due to Pyongyangâs resistance.Yet the measure may trigger backlash, some officials and experts say, from not only Pyongyang, but other countries for ditching the unanimous system that has been in place since its founding in 1956. The participation of Azerbaijan, which for its part opposes Armeniaâs membership, is another factor.âTheyâre taking a detour because to amend the existing pact also requires consensus. Iâm concerned that the move could rile North Korea and lead it to drop from the organization. Whatâs the point of us joining if the North exits?â a Transport Ministry official said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. A railroad analyst who took part in the seminar said, âIt is matter of the organizationâs integrity as it has been operating the consensus system for the last 60 years. Given the varying weights of the rail industry in each member countryâs economy, their national interests and diplomatic ties with the North, it may come back as a burden to South Korea even after it secures full membership.âBy Shin Hyon-hee, Korea Herald correspondent (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","opposition to seoul joining tadeusz ,body in ulaanbaatar last may ,ratify new convention with special ,wednesday despite pyongyang unfaltering opposition ,chief said wednesday despite pyongyang","['WARSAW', 'the Organization for Cooperation between Railways', 'South Korea âs', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Tadeusz Szozda', 'Warsaw', 'U.N.', 'South Korea', 'the OSJD Committee', 'Warsaw', 'Tadeusz Szozda', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Warsaw', 'OSJD', 'South Korea âs Transport Ministry', 'KORAIL', 'Eurasia Express', 'Berlin', 'China', 'Mongolia', 'Russia', 'Poland', 'North Korea', 'South Korea âs', 'Szozda', 'the Trans Korea Railway', 'Trans - Siberian Railroad', 'Busan', 'Rotterdam', 'dutch', 'OSJD', 'South Korea', 'KORAIL', 'Seoul', 'Ulaanbaatar', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Azerbaijan', 'Armenia', 'North Korea', 'Transport Ministry', 'South Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee', 'Korea Herald']",3,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.32698342  0.38784343

Sydney Seiler, the U.S. special envoy to the multilateral talks on North Koreaâs denuclearization, speaks in a meeting with the press in Seoul. (Yonhap)His meeting with Seoul officials came ahead of the trilateral talks among the nuclear envoys of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan, which are slated to take place on Friday in Tokyo. Seoul and its partners have been seen exploring ways to forge momentum to address Pyongyangâs nuclear issue, which was given fresh attention following the landmark deal earlier this month on Iranâs nuclear program.Seiler first met with his South Korean counterpart Kim Gunn, director general for North Korean nuclear affairs at Seoulâs Foreign Ministry. Separately, he also met with Seoulâs chief nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-juk and Kwon Yong-woo, head of the ministryâs Korean Peninsula Peace Regime Bureau.Describing his talks with South Korean officials as âfruitful,â Seiler stressed that the U.S. has always been open to dialogue with Pyongyang. He also pointed out that the recently clinched deal over Iranâs nuclear program demonstrates Washingtonâs flexibility that could also be exercised should the North choose a âdifferent path.ââIranâs deal demonstrates the value and possibilities the negotiations bring. It demonstrates again our willingness when we have a willing counterpart, and it demonstrates our flexibility when the DPRK (North Korea) makes a decision and it wants to choose a different path,â he told reporters after his meetings with Seoul officials.The agenda for the meetings was expected to include deterring North Koreaâs potential provocations such as a long-range rocket launch. Observers believe that the North could set off âstrategic saber-rattlingâ moves as it prepares to mark the 70th anniversary on Oct. 10 of the founding of its ruling Workersâ Party.The meeting was also to touch on how Seoul, Washington and other concerned parties could work together to pressure the North to come to the bargaining table, and to curb its nuclear ambitions. The North recently claimed to have already entered the technical phase to âminiaturize and diversifyâ its nuclear arms.Seoul officials say that the efforts to denuclearize the North are now at a crucial strategic âinflection pointâ given that the Iranian deal could create fresh momentum for the stalled nuclear negotiations, while the Northâs possible provocations could also thwart the efforts. Seoul, Washington and Tokyo are expected to coordinate their positions over how to pressure the North to come to the dialogue table during their three-way meeting on Friday. Kim, Seiler and their Japanese counterpart Shigeki Takizaki will represent each side at the meeting.They are also likely to push for the so-called exploratory talks with the North during the ASEAN Regional Forum next month, which Pyongyangâs Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong is expected to attend.Lowering the bar for the resumption of the six-party talks that involve the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan, and Russia, Seoul has made the offer for the unconditional exploratory talks with the North.

Lippert is senior vice president of external affairs at UnitedHealth Group, the largest U.S. health insurer. Inside the Habib House -- the residence of the U.S. ambassador in downtown Seoul -- she spends her days with Sejun and a basset hound named Grigsby. But after her family falls asleep, she turns on the computer and begins her work. âI am fortunate because I work in U.S. hours, so I work during the evening, which means I have my days to really explore Korea and take Sejun around museums and hiking,â she said as she sat down for an interview with The Korea Herald in the main hall of the Habib House. The dining room is her temporary office where she makes frequent conference calls, careful not to wake the other two in the middle of the night. Lack of sleep is her concern, but is definitely one of the âtrade-offsâ that allows her bonding time with the baby.Balancing work and family is, indeed, challenging, she said, like for many others around the world. But she believes that it can be done by setting priorities and sharing parental duties.âThere has to be that honest and hard discussion that you canât do everything,â she said.âChoosing which are the most important elements, and you know, for me that is family first and work second.âIn her effort to balance family and work, her husband is more than willing to help out, such as by supporting her trip to the U.S. once a month.âI do think that there are increasingly more shared responsibilities, and in our house Mark has been fantastic in terms of changing diapers and getting up in the night to take care of Sejun if he is upset and walking Grigsby out.â Robyn Lippert holds her six-month-old son Sejun. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)A native of Boston, Lippert worked in U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahyâs office, where she first met her future husband. After eight years of dating, the two got married in 2008.âI thought he was really funny, he has a great sense of humor and he is incredibly smart, and with both of us working in the Senate, we had so many common interests,â she said.âBoth were looking toward similar beliefs about making the world better and that is why we were in those jobs. We found someone who shares that interest and lives it every day â¦ it was very important.âBetween dating and marriage, both their careers took dramatic turns.Before being stationed in Seoul as the youngest U.S. ambassador to Korea, her husband served as deputy national security adviser and the National Security Councilâs chief of staff. Lippert also expanded her career both in the public and private sectors. Before joining UnitedHealth Group, she also worked at Fannie Mae in addition to working on various political campaigns including the Kerry-Edwards 2004 campaign.It was Korea that made the couple spend more time together, as her husband was traveling a lot to Asia while in Washington. After three months in Seoul, the couple welcomed their first baby. They gave the boy a Korean middle name, Sejun, by taking reference from the saju -- a traditional Korean way of selecting names based on the hours and the date a baby was born. âKorea is very special for our family,â she said.âWe chose a Korean name because we want Sejun to always have a connection to this special country and always be aware of that.âThough too young to remember all these cross-cultural experiences in Seoul, Lippert as a mom hopes her child can have an âinternational perspectiveâ in the future. The six-month-old child is being partly raised by a local nanny who speaks to him in Korean. The mother is also planning to let him explore both Korean and American food as he grows up.âJust having him learn about Korean culture, and having him learn Korean, it is just a part very important to us that he grows up with an international perspective and it is just the initial foundation for him.â âIt is always a part of our recognition of how special Korea is to us. And we really want him to embrace that and be part of his life as he grows up.âOf course, life in Seoul has not always been easy, and even life-threatening.In March, the ambassador was slashed by a knife-wielding man in downtown Seoul. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he received surgery for the cut stretching from his right cheek to his chin and another injury on his left arm. Despite the devastating incident, the Lipperts remained unperturbed, but rather comforted the well-wishers concerned for his safety.âIt was definitely a surreal experience,â she said, recalling the incident four months ago. âThe response and reaction from folks throughout South Korea was just amazing, and the support and the warmth we felt immediately after and still continuing is absolutely amazing ... and it has just made us to love this country even more,â she said. The ambassador is recovering really well and has hardly any visible scars, she added.Besides being a working mom, Lippert has shown her dedication to promote cultural exchanges between the two countries. A collection of U.S. works of art, including Sen. Leahyâs photography, will be arriving in late July as part of the âArt in Embassiesâ program, she said. The works will be installed at the Habib House along with other Korean pieces permanently placed at the residence, to showcase both Korean and American art. Calling the house, âone of the nicest residences in the world,â Lippert said she is very lucky to experience both cultures at one house. Named after former ambassador Philip Habib, the hanok (a traditional Korean house) was built in the 1970s, and has served as a symbol of the bilateral relationship between Seoul and Washington.âIt is a special combination of Korean architecture and style, but (is) actually made with U.S. wood,â she said. âA perfect blending of the two cultures.âBy Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","seoul pregnant last year she ,since arriving in seoul pregnant ,in seoul pregnant last year ,seoul pregnant last year ,ambassador to korea her husband","['Robyn Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Robyn Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'James William Sejun Lippert', 'U.S.', 'UnitedHealth Group', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Sejun', 'Grigsby', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Sejun', 'the Korea Herald', 'U.S.', 'Mark', 'Sejun', 'Grigsby', 'Robyn Lippert', 'Sejun', 'Chung Hee - cho', 'Boston', 'Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Patrick Leahy âs', 'Senate', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'the National Security Council âs', 'Lippert', 'UnitedHealth Group', 'Fannie Mae', 'Korea', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Sejun', 'korean', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Sejun', 'Seoul', 'Lippert', 'Korean', 'korean', 'american', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Lipperts', 'South Korea', 'Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Leahy', 'korean', 'korean', 'american', 'Lippert', 'Philip Habib', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Cho Chung - un']",14,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -1.03796458  0.13592859

It is not clear whether the August joint event can be held.Â Â ""The government plans to actively support civic groups' move to increase exchanges with North Korea,"" the official said.Â Â The official, meanwhile, said the government shared the need to upgrade the current working-level talks on a joint industrial complex to high-level talks.Â Â The two Koreas held talks on a joint committee running Kaesong Industrial Complex last week to discuss a dispute sparked by the North's unilateral decision to hike wages. But they failed to produce breakthrough over the months-long wage row.Â Â ""The wage issue should be resolved as soon as possible,"" the official said.Â Â He also said that the government is open to having possible inter-Korean contacts behind closed doors to improve the strained ties.

South Koreaâs chief nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kuk moves toward a customs clearance area to take his flight bound for China, at Gimpo International Airport in western Seoul on Sunday. (Yonhap)Hwang, Seoulâs Special Representative for Korean Peninsular Peace and Security Affairs, arrived in Shanghai for a three-day trip and is scheduled to leave for Beijing on Tuesday to meet opinion leaders from Chinese universities, think tanks and media, as well as top Chinese officials including Beijingâs top nuclear negotiator Wu Dawei. He returns on Friday.His trip comes amid growing concerns over Pyongyangâs increasingly sophisticated nuclear capabilities and the lack of international efforts to press the reclusive regime to renounce its nuclear program. The North, which has described itself as a nuclear power in its constitution, claims that it has already entered the technical phase of âminiaturizing and diversifyingâ nuclear bombs. Despite the Northâs development of nuclear weapons technology, the multilateral negotiation process, involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia, remains dormant.From Sunday through Tuesday, Hwang is to visit Fudan University, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, Shanghai Institute for International Studies and the Oriental Morning Post, all of which are located in Shanghai.From Tuesday through Friday, Hwang will be in Beijing to visit the China Institute of International Studies, the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, the China Reform Forum and other institutions. In Chinaâs capital, Hwang will meet various scholars from Peking University and Tsinghua University. He will also hold talks with Chinese journalists from the Global Times, Peopleâs Daily and Xinhua News Agency.Hwangâs meeting with Wu Dawei will come on Thursday. At the meeting, the two are expected to exchange their views on how to strengthen bilateral cooperation to reopen dialogue with the North and stop it from further developing its nuclear weapons.The North has so far refused to come out for talks with the international community, arguing that it would continue to strengthen its ânuclear deterrenceâ capabilities.Initially, Seoul demanded that Pyongyang should first take âsincereâ steps toward its denuclearization should it want the six-party talks to resume. But Seoul now demands that the North come out for unconditional âexploratoryâ talks before the six-party process resumes.Attention is now focused on whether North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will attend the military parade, which will be held in Beijing on Sept. 3 to mark the 70th anniversary of Chinaâs victory in its âWar of Resistance against Japanese Aggression.âSome observers say that should Kim attend the event, this would be a rare opportunity for the international community including China to allow the secluded ruler to listen to global concerns about the Northâs nuclear program.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","beijing on tuesday to meet ,seoul on sunday yonhap hwang ,trip to china on sunday ,western seoul on sunday yonhap ,seoul on sunday yonhap","['South Korea âs', 'Hwang Joon - kuk', 'China', 'north korean', 'Iran', 'South Korea âs', 'Hwang Joon - kuk', 'China', 'Seoul', 'yonhap)hwang', 'Korean', 'Security Affairs', 'Shanghai', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'Wu Dawei', 'Pyongyang', 'North âs', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Hwang', 'Fudan University', 'the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences', 'Shanghai Institute for International Studies', 'the Oriental Morning Post', 'Shanghai', 'Hwang', 'Beijing', 'the China Institute of International Studies', 'the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China', 'the China Reform Forum', 'China', 'Hwang', 'Peking University', 'chinese', 'the Global Times', 'People âs Daily', 'Xinhua News Agency', 'Hwang', 'Wu Dawei', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Beijing', 'Kim', 'China', 'North âs', 'Song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67220914  0.70381868

The South Korean government put the number of workers at around 57,000.""There was a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites,"" Japan's ambassador to UNESCO Kuni Sato stated Sunday in English during the annual session of the World Heritage Committee.Maria Bohmer, Germany's vice foreign minister who chairs the committee, called the Seoul-Tokyo deal a trust-based ""outstanding victory"" for diplomacy.South Korean media also described Tokyo's acknowledgment of such a bitter history unprecedented on the global stage.But the positive mood did not last even for a day.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida drew a line between the diplomatic rhetoric and his government's basic view of history.He told reporters that the UNESCO statement does not mean that there was actually ""forced labor"" that violated international law.He labeled the victims as ""requisitioned workers"" during Japan's colonial rule of Korea in the early 1900s.""There is no change whatsoever to the position that the issues relating to property claims between Japan and South Korea, including the issue of requisitioned workers from the Korean Peninsula, have been settled"" under the 1965 treaty to normalize bilateral ties, he was quoted as saying by local media.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said later that tens of thousands of Koreans who toiled at seven of the new world heritage sites did not involve forced labor prohibited under the Forced Labor Convention of the International Labor Organization.The 1932 convention says, ""The term forced or compulsory labor shall mean any work for service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.""Japan reportedly plans to step up diplomatic efforts to publicize its position on the issue.South Korean officials said Japan appears to be trying to interpret the rule for its own advantage due to political reasons.Â  A number of suits are underway in South Korea and abroad against Japanese firms that forcibly conscripted Koreans and others to work at their coal mines, shipyards and steelmills during Japan's imperialist past.Japan's claim is apparently based on its perception that its1910-45 annexation of Korea was legitimate.The South Korean government sought not to overreact to Japan's own interpretation of the UNESCO document, formally reiterating the English version is official.""It means by international standards and practice that there was forced labor,"" a Foreign Ministry official said on background.""According to ILO's home page, forced labor refers to situations in which persons are coerced to work.""He stressed, ""There's no room and need for more debates.""The ministry posted Japan's English-language statement and other related materials on its website, www.mofa.go.kr.

Washington and Havana have agreed to reopen their embassies in each otherâs capitals, following a surprise announcement last December that they will reestablish the bilateral diplomatic relations after 10 months of secret talks.Seoul, which itself has been working to improve its relationship with the Caribbean country, welcomed the move, calling for Pyongyang, a longstanding ally of Cuba, to change course and follow suit. âWe expect that the restoring of the U.S.-Cuba relations will provide an opportunity to usher in an era of new cooperation and open the door for peace and prosperity for Cubans,â South Koreaâs Foreign Ministry said in a statement. âNorth Korea, too, will hopefully join the positive flow in the international community through the right choice.â In contrast, ties between North Korea and the U.S. have rather been plummeting this year on the back of the communist countryâs ongoing nuclear weapons development, stringent verbal attacks and suspected hack on Sony Pictures over a film about a plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. U.S. President Barack Obama has said before and during the early years of his presidency that he was willing to thaw relations with North Korea, Iran and Cuba. In a 2007 election debate, he said it was âridiculousâ to think that âsomehow not talking to countries is punishment to them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration,â referring to the then-presidency of George W. Bush.Yet skepticism persists over any fresh restart of talks, while Obama said after the hack that he would âreviewâ whether to relist Pyongyang as a state sponsor of terrorism. With Cuba off Washingtonâs blacklist, North Korea will remain the only remaining vestige of the Cold War on the terrorism list. The other three listed countries are Iran, Sudan and Syria. North Korea and Cuba were seen as sharing much in common. Both the small communist states weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and its aftereffects, faced stifling U.S.-led international sanctions and carried out family power successions in recent years. And they had apparently maintained close cooperation until recently. Late last year, Havana proposed a resolution at a U.N. panel to defend Pyongyangâs human rights record and counter a European Union-led text calling for justice for the perpetrators including Kim. In July 2013, Panamanian authorities intercepted a North Korean ship carrying arms from Cuba. The Latin American country initially reported the cargo as economic handouts in the form of sugar, but under the giant bags were two Cuban MiG-21 fighter jets, missiles and other equipment, which constituted a breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions.The gap between the two longtime allies is only set to continue widening. While Havana enjoys an easing of sanctions, economic aid and high-level exchanges with Washington and the world community, Pyongyang will likely face deeper isolation over its grave human rights situation, nuclear weapons and other asymmetric warfare programs. Any return of North Korea to the terrorism list means more sanctions on trade, investment, assistance, financial transactions and other engagement with the reclusive country. For Seoul, this could spell a greater dilemma as it is poring over ways to improve cross-border relations such as through a lifting of bilateral bans, restart of tours to Mount Geumgangsan and expansion of trilateral economic cooperation including Russia. Alarmed by the recent progress between the U.S. and Cuba, Pyongyang has dispatched Kang Sok-ju, secretary of the Central Committee of the Northâs ruling Workersâ Party, to Havana apparently to reaffirm their decades-long friendly relationship with Cuban President Raul Castro.

Pyongyang has said Seoul will face ""catastrophic"" fallout in inter-Korean ties due to the office opening.Â Â  Â Â If Lee's visit is realized, it is widely expected to alleviate the strained inter-Korean ties as she may meet with North Korean leader Kim jong-un.Â Â Lee's late husband was the architect of the ""sunshine"" policy that actively pushed cross-border exchanges and reconciliation. He held the first inter-Korean summit with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2000, which produced a landmark declaration on peace and reconciliation on the peninsula.Â Â Lee, 93, expressed her wish to visit the North last October, citing humanitarian purposes, but she had to postpone her trip due to cold winter weather even as Pyongyang accepted her request.Â Â She sent a wreath of flowers in December last year to the North to mark the third anniversary of the death of the current leader's father Kim Jong-il. In response, the North's young leader said in a letter that he was ""looking forward to having Lee in Pyongyang once the weather got warmer in 2015.""Â Â In April, the peace center made a request for a prior contact over Lee's visit, but the North rejected it, citing ""complex inter-Korean circumstances.""Â Â Any trip by South Koreans to North Korea requires the South Korean government's approval along with the North's consent. The two remain technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Â Â In May, South Korea said it will encourage civilian groups to boost inter-Korean exchanges in such areas as culture, sports and history if they help restore national unity and open channels for cooperation.Â Â This year marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule and the division of the two Koreas.

High Commissioner for Human Rights launched the field office earlier in the day to monitor and document human rights violations in the North. The office's establishment was one of the recommendations the U.N. Commission of Inquiry made in its landmark report last year.""Today we also want to congratulate the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the opening of its new field office in Seoul. And we thank the Republic of Korea for hosting this office,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said at a regular press briefing.The new office will continue the documentation work initiated by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on the North's human rights situation and such efforts ""will lay the groundwork for bringing to account those responsible for atrocities in the DPRK,"" he said.Kirby also called the establishment of the office ""an important step"" in implementing COI recommendations.North Korea strongly protested the establishment of the U.S. office, calling it a ""hideous politically-motivated provocation challenging the dignity and social system"" of the communist nation and ""a criminal act of escalating tensions.""Pyongyang's foreign ministry also threatened to take the ""toughest counteractions,"" albeit unspecified.""We've seen the threatening comments made by North Korean officials regarding this field office that's being stood up. And obviously, we certainly have deep concerns about those comments and would just reiterate that they do nothing to help the security and stability on the Korean peninsula,"" Kirby said.""This office is all about trying to help -- potentially down the road help hold those accountable, those who are responsible for human rights violations in the North. That's a good thing. Again, we welcome the standup of this office, and it's in nobody's interest to do anything to interfere with that work,"" he said.The North's human rights problem has drawn greater international attention since the COI report said that North Korean leaders are responsible for ""widespread, systematic and gross""violations of human rights and the International Criminal Court should handle North Korea's ""crimes against humanity.""The report led the U.N. General Assembly to adopt a landmark resolution calling for referring the issue to the International Criminal Court. The U.N. Security Council also took up the issue for the first time last December.Pyongyang has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.

136,136,136,[NEWS ANALYSIS] U.N. human rights office ups pressure on Pyongyang,"The U.N. opened a field office in Seoul on Tuesday to systematically monitor and record North Koreaâs human rights situation, in a culmination of the international efforts to shed light on the Northâs deep-seated inhumane practices and stop them.U.N.

High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raâad al Hussein, Seoulâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo and other high-profile officials and politicians joined the opening event at the Seoul Global Center building in central Seoul.A member of a college student group for North Korean human rights wears a mask that looks like North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during a rally in front of the U.N. field office to monitor the communist stateâs human rights situation in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Noting that his institution is striving to be as close to the âvictimsâ as possible, the U.N. human rights chief said that the office would do its utmost to improve the Northâs woeful rights record.âWe firmly believe this will help lay the basis for future accountability,â he said during a ceremony to launch the office.âThe Seoul Office also has a mandate for technical cooperation with member states, national institutions and civil society, and will work in partnership with you to strengthen our collective efforts to change human rights in the DPRK (North Korea).âThe establishment of the office is expected to further anger the communist regime, which has accused South Korea, the U.S. and other supporters of the office of seeking to overthrow the regime by politicizing human rights issues and meddling in its domestic affairs.Analysts said the presence of the office would serve as a constant reminder for the North that its human rights abuses were being monitored, would not go unnoticed and could potentially trigger international intervention.They also noted that excessive pressure could be counterproductive given that it could lead the North to further tighten control over its people and cut itself off from the international community -- moves that would exacerbate the suffering of North Koreans.âNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un should realize that there is now a team of dedicated professional investigators working full time to add to the factual record that will ultimately see him and his top officials brought before an international court,â said Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of the activist group Human Rights Watch.Bruce Bennett, a North Korea expert at the U.S.-based think tank RAND Corp., expressed hopes that the office would help North Koreans gradually awaken to the regimeâs rights abuses.âThe human rights office will continue to raise the human rights issue, which will not make the North Korean regime happy. But as this information seeps into North Korea, more North Koreans will learn about international opposition to the abuses by the regime,â he said.âUltimately, over the years, the credibility of the North Korean regime will be questioned by more of the North Korean population. This would indeed be a change in the North, and a change that the regime really does not want to let happen. It is also a change that would, over time, help to destabilize the regime,â he added.The Seoul human rights office was launched based on a recommendation by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry report in February 2014 to address what it thinks amounts to âcrimes against humanity.âThe COI report that came after its yearlong study found evidence of torture, execution, arbitrary incarceration, deliberate starvation, enslavement and other appalling practices. In particular, it indicated that high-level Pyongyang officials responsible for the abuses could be referred to the International Criminal Court.The report went on to say that the international community should accept its âresponsibility to protectâ the North Korean people as the regime in Pyongyang had âmanifestly failedâ to protect its people.Experts say that to bring about real change in the North, the international community should mix pressure with humanitarian assistance rather than focus wholly on pressuring the reclusive regime. They also said that the international community should show the North that what it strives to do is to improve the human rights of North Koreans, not bring down the regime.âWe can think of human rights in political terms, but we can also think about human rights from a pure humanitarian perspective. For example, the international community can increase its humanitarian aid to enhance the well-being of North Koreans,â said a North Korea expert, who refused to be identified.âThus, we need to mix pressure with humanitarian aid to make the North Korean regime believe that the international community is sincere about changing North Korean policy to ensure human rights of its people, and has no intention of overthrowing the regime.âKoh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoulâs Dongguk University, cautioned against applying too much pressure on Pyongyang, pointing out that the international community should think about how to lead the North to become a responsible member.âHuman rights is of course a universal value now. But the concept of human rights is different in a democracy featuring individualism and a socialist society focusing on collectivism,â he said. âWith this difference and complexity of the issue in mind, we need to adopt a cautious approach to deal with North Koreaâs human rights issue rather than increasing pressure on it.âBennett of RAND Corp. painted a negative outlook of North Koreaâs human rights conditions, noting that the emphasis on the human rights would increase the possibility of a âsudden changeâ in the North.âI donât think that the North Korean regime will actually stop its abusive behavior; indeed, it may only get worse,â he said.âInstead, a focus on North Korean human rights abuses likely increases the probability that the regime will eventually fail and fall. So Seoul and Washington need to prepare for such a sudden change.âBy Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","office in seoul on tuesday ,in seoul on tuesday yonhap ,situation in seoul on tuesday ,in seoul on tuesday ,seoul on tuesday to systematically","['U.N.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea âs', 'U.N.', 'al Hussein', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'U.N.', 'âthe Seoul Office', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'North Koreans', 'korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Phil Robertson', 'Human Rights Watch', 'Bruce Bennett', 'North Korea', 'RAND Corp.', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'the U.N.

At a commemorative event arranged by the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to mark the anniversary, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said it was time to âput down the heavy burden of history with the spirits of reconciliation and coexistence.ââThis year, which marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral ties, is a historical opportunity. We should make it a turning point for South Korea and Japan to move forward toward a future of new cooperation. This is also our obligation for future generations,â she said.âOur governments should unite the minds of the two countries, and cooperate on the issues that require bilateral cooperation.â President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speak during separate events to mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral diplomatic relations in Seoul and Tokyo, respectively, Monday. (Yonhap)Parkâs message reflected a subtle change from her earlier tough position that without Japan squarely facing up to history and recognizing its colonial-era atrocities, it could not open a new future and would only face isolation.Park was also seen to urge her counterpart to use this occasion as an opportunity to make efforts to extend the reconciliatory gesture to mend the differences and move forward, without specifying the thorny issues.The same message was delivered to an anniversary event arranged in Tokyo by the South Korean Embassy there.The message was read out by Seoulâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se who arrived in Japan Sunday for talks with his counterpart Fumio Kishida and to attend the event.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attended the anniversary event in Tokyo, urging Seoul to open another 50 years of cooperative relations.âLetâs look back on the 50 years of the development of our friendship, look ahead into the next 50 years and hold our hands together to open a new era,â he said, stressing that South Korea and Japan are the âmost important neighborsâ to ensure regional peace and stability.âThe two countries cooperating to tackle regional and global tasks, and cooperating globally would lead to an establishment of new bilateral relations. (I) will join forces with President Park Geun-hye (to evolve the relations).âReflecting the deterioration in bilateral relations, Park and Abe have yet to hold a summit. They met for a trilateral summit, arranged by U.S. President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, the Netherlands in March 2014.Seoul has maintained that âconditionsâ are not yet ripe for a bilateral summit when the two sides have made little progress in the efforts to address historical issues including Japanâs wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women, euphemistically called âcomfort women.âIn recent months, diplomatic tension between Seoul and Tokyo has continued over a series of historical issues including Japanâs bid to put 23 sites of Japanâs Meiji Industrial Revolution on UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.Yun indicated that, during his talks with the Japanese foreign minister on Sunday, the two sides had almost reached an agreement to present the facts about the use of forced labor at seven of the sites if they are to gain world heritage status.Seoul has demanded that Tokyo should exclude seven of the sites where around 57,900 Koreans were forced to work during the colonial era, or clearly mention that forced labor was used there. The World Heritage Committee will convene a general session from June 28-July 8 in Bonn, Germany, where its 21 members will make a final decision on the issue.In the afternoon, Park met with Fukushiro Nukaga, chairman of the Japan-Korea Parliamentariansâ Union, who attended the anniversary event in Seoul as Abeâs special envoy. During their meeting, Park expressed her hopes that Abe would uphold former Tokyo governmentsâ positions about history. Abeâs nationalist rhetoric and action have been seen in Korea as him holding a revisionist view of history, which has escalated diplomatic tensions between the two nations.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","seoul to mark the anniversary ,anniversary south korean president park ,anniversary event in tokyo urging ,the anniversary south korean president ,the anniversary event in seoul","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Japan', 'Fumio Kishida', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'the Nuclear Security Summit', 'the Hague', 'the Netherlands', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'UNESCO World Heritage Sites', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Koreans', 'the World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'Park', 'Fukushiro Nukaga', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Abe âs', 'Abe', 'Tokyo', 'Abe âs', 'Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",16,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.64998806  0.36884043

It was the first visit by Seoulâs top diplomat since the Park Geun-hye administration was inaugurated in February 2013. During their talks, Seoulâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida exchanged views on a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues including North Koreaâs escalating nuclear and missile threats, Seoul officials said.High on the agenda was a set of pending history issues including Japanâs sexual enslavement of Korean women, euphemistically called âcomfort women, and Japanâs bid to gain UNESCO World Heritage status for 23 sites from the Meiji-era industrialization.Â South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (left) shakes hands with his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida before their talks at the Japanese Foreign Ministryâs Iikura guesthouse in Tokyo on Sunday. (Yonhap)Attention was being drawn to whether the ministers could move forward the two sidesâ ongoing negotiations on the comfort women issue. Since April 2014, the two sides have held eight rounds of director-general-level talks on the issue, which were seen to have made some progress.During a recent interview with the Washington Post, President Park said bilateral negotiations on the comfort women issue had yielded âconsiderable progress,â and were currently in the âfinal stages.âSeoul has long demanded that Tokyo offer an explicit apology for the sexual slavery and legal compensation to Korean victims. Tokyo argues that all colonial-era issues including the comfort women issue were settled under a 1965 normalization pact. The two sides were also expected to delve deep into Tokyoâs push to put the sites of âJapanâs Meiji Industrial Revolutionâ as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Seoul has demanded that Tokyo should exclude seven of the sites where around 57,900 Koreans were forced to work during the colonial era, or clearly present the facts about forced labor when the sites gain world heritage status.The two sides have engaged in tough consultations over the issue.

During the talks, Yun was also expected to demand that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe include his sincere apology for Japanâs colonial-era atrocities in a statement that he plans to issue to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in August. On Monday, Yun is to pay a courtesy visit to Prime Minister Abe and attend an event to mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of the bilateral relationship, which is arranged by the Korean Embassy in Tokyo.Kishida and Shotaro Yachi, secretary general of Japanâs National Security Secretariat, are expected to attend the event in Tokyo.

Â Â Many Koreans were conscripted to work as slave laborers at some of the locations during Japan's brutal colonization of the peninsula from 1910-45.Â Â South Korea has urged Japan to clarify the tragic historical background in UNESCO documents.Â Â It remains unclear whether Yun's trip will produce a breakthrough.Â Â No specific deal is expected from his visit, an informed diplomatic source said.Â Â On Monday, Yun is scheduled to pay a courtesy visit to the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and will possibly deliver a message from President Park.Â Â The foreign minister is also set to attend an anniversary event at the South Korean Embassy in Tokyo on the same day.Â Â Yun's Japanese counterpart Kishida and Shotaro Yachi, secretary general of Japan's National Security Secretariat, are also likely to attend the ceremony, said the source.Â Â Another government source says Abe may take part in the event.Â Â ""I understand Prime Minister Abe is positively considering ways to attend the reception hosted by the South Korean Embassy in Tokyo to mark the 50th anniversary,"" the source told Yonhap News Agency by phone on Sunday, adding that the final decision will be made on Monday.Â Â President Park may also attend a ceremony to be held at the Japanese Embassy on the same day in Seoul to mark the anniversary, if Abe attends the one in Tokyo, the source said.Â Â Abe was expected to send a political heavyweight, Fukushiro Nukaga, as his special envoy to the Seoul ceremony while Trade Minister Yoon Sang-jick will represent South Korea in the Tokyo event. The two leaders planned to exchange congratulatory messages to be read out by their envoys during the ceremonies.Â Â Yun initially planned to visit Japan in 2013 but canceled it in protest of visits by senior Japanese officials to a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, including Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso.Â Â South Korea views the Yasukuni Shrine as a symbol of Japan's imperialistic past as 14 Class-A war criminals are enshrined there among war dead.Â Â It would be the first time for a South Korean foreign minister to travel to Japan since May 2011 when a trilateral meeting also involving China's foreign minister took place there.

High Commissioner for Human Rights is scheduled to open the envisioned rights office in downtown Seoul on Tuesday, they said, adding that it will work on monitoring and documenting human rights in North Korea.Â Â The role is based on a report released in February by the Commission of Inquiry, a U.N. panel tasked with probing human rights in the North, wrapping up its one-year-old inquiry on the issue.Â Â In the report, the panel recommended a series of actions, including the establishment of such a field-based structure, to address the problem in the communist nation.Â Â In March, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling for the OHCHR to submit a report on the field office to the council early next year.Â Â The office is also expected to serve a bridge role between domestic civic groups working to address human rights in the North and the international community as an organization under the wing of the U.N.Â Â Last week, the OHCHR already opened its Twitter and Facebook accounts for the envisioned Seoul office and began communicating with netizens in and out of the country.Â Â ""Hello world!

Â Â It recently completed the process of hiring the staff members, including the chief, said the sources.Â Â When it opens, however, relations between the two Koreas are expected to worsen as the North has strongly protested the move.Â Â On May 29, Pyongyang threatened to retaliate against South Korea over the U.N.'s plan to open the field office. Â Â The North will ""mercilessly punish"" South Korea by mobilizing all means possible if a U.N. office were set up in Seoul, the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement carried by the country's official Korean Central News Agency.Â Â The North condemned the envisioned U.N. office as an ""unpardonable provocation"" and ""open declaration of war against it.""Â Â North Korea's human rights record drew global attention last year when the U.N. General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution calling for the U.N. Security Council to refer the country to the International Criminal Court.Â Â North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world. But Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.

He is also expected to meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his two-day stay there, although no schedule has been fixed yet.Yun's visit is aimed at paving the way for ""unraveling a complicated problem and taking one step forward in South Korea-Japan ties, with a big, strategic road map in mind ,"" the official told reporters in a background briefing.It is part of efforts to ""build mutual trust on a gradual basis,"" he added.""Timing matters in diplomacy,"" he pointed out, referring to the 50th anniversary next week of the normalization of their diplomatic relations.""The main purpose of Yun's trip is to attend an anniversary event.

Yun planned to visit Tokyo in April 2013, but his visit was canceled after Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine.âThe bilateral relationship has been in bad shape for years. In light of this, the ministerâs visit to Japan will be meaningful in forging the mood to enhance the relationship,â a senior Seoul official told reporters on condition of anonymity.Yun plans to meet Kishida on Sunday afternoon to discuss a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues including North Koreaâs escalating nuclear and missile threats, the ministry said in a press release.Their meeting is also expected to touch on the issue of Korean victims of Japanâs wartime sexual slavery, the possibility of holding a bilateral summit and Japanâs bid to gain UNESCO World Heritage status for 23 sites from the Meiji-era industrialization. Atop the agenda will be the issue of comfort women, a euphemism for former sex slaves who were forced by Japan to work at frontline brothels during World War II.During a recent interview with The Washington Post, President Park Geun-hye said bilateral negotiations over the comfort women issue have yielded âconsiderable progressâ and are now in the âfinal stage.âSeoul has long demanded that Tokyo offer an explicit apology for the sexual slavery and legal compensation to Korean victims. Tokyo argues that all colonial-era issues including the comfort women issue were settled under a 1965 normalization pact. As for Japanâs bid for World Heritage status, Yun is expected to reiterate Seoulâs stance that Tokyo should clearly present the fact that around 57,900 Koreans were believed to have been forced to work at seven of the sites. On Monday, Yun is to attend a reception, arranged by the South Korean Embassy in Tokyo, to mark the 50th anniversary. It is speculated that a senior Tokyo official will read out Prime Minister Abeâs message of congratulations on the occasion. On the same day, the Japanese Embassy in Seoul is also to hold the anniversary event where high-level South Korean and Japanese politicians are expected to attend.

The chaplains provide spiritual and emotional support for service personnel including conducting religious services on bases or in the field.The program was designed to boost their skills to console wounded soldiers while transporting them, hold religious ceremonies for the deceased and operate emergency surgery at field tents, among others. To that aim, the allies mobilized CH-47 and UH-60 choppers, two multipurpose wheeled vehicles, blanks and other equipment to boost reality. Special Forces would act as enemies, while experienced U.S. military ministers have joined to refine the scenario-based exercise. âThrough the drills, the participants will learn various religious support activities to heal and calm with the power of faith the soldiers who suffer from physical injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder at war,â the Army said in a statement. The two countriesâ militaries have been striving to expand exchanges between their chaplains since they clinched an agreement last year to step up cooperation in religious affairs.

(Yonhap)Educational institutions across the country resumed classes this week, after fears over the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak had suspended operations at nearly 3,000 schools, kindergartens and colleges.This came as a joint team of officials from the government and the World Health Organization urged schools to reopen, saying last week that the outbreak was not directly related to schools being open. âTransmission of infection in schools has not been a feature or an important part of transmission of this virus in this outbreak. On the other hand, the closure of many schools creates tremendous hardship for parents and it also creates a level of fear and concern about schools, which does not reflect, in reality, any danger,â said Keiji Fukuda, the WHOâs assistant director-general for health security, in a briefing Saturday.Ironically, mass anxiety that nearly paralyzed the nationâs educational bodies came to an end after comments made by an outsider, underscoring how little the public places trust in the governmentâs ability to handle large-scale disasters.About 68.3 percent of Korean adults answered that they do not trust the governmentâs countermeasures against MERS in a recent poll by Realmeter. Another survey commissioned by the Peopleâs Solidarity for Participatory Democracy showed that 43.3 percent believed President Park Geun-hye was most responsible for the spread of MERS, followed by Health Minister Moon Hyong-pyo with 30.4 percent.The distrust had pushed parents to call for classes to be canceled, even before local education offices issued an order for a mass shutdown. âHow am I supposed to trust them (the government)? The same thing happened during the Sewol incident. People in charge said everything was under control, when things were not even close to being okay,â said a 40-year-old woman whose son attends an elementary school in Seoul. The 2014 April sinking of the Sewol ferry, resulting in over 300 deaths, revealed gaping holes in the governmentâs safety and crisis management capabilities. While an outbreak of a contagious disease is very different in nature from a maritime accident, the traumatized parents said they wanted to take no chances in terms of their childrenâs well-being. The lack of clear initiative from the educational authorities has further fueled confusion, as neither the Education Ministry nor the educational offices gave clear direction as to how schools should react. On the contrary, the education authorities appeared to be a step behind and lack vital information needed to respond to the situation.Â  Students wearing masks enter an elementary school in Seoul, which resumed classes after a weeklong shutdown last week. (Yonhap)On June 3, the Education Ministry suggested that schools cancel classes if concerned about MERS. But it was a full week later when it finally revealed the criteria for canceling classes. Adding to confusion was the Health Ministry saying canceling classes was unnecessary. âWe were not sure what to do, as the authorities were not telling us for sure. Both the school and the students are getting sick of the nonexistent contingency measures by the government,â said a principal of a school in the Gangnam area who recently canceled classes. The ministry immediately changing its position and advising schools not to cancel classes following the Korea-WHO teamâs announcement appeared to do little to persuade the public that it was on top of things. Two days before, it had ordered schools in the affected region to suspend classes.Observers also pointed to cautious parents and rumors as having sparked the mass shutdown.âWhether the authorities advise it or not, I have no plans whatsoever to expose my child to an outside harm,â a 39-year-old mother of two said, adding that she has taken leave from work to take care of her children at home.Parents of Wangbuk Elementary School located near the MERS-hit Samsung Medical Center repeatedly called school authorities as soon as rumors of the hospital started going around, demanding the classes be canceled immediately. The school suspended classes from June 3 and resumed Monday.âBut I plan not to send my child back to school (from Tuesday) after receiving a text message from the school saying they are sending back children with high fever and that a total of 65 students have not come to school,â said Kim Ji-young, a parent of the schoolâs student.The myriad of unconfirmed information circulating via social media also contributed to the panic. âThese messages claimed all sorts; such as a kid who went to a certain private institute had caught the virus, or a doctor living in certain apartment being put in isolation,â said a 43-year-old man whose son attend a school in Gangnam-gu. âMeanwhile, there was hardly any information worth trusting from the government. Should we stop sending children to private institutions? Should our schools be canceling classes?â he asked.With the students flocking back to classrooms, the mass panic among schools appears to be settling down. But whether the education authorities can win back the trust of students and their parents remained uncertain. âWhat the Education Ministry should have been doing is to spread the correct information. Right now, the school has to learn about the outbreak via different routes (than the government). Even when one has to make a judgement call, one has to rely on inaccurate information,â said Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor opposition Justice Party on education authoritiesâ handling of the MERS situation.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","school suspended classes from june ,seoul is empty thursday after ,recently canceled classes the ministry ,classes after weeklong shutdown ,our schools be canceling classes","['Yongsan - gu', 'Seoul', 'the World Health Organization', 'Keiji Fukuda', 'korean', 'the People âs Solidarity for Participatory Democracy', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Health', 'Moon Hyong - pyo', 'Seoul', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Health Ministry', 'Gangnam', 'Wangbuk Elementary School', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Kim Ji - young', 'Gangnam - gu', 'the Education Ministry', 'Jeong Jin - hoo', 'Justice Party', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49770465  0.50901884

As both countries experienced colonial oppression and national independence, cultural sentiments find similar artistic expressions in society. Polish Minister of Culture and Heritage Malgorzata Omilanowska visited Korea last week before the opening of the exhibition âPolish Art: An Enduring Spirit,â which runs at the National Museum of Korea June 5-Aug. 30. The exhibition, which shows paintings, sculptures and decorative and applied art from the 15th to 20th century, is the largest ever of its kind outside of Poland. On display are 250 original pieces by Jan Matejko, Jozef Brandt, Teofil Kwiatkowski and Stanislaw Wyspianski and Zofia Stryjenska, among others, collected from 19 museums and institutions from Poland.Â  Polish Minister of Culture and Heritage Malgorzata Omilanowska (center) poses beside Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka (left) and Synn Il-hi, president of Keimyung University and honorary consul general of Poland to Korea, at a reception at the ambassadorâs residence in Seoul on Saturday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The National Museum of Korea, Korea Broadcasting System, the National Museum in Warsaw and the Adam Mickiewicz Institute collaborated. âAlthough I am not an art expert, I can say that the exhibition is a time capsule of Polish art intermingling with our history,â Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka said in a reception at the ambassadorâs residence in Seoul on Saturday.Quoting Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho, the ambassador added: âCulture allows people to understand each other. And if they can do that through their souls, they can overcome economic and political barriers. We get to understand that our neighbors are just like us, with the same problems and questions.âOmilanowska said the purpose of her visit was to recognize from the Korean side what the Polish government should do to promote mutual cultures to each other. This exhibition will serve as a stepping stone for a new level of bilateral collaboration, she noted. The minister met her Korean counterparts in the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, as the two governments are working on agreements in culture, science, education and youth. âArt represents our thoughts and mirrors our experience. Poland was only able to survive foreign invasions by preserving our culture,â Omilanowska told The Korea Herald. âIn a state of state absence, language and culture are the only tools that keep people together.âOmilanowska said that Poland, having established Europeâs first democratic constitution in 1791, developed toward a democratic direction too quickly. Having a strong democracy without a strong military, the imperial neighbors of Russia and Germany invaded Poland and stripped it of its sovereignty for over 120 years. A part of the exhibition shows growing nationalist sentiments in the works of artists from the early 20th century onward, who tried to recapture Polish identity, culture and language. The highlight painting âBatory at Pskov (1872)â by Jan Matejko shows a defeated Russian monarch kneeling in humiliation before Polish King Stefan Batory in the siege of Pskov, which took place in 1581 and 1582. These late 19th-century art productions tried to capture the greatest moments in Polish history and supported the independence cause, she highlighted. During the first era of communism from 1945 to 1956, the Soviet authorities pressed artists to produce works of socialist realism that glorified the communist ideology -â laborers sweating and working in factories happily, farmers toiling the lands with sickles and people chanting and demonstrating socialist slogans.However, after 1956 and the death of Joseph Stalin, Polish art recaptured more diverse, free-spirited, European perspectives through abstract, modern and non-figurative paintings.âIt was my first time visiting Korea, but the positive experience I have made overwhelmed my previous expectations of Korea. Now I feel that we are much nearer despite our physical distance,â Omilanowska said. âI could sympathize with Koreaâs situation after I visited the demilitarized zone. Poland is similarly experiencing military tensions with Russia along our border.âThe Polish government tries to find countries where representing Polish culture would create a framework for exchange in diplomacy, economy and technology, Omilanowska explained. Poland has highly advanced creative industries with innovation in software contents and engineering, according to the minister. Omilanowska mentioned the action role-playing video game âThe Witcherâ â based on medieval fantasy by Polish novelist Andrzej Sapkowski â as a leading example of industry collaboration in Poland. The Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw specializes in and promotes new media and filmmaking, which has contributed to Polish films sweeping international awards. The Korean Cultural Center in Warsaw and Korean language faculties at Polish universities have also elevated Polish peopleâs understanding and curiosity of Korean culture.Translation of literature into each otherâs language must also be encouraged strongly, she said.

Foreign Minister Han Min-koo and his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani met on the margins of the Asia Security Summit in Singapore on Saturday and agreed on the principle that the Self-Defense Forces can enter the peninsula only upon Seoulâs request or consent. Related working-level consultations will chiefly take place within the framework of the Defense Trilateral Talks also involving the U.S., but separate bilateral sessions may open if necessary, Seoul officials said. The potential items on the agenda are the scope, conditions, procedure and other formalities associated with any Japanese military operation on the peninsula. âThink of standard situations like an evacuation of Japanese nationals or wartime,â a senior official at Seoulâs Defense Ministry told reporters in Singapore. âWe can take time and have sufficient discussions on such situations relevant to Japanâs exercise of the collective self-defense right on the peninsula.â Tokyo is predicted to exert its right to collective self-defense primarily when it escorts and provides supplies to U.S. warships at sea or troops in Japan, evacuates its citizens here in a contingency or intercepts a ballistic missile heading toward the U.S.Yet Nakatani triggered controversy after raising the possibility of a preemptive strike on North Korea under the scenario that it had launched a missile attack on the U.S. and was gearing up to fire another. During the top defense meeting, Han sought to ensure that without Seoulâs request or agreement Japan could not conduct military activities that may âaffect the peninsulaâs security and our national interests,â the ministry said in a statement. Any issue related to the operation of U.S. forces in Japan and other reinforcements in a peninsula contingency must be subject to consultations between Seoul and Washington, he added. Nakatani, in response, reaffirmed that if any operation is to unfold in foreign territory, the Self Defense Forces will secure the countryâs consent âin any circumstances, according to international law,â saying the policy will naturally be applied to South Koreaâs case. His remarks marked Tokyoâs confirmation of the fundamental condition of Japanese troopsâ entry here at the highest level yet. The consultations, the first since January 2011, however, apparently failed to build consensus over the details on an attack against North Korea. While Han stressed that North Korea is part of South Korean territory and thus any Japanese operation requires Seoulâs consent, Nakatani did not give a clear endorsement, saying simply that Hanâs view was well accepted yet he could not answer immediately, officials said.Despite mounting pressure from Washington for a thaw, the session highlighted persistent historical tension between the top two U.S. regional allies. South Korea has pledged to separate practical cooperation with Japan and historical and territorial rows under the so-called two-track approach. Yet it remains lukewarm about Tokyoâs offer, reiterated by Nakatani at the meeting, to clinch bilateral pacts on intelligence sharing and logistical support amid vehement political and public resistance over military cooperation with the onetime occupier and Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâs unbridled attempts to whitewash wartime history. Following the last-minute cancelation of the signing of their info-sharing pact in June 2012, the two countries resorted last December to a trilateral âarrangementâ with the U.S., citing Pyongyangâs growing nuclear and missile threats. In Singapore, Nakatani raised eyebrows when he thanked U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter at the outset of their own bilateral talks for helping make the Korea-Japan session possible. In their three-way meeting the same day, Han, Carter and Nakatani re-emphasized their steadfast opposition to the communist countryâs continuing development of atomic weapons and delivery means in the wake of its recent ejection test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile. They agreed to work more closely together to deter any provocation including through the implementation of the intelligence accord, the ministry said. Han, for his part, also met Carter separately to review the cross-border situation and other alliance issues. With the two countries set for a summit next month in Washington, they agreed to develop their responses to Pyongyangâs nuclear and conventional military threats and reinforce their joint defense posture, the ministry said. âThe two ministers concurred that North Koreaâs provocations including the SLBM underwater ejection test pose a grave threat to peace and stability of not only the peninsula but Northeast Asia and the world,â it said in a press release.

Also on Tuesday, senior Chinese and Japanese diplomats met in Beijing to discuss the restart of the talks among the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia, which have been stalled since late 2008.The series of talks underscored the pressing need to resume dialogue over the escalating nuclear threats from Pyongyang, which has recently claimed to have already entered a âtechnical phase to miniaturize and diversifyâ its nuclear weapons capabilities.Despite the need for dialogue, skepticism is lingering over the six-way talks with critics arguing that within the multilateral formula, building consensus is an arduous undertaking due to the participantsâ different calculations of interests and the Northâs recalcitrance.âFirst of all, it is very difficult to bring the North back to the table as it is now refusing to denuclearize,â said Park Hyeong-jung, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification. âAnd even if the talks should be resumed, it is difficult to forge an agreement that would please all the participants as they have different thoughts over how to pressure the North to renounce its nuclear ambitions.âPark, however, said that there are no other viable options than the six-party talks that have fairly been institutionalized over the course of time and produced a set of landmark agreements based on which the participants could move their talks forward.Given that the North now identifies itself as a nuclear-armed state in its constitution and sticks to its policy of simultaneously pursuing the development of its economy and nuclear weapons, the six-party talks would face even tougher challenges even if they should be resumed, analysts said.âThe North may not come out for denuclearization talks now. It may seek to bolster its leverage by further sophisticating its nuclear capabilities â perhaps reaching the technological level to put nuclear warheads on long-range missiles,â said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies under Seoul National University.Analysts say that though the prospects of the resumption of the six-party talks remain dim, the parties to the six-way formula can use their creative ideas to expedite the negotiation process. Regarding the multilateral forum as an umbrella process, the parties can hold bilateral and trilateral talks to activate the overall denuclearization process, they noted. Some also pointed out that the six-party dialogue could go beyond the Northâs nuclear issue to play a role as a multilateral security cooperation forum, which has been absent in Asia beset by nationalism and historical and territorial disputes.âIt is difficult (in international politics) to create another mechanism for negotiations,â said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University. âThus, if need be, the participants in the six-party talks could organize separate forums within the six-party framework to help achieve the forumâs goals.âSeoul has recently pushed for what it calls the âKorean Formula,â a still-veiled process aimed at promoting dialogue among the five parties excluding the North and finding ways to persuade the North to return to the negotiations and denuclearize.It has also pushed for what it terms âexploratory dialogueâ with Pyongyang in a move to lower the bar for the resumption of the six-party talks. But there has not been any progress on the efforts as the North sticks to its nuclear adventurism.First held in August 2003, the six-party talks had produced a set of achievements such as the âSept. 19 joint declarationâ in 2005, which guarantees the security of the North Korean regime and provision of economic assistance to it in return for the dismantlement of its nuclear program.But the talks got bogged down with the North and other parties accusing one another of failing to fulfill their parts of the denuclearization deal. In April 2009, the North declared that it would drop out of the talks.After the Northâs withdrawal from the talks, it conducted a second nuclear test in May 2009. In February 2013, the North carried out its third nuclear test, speeding up its efforts to develop strategic nuclear weapons.The North has recently claimed that it successfully conducted an underwater test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile â capable of conducting a nuclear retaliatory strike â in an apparent move to elevate the level of its nuclear threat.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","talks bilaterally in seoul tuesday ,seoul tuesday before their trilateral ,tuesday before their trilateral meeting ,second nuclear test in may ,stalled multilateral talks on north","['North Korea âs', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'Beijing', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'North âs', 'Park Hyeong - jung', 'the Korea Institute for National Unification', 'North', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'North âs', 'Koh Yoo - hwan', 'North Korea', 'Dongguk University', 'Korean', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.26281548  0.24353288

Defense Minister Han Min-koo will meet his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani on the sidelines of the Asia Security Summit in Singapore on May 29-31. They are expected to discuss ways to stave off North Koreaâs growing threats in the wake of its recent ejection test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, such as by sharing intelligence more swiftly and effectively.Nakatani is anticipated to brief Han on the recently amended U.S.-Japan bilateral defense guidelines which paved the way for Tokyo to exercise its right to collective self-defense â the use of force to aid allies under attack.Han, for his part, will likely emphasize that the rules must be implemented in a transparent manner and Japanese forces can enter South Korean territory only at its request. The revision stipulates that the alliesâ military actions will be in line with international laws and âfull respect for the sovereignty of a third nation,â reflecting lingering resentment among South Koreans toward its onetime occupier. They will also have a separate trilateral meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. The three countries sealed a trilateral arrangement on military intelligence in December. âAt the two-way talks, the ministers plan to discuss issues related to each countryâs defense policy and how to enhance cooperation on North Koreaâs nuclear and missile threats and other exchanges,â the ministry said in a statement. âThe tripartite meeting will explore ways to collaborate on North Korean threats, the new U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines, and transnational and nonmilitary threats including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.â Hosted by the U.K.-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, the so-called Shangri-La Dialogue has set the stage for high-level security consultations between the two old foes. But the ministerial talks have not taken place since January 2011 as tension flared over wartime history and Japanâs claim to South Koreaâs easternmost islets of Dokdo. The announcement came as Seoul is seeking to keep up practical cooperation with Tokyo and defuse Washingtonâs mounting pressure for a thaw through the âtwo-track approach,â under which it would sternly respond to the Shinzo Abe governmentâs historical and territorial provocations while working together on North Korea, the economy and other areas of mutual interests.On Friday, South Korea and Japan will hold consultations to resolve their dispute over Tokyoâs campaign to list as UNESCO World Heritage sites major wartime industrial facilities where hundreds of thousands of Koreans were forced into slave labor.The two countriesâ finance and trade ministers are also set for their first bilateral talks in more than two years this weekend in Tokyo and the Philippines, respectively. Last month, senior foreign affairs and defense officials from each side also met and discussed security policy in Seoul. Senior officials of South Korea and Japan held their first security policy talks since 2009 in Seoul on Tuesday, as part of efforts to move their relationship forward amid escalating historical and territorial feuds.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","2009 in seoul on tuesday ,talks since 2009 in seoul ,in seoul on tuesday ,seoul on tuesday as part ,interests on friday south korea","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul âs Defense Ministry', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'japanese', 'Gen Nakatani', 'Singapore', 'North Korea âs', 'Nakatani', 'Han', 'U.S.-Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Han', 'japanese', 'south korean', 'South Koreans', 'U.S.', 'Defense Ashton Carter', 'North Korea âs', 'north korean', 'U.S.-Japan', 'the u.k.-based International Institute for Strategic Studies', 'Shangri - La Dialogue', 'Japan', 'South Korea âs', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'Shinzo Abe government âs', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'Koreans', 'Tokyo', 'Philippines', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",1,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.53129363  0.28076699

Choi's visit marks the first time that a deputy prime minister level official is visiting Japan since relations soured. Â Â The two neighbors had been holding annual meetings since 2006 but fraying relations triggered by Japan's move to deny its colonial and wartime atrocities put an end to the talks.Â Â ""The meeting can help open the way for better ties in the economic and financial areas,"" the ministry said.

Korea was under harsh colonial rule by Japan from 1910 to 1945. Â Â ""The two sides will discuss issues of mutual interest including their defense policies and how to boost cooperation to better deal with North Korea's nuclear and missile threats,"" the ministry said.Â Â Apart from the bilateral meeting, Han and Nakatani will also hold trilateral talks with U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, with its date yet to be fixed, the ministry added. Â Â The Seoul government has called on Japan as well as the U.S. to closely consult with it in implementing the renewed version of their defense cooperation guidelines that they announced last month. The arrangement, with a gist of allowing Japan to play a greater military role aboard, sparks concerns over Tokyo's possible amendment of its pacifist Constitution and a regional arms race.Â Â In July last year, the Japanese cabinet decided to reinterpret its war-renouncing pacifist constitution to pursue the right of collective self-defense, which would allow it to fight alongside its allies even if Japan itself is not under attack.Â Â Despite the strained relations, Seoul has been working with Japan on security matters under the trilateral framework. In December, the two Asian countries and the U.S. signed an arrangement to share military intelligence on North Korea's nuclear and missiles programs.Â Â Meanwhile, Han plans to visit Vietnam on a three-day schedule starting Wednesday, according to his office.Â Â ""While in Vietnam, Han plans to meet with his Vietnamese counterpart to sign a memorandum of understanding on the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement in a move to strengthen security ties,"" the ministry said.

The WEF 2015, bringing together some 1,500 education officials from across the world, evaluated the U.N.-led âEducation for Allâ movement while working to set new global education goals for the next 15 years. Participants of the event, including President Park Geun-hye who delivered a speech at the opening ceremony Tuesday, have emphasized that education is the backbone of a countryâs development.On the second day of the forum, Korea Education Development Institute chief Baek Sun-geun presented why the Korean model was successful in its economic growth and what challenges lie ahead. The Korean War (1950-53) tore the Korean Peninsula into two, making both Koreas among the poorest countries in the world. But some 60 years later, South Korea is the fourth-biggest economy in Asia. Baek said that competent teachers, the governmentâs contribution to train them and a nationwide consensus on the importance of education led to the countryâs high education fever.âEducation was recognized as one of the most basic and fundamental rights, while being seen as the most proper way to improve oneâs social and economic status. Such a view on education led to voluntary participation and enthusiasm of individuals (to educate themselves),â Baek said.He added that South Korea was able to access the type of skills that society needed as it progressed through stages of industrialization, and focus its effort on creating an education model that fosters such skills.The country focused on quantitative growth in the early stages of development, working to increase the number of higher education institutes and the percentage of students attending college, according to the presentation. Since the late 1990s, however, the country has been working to improve the quality of tertiary education. Currently, Korea is carrying out a nationwide college evaluation for higher education reform. The point now, Baek said, is to foster creativity in students while providing quality education for all learners. âThe society now calls for creators, not followers.âBy Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","south korea on wednesday advocated ,incheon the wef 2015 bringing ,korea on wednesday advocated its ,korea on wednesday advocated ,south korea on wednesday","['South Korea', 'the World Education Forum', 'Songdo', 'Incheon', 'Park Geun', 'Korea Education Development Institute', 'Baek Sun - geun', 'korean', 'Koreas', 'South Korea', 'Baek', 'Baek', 'South Korea', 'Korea', 'Baek', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.56421763  0.50095677

Under the slogan, âOne Dream, One Eurasia,â some 250 people from the political, economic, academic and cultural circles and ordinary citizens will gather in Seoul on July 14 before flying to Vladivostok and Beijing for a 20-day journey. In Vladivostok, about 200 of them will take the main itinerary under which they traverse nearly 12,000 kilometers on a charter railroad through Berlin with five stops in Russia and Warsaw. A Trans-Siberian train. (KORAIL)A branch line starting from Beijing will carry another 50 until they join the others in the eastern Russian city of Irkutsk via Ulaanbaatar. âThe total travel range will reach 14,400 kilometers, which translates into about one-third of the Earthâs circumference and 33 times the distance between Seoul and Busan,â Park Chul-min, director-general for European affairs at the ministry, said at a news conference in Seoul. âThe project is forecast to help improve mutual understanding with Russia and Mongolia and expand the foundation for exchanges and cooperation in various fields as we celebrate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties with each of the countries.â As the centerpiece of President Park Geun-hyeâs third-year presidency, Seoul officials highlighted the âEurasia Initiativeâ aimed at connecting Eurasian nations by linking roads and railways. She has announced her desire to launch what she called the âSilk Road Expressâ running from South Korea to Europe via North Korea, Russia and China, as well as an integrated Eurasia power grid and a logistics hub that covers China, Central Asia and Eastern Europe.Despite the absence of Pyongyangâs participation, the project could pave the way for the Trans-Korean Railway and the wider Trans-Siberian Railroad reaching Europe, they said. The ministry and the state-run Korea Railroad Corp. plan to funnel 1 billion won ($920,000) and 600 million won, respectively. The total budget is subject to change according to the final event schedule but expected to top 2 billion won, officials say, adding that the remainder will be donated by businesses. On each stop, the passengers will take part in a number of forums and seminars on business, logistics, cultural exchanges, foreign affairs and unification, among others. The final destination will house major events such as a music concert in front of Brandenburg Gate, a conference on unification and a march to the Berlin Wall marking the 25th anniversary of the unification of the two Germanys and the 70th anniversary of the division of the peninsula. âThough North Koreaâs participation is unconfirmed, we hope the project will provide a chance to expedite inter-Korean rail cooperation and the Rajin-Khasan project,â Lim Soo-suk, the ministryâs deputy director general for European affairs, added, referring to the Russian-led initiative to refurbish the North Korean port city of Rajin and a railroad connecting it to the nearby Russian town of Khasan, with participation by three South Korean companies â KORAIL, POSCO and Hyundai Merchant Marine.

It will continue through Friday at Sondgo Convensia in Songdo, Incheon, 40 kilometers west of Seoul.Education ministers from 97 countries â including Hwang Woo-yea of South Korea â and vice education ministers from 34 countries will join the event. Some of the prominent participants include U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim; UNESCO director general Irina Bokova; and Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, the mother of Qatarâs current emir.âThe 2015 WEF has a great significance in that education chiefs from all over the world will gather in Incheon and reach a global consensus for the betterment of education,â Kim Young-gon, secretary-general of the WEF Host committee secretariat, said Monday. âSouth Korea will carry out its role as an education leader, while making sure that (the forum) will leave a lasting, favorable impression on participants.â Volunteer workers for the World Education Forum 2015 pose for a photo at their official appointment ceremony in Incheon on April 30. (Incheon)Organizations involved in the forum include U.N. Childrenâs Fund, the U.N. Development Program, U.N. Women, U.N. Population Fund, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and World Bank. The forum is the largest education-related global conference, and succeeds the World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand, in 1990 and World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, in 2000.The focal point of the two preceding meetings had been the âEducation for Allâ movement, a UNESCO-led drive devoted to providing quality basic education for all children, youth and adults. Initiated at Jomtien, the agenda took a step forward in Dakar when the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to the EFA and identified six goals to be met by 2015. They include expanding early childhood education, providing free primary education for all, achieving gender equality, improving quality of education and increasing adult literary.Incheon will see how far each country has come in realizing these goals, along with a general evaluation of what has been accomplished in terms of education circles around the globe. In the course of self-assessment, participants will also agree on the new objectives that should be reached prior to the next meeting.In the EFA Global Monitoring Report published in 2014, UNESCOâs Bokova said it was clear that new education goals set in 2000 would not be achieved by 2015. She urged governments to step up efforts as âEquality in access and learning must stand at the heart of future education goals. We must ensure that all children and young people are learning the basics and that they have the opportunity to acquire the transferable skills needed to become global citizens.â She also suggested that the new goals must be âclear and measurableâ which will allow the necessary tracking and monitoring. The assessment will play a part in the subsequent discussions that will be conducted throughout the forum.The subjects to be discussed by the panels include the future global education agenda, education development plans, gender equality in education, post-tertiary education, guaranteeing free quality education for all, vocational training for youth and adults.The pinnacle of the forum will be the Incheon Declaration, which will be announced at the closing of the WEF 2015. The declaration and the Incheon Framework for Action will present the guidelines for global education until 2030.The main idea for the declaration will be to provide equal and comprehensive quality education for all, and to promote lifelong education. The five key themes are right to education, equity in education, inclusive education, quality education and lifelong learning.This is also connected to how technology can play a role in providing equal learning opportunities, such as online courses for the masses.One of the plenary sessions on the second day of the forum will discuss the essential role education plays in a countryâs development. The discussion will be led by Jeffrey Sachs, a renowned economist and a special adviser to the U.N. chief on the Millennium Development Goals. There, Korean delegates will present how education played a critical part in helping the country achieve rapid economic development in a short period of time. Another session on the third day will discuss how education can contribute to the post-2015 sustainable development and solving the global issues of today. The WEFâs outcome will be aligned to the education target of the global development agenda to be adopted at the U.N. High-Level Summit in September to form a single education agenda, according to the organizers.As part of the event, the organizers plan to hold an exhibition about the countryâs education policies, along with education-related policies of other member states and organizations taking part in the forum. Participants will also be offered a peek at how Korean public organizations and education offices use ICT in their education, vocational training models at high schools, and the countryâs role in the global citizenship education.Global citizenship education is one of the U.N.âs education initiatives that aims to train learners of all ages to become responsible global citizens, by equipping them with values and knowledge based on respect for human rights, social justice, diversity, gender equality and environmental sustainability.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","ceremony in incheon on april ,for global education until 2030 ,on tuesday in south korea ,tuesday in south korea gateway ,tuesday in south korea","['the World Education Forum', 'South Korea âs', 'Incheon', 'the United Nations Educational , scientific and Cultural Organization', 'U.N.', 'Convensia', 'Songdo', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'South Korea', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'World Bank', 'Jim Yong Kim', 'UNESCO', 'Irina Bokova', 'Mozah', 'Nasser al - Missned', 'Qatar', 'WEF', 'Incheon', 'Kim Young - gon', 'the WEF Host', 'South Korea', 'volunteer', 'the World Education Forum', 'Incheon', 'U.N.

The first in six years of Bulgarian presidentâs visit to Seoul, Plevneliev came with key government officials and some 30 business leaders to mark 25 years of bilateral ties. At the summit meeting on Thursday, Plevneliev and President Park Geun-hye signed three memorandums of understanding in defense, science and technology as well as education and culture, and raised the relations to a âcomprehensive and future-oriented partnership.â Both leaders also agreed to cooperate in Bulgariaâs infrastructure projects in energy, transportation, logistics and e-government, worth 9.3 billion euros.With a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, the two countries will host the first joint economic committee meeting in Sofia in October. âDespite the short span of our ties, relations have grown by leaps and bounds based on mutual respect and trust,â the president said in a reception at Grand Hyatt Seoul on Thursday.Â  From left: Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev speaks beside Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Korea-Bulgaria Parliamentary Friendship Association chairman Kim Young-woo and Bulgarian Ambassador Petar Andonov at a reception marking his visit to Korea following the silver jubilee on March 20. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)âThe signing of our partnership symbolizes our closeness. Korea is Bulgariaâs high-priority country in Asia for its strong economy, and Bulgaria assumes leadership among the Balkan countries.â Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se; 18th National Assembly member and the Korea-Bulgaria Parliamentary Friendship Association chairman Kim Young-woo; Honorary Consul of Bulgaria Kim Hi-yong; and Hanguk University of Foreign Studies president Kim In-chul, participated in the event. Addressing Bulgarian Ambassador Petar Andonov as ânot just a usual diplomat,â Plevneliev complimented his contribution to the foreign service, which sprung from his past career as a journalist and policy adviser to the former Bulgarian president and prime minister. Last yearâs bilateral trade volume reached $310 million, with Korean firms investing $260 million in Bulgaria, and Bulgarian firms investing $1.2 million in Korea. âOur world is under a myriad of political, economic and environmental crises. These problems require comprehensive and multidimensional cooperation,â Plevneliev said.âSuccess and failures on the worldâs stage are shared by all nations. Creating a better world requires big powers and smaller nations to work together.âBulgaria plans to lift its economy by developing the information communications technology sector with foreign investment, vying to be the âSilicon Valley of Eastern Europe.â It is in the process of creating an ecosystem called the Sofia Tech Park. Sofia ranks as the third European capital in the number of entrepreneurship. International firms such as the HP, IBM, SAP, Cisco and Oracle have set up branches in Bulgaria. Bulgarian ICT workers have high educational credentials, while operation and labor costs are one of Europeâs lowest. âBulgariaâs competitive strengths and business-friendly environment can help Korean firms enter the larger European market with 500 million people,â the president said. âOur priorities are enlarging cooperation into infrastructure, energy, transport, automobiles, agriculture, food, outsourcing and research and development.âPlevneliev said that increasing people exchanges in science, education, art have led to better understanding of both cultures, with Korean movies, dramas and music driven by the âKorean Waveâ boom making strides among Bulgarian youths. Bulgaria ranks third in the number of people who took TOPIK, the Test of Proficiency in Korean; many Bulgarian students in elementary, middle and high schools are learning Korean.Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul has a Bulgarian language department, and the Sofia University has a Korean studies department.

He was arrested on April 22 for illegally entering the communist nation through a Chinese border city.Pyongyang identified him as Joo Won-moon, residing in New Jersey.âIt is deeply regrettable that North Korea is detaining Joo Won-moon, who is a South Korean national, without any explanation to our government and his family,â Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at the Ministry of Unification, said in a statement. âThe government strongly demands the North immediately release Joo and return him to the arms of his family.âLim stressed Pyongyang should guarantee his security and permit consular access in accordance with international law and practice.The official also called on the North to release three other South Koreans detained there â Kim Jung-wook, Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil.Kim Jung-wook, a South Korean missionary, has been detained there for more than a year after being sentenced to hard labor for life on charges of spying and setting up underground churches.In March, the North also said it arrested two South Koreans, claiming they are agents of the Southâs state spy agency.The North allowed the U.S. cable news network CNN to hold separate interviews with the two in Pyongyang on Sunday, in which they said they worked for the National Intelligence Service.The two South Koreans told CNN on Sunday that they spied for South Korea, while Seoul has flatly rejected the accusations and urged Pyongyang to release them.Sundayâs interviews as well as the new detention could be an attempt by Pyongyang to pressure South Korea to shift its policy toward the communist nation. The North could also use the detainees as a negotiating chip should inter-Korean talks reopen.When announcing last month the arrest of the two CNN interviewees â Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil â North Korea branded them as âheinous terrorists.â In Sundayâs interviews, both Kim, 61, and Choe, 56, admitted to the charges against them and said they would accept any punishment that was decided. North Korean minders were present during the interviews, CNN said.The news network also said North Korea is often accused of pushing detainees to make false confessions.Kim was quoted as telling CNN that he was a missionary struggling financially in northern China when the Southâs spy agency recruited him. They offered to pay for information about the North, such as itineraries of visits by leaders to foreign countries and copies of the new North Korean currency for forgery.He was also quoted as saying he was paid about $500,000 over roughly nine years.Choe said he was working as a businessman in northern China when he was approached by the Southâs spy agency to gather information and materials from North Korea. He said he worked as a spy for three years before he was arrested.They said they were being treated well by the North Koreans, accusing the South of disowning them.Choe apologized to his family for getting into trouble. Kim said he had no family, but warned other South Koreans against doing as he had done.

North Korea demands the unconditional resumption of negotiations, while the U.S. says that Pyongyang must first take concrete steps demonstrating its denuclearization commitments.As the six-party talks have been idled, the North has bolstered its nuclear capabilities and stockpile and conducted its second and third nuclear tests, in 2009 and 2013. Some experts now warn that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to 100 bombs by 2020.(Yonhap)","beijing next week for talks ,nuclear envoy will visit washington ,washington and beijing next week ,seoul foreign ministry said friday ,third nuclear tests in 2009","[""South Korea 's"", 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Joon - kook', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Amb', 'Sung Kim', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Wu Dawei', 'Washington', 'Hwang', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang']",8,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.3277413   0.71624881

The answer is no,"" Mark Lippert, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said in a luncheon conference arranged by the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea.Â Â ""The U.S. welcomes a better relationship between Beijing and Seoul. We want good relations between Seoul and Beijing, Washington and Beijing, and especially Washington and Seoul,"" he said. ""Our relationship is one that is unbelievably strong right now, and moving in a direction (toward) even more strength.""Â Â Lippert said Seoul and Washington have had widespread consensus on the need for increasing infrastructure in Asia and the role of a multilateral development bank in setting up labor, environment and social standards.Â Â ""The U.S. went through a lot of these top debates since the 1990s and 2000s about standards what multilateral development banks will do and won't do,"" said the U.S. envoy. ""I think that's why the U.S. has a little extra vigilance when it comes to the standards issues, and has a different perspective.""Â Â He added that it is important for the two allies to agree on detailed points in dealing with the international standards issues.Â Â ""I think (it is important) working together some ins and some outs with other multilateral development banks to effectuate the best policies that accomplish the goals of increasing infrastructure in Asia,"" he said.Â Â Lippert also said the free trade agreement between South Korea and China will not interrupt the Korea-U.S. alliance, which is around 60 years old, but contribute to bolstering the global free trade networks. Â Â He cited that South Korea also has an FTA with the United States, or the KORUS FTA, that took effect in 2012.Â Â ""We want more free trade, more cooperation and more collaboration. Because in the end, that's a good thing, and that helps everybody,"" he said. ""We are very much encouraged in additional trade liberalization between countries and look to work to help American countries and American consumers.""Â Â He said the KORUS FTA will be the key to South Korea's participation in a U.S.-led regional trade pact, known as the Trans Pacific Partnership.Â Â Seoul has been considering joining the multilateral trade pact as a founding member but has yet to make a final decision as its participation requires a parliamentary agreement.Â Â Earlier last week, South Korea's finance minister said that the government will take part in a fresh round of talks on the TPP membership, after previous rounds of ""preliminary talks"" since Seoul expressed its interest in joining the trade deal in late 2013.

(Yonhap)He was responding to a deal made at a New York meeting of the foreign and defense ministers from the U.S. and Japan on Monday. Wrapping up years of negotiations, the two sides signed defense guidelines that allow Japan's self-defense forces to expand activities abroad.Â Â It would enable Japan to use military force to help the U.S. and other allies if they come under attack.Â Â South Korea is concerned about any Japanese military presence on the Korean Peninsula to help U.S. forces should there be a North Korean provocation, without Seoul's consent. South Korea still has bitter memories of Japan's colonization of Korea from 1910-1945.Â Â  Â Â Seoul expressed support for the agreement itself, saying it clarifies ""full respect"" for a third country's sovereignty when Tokyo exercises the right to ""collective self-defense.""Â Â The deal came as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe embarked on a weeklong trip to the U.S. He is scheduled to hold summit talks with President Barack Obama in Washington on Tuesday (local time), followed by a speech at a joint session of Congress a day later.Â Â The revised defense rules show the Washington-Tokyo alliance has entered a new stage, while Seoul-Tokyo ties remain mired in territorial and historical disputes. Â Â South Korean officials acknowledge the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance in regional security, but they have doubts over Abe's view of history. There is widespread speculation that the conservative leader may be drawing Japan back to its militaristic past.Â Â South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said Seoul and Tokyo are not competing against each other in terms of their alliances with Washington. Â Â ""The South Korea-U.S. alliance and the U.S.-Japan alliance are not a zero-sum game,"" he told reporters earlier this month.

(Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)Chung has proposed making the World War II resolution two-way with the U.S. and China, by writing separate joint statements with the U.S. Congress and Chinaâs National Peopleâs Congress.Chung pitched his idea to U.S. lawmakers during a visit there last month, and to Zhang Dejiang, the NPC Standing Committee chairman, during a stay in China last December.âMr. Zhang expressed his support for the idea, and the joint resolution (with China) is under preparation. Mr. Zhang will visit South Korea in June, so I hope to get the resolution done by then,â Chung said.John Boehner, the sepaker of the House of Representatives, had likewise welcomed the idea of writing a joint U.S.-South Korea resolution on the 70th anniversary of World War IIâs end, Chung added.âRep. Ed Royce, the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee chief, also supported the proposal, but he urged us to write our version first, so that the U.S. Congress could add their own words to our initiative,â Chung said.South Koreaâs top lawmaker added that the Washington-Seoul resolution would be finalized sometime later this year, when President Park is expected to visit the White House.Chung will propose a similar resolution to Japanâs Diet.Chung, a neurosurgeon-turned-politician, has been trailblazing in diplomatic efforts to enhance ties with tricky neighbors and upgrade Seoulâs foothold in the international arena. He served as the assemblyâs deputy speaker from 2010 and 2012, before winning the parliamentâs top post last May. Chung, a fifth-term lawmaker, left the Saenuri Party in accordance with assembly laws that ban the speakerâs party affiliation.Chung, who owns Bong Seng Hospital in Busan, has also been praised for unconventional relations with Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling party, challenging controversial policies or positions such as criticizing Parkâs âuncommunicativeness.â Chungâs resolution initiative comes as South Korea ponders what meaning it should attach to 2015, a year marking an array of landmark anniversaries.The year is the 50th anniversary of Seoulâs normalization of diplomatic ties with Tokyo in 1965, after Japanâs colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945, a period some historians have called brutal and comparable to Nazi Germanyâs occupation of France from 1940 to 1944.As relations between the two countries have steadily worsened this decade, officials from both sides have urged Park and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to take advantage of the symbolic meaning of the year to mend ties.This year also marks the 70th anniversary of Koreaâs division into North and South, after Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel III â two then-relatively unknown U.S. military officers â divided Korea along the 38th parallel in August 1945, using a National Geographic map under a 30-minute time frame.The two were asked to map out the border between the U.S. occupation zone and the Soviet Unionâs, the two countries that had agreed to jointly occupy Korea after Japanâs defeat in the Second World War.Rusk would serve as U.S. Secretary of State from 1961 to 1969, and Bonesteel as the commander of U.S. Forces Korea from 1966 to 1969.âWhat is important though is not the past 70 years, but the next 30,â Chung said. âWe must maintain this peace that has enabled the region to grow,â Chung added.Chung also said this year would be critical to improving Seoul-Pyongyang ties.âI am at a dilemma (on how to improve relations with North Korea),â he said with a sigh. âCheong Wa Dae has not been pessimistic (on improving relations), but appears to be taking a âwait-and-seeâ approach on Pyongyang,â the speaker said.âBut from my standpoint, I think that this year is extremely important in improving ties with Pyongyang, because we have major elections next April,â he said in reference to the 2016 parliamentary elections. âOnce the parliamentary elections end, public attention will be fixed on the presidential race (in 2017),â Chung said.âSo this year â (which does not have any major election) â will prove critical for the president to carry out her policies, especially on North Korea,â Chung added.The speaker expressed his determination to propose setting up a meeting between himself and his parliamentary counterpart in the North, Kim Yong-nam, sometime in June.âI will officially propose the plan again during my keynote speech on Constitution Day in July,â he said.Constitution Day occurs on July 17 in South Korea, a day which notes the founding of the countryâs government in 1948.The senior politician added that dealing with the Sewol disaster was the most difficult time of his term.âIt was tough. It was tough asking for the victimsâ families to be patient, as they had suffered so much already,â the speaker said, in reference to the months-long partisan fighting that had delayed the passage of the special Sewol bill for up to four months until last November.The legislation authorized the founding of an independent inquiry into the disasterâs causes, and the governmentâs botched rescue operations. The billâs delay, though, left many of the bereaved families with a strong distrust of politicians.âBut I was reassured when I heard that the families had considered me a trustworthy person.âIn regards to repeated reports of him being dubbed one of the potential presidential candidates, Chung said it is the decision that would be left to the disposition of Providence.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","seoul national assembly by june ,50th anniversary of seoul normalization ,korea in june so hope ,keynote speech on constitution day ,the 70th anniversary of korea","['South Korea âs', 'Seoul âs National Assembly', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'inter - korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chung', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Chung Hee - cho', 'the Korea Herald)Chung', 'U.S.', 'China', 'the U.S. Congress and', 'China', 'National People âs Congress', 'Chung', 'U.S.', 'Zhang Dejiang', 'the NPC Standing Committee', 'China', 'China', 'Zhang', 'South Korea', 'Chung', 'John Boehner', 'the House of Representatives', 'U.S.-South Korea', 'Chung', 'Ed Royce', 'the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee', 'the U.S. Congress', 'Chung', 'South Korea âs', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Chung', 'Japan', 'Chung', 'Seoul', 'Chung', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chung', 'Bong Seng Hospital', 'Busan', 'Chung âs', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Nazi Germany âs', 'France', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Korea', 'North and South', 'Dean Rusk', 'Charles Bonesteel III', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'National Geographic', 'U.S.', 'the Soviet Union âs', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Rusk', 'U.S.', 'State', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Chung', 'North Korea', 'Chung', 'Kim Yong - nam', 'South Korea', 'sewol', 'Chung', 'Providence', 'Jeong Hunny']",2,"[ 4.          0.          0.         ... -0.19092783  0.23007646

Park arrived in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, a day early for the last leg of her 12-day trip that took her to Colombia, Peru and Chile. During her three-day state visit in Brazil, she is scheduled to take part in a bilateral business forum, meet with Koreans and attend cultural events. The Korean and Brazilian leaders explored how to build on their comprehensive cooperative partnership forged in 2004, such as intensifying collaboration on medical care, information communication technology and renewable energy, while exchanging views on regional and global issues. Having secured a second term, Rousseff was expected to have sought greater investment from Korea as Brasilia is speeding up the third phase of its economic growth plans for 2018, with a focus on electricity, health care, energy, transportation and other infrastructure and social service areas. Brazil is the worldâs seventh-largest economy and a prime market for Korean businesses throughout Latin America. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1959, with bilateral trade reaching $12.5 billion as of 2013. On Thursday, Park called Koreaâs research station in Antarctica to encourage the 17 scientists and engineers on the continent, who are working on climate change, maritime biology and other fields. The King Sejong Station on King George Island in Antarctica was set up in 1988 following Seoulâs membership to the Antarctic Treaty two years earlier. The facility is named after King Sejong the Great of the Joseon Dynasty, which ruled the peninsula from 1392 to 1910.The conversation followed a summit between Park and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, during which they agreed to boost cooperation on Antarctic study and initiate related policy dialogue.

But South Korea and the U.S. have already said Park and Obama do not plan to visit, with Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the ruling Saenuri Party picked as Seoulâs special envoy. âKimâs participation was confirmed through a diplomatic channel and such a matter is not necessarily made public always. So donât worry about it, he will probably go,â Alexander Timonin told a news conference at the embassy in central Seoul, raising the possibility of a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. âI respect the decision of the South Korean president and I am confident that this will not affect the bilateral relationship.â With Russia stepping up outreach to Pyongyang, the envoy also expressed the countryâs willingness to invest in a joint inter-Korean industrial park in the North Korean border city of Gaeseong. âNumerous projectsâ are being discussed, including one proposed by ethnic Korean entrepreneurs in Russia on food production. âRussia is ready to actively take part in the Gaeseong industrial complex,â he said. âWe will introduce it when the agreement is reached.â Timonin expressed stiff opposition to a possible stationing of advanced U.S. missile assets in South Korea. The U.S. Forces Korea has confirmed that it had carried out a site survey for possible stationing of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, which is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal stage. But Seoul has been reluctant over its deployment given likely repercussions at home and abroad of its virtual participation in the U.S.-led global missile defense program, which China and Russia deem is directed at them.âTHAAD is part of the U.S.â global missile defense scheme. â¦ Weâre opposed to any deployment of it in regions near Russia,â the ambassador said. âIt is a very complex military and political issue, so you have to take into account potential side effects in the regional situation when you make such a decision.â By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","ambassador to seoul said thursday ,korean entrepreneurs in russia on ,moscow next month to take ,park geun hye barack obama ,ceremony marking the 70th anniversary","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'russian', 'Sergey Lavrov', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Nazi Germany', 'Alexander TimoninDozens', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Barack Obama', 'Xi Jinping', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Yoon Sang - hyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Alexander Timonin', 'Seoul', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'south korean', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Gaeseong', 'korean', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Gaeseong', 'Timonin', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",0,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.556283    1.04314518

The number of Japanese tourists to Korea, however, is forecast to drop 10.6 percent on-year to 73,000, due to a record-low value of Japanese yen against the South Korean won.

A military airport is also located near the county, raising accessibility to the district.North Korea's sovereignty will be exercised in the special tourist zone where the North's laws and regulations on economic development zones and foreign investment will also apply, according to the KCNA.The Mubong zone will be the second special zone for international tour in the North, along with a special zone at Mt. Kumgang, a scenic resort on the North's east coast.Experts said that the latest move is aimed at luring the dollar from foreign tourists by boosting tourism at Mt. Baekdu at a time when inter-Korean exchanges have been suspended since 2010 following a deadly warship sinking.Seoul imposed punitive actions in May 2010 which ban economic and cultural exchanges with North Korea as a punishment for the North's torpedoing of the South Korean warship Cheonan that year.Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea, developed by the South Korean company Hyundai Asan, opened in 1998 as a symbol of reconciliation, but South Korea halted tours to the area after a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted military zone was shot dead in 2008.

The first charge is punishable by up to eight years in prison.Kim pleaded guilty to the latter two charges but denies he tried to murder the ambassador.""I'm not trying to brag, and I won't call my action 'worthwhile,'"" Kim, brimming with confidence, said during the first session of his pretrial at a court here.

The report is another sign that North Korea has approved more cross-border tours for Chinese nationals after lifting travel restrictions it imposed in March due to concerns over the Ebola virus. The charter flight service between Zhengzhou, the capital of China's central Henan province, and Pyongyang began on late Sunday with about 140 tourists on board the first flight, the website of the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party, reported.""It is the sixth province in China that has opened such flights to North Korea,"" the report said. The new flight service for mainland Chinese will fly tourists back to Zhengzhou after a five-day trip to North Korea, the report said, citing Chinese tour agents. It takes two hours and 20 minutes from Zhengzhou to Pyongyang. The tour group is scheduled to visit the truce village of Panmunjom, which sits in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two Koreas, as well as subway stations in Pyongyang.Last October, North Korea banned foreign tourists and imposed a 21-day quarantine on all people, including diplomats, entering the country. Previously, North Korea operated tourist charter flights from Shanghai and Yanji of Jilin province during peak tour seasons. North Korea is one of the world's most secretive and isolated nations, but Pyongyang has stepped up efforts to attract foreign tourists since earlier last year by offering more international and domestic flights.

The revision, which could come later this month, is widely expected to reflect Tokyo's decision to exercise its collective self-defense right.The right to collective self-defense would allow Japan to send its forces to the Korean Peninsula to help the U.S. in the event of contingencies, such as a conflict with North Korea.South Korea and the U.S. are also close allies, with more than 28,000 American troops stationed in the country to deter North Korean provocations.""We asked the Japanese side for an explanation of the current direction of talks (with the U.S.),"" the senior ministry official told reporters.The South Korean side also stressed that the revision should be made in a way that resolves the suspicions and concerns of neighboring nations and contributes to regional peace and stability, the official said.

Brig. Gen. Park Chul-kyun, director general for international policy at Seoulâs Defense Ministry and Atsuo Suzuki, deputy director general of the Defense Policy Bureau of Tokyoâs Defense Ministry also participated. The talks, which first began in 1998, have not been held since December 2009 due to bilateral conflicts over history and Dokdo.At the talks, Japanese officials were expected to explain the ongoing revision of the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines. Seoul has said that the revision work should proceed in a transparent way and in a direction that contributes to peace and stability.Washington and Tokyo have been working to amend the 1997 guidelines to stipulate joint procedures to handle a series of the emerging security challenges possibly including Chinese threats. First adopted in 1978 to counter Soviet threats, the guidelines were last amended in 1997 to reflect post-Cold War security threats.The U.S. and Japan are expected to reach an agreement on the revision of the guidelines when their defense and foreign ministers meet at the so-called two-plus-two meeting to be held in Washington on April 27.Seoul officials were expected to express their concerns over Tokyoâs repeated claim to the Dokdo islets and its apparent attempt to whitewash its wartime atrocities. The bilateral relationship has been deteriorating as Japan has continued to reinforce its claim to Dokdo in its government policy papers and misrepresent the negative side of its history in school textbooks.Seoul officials were also expected to touch on the need for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to present his sincerity in addressing historical issues during his speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on April 29. The two sides also discussed North Koreaâs escalating nuclear and missile threats and explored ways to enhance cooperation to counter the threats. Some observers said that the officials could also discuss the possibility of holding bilateral talks between the defense ministers of the two countries during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore next month.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","2009 in seoul on tuesday ,talks since 2009 in seoul ,in seoul on tuesday ,seoul on tuesday as part ,history in school textbooks seoul","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'South Korea âs', 'Lee Sang - deok', 'northeast asian', 'Seoul âs Foreign Ministry', 'Junichi Ihara', 'asian', 'oceanian', 'Tokyo âs Foreign Ministry', 'brig', 'Park Chul - kyun', 'Seoul âs Defense Ministry and Atsuo Suzuki', 'the Defense Policy Bureau of Tokyo âs Defense Ministry', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'chinese', 'soviet', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'the U.S. Congress', 'North Korea âs', 'the Shangri - La Dialogue', 'Singapore', 'Song Sang - ho']",1,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.45344004  0.3282961

His visit came two days after Pyongyang test-fired two KN-06 surface-to-air missiles from Hwajin-ri, South Pyeongan Province, in an apparent show of force amid the prolonged deadlock in its relations with Seoul and Washington.

Carterâs first visit to Korea as the Pentagon chief followed his three-day visit to Japan where he portrayed the U.S-Japan alliance as the âbedrockâ of Americaâs alliance system in the Asia-Pacific.

After touching down at the U.S.â Osan Airbase south of Seoul, Carter was greeted by U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, U.S. 7th Air Force Commander Lt. Terrence OâShaughnessy and South Koreaâs Air Force Operations Commander Lt. Park Jae-bok.

Carter toured the 36th Fighter Squadron, a U.S. air force unit operating the F-16 fighter fleet, and then attended a town hall meeting with some 200 U.S. troops, where he appreciated their contribution to keeping the alliance and the U.S. strategic engagement in the region.

âYou, by being as ready, skilled and formidable as you are, deter attack and keep the peace. I just want you to know that you are what I wake up for everyday. We donât take it for granted,â Carter said during the town hall meeting.

Touching on Washingtonâs ârebalanceâ policy toward the Asia-Pacific, the secretary stressed that the U.S. would commit the new high-tech equipment in the region, which accounts for half of the worldâs population and wealth.

âA lot of our newer capabilities that we are investing in are going to be flowing into this theater because of the importance we attach to it,â he said. âYou will see a lot of new stuff showing up here first. And that is deliberate and that is appropriate.â

On Friday, Carter and his South Korean counterpart Han Min-koo will hold talks to discuss bilateral, regional and global security challenges and their cooperation in handling them.

On top of the agenda is North Koreaâs escalating nuclear missile threats, a reason why observers expect them to discuss the U.S.â potential deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, a core element of Americaâs multilayered ballistic missile shield.

THAAD has emerged as a hot-button diplomatic issue as Beijing has repeatedly expressed opposition to it based on its belief that the deployment would hurt the regional security balance, escalate military tension and potentially spark an arms race.

Seoul officials say that the THAAD issue is not included in the official agenda. But many anticipate that the issue would be touched upon unofficially during the talks between Han and Carter.

This week, senior U.S. officials have played up North Koreaâs nuclear missile threats, sparking speculation that Washington appears to be underscoring the need for THAAD in Korea and a stronger missile defense program elsewhere.

Aside from the Northâs nuclear and missile threats, the two ministers are also to discuss developing follow-up measures to implement the âconditions-basedâ transition of wartime operational control.

They will also consult over the issue of crafting a set of documents to replace the Strategic Alliance 2015 -- detailing procedures for the OPCON transfer in 2015.

Last October, the allies agreed to a âconditions-basedâ transfer of wartime operational control in light of evolving North Korean threats, finalizing their decision to delay the transfer, previously scheduled for December 2015. They did not set a date for the transition, but the transfer is expected to occur in the early or mid-2020s.

After the talks between the two ministers, Han and Carter will visit the 2nd Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the wreckage of the ill-fated corvette Cheonan is on display. Carter will be the first U.S. defense chief to visit the wreckage.

The Cheonan was sunken by a North Korean torpedo attack in March 2010, which killed 46 sailors. Pyongyang, however, denies responsibility for the attack, arguing that Seoulâs blame on Pyongyang was an âoutright fabrication.â

Carterâs visit to Japan focused on highlighting the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance for maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. He touted the alliance as the bedrock of Americaâs alliance network, stressing joint efforts to bolster the bilateral security cooperation.

At the talks between Carter and Japanâs Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, the issue of revising the 1997 bilateral defense cooperation guidelines topped the agenda.

The revision work, expected to be completed in the first half of this year, will charter a future path for the defense collaboration to tackle new challenges including Chinaâs assertiveness in maritime disputes, analysts say.

âThe guidelines give us opportunities to have reflected on this alliance which has been the bedrock of our alliance system in this part of the world and a foundation of security in the entire region â¦ give us the opportunity to extend its reach into new domains like space and cyber,â said Carter during a joint news conference in Tokyo.

âIt really allows us to open up many new opportunities to strengthen the alliance in areas where that strengthening is needed because the security situation has changed, or in areas where we have new opportunities as a consequence of the guidelines.â

The revision of the guidelines is expected to contain a set of joint measures to cope with Chinese threats and other emerging scenarios. First adopted in 1978 to counter Soviet threats, the guidelines were last amended in 1997 to reflect post-Cold War security threats.

The two sides are to explore ways to strengthen joint capabilities and reinforce deterrence against evolving threats by North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles.Â Â Â Han and Carter will then hold a joint press conference and visit the Navy's 2nd Fleet Command together to pay tribute to the sailors who died in the sinking of the warship Cheonan.Â Â Â On March 26, 2010, the 1,200-ton naval corvette sank in the Yellow Sea, killing 46 sailors. A South Korean-led international investigation found that the North had torpedoed the ship, though Pyongyang denied its involvement. The hull of the vessel is on display in the Command headquarters in Pyeongtaek.Â Â Â Carter will be the first U.S. defense minister to visit the site to commemorate the deceased, which ""will be a chance to display the allies' staunch will to jointly cope with any threatand provocations by Pyongyang,"" a Seoul ministry official said. The U.S. secretary will leave here on Saturday for the country's Pacific Command in Hawaii on his way back home.Â Â Â  Â Two days before Carter's visit to South Korea, the communist North test-fired two short-range ground-to-air KN-06 missiles from its western province of South Pyongan into the East Sea, Seoul's defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said in a regular briefingon Thursday. Â Â Â The projectiles flew some 100 kilometers after being launched from a transporter erector launcher (TEL), he said, adding Seoul and Washington are closely monitoring moves of the bellicose regime.

But observers say discussion about the issue is unavoidable as it has emerged as a hot-button political issue amid Chinaâs explicit opposition to it.Mindful of repeated opposition from Beijing, Seoul has taken a cautious stance over THAAD, which Beijing argues could undermine its security interests. Seoul has so far maintained there have been âno official consultations between the allies, no request from the U.S. and no decision made.âThe agenda for the bilateral talks include strengthening the alliesâ deterrence against North Koreaâs nuclear and missile threats and developing follow-up measures to push for the conditions-based transition of wartime operational control.Should the THAAD issue not be discussed during the talks, the issue could be touched on at the Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue to be held mid-April in Washington, observers say.After the talks between the two ministers, Han and Carter will visit the 2nd Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province where the wreckage of the ill-fated corvette Cheonan is on display. The Cheonan was sunken by a North Korean torpedo attack in March 2010, which killed 46 sailors.Carter will be the first U.S. defense chief to visit the wreckage, Seoul officials said.Carter will land in South Korea following a visit to Japan.

Themed âSustainable Solutions for an Urban Future,â the triennial event will examine citiesâ roles in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and promoting cooperation for tackling climate change.Earlier in the day, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon was appointed president of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives by the Global Executive Committee. He will succeed David Cadman, who served the term from 2012. Park will chair the GEC meetings for the next three years. âCity cooperation is essential for promptly responding to global climate change. I will lead the municipalities around the world to join anti-carbon moves and encourage them to contribute to the greenhouse gas emission cut,â he said in the inauguration speech.Â  Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon (second from right) talks with Vaxjo Mayor Bo Frank (from left) and Malmo Mayor Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh of Sweden and Reykjavik Mayor Dagur Eggertsson of Iceland at Seoul City Hall on Wednesday.(Seoul Metropolitan Government)Ahead of the opening, Park met with three European green city mayors â Bo Frank, the mayor of Vaxjo City in Sweden; Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, the mayor of Malmo City in Sweden; and Dagur Eggertsson, the mayor of Reykjavik City in Iceland â to share their efforts in seeking environment-friendly policies.The Reykjavik mayor highlighted that national-level efforts against climate change cannot be achieved without local-level initiatives. âThe city efforts are often ignored at the national level. The central government should realize the importance of city roles in environmental issues to better cope with these issues,â Eggertsson said. âI believe the ICLEI assembly could be a strong platform in raising the importance of awareness.â Reykjavik, the capital city of Iceland, home to some 120,000 city residents, has set a policy to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent by 2020 and 73 percent by 2050. Under Reykjavikâs master plan, all electricity will be produced with hydro-electronic power and house heating will include geothermal power. More than 85 percent of vehicles owned by the city use biodynamic energy, methane or electricity, the city said.Â The mayor of Vaxjo stressed that his city government was able to seek green policies due to the autonomous city system. âIn the case of Sweden, the power of the local government is systematicallyÂ strong. The decentralization system has been settled since 200 years agoÂ whileÂ the majorityÂ of the city budget is nationally funded,â Frank said. Vaxjo in Kronoberg County, also known as âthe greenest city in Europeâ with nearly 100,000 residents, has been putting efforts into eliminating the use of fossil fuel since 1996. In an aim to become a fossil fuel-free city by 2030, Vaxjo promoted environmentally friendly transportation with bicycle-only roads, and pushed for constructing timber buildings to curb energy use. It also turns waste into a source of biogas for vehicles. As a result, the city has halved carbon emissions in the last two decades, Vaxjo officials said. Its goal is to reduce emissions per capita by 70 percent by 2025, compared to that of 1993, they added. Malmoâs mayor emphasized that childhood education is essential to encouraging civic participation in local-level green projects. â(The city) has put in efforts to get children interested in environmental issues from an early age. For example, schools arrange a carnival to offer an opportunity for students to create their own solutions for a sustainable future,â said Jammeh. Malmo, the capital of Skane County in Sweden, has pursued solar, wind and water energy to reduce carbon emissions by at least 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels. After the talks, the city leaders vowed to further strengthen their inter-city ties and to share their green policies. On Thursday, the ICLEI members will participate in the opening plenary session.

It is one of South Korea's deadliest peacetime disasters, leaving more than 300 people, mostly teenagers, dead or missing.Â Â Jang Byeong-joon, a spokesman at Tree Planet, said Ferrer wanted to continue his mother's legacy of serving disenfranchised children. Audrey, a British actress and renowned humanitarian, had served as the Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund from 1989 until her death in 1993.Â Â The ""Sewol Memorial Forest"" will be created on a hill on the southwestern island of Jindo. The hill is located about 4 kilometers away from the port closest to the accident site, he said.Â Â Jang also said Tree Planet has been studying memorial forests in other countries, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in the U.S., for the past 10 months and is ready to get to work on Friday.Â Â The project has the blessing of the bereaved families, who hope the forest would memorialize not only the deceased but their close friends and families, the spokesman said. Â Â Jang plans to announce details of the project at a press conference on Thursday morning in Seoul where Ferrer will join along with his wife and children.Â Â Jang said Tree Planet will collect donations through its website (sewolforest.org) starting Thursday.

Â Â Earlier this week, Japan approved new school textbooks and published an annual diplomatic white paper containing its Dokdo claim, drawing strong condemnation from South Korea.Â Â South Koreans will also pay keen attention to Abe's speech at a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives slated for April 29.Â Â Pundits say South Korea needs to deal with Japan's territorial and history claim in a calm manner for national interest.Â Â ""The history row between South Korea and Japan is becoming a multilateral issue involving the U.S. and China, not just a bilateral problem,"" said Cho Yang-hyun, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. Â Â An alternative strategy, if not the best one, is for South Korea to push for cooperation on security and other issues, while maintaining its current approach on the history issue, he added.

Â Â Seoul is the second leg of his two-nation trip that will also take him to Japan from April 7-9, the ministry added. It is Carter's first trip to Northeast Asia since taking office last month.Â Â Asked if the ministers will deal with one of the most controversial pending issues -- the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system -- during the meeting, ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said, ""THAAD is not included on the agenda as of now ... Discussions on details are still under way between the two sides.""Â Â Kim, however, refused to comment on the Yonhap report on Wednesday that said Washington decided not to bring up the THAAD issue during Carter's trip after discussions with senior leaders at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul and military leaders on the peninsula and at the Pentagon. The report cited a U.S. official who declined to be identified due to the matter's sensitivity.Â Â Speculation has grown that the U.S. secretary could officially raise the issue for the first time. Washington has expressed its willingness to deploy the battery here to better defend South Korea from the North's security threats and to guarantee the safety of around 28,000 U.S. troops stationed here and their families. It's a move that sparks concerns and opposition from neighboring countries, mainly China and Russia. Â Â Last week, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey said he had ""productive conversations"" with his South Korean counterpart, Adm. Choi Yun-hee, in Seoul on their progress in building an integrated air and missile-defense system, though officials here said THAAD was not on the agenda.Â Â THAAD is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at a higher altitude in their terminal phase using a hit-to-kill method.Â Â Also on the table during the planned Seoul-Washington meeting will be follow-up measures to smoothly push for the transfer of the wartime operational control of South Korean troops from Washington to Seoul, according to the ministry. Â Â In November, the allies agreed to delay the transition of wartime operational control of South Korean troops from Washington to Seoul until South Korea is capable enough to counter threats from Pyongyang. The two sides are eyeing the mid-2020s as the time frame for the handover.Â Â Carter and Han also ""plan to visit the Navy's 2nd Fleet Command to pay tribute to sailors killed by the sinking of the warship Cheonan.""Â Â On March 26, 2010, the 1,200-ton Cheonan warship exploded and sank in the Yellow Sea, killing 46 sailors.

In light of such sensitivity, South Korean and U.S. officials have only said there have been no official consultations or decisions on the issue. Ahead of Carter's trip, however, speculation had grown that the American defense chief could officially raise the issue for the first time.The U.S. official, who spoke strictly on condition of anonymity due to the issue's sensitivity, did not elaborate on why they decided not to raise the issue, including if there was such a request from South Korean officials, and whether the U.S. still sees the need for a THAAD battery in the South.Carter plans to visit Seoul from April 9-11 for his first face-to-face talks with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo.Seoul is the second leg of his two-nation trip that will also take him to Japan from April 7-9.U.S. officials have said that Carter's trip is meaningful in that the two Asian allies are the destination of his first bilateral visits since taking office earlier this year, except for his trip to U.S. troops in Afghanistan. In Seoul, he is expected to reaffirm the U.S. security commitment to the South.

Other countries in the region, including China, are against the move.During his confirmation hearing in February, Carter pledged to significantly beef up missile defense, including deploying more ground-based missile interceptors in California and Alaska, saying North Korean missiles could pose a ""direct threat"" to the country.Last week, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey said he had ""productive conversations"" with his South Korean counterpart, Adm.

He'd earlier announced his retirement at the conclusion of the AFC Asian Cup in January in Australia but head coach Uli Stielike called him up one last time to give the energetic fullback a chance to get his swan song on home soil.Stielike has said he plans to start Cha and substitute for him toward the end of the first half, an arrangement that would allow fans to give him an ovation as he leaves the pitch. Then during halftime, the Korea Football Association (KFA) will hold a retirement ceremony for Cha, who has represented South Korea at two FIFA World Cups.With South Korea favored to beat New Zealand, Cha could leave the national team on a winning note -- his final Asian Cup match was a 2-1 loss to Australia in the championship final.South Korea, though, must step up its game to give the veteran a proper sendoff. It is coming off an uninspired 1-1 draw against Uzbekistan last Friday. Attacking midfielder Koo Ja-cheol scored his first international goal since last June but the rest of the team was otherwise flat at Daejeon World Cup Stadium.South Korea takes an undefeated record against New Zealand with five wins and one draw all-time.This will be South Korea's final game before the Asian qualifying matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup begin in June.Stielike had already been shorthanded before the match against Uzbekistan and the situation hasn't improved. Forward Ji Dong-won, who sat out Friday with a sprained ankle, will be available Tuesday. Yet the only other forward on the team, Lee Jeong-hyeop, had his forehead bloodied after a collision with an opposing player and had to leave the match after only 32 minutes. He had stitches above his left eye and may watch Tuesday's match from the bench.Defensive back Jeong Dong-ho, making his international debut Friday, suffered a sprained hip during that match and has since returned to his pro club, Ulsan Hyundai.Against Uzbekistan, Son Heung-min wasn't close to his dynamic self. In his stead, Lee Jae-sung, Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors midfielder playing in his first international contest, filled in ably as the offensive force. With midfield mainstay Ki Sung-yueng starting the night on the bench, Kim Bo-kyung, playing for Stielike for the first time, did yeoman's work on both ends as the central midfielder.In net on Friday, Stielike started Kim Seung-gyu, a backup during the Asian Cup, and is expected to go back to his No. 1 custodian, Kim Jin-hyeon, on Tuesday.

But Seoulâs JCS officials dismissed the speculation, arguing that Dempsey just touched on the progress in the ongoing efforts to improve interoperability in the alliesâ separate missile defense programs.Seoul and Washington have been trying to link the Southâs Air and Missile Defense-Cell and the U.S. Forces Koreaâs Theater Missile Defense-Cell. The AMD-Cell and TMO-Cell are the interception control centers that the allies have sought to connect to enhance the sharing of their intelligence on hostile missiles. âThe discussions (between Choi and Dempsey) focused on how to maximize interoperability in the operations of their respective defense systems including Seoulâs KAMD and the âKill Chainâ (preemptive strike) system,â a JCS official told reporters, declining to be named.As the THAAD issue has been intensely debated here, observers say that the allies might soon begin their consultations over the issue. U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is set to travel to Seoul next month and may discuss the issue with Seoul officials, they presumed.The THAAD issue has been a hot-button issue as China has repeatedly expressed its disapproval to its deployment in Korea, arguing that it would undermine Chinaâs security interests. Seoul has been cautious, to avoid straining ties with Beijing, which is its largest trading partner.On Thursday, Chinaâs Defense Ministry spokesperson Geng Yansheng reiterated Beijingâs concerns over THAAD. âOur stance on the deployment of the missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region is clear and consistent. We think that to deploy the missile defense system by some countries in the Asia-Pacific region is neither conducive to the strategic stability and mutual trust, nor to regional peace and stability,â he said.The THAAD is a core element of the U.S.â multilayered missile defense program. It is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the final phase of their flight, after detecting them with a radar that has a maximum range of about 1,800 km.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","dempsey held meeting in seoul ,staff said friday south korea ,korea evolving security threats seoul ,meeting in seoul during which ,hour meeting the two governments","['South Korea', 'U.S.', ""North Korea '"", 'Seoul', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'South Korea âs', 'JCS', 'Choi Yun - hee', 'U.S.', 'Martin Dempsey', 'Seoul', 'Dempsey', 'Choi', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Terminal High - Altitude Area Defense', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'Dempsey', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'MD', 'Seoul', 'Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'Seoul', 'JCS', 'Dempsey', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Missile Defense - Cell', 'the U.S. Forces Korea âs', 'Theater Missile Defense - Cell', 'AMD', 'Choi', 'Dempsey', 'Seoul', 'KAMD', 'JCS', 'thaad', 'U.S.', 'Ashton Carter', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'China âs Defense Ministry', 'Geng Yansheng', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.51429313  0.40869072

""We strongly call for their quick release and repatriation.""The North held a press conference for the two, which it identified as Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil, at the People's Palace of Culture in Pyongyang on Thursday. Speaking at a press briefing, unification ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol confirmed that Kim and Choe are South Korean nationals. But he refused to clarify whether they are related to the NIS.It is a matter that requires a South Korean government probe after they are freed and repatriated here, Lim said.He instead criticized the North for violating human rights and humanitarian spirit as well as international practices by unilaterally detaining the South's citizens without any notice to Seoul.In the Pyongyang press conference, meanwhile, an unnamed official at the North's Ministry of State Security branded them as ""heinous terrorists,"" according to Pyongyang's media.""They zealously took part in the anti-DPRK smear campaign of the U.S. imperialists and the puppet group of traitors to isolate and blockade the DPRK in the international arena by labeling it 'a country printing counterfeit notes' and 'sponsor of terrorism' while pulling it up over its 'human rights issue,'"" the North's official was quoted as saying.DPRK is the acronym for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.The official also accused the two of gathering information on the Workers' Party of Korea and other state and military secrets.Pyongyang released public footage and audio files of what it claims to be the two men's confessions of spying for the South's National Intelligence Service.With the North's security agents standing next to them, Kim and Choe said they were bribed by a senior NIS agent to collect information on the communist nation and criticize its system.In 2010, Kim said, he received an ""instruction"" from the NIS that the North's top leader might visit China by train and he provided the Seoul-based agency with information related to a railway station in a Chinese border town.He also said he offered information on the North's nuclear program. He admitted to have committed a grave crime and apologized for that.Kim was born in Daejeon, a South Korean city, and he had operated an underground church in the Chinese border city of Dandong since 2003, the North said, without specifying when and how he was arrested.As to Choe, it said, his hometown is the South's eastern city of Chuncheon, and the 56-year-old left his country in 2003 and spent many years in China. He was caught by the North's border guards after illegally entering the nation.The arrests of Kim and Choe are expected to add to already-strained ties between the two Koreas.It raised the number of South Koreans currently detained in the North to three.

Martin Dempsey began their 90-minute meeting in Seoul ""to deal with a wide range of issues, including how to deal with North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile threats and their preparedness,"" Seoul's JCS said.While the JCS and the defense ministry here have stressed that the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense issue would not be on the agenda, observers said the top military officers could touch upon the issue ""at least in an unofficial fashion.""The possible deployment of the missile-defense system has been a hot-button issue facing South Korea amid strong opposition from China, Seoul's largest trading partner.The U.S. hopes to deploy THAAD in South Korea to counter ballistic missile threats from North Korea and guarantee the safety of about 28,000 U.S. troops stationed here and their families, saying it is a purely defensive system.But China has repeatedly voiced its opposition to the possible deployment of a THAAD battery on South Korean soil, suspecting it is part of U.S. attempts to contain an increasingly assertive China.Heading for Japan, the first leg of his Asian tour, Dempsey said Tuesday that building an integrated air and missile-defense system will be a key topic of discussions when he meets with South Korean officials.Noting that Washington is making progress on building the integrated defense umbrella, the general said Seoul and Tokyo have ""made some commitments in procurements on their side to make us more interoperable.""As an integral part of the U.S.-led air defense system for the region, the THAAD is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles at high altitudes in their terminal phase.Â  Dempsey arrived here on Thursday for a three-day trip. It is considered a return visit before he leaves office at the end of September, according to the JCS, noting that Choi traveled to the U.S. in July.

Seoul is part of a regional trip that will also take her delegation to Myanmar, Vietnam and Japan, the sources said. She was to depart on the trip on Thursday.While in Seoul, she is expected to pay a visit to President Park Geun-hye and meet with South Korean National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa.Pelosi was the speaker when the House of Representatives adopted a landmark 2007 resolution on Japan's wartime sexual slavery that called on Tokyo to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility for the atrocity.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to whitewash the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has been the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Japan take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.

He came here following his three-day visit to Japan.On Friday, he is to meet with South Koreaâs Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Choi Yun-hee to discuss a range of bilateral and regional security issues, which may include the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system as part of the unofficial agenda. President Park Geun-hye walks with visiting Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey (left) along with Defense Minister Han Min-Koo (center) and U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert (right) at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. (Yonhap)South Koreaâs JCS has insisted that the THAAD issue is not on the agenda. But observers say that the two sides cannot help but discuss the issue, which has been intensely debated here amid Chinaâs repeated opposition to its deployment on the peninsula.On his flight to Japan, Dempsey said constructing an integrated air and missile defense system would be a key topic of talks when he meets with South Korean officials. He also said the U.S. is making progress on building an integrated missile defense umbrella, and Seoul and Tokyo have âmade some commitments in procurements on their side to make us more interoperable.âHis remarks triggered speculation that the U.S. military leader would play a role to start talks in earnest over the controversial THAAD issue. The allies have yet to begin any official consultations, although the U.S. conducted a site survey here to find locations for a THAAD battery.The U.S. has expressed its wish to deploy THAAD to better handle North Koreaâs missile threats. But Seoul has remained cautious about the issue due to strong opposition from Beijing, a crucial partner for trade, tourism and efforts to denuclearize the North.China has repeatedly expressed worries that the deployment of THAAD could undermine its security interests, while the U.S. has stressed that THAAD is an entirely defensive interception system designed to shoot down North Korean missiles.Amid increasing pressure on Seoul to clarify its hitherto vague position on the deployment of THAAD, Seoul said last week that Beijing should not attempt to exert its influence on Seoulâs defense policies, and that it would make an independent decision based strictly on the military efficacy of THAAD and national interests.The controversy is likely to continue as top defense officials of the allies are expected to meet next month. U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is expected to visit Seoul to meet with South Korean officials early next month, reports said, as he plans to visit Asia for the first time since he took office as Pentagon chief last month. The allies are also expected to touch on the THHAD issue when they hold the two-day Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue in Washington next month.The THAAD is a core element of the U.S.â multilayered missile defense program. It is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the final phase of their flight, after detecting the missiles with a radar that has a maximum range of about 1,800 km.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","in seoul on thursday drawing ,three day visit to seoul ,arrived in seoul on thursday ,martin dempsey arrived in seoul ,seoul on thursday drawing","['U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Martin Dempsey', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Dempsey', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the order of National Security Merit âs', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'South Korea âs', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Choi Yun - hee', 'Park Geun', 'the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Martin Dempsey', 'Defense', 'Han Min - Koo', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'Korea', 'JCS', 'thaad', 'China', 'Japan', 'Dempsey', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'North Korea âs', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'China', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'U.S. Defense', 'Ashton Carter', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Pentagon', 'THHAD', 'Korea', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.76502156  0.53232741

Carter also expressed gratitude for Han's ""unwavering support following the attack"" on the U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert, the department said in a statement.The planned visit by the top U.S. defense official comes at a time when Seoul is divided over whether to allow the U.S. to deploy a THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense battery on its soil, while officials of the two sides have said there have been no official consultations on the matter. Supporters say the deployment would help better protect against North Korea's ballistic missile threats, while opponents claim it would inflame tensions with China and Russia as they see the move as a threat to their security interests. During his confirmation hearing in February, Carter pledged to significantly beef up missile defense, including deploying more ground-based missile interceptors in California and Alaska, saying North Korean missiles could pose a ""direct threat"" to the country.In 2006, he openly called for a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean long-range missile that was being readied for a test-launch, claiming that the risk of inaction in the face of North Korea's race to threaten the U.S. would be greater than the risk associated with a pre-emptive strike.On Thursday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is set to arrive here for a three-day visit for talks with his counterpart on boosting the bilateral alliance.

With the signing of the pact, New Zealand has become South Koreaâs 13th bilateral free trade partner, officials said.âThe official signing of the free trade agreement has allowed the two countries to build a foundation for an upgraded cooperation not only in the field of economy but also in culture, human exchanges, security and international cooperation,â Park said. President Park Geun-hye shakes hands with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key at a press conference at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)The prime minister of New Zealand arrived in Seoul for a three-day trip on Sunday. It was his fourth visit to Asiaâs fourth-largest economy since 2010. The two sides concluded the deal in November during the G20 summit in Australia and will now request their parliaments to endorse it. Key said his government would work to get his parliamentâs approval by September at the latest.âThe agreement also symbolizes both Korea and New Zealandâs commitment to economic openness and market integration in the Asia-Pacific region,â Key said at a joint press conference after the summit.âI hope that ratifications can be completed by both countries this year so that New Zealand and Korea can start to receive the benefits of the agreement.â Park also asked Key for his support over Seoulâs decision on a Washington-led regional free trade agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Key told Park that he would cooperate closely with Seoul on the progress of TPP negotiations. New Zealand has participated in the negotiations. South Korea has expressed its interest but has so far not been involved.South Korea and New Zealand held seven rounds of negotiations since they began talks on the free trade pact in 2009. The two sides were having difficulties in narrowing differences in the last stage of negotiations, but a phone call between Park and Key in August helped conclude the deal, the presidential office told reporters. Last year, the two leaders agreed to elevate the positions of negotiators to deputy ministers and devise âcreative alternativesâ to help the two fairly enjoy benefits of the free trade pact.Under the pact, New Zealandâs import tariffs will be eliminated on 92 percent of all shipments from Korea in terms of their value and all tariffs on Korean products will be removed within seven years after the implementation of the deal. Korea will reciprocate by removing tariffs on 96.4 percent of shipments from New Zealand over a 15-year period. The two sides have agreed to immediately lift tariffs on washing machines and auto parts over the next three years. However, they agreed to exclude some products from the deal, mostly agricultural goods that are considered very sensitive in Korea.They also agreed to expand human exchanges in agricultural, livestock and Oriental medicine and seek new opportunities to jointly make inroads into emerging markets by strengthening cooperation between agricultural firms in both countries.During the summit, Park and Key agreed to promote an institutional framework in maritime cooperation and promote the joint development of weapon systems, information technology and health care. On maritime affairs, Korea has requested New Zealand to help Korean fishing fleets continue their operations in the countryâs exclusive economic zone. In 2014, bilateral trade between the two countries came to $3.2 billion, making New Zealand the 40th-largest trading partner of South Korea. New Zealand is the third-largest beef exporter to Korea, following Australia and the United States.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","agreement in seoul on monday ,in seoul on monday yonhap ,dae in seoul on monday ,seoul on monday yonhap the ,seoul on monday yonhap","['South Korea', 'New Zealand', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'New Zealand', 'John Key', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'New Zealand', 'South Korea âs 13th', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'New Zealand', 'John Key', 'Seoul', 'New Zealand', 'Seoul', 'G20', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'New Zealand âs', 'New Zealand', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'Seoul', 'TPP', 'New Zealand', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'New Zealand', 'New Zealand âs', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'New Zealand', 'Korea', 'oriental', 'Korea', 'New Zealand', 'korean', 'New Zealand', 'South Korea', 'New Zealand', 'Korea', 'Australia', 'the United States', 'Cho Chung - un']",18,"[ 4.          0.          0.         ... -0.40406558  0.2305204

Seoulâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (middle) and his Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Wang Yi (right) and Fumio Kishida respectively (Yonhap)When the summit will be held remains unclear, ...","The foreign ministers of South Korea, China and Japan agreed to work together to hold a trilateral summit at the most âmutually convenient, earliest timeâ during their first meeting in nearly three years in Seoul on Saturday. Seoulâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (middle) and his Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Wang Yi (right) and Fumio Kishida respectively (Yonhap)When the summit will be held remains unclear, but the agreement is expected to give a much-needed boost to the efforts to restore trilateral regional cooperation that has been undermined due to historical and territorial feuds, Seoul officials said.âOn the occasion of this foreign ministersâ meeting, we hope to move forward toward restoring a trilateral cooperative system,â read a joint press statement issued after the talks among Seoulâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Wang Yi and Fumio Kishida, respectively.âWe share the understanding that the trilateral cooperative system should remain and be developed as a crucial mechanism to promote peace, stability and prosperity in Northeast Asia.âSince the trilateral summit was last held in Beijing in May 2012, it has been suspended due to Tokyoâs failure to fully atone for its wartime wrongdoings and territorial spats with South Korea and China. The meeting had been held annually since 2008.Seoul and Tokyo currently hope for the revival of the summit talks, while Beijing remains cautious over the summit due to historical issues with Tokyo. Observers say that Beijing could agree to or reject the summit depending on the content of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâs statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in August.Reflecting Beijingâs cautious stance, the Chinese foreign minister stressed the importance of âcoming to grips with historyâ during a joint news conference.âThe history issue should be (discussed) in the present tense, not in the past tense. We should not drag it into the future (and thus resolve it quickly),â he said, using a set of Chinese phrases that are translated as âface history squarely and chart a future course.âThe joint statement said that based on the shared understanding that they would move forward into the future while facing history, they would work together to strengthen three-way cooperation and improve bilateral relations.In the statement, the three ministers also reaffirmed their united stance against Pyongyangâs pursuit of nuclear arms, urging the North to abide by related U.N. Security Council resolutions and other denuclearization commitments that the North has made with the international community.They agreed to work together for the âmeaningfulâ resumption of the long-stalled six-party denuclearization talks to âachieve a substantive progressâ on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The six-way talks that have been stalled since late 2008 involve the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia.On the sidelines of the trilateral meeting, the ministers held separate bilateral talks. Before the talks between Yun and the Chinese minister, media attention was focused on whether the two would discuss the U.S.â possible deployment of an advanced missile defense asset, which Beijing has repeatedly opposed. But Seoul officials said there was no discussion about the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system. To a reporterâs question of whether there was any discussion on THAAD, Wang Yi said, âWe have already expressed our stance repeatedly, and everybody knows it now.âDuring the talks between the Korean and Japanese ministers, the two sides agreed to encourage their ministries to pursue progress in their current consultations to resolve the issue of Korean women who were forced into sexual servitude by Japan during World War II.The two sides have discussed the sexual slavery issue in seven rounds of talks since last April, but have failed to narrow their differences. Seoul has called on Tokyo to take legal responsibilities and sincerely apologize for the wrongdoing, while Tokyo has maintained that every issue concerning its colonization of South Korea had been settled under a 1965 normalization deal.Meanwhile, President Park Geun-hye called for trilateral cooperation to make progress on the efforts to denuclearize North Korea, during her meeting with the Chinese and Japanese ministers at Cheong Wa Dae.âConsidering that the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue would help develop a stable inter-Korean relationship and contribute to the stability of Northeast Asia, the three nations need to gather their wisdom to achieve a substantive progress on the denuclearization of the North,â she said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","years in seoul on saturday ,held annually since 2008 seoul ,on saturday seoul foreign minister ,in seoul on saturday seoul ,saturday seoul foreign minister","['South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'Wang Yi', 'Fumio', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'Wang Yi', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Tokyo', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'Beijing', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe âs', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Pyongyang', 'U.N.

But Japan's refusal to face up to its wartime atrocities has sparked a diplomatic tension between the two.Last April, Seoul and Tokyo launched talks on Japan's sex slavery, but no breakthrough has been made due largely to Japan's attitude.A Seoul official said Monday that the two sides ""went beyond"" the repetition of their respective stances at the latest talks.But experts said there is a long way to go as speculation is growing that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not include words of apology for Japan's past atrocities in his new statement due out in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.Since taking office in early 2013, President Park has shunned a bilateral summit with Abe, calling on Japan to first sincerely apologize for the sex slavery issue.

Â Â ""The JCS chairmen of South Korea and the U.S. will boost their relationship, reaffirm their strong will for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and discuss ways on how to develop the alliance in the future,"" the JCS said in a statement.Â Â ""The chairmen are expected to deal with a wide range of pending issues, including how to deal with North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile threats and their preparedness for the transfer of the wartime operational control of South Korean troops,"" a JCS officer said.

It helped South Korea transform into an economic powerhouse from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War.""We need to improve a system related with foreign investment to ensure that heightened interest in South Korea by Middle East investors can lead to their investment in South Korea,"" Park said in a meeting at the presidential office meant to promote trade and investment.

Safety can be ensured, but the real issue is whether it will be economically viable,"" he said.Â Â The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission on Feb. 27 had approved a 10-year life span extension of Wolsong 1, the country's second-oldest reactor, after three rounds of drawn-out deliberations and heated debates largely over its safety.Â Â The life span of the 580-megawatt Kori 1 reactor, located some 410 kilometers southeast of Seoul, was extended by 10 years when its initial 30-year life span expired on June 18, 2007.Â Â The KHNP is required to submit a request for operational extension at least two years before the expiration.Â Â Cho said that operating the 38-year-old reactor for another 10 years may cost more than it can benefit the country.Â Â The expenses for running it for another decade will include costs for repairs and reinforcements, and also a large amount of financial support for residents around the reactor and the regional government, he said.Â Â Following the first life span extension of the Kori 1 reactor in 2007, the KHNP had to provide nearly 200 billion won ($177 million) in financial support for the local residents and the government. The amount accounts for more than 13 percent of the KHNP's annual profit of some 1.5 trillion won in 2014.Â Â The KHNP earlier said it had spent about 650 billion won to keep Wolsong 1 in maintenance. The cost will be lower for the Kori 1 reactor as refurbishments from the first extension in 2007 are still valid, Cho said.Â Â ""We can simply decide to continue operating the reactor if we find that the benefits from operating the reactor for another 10 years will outrun the cost. But for the entire country, the government may decide that building a new reactor to supply the equal amount of electricity will be more economically sound,"" he said.

(Yonhap)âWe hope that the U.S. and South Korea will make an appropriate decision over the potential deployment of THAAD,â he added, noting the two sides held âvery candid and freeâ talks over the issue.As for Seoulâs participation in the creation of the AIIB, Liu renewed Beijingâs calls on Seoul to join the China-led initiative as a founding member. Seoul has been cautious about its participation amid strong opposition from Washington which suspects the AIIB is a Chinese attempt to revise the regional financial order that has been led by the U.S. and Japan. But Seoul has to make its decision by the end of the month should it want to join the negotiations for the bankâs Articles of Agreement.Liu came to Seoul in return for Leeâs visit to Beijing last December. The day after Liu arrived here, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel also visited Seoul to discuss pending issues with Korean officials. The visits by the senior officials from Beijing and Washington fueled already tense public debate over the issues surrounding the THAAD and AIIB.As for the THAAD issue, Seoul has maintained âstrategic ambiguity.â It has said THAAD, a core asset of the U.S. global multilayered missile shield program, could be helpful for the defense of the South. But it has made it clear that there has been âno requestâ from the U.S., âno consultationsâ with the ally and âno decisionâ reached.Chinese officials including Chang Wanquan have repeatedly expressed their opposition to THAAD, apparently suspecting that the U.S. may consider using the system not only against North Korea, but also against other potential adversaries such as China and Russia.The Korean public has been divided over the THAAD issue: Some argue that strictly from the standpoint of security interests, Seoul should allow the U.S. Forces Korea to install an additional missile defense system here. But others argue it is inappropriate to make a decision to undermine Chinaâs security interests, while seeking greater economic relations through trade and exchanges with China.The AIIB issue has become more complicated after Britain decided to join the AIIB last week, a decision that frustrated the U.S., Britainâs core ally. Australia and France are also reportedly considering their participation.During an interview with a local daily, Seoulâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said that Seoul would make a âbalanced judgementâ in consideration of its interests, and that it would not bow to any outside pressure.Experts say that Seoul should try to persuade Washington and Beijing of its hopes to prevent the issues from harming bilateral ties, and take careful diplomatic steps based on its prudent calibration of national interests.âIt is a matter of how we can persuade China and the U.S. to understand our position. Rather than dithering over the issues or making blunt decisions that would provoke any of them, we should explore ways to persuade them in a low-profile and tenacious manner, and very cogently,â said Suh Jin-young, professor emeritus at Korea University.âWe should strive to gain their understanding by continuing to persuade them of our position. This calls for Seoulâs cautious, prudent and sophisticated diplomacy.âBy Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","renewed beijing calls on seoul ,putting seoul in tricky diplomatic ,china on monday raised pressure ,visited seoul to discuss pending ,building in seoul on monday","['China', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Liu Jianchao', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Liu', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Lee Kyung - soo', 'Lee Kyung - soo', 'chinese', 'Liu Jianchao', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'AIIB', 'Liu', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'AIIB', 'chinese', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Liu', 'Seoul', 'Lee', 'Beijing', 'Liu', 'U.S.', 'State', 'East Asian', 'Daniel Russel', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'thaad', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'Chang Wanquan', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'korean', 'thaad', 'Seoul', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'China', 'China', 'AIIB', 'Britain', 'AIIB', 'U.S.', 'Britain', 'Australia', 'France', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Suh Jin - young', 'Korea University', 'Seoul', 'song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.53463125  0.34256876

Â Â Experts say South Korea's decision on the THAAD issue could upset either the U.S. or China.Â Â U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken told reporters in Seoul last month that THAAD, if deployed, is aimed at exclusively dealing with the threat posed by North Korea, calling it a ""purely defensive and good system.""Â Â South Korea has said it does not plan to buy THAAD, but it is also not opposed to a possible deployment on Korean soil if Washington brings the advanced defense system here to protect the about 28,500 American troops stationed in the country.Â Â A government official said that Seoul plans to decide on the THAAD issue from a comprehensive perspective. It also delivered to China its hope that Beijing could do its part to resolve North Korea's evolving nuclear threats.Â Â Touching on a China-proposed development bank, Liu said that China repeated its hope for Seoul to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Â Â China launched the AIIB late last year with other 20 nations as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank, led by the U.S. and Japan.Â Â ""I explained the progress of the AIIB.

Â Â Liu, who arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a four-day visit, has been in charge of bilateral relations with Seoul, Pyongyang and Tokyo at China's foreign ministry since July 2014.Â Â Deputy foreign ministers of China and South Korea join hands at a trilateral meeting in Seoul, September 2014. Liu Zhenmin (left) from China and Lee Kyung-soo from Korea. (Yonhap)""The China-Korea relations are evolving as there have been vibrant exchanges at every level,"" Liu said at the start of the meeting.Â Â He said that it is very important to strengthen exchanges and share opinions on global, regional and bilateral issues between China and South Korea this year.Â Â Seoul's foreign ministry didn't disclose the meeting's agenda, but analysts speculated the two officials may discuss the possible deployment of an advanced U.S. missile-defense system on Korean soil and South Korea's potential joining of the China-proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Â Â China has explicitly voiced its opposition to Washington's possible deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery in South Korea, apparently out of concerns the move may be aimed at containing a rising China.Â Â Experts say South Korea's decision on the THAAD issue could unnerve either the United States or China.Â Â Seoul and Washington have said that there has been no consultation or decision about the possible deployment.Â Â U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken told reporters in Seoul last month that THAAD, if deployed, is aimed at exclusively dealing with the threat posed by North Korea, calling it a ""purely defensive and good system.""Â Â In addition, the question of whether Seoul will join the AIIB is one of the hottest issues for Seoul-Beijing relations.Â Â China launched the AIIB late last year with 21 nations as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank, led by the U.S. and Japan.Â Â The U.S. has raised concerns about the AIIB, citing its lack of transparency in decision-making processes. Washington apparently has pressed its ally Seoul to be cautious about joining the regional bank.Â Â Seoul plans to decide whether to join the AIIB soon as China has said the deadline to become a founding member of the bank is the end of March. Britain announced its plan last week to join the bank, becoming the first Western country to do so.Â Â Liu's visit to Seoul also coincides with a planned trip by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel.Â Â Russel was to arrive in Seoul later in the day for a two-day visit, during which he will meet with his Korean counterpart Lee to discuss issues of mutual interest and to reaffirm their countries' strong alliance, according to the foreign ministry.Â Â THAAD and the AIIB seem to be the highest on the agenda for the talks slated for Tuesday, according to government sources.Â Â On Monday, Russel plans to meet with U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Mark Lippert, who is recovering after sustaining injuries in a knife attack early this month.Â Â Lippert was slashed by anti-U.S. activist Kim Ki-jong on his face and wrist with a knife during a breakfast function in downtown Seoul on March 5, leaving the envoy with wounds that required 80 stitches.

Senior diplomats from South Korea, China and Japan held their meeting in Seoul on Wednesday, during which they discussed the agenda of their foreign ministers' meeting later this month. The upcoming foreign ministers' talks come after a nearly three-year hiatus and, if successful, will raise the prospects of a three-way summit among the three neighbors. The last trilateral summit was held in 2012.Diplomatic tensions between China and Japan run deep because of competing claims over islands in the East China Sea. Relations between Seoul and Tokyo also remain frayed over Japan's unrepentant attitude on its wartime atrocities, including the sexual enslavement of women by the Japanese military during World War II.""China attaches great importance to the (upcoming) foreign ministers' talks,"" Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said in the Wednesday meeting in Seoul, according to his remarks posted on the Chinese foreign ministry's website on Thursday.

""I will still be a 'dongne ajeossi' and 'sejuni appa,' as people in Korea have called me,"" he added, referring to his Korean nicknames, roughly translated as ""a dude in the neighborhood"" and ""Sejun's dad."" Sejun is the Korean middle name Lippert gave to his son, who was born here in January.Lippert spent five days at Yonsei University's Severance Hospital. Hospital officials said he will continue to receive treatment from home.Jung Nam-shik, head of the Yonsei University Health System, said the wounds on Lippert's left arm will require regular sterilization to prevent infection. The ambassador continued to experience pain in his left wrist, but it was manageable with a mild painkiller, Jung added.Lippert was slashed on his face and wrist last week by a knife-wielding South Korean man who attacked him at a breakfast function in downtown Seoul.Kim Ki-jong was arrested at the scene and has been detained on various charges, including attempted murder.Kim said he assaulted the ambassador to alert the U.S. to ""the fact that it hinders inter-Korean reunification."" He denies having meant to murder the envoy.South Korea remains technically at war with rival North Korea, with the U.S. stationing more than 28,000 troops here to deter North Korean aggression. Hard-core nationalists here argue that the U.S. gets in the way of Korean reunification, as Pyongyang considers U.S. troops here threatening.Kim was convicted in 2010 of throwing pieces of rock at a Japanese ambassador to Seoul. It was the first incident in South Korea in which a foreign envoy was attacked by a local.He fractured his right ankle when authorities overpowered him on Friday and will undergo surgery at the National Police Hospital this afternoon. Police said the interrogation will continue at the hospital.Authorities are continuing their probe to determine whether Kim has violated a controversial security law that bans people from openly praising North Korea.Kim was already found to have traveled to the North seven times between 1999 and 2007. He also tried to erect an altar in the heart of Seoul that honors late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2011, according to authorities.About a dozen books were recently found in Kim's home that are suspected of being dangerously pro-North Korea in nature, including ""On the Art of Cinema"" written by Kim Jong-il.Possession of pro-North Korea books alone would not be sufficient to charge Kim with violating the National Security Law.Authorities would need to prove that Kim tried to threaten national security or destabilize South Korea's democratic order with these materials.Kim reportedly told officers he considers North Korean founder Kim Il-sung a ""great leader of the 20th century"" with no leader in South Korea coming close.Lippert, 42, is the youngest U.S. ambassador to South Korea. He took office in October and his wife gave birth to a son here. His son was given a Korean middle name.Meanwhile, police have apprehended a 71-year-old man who allegedly called in a phone treat to YTN, a local cable news channel, earlier Thursday to protest the TV showing of Lippert's injured face.The man, identified only by his surname Song, allegedly called to say he would blow up the YTN headquarters if the channel continued to show Lippert's injured face on TV.Song reportedly said he had made several such requests before and would not tolerate another display of Lippert's injury.He was arrested near Seoul's YTN headquarters about six hours after the call was made. Police are investigating his motive.

The incident prompted concerns that it could sour public sentiment in both countries and make it difficult for the allies to work together on key issues in the future.âThough weâve been having extensive high-level consultations, weâre trying to arrange another round for an early date,â a Foreign Ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. âAs both countries repeatedly said, the attack should not and will not affect the bilateral relationship and we will make public diplomacy efforts to prevent any bad perceptions from spreading.â As part of the efforts, Kim Hong-kyun, former secretary for international cooperation at Cheong Wa Daeâs National Security Office who is expected to take over as deputy foreign minister for political affairs later this month, could travel to Washington following his official appointment. The Foreign Ministry is believed to be also considering visits by other ranking officials including Minister Yun Byung-se and Vice Minister Cho Tae-yong, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly plans to visit Northeast Asia next month. The envisioned trips would also provide the allies with scope to improve policy coordination and align public messages in the face of growing signs of a discord over their approaches toward North Korea and Japan. The U.S. came under fire after Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman implicitly blamed Seoul and Beijing for taking advantage of ânationalist feelingsâ for domestic interests and thus thwarting greater cooperation involving Tokyo. Though officials quickly stepped in to downplay them, Shermanâs remarks kindled concerns that the Shinzo Abe administration may now press more freely ahead with its ongoing revisionist drive while refusing to change its unrepentant stance toward sex slavery and other atrocities during World War II.The U.S. State Department also reaffirmed Washingtonâs commitment to the alliance, issuing a statement saying it would not be deterred by âsenseless acts of violence.â Lippert, for his part, has been gaining compliments for his poised response, with his Twitter account being increasingly flooded with cheers and wishes for a swift recovery. âDoing well & in great spirits! Robyn, Sejun, Grigsby & I â deeply moved by the support! Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK alliance! Gachi gapshida! (Letâs go together!),â he wrote on the microblogging site late Thursday. âLippert looks forward to getting back to work with his Korean counterparts to strengthen our bilateral relationship and to jointly address regional and global challenges,â the department said in a statement.

Mark Lippert is recovering in a hospital after surgery, and ""is doing well and in great spirits."" She cited a message the ambassador tweeted earlier in the day.""The U.S.-ROK alliance is strong; we will not be deterred by senseless acts of violence,"" she said.Harf also noted that both South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se called Lippert to express condolences and wish him a speedy recovery.""Ambassador Lippert looks forward to getting back to work with his Republic of Korean counterparts to strengthen our bilateral relationship and to jointly address regional and global challenges,"" the spokeswoman said.Harf said the suspect is in custody and U.S. law enforcement is cooperating closely with Korean police in the investigation. She also said she ""cannot speculate on a motive at this time.""The attack -- the first terrorist attack on a top U.S. envoy in Seoul -- occurred at a breakfast function in central Seoul, where Lippert planned to give a lecture organized by a coalition of South Korean civic groups dedicated to forge national consensus on unification with North Korea.The knife-wielding assailant, identified as 55-year-old Kim Ki-jong, slashed Lippert on the face and wrist when he was having breakfast. The ambassador was immediately taken to a hospital and received more than 80 stitches. Hospital officials said he will need to remain hospitalized for three to four days.The attacker was immediately arrested. As he was hauled away, Kim shouted his opposition to joint military exercises under way between South Korea and the U.S. North Korea has strongly condemned such annual drills as a rehearsal for an invasion of the country.In Saudi Arabia, Secretary of State John Kerry also said the U.S. ""will never be intimidated or deterred by threat or by anybody who harms any American diplomat."" ""We will remain as resolved as ever to pursue what we believe is in the interests of our country and with respect to universal rights and values,"" Kerry told reporters during a visit to the Middle Eastern nation, according to the department. ""And whoever threatens or harms our diplomats, I can assure them, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" he said.Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also called the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea ""very strong, and very important.""""I was very concerned to learn of the violent attack on Ambassador Lippert in Seoul. My thoughts are with the Ambassador as he begins his recovery from the injuries sustained in this attack,"" Royce said in a statement.""Ambassador Lippert holds an important post, entrusted with the very strong, and very important, relationship between the United States and South Korea. I am thankful to Ambassador Lippert and the many U.S. diplomats abroad. They do important work,"" he said.U.S. experts said the incident won't have any impact on relations between the two countries.""This kind of an attack can happen in any country, including the United States, and by people from any country. The American people and American officials understand this, so it will have absolutely no effect on U.S.-Korean relations,"" said David Straub, associate director for the Korean Studies Program at Stanford University.Such a case is ""a one- or two-day story in the media"" in the U.S., he added.Evans Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary who also served as duty chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, said the alliance-partnership between the two countries is stronger than ever, certainly strong enough and resilient enough to deal with this reprehensible act.""Lippert's father expressed shock and worries.""This was something we felt pretty secure in because South Korea is a friendly country. He seemed to be well received, and seemed to be progressing really well within the citizenry,"" the ambassador's father, Jim Lippert, said at his home in Ohio, according to WCPO television.""So it did come as a shock to us that in that venue he would be subjected to an assault of this nature,"" he said. He added the ambassador never got hurt when he served in Afghanistan and Iraq as an intelligence officer with the Navy SEALS.The father said he is proud of his son.""How does it make me feel? I'm sorrowful that it happened. It caused me great anxiety. It caused my family great anxiety and despair,"" he said. ""But how do I feel about him? I feel proud of him.""

The massive participation of Korean companies reflects the significance of her trip, which comes at a critical time when the Gulf nations are attempting to diversify their business portfolio to prepare for the post-oil era, he said. In the past, the Middle East was a business destination for energy and construction companies, but the region is increasingly opening new markets for a wide range of soft industries including information technology, medical services and renewable energy.âThe presidential trip to the Middle East is expected to bring significant economic achievements as we expect to sign a number of MOUs with our counterparts,â An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economy, said.

The two countriesâ foreign ministries held the fourth session of consultation in Seoul last March after 11 dormant years. During last yearâs general-director-level meeting, the two sides exchanged views on issues of common interest: increasing the visit of high-level delegates; establishing legal institutions for trade and investment; holding bilateral economic forums; cooperating at international bodies; and facilitating official development assistance. âKoreaâs successful development from the ashes of the Korean War (1950-53) provides a great model of progress for Sudan,â Abdelaal said. âWe appreciate Koreaâs contribution in providing human resources, education and capacity-building.âÂ Sudanese Ambassador Mohamed AbdelaalSudan and Korea established consular relations in 1976 and diplomatic relations in 1977. Abdelaal was hopeful that Sudanese natural resources could be combined with Korean capital and technology. He suggested energy, agriculture, food, textiles and leather, petrochemicals and metals as potential areas of investment. Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Hyundai Motors are currently operating in Sudan and bilateral trade volume reached $300 million in 2013, according to the embassy.Sudan and South Sudan have an estimated 6.8 billion barrels of oil reserves, of which more than 75 percent belongs to South Sudan. As the countryâs main export, oil has helped Sudanâs economy grow at more than 4 percent a year since 2010.Chinese, Malaysian and Indian state oil companies have formed a consortium with their Sudanese counterpart Sudapet for the production, refinery and export of petroleum. No Korean companies have invested in Sudanâs oil sector.âSudan also has abundant natural resources, agricultural land, fresh water supply and livestock,â the ambassador said. Agriculture makes up a third of the countryâs gross domestic product, employing 80 percent of the workforce. South Sudan declared independence from its northern neighbor, Sudan, after nearly six decades of civil war that killed more than 2 million people. But a power struggle between South Sudanâs President Salva Kiir and first Vice President Riek Machar, has plunged South Sudan into violence since early last year, with 1.2 million refugees and 850,000 internally displaced persons. After a request from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Korea dispatched a 270-member contingent of military engineers and medics to South Sudan in August 2013. They have provided peacekeeping assistance as part of the U.N. mission in Bor, Jonglei state.Korea recognized South Sudanâs sovereignty and established ambassador-level diplomatic relations in July 2011.âThere are still post-independence issues that need to be settled between Sudan and South Sudan particularly marking the border and arranging security,â the ambassador explained, adding that the two governments now had friendly relations. âThere is close security coordination under the auspices of the two presidents, but the presence of some rebel groups in South Sudan remains an obstacle to fully normalizing our relations,â he said.Sudan has been hit by U.S. economic sanctions since late 2006, after it denied access to joint African Union-U.N. peacekeeping forces in the Darfur region. The embassy explained that the U.S. has lifted some sanctions to allow agricultural produce, food and communications hardware and software into the country since 2013. There are currently about 100 Sudanese students studying at Korean universities and the number of applicants has seen a significant rise in recent years, the embassy said.

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)He was appointed the new ambassador to Korea last December, replacing Konstantin Vnukov. The holiday was introduced in 1919 to commemorate the first mass draft into the Red Army on Feb 17, 1918, as part of the Russian Civil War (1917-22). After several date and name changes, it was given its current name and decreed a national holiday by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2002. âUnder present conditions, our country is strengthening its position as a democratically, economically and militarily strong nation,â the ambassador said. âRussia has consistently advocated the formation of democratic, equitable and polycentric world order, excluding interference in the internal affairs of other states.âTimonin has written a number of books and articles on peace and security and multilateral economic cooperation in Korea and Northeast Asia. He participated in the six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing North Korea as a deputy head of the Russian delegation from 2004-06. The ambassador noted that an integral part of Russia-Korea relations was military cooperation not directed against third countries. âI am confident that further expanding our bilateral relations and military contacts will contribute to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia,â he said. This year marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Russia and South Korea and Russiaâs 70th anniversary of defeating Nazi Germany. A grand-scale national event is scheduled in Moscow on May 9, to which international leaders, including South Korean President Park Geun-hye and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, have been invited.

Saudi Arabia accounts for about one-third of South Korea's total imports of crude oil.The trip will also take Park to the UAE and Qatar for separate talks with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Cooperation in energy, construction and healthcare are also expected to be their major topics.Healthcare has emerged as a new promising area of cooperation between South Korea and Middle East countries. Earlier last month, a specialist hospital managed by Seoul National University Hospital (SNU), one of South Korea's top medical centers, opened in the UAE.The opening ceremony of the Sheikh Khalifa Specialist Hospital came eight months after SNU was selected as the consignment manager of the largest specialist hospital in the Middle East for five years.It marked the first time that a South Korean hospital has won a consignment contract with a foreign hospital.Park is set to return home on March 9.

Â Â The much-anticipated speech by Abe will be closely watched by Japan's neighbors amid speculation that Tokyo might tone down its past apologies to wartime atrocities. Â Â ""We hope that Japan, on this special occasion, can show an attitude that honestly reflects upon its history and win back the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community,"" Hong told a regular press briefing. Â Â Abe has angered both South Korea and China by making a controversial visit to the Yasukuni shrine, which honors 14 Class A Japanese criminals convicted by the Allies in the trials that followed the war, in December 2013. Â Â Abe's cabinet had also suggested that it could review a landmark 1993 apology for the Japanese Imperial Army's sexual slavery of women during the war. Â Â According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly Korean, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during the war when the Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony. Those sex slaves were euphemistically described by the Japanese military as ""comfort women.""Â Â Earlier this month, a group of American history scholars expressed strong protest against Japan's attempts to pressure a textbook publisher to change the description of Japan's wartime sex slavery.

The Shinzo Abe administration sent a vice minister-level official for a third straight year since its launch to the âTakeshima Dayâ ceremony in Shimane Prefecture attended by some 500 politicians, local government officials and residents. The islets are an âinherent part of Japanâs territory under international law. We will make all-out efforts for a peaceful solution to the problem,â Yohei Matsumoto, a Cabinet Office parliamentary secretary, was quoted as saying at the event. The Foreign Ministry here called the decision âdeplorable,â reiterating that the outcrops were Korean territory âhistorically, geographically and under international law.â âThe Japanese governmentâs repeat of this behavior not only attests to its denial of the history of aggression on the Korean Peninsula by imperial Japan, but also marks a retrograde act that questions the sincerity of its proclaimed resolve to open a new relationship with Korea ahead of the 70th anniversary of its normalization,â ministry representative Noh Kwang-il said in a statement. The territorial row is a perennial thorn in the two old foesâ checkered relations, coupled with Tokyoâs sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II and recurring falsification of historical descriptions in diplomatic and defense papers, schoolbooks and other documents.Tension is growing as Abe is expected to unveil yet another revisionist view through a statement on Aug. 15 to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, following Japanâs review last year of the 1993 apology for the sex slavery it forced on women from Korea and other parts of Asia during the conflict.

Bilateral diplomatic services in Georgia have been handled by the Korean Embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan.Â  Georgian Ambassador to Korea Nikoloz Apkhazava. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldSituated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia and between the energy-rich Caspian and Black seas, Georgia offers a wealth of tourism attractions, including UNESCO heritage sites, national parks, mineral water springs, and summer and winter resorts.Georgia received 5.6 million tourists last year and more than 4,000 Korean tourists traveled to Georgia on trekking, skiing, golfing and wine tours in 2013.âOur tourism and hospitality sectors have seen soaring demands for development, and Korean companies can participate in constructing hotels,â the ambassador said.Additional areas awaiting foreign investment include infrastructure development, construction, and the manufacturing and energy sectors.The Korea Water Resources Corp. and Georgian Partnership Fund signed an agreement last year to develop a $1 billion, 280-megawatt hydropower station in Svaneti province in northern Georgia.Korean conglomerates including Hyundai Motors, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics have invested in Georgia, and small and medium-sized Korean companies, including Dohwa Engineering and Pyunghwa Engineering, are currently involved in energy and infrastructure projects.âDespite our small territory (70,000 square kilometers) and population (5 million), Georgia has actively sought to diversify its foreign policy channels with a new focus on the Asia-Pacific,â Apkhazava said.âAs a strategic transport and energy corridor in the Caucasus region, Georgia can cooperate with Korea on its Eurasia Initiative through joint ventures in transport infrastructure, (and) energy networks.âKoreaâs Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and his Georgian counterpart Tamar Beruchashivili met on the sidelines of the Davos Forum in Switzerland on Jan. 22 this year to discuss ways to activate bilateral consultative mechanisms and economic cooperation.Yun and Beruchashivili noted the surge in trade between the two countries, which has risen 17-fold over the past five years.Tbilisi signed an Association Agreement with the European Union last June, which is expected to provide a âqualitative leapâ in internal government policy regarding judicial, political, economic and social standards, according to the embassy.âGeorgia has always striven to be a full-fledged member of the European family,â Apkhazava said, explaining that European integration had long been a strategic goal of Georgiaâs foreign policy.Tbilisi initiated a statewide reform in 2003 to fight corruption, eliminate poverty and attract foreign investment. It also implemented policies to decentralize bureaucracy and strengthen democracy, human rights and rule of law, Apkhazava said.According to the World Bankâs Ease of Doing Business Survey in 2014, Georgia ranked eighth out of 189 countries in the world. The Heritage Foundation 2014 Index of Economic Freedom rated Georgiaâs economic freedom 22nd in terms of public finance, property rights, investment and monetary freedoms.The country saw a steady gross domestic product growth at 7 percent on average from 2004-08 and received significant foreign capital inflow following privatization and the creation of free industrial zones.Currently, about 30 Georgian students are studying in Korea on scholarships offered by the Korea Foundation, Korea International Cooperation Agency and universities.

Though Seoul is yet to recognize the state of Palestine and maintains close ties with Israel its longtime foe across the border, Riad Malki was upbeat about relations with South Korea, raising hopes for a boost especially in economic and development cooperation. âIâm hoping to complete the process and set up the mission as soon as possible, whether it be a representative office or embassy, which will help improve the two countriesâ relations,â Malki said at a news conference in Seoul.Â  Riad MalkiThe 60-year-old former university professor arrived in Seoul on Thursday and held talks with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se on Friday. During his five-day stay, he was scheduled to meet with high-level officials and senior lawmakers and visit the truce border village of Panmunjeom.Despite its reluctance to endorse the âtwo-stateâ solution, South Korea has been expanding aid and stepping up efforts to enhance ties with Palestine. While Yun traveled to Ramallah in December, South Korea launched a permanent mission there in August after nearly seven years of running a representative office without a full-time diplomat. Seoul largely supports the plan for a Palestinian mission here, but Palestineâs request for financial assistance for its operation remains a challenge, a ministry official said, calling it unprecedented. With its conflict with Israel remaining deadlocked, Malki said Palestine is âreadyâ to resume negotiations but stressed that Jerusalem must âcompletely stopâ its construction of settlements in the West Bank and clearly set the deadline for an end to Israelâs occupation. He also lambasted a move in U.S. Congress to cut off assistance to Palestine as it spurs its bid to join the International Criminal Court, aimed partly at bringing Israel to justice for the massive attack in the Gaza Strip since June 2013.âWe should be making preparations for a restart of negotiations, rather than sitting idle, waiting for Israelâs general election to end until March,â Malki said, calling for the international community to share wisdom and ânot to repeat past failures.â âU.S. Congressâ threats of slashing aid by half due to our ICC membership is gravely wrong; only the U.S. and Israel criticized our efforts to align our law with international law while the entire international community welcomed it.âBy Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","with south korea raising hopes ,minister said friday though seoul ,korea raising hopes for boost ,south korea raising hopes for ,at news conference in seoul","['South Korea', 'the Palestinian Authority', 'palestinian', 'Seoul', 'Palestine', 'Israel', 'Riad Malki', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Riad MalkiThe', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'South Korea', 'Palestine', 'Ramallah', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'palestinian', 'Palestine', 'Israel', 'Malki', 'Palestine', 'Jerusalem', 'the West Bank', 'Israel', 'U.S. Congress', 'Palestine', 'the International Criminal Court', 'Israel', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Israel', 'ICC', 'U.S.', 'Israel', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 4.          0.          0.         ... -0.65950048  0.29575035

In the Philippines, 10 South Koreans were killed last year while 13 were murdered there in 2013. Four Korean drug dealers were executed in China last year alone.Â Â To beef up its response capacity, Seoul plans to increase the number of consular staff members after selecting 10 overseas missions in countries prone to accidents and crime. It will also send one more police officer to the Philippines to join local police officials in handling crimes involving South Koreans there.Â Â Touching on drug-related crime, the Seoul government said it plans to raise alertness against involvement in such offenses in foreign countries.Â Â It said it will also send government officials to China to promote cooperation with related authorities to prevent South Koreans from committing drug-related crimes there.

Â  Â Also on the agenda will be President Park Geun-hye's possible attendance to the Russian ceremony as well as the North Korean leader's participation in the event, according to diplomatic sources. Â Â Seoul has yet to decide whether Park would attend the Russian ceremony although she was reportedly invited. Â Â The foreign ministers are also expected to touch on ways to resume the long-stalled six-party talks on ending North Korea's nuclear program as well as the current state of the communist country.

It also controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century. A high-level trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 amid long-standing historical grievances.Â Â Since taking office in early 2013, President Park has shunned a bilateral summit with Abe, calling on Japan to first sincerely apologize over the sex slavery issue.Â (Yonhap)","ministers in seoul late march ,seoul late march in bid ,ministers meeting around late march ,foreign ministers in seoul late ,ministers in seoul late","['South Korea', 'China', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Myanmar', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'China', 'Japan', 'Senkaku', 'Japan', 'China', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'asian', 'China', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Japan']",13,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.70000386  0.31355643

Chinese Gen. Chang Wanquan(left) and Korean defense chief Han Min-koo(right).Seoulâs Defense Minister Han Min-koo and his Chinese counterpart Gen. Chang Wanquan held the countriesâ first top-level defense talks since 2011 to discuss a range of regional and bilateral issues including North Koreaâs nuclear threats.âThe Chinese side conveyed their worries about the possible deployment of the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system to the peninsula,â a senior Seoul defense official told reporters, refusing to elaborate further on Changâs remarks for diplomatic courtesy.âMinister Han said that Seoulâs stance remains unchanged. No decision has been made by the U.S. and Washington has yet to call for any official consultation with Seoul on the issue,â he said, declining to be named.The issue of the THAAD deployment has emerged as one of the thorniest issues in South Korea-China relations since the U.S. expressed its desire last year to bring in the missile defense asset here to better counter North Korean threats. China believes the THAAD could potentially target it.Seoul has so far maintained a cautious stance as the deployment of any core U.S. missile defense assets would be perceived as participation in the U.S.-led missile shield program to the detriment of Seoulâs relations with Beijing and Moscow.To avoid fraying ties with the regional powers, Seoul has been working on developing its independent Korea Air and Missile Defense system â a low-tier, multiple-interception program that destroys incoming missiles at altitudes of 40-50 km.Chang is the first Chinese defense chief to visit Seoul since 2006. Later in the day, he met with President Park Geun-hye at Cheong Wa Dae.During the defense ministersâ talks, the two sides agreed to establish a hotline between the two ministries at an early date this year to deepen strategic communication and bilateral cooperation.Seoul also agreed to return the remains of 68 Chinese troops killed during the 1950-53 Korean War in March. Last year, Seoul repatriated the remains of 437 Chinese troops as part of efforts to improve the bilateral partnership.The Chinese minister shared the view that the South Korea-U.S. alliance contributes to deterring North Korean provocations and managing stability and peace in East Asia, Seoul officials said.Han explained in response that Seoulâs basic position is to pursue a âharmonious developmentâ of a comprehensive alliance with the U.S. and a strategic partnership with China, the officials said.On the issue of cyberthreats, the two sides recognize the need for enhanced cooperation as the issue concerning the new security domain has become an international one that requires a transnational approach.Following the meeting, Chang headed to Cheong Wa Dae for talks with Park.The president called for Chinaâs support for Seoulâs efforts to lay the groundwork for national reunification.âI think it is about time (for the two Koreas) to work together to increase bilateral exchanges and make substantive progress for our efforts toward reunification, through some kind of inter-Korean dialogue,â Park told Chang. âIn that regard, I think it is time for the international community including China to pay more attention and offer cooperation for our efforts to lay the foundation for reunification.â Chang is to leave Seoul on Thursday.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","in seoul on wednesday chinese ,defense chief to visit seoul ,seoul on wednesday chinese gen ,seoul defense official told reporters ,in seoul on wednesday","['China', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Chang Wanquan(left', 'korean', 'Han Min - koo(right).Seoul', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'chinese', 'Chang Wanquan', 'North Korea âs', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Chang', 'Han', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'China', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Seoul', 'Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'Chang', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Han', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Chang', 'Park', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'inter - korean', 'Chang', 'China', 'Chang', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",9,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.75289315  0.85820472

Sherman stressed Washington supports Seoul's initiative for talks with the North.Â Â Despite the stalled multilateral denuclearization talks, the U.S. has not utterly shut the door on dialogue with the North as it recently attempted to have exploratory talks with the country, but with no avail.Â Â Sung Kim, Washington's top nuke envoy, had offered to meet with North Korea's top nuclear negotiator in a third country during his recent trip to Asia, according to a diplomatic source.

Lee Byung-suk of the Saenuri Party (right), at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. (Lee Gil-dong/The Korea Herald)But Ambassador Mark Lippert disappointed some South Korean lawmakers when he refrained from talking in length about Japanâs refusal to apologize for its sexual enslavement of Korean women in World War II, known widely as the comfort women issue.âWe support the Park Geun-hye administrationâs efforts to pursue unconditional talks with North Korea,â Lippert said.âPresident Obama and this administration stand ready for credible and authentic negotiations that could lead to a creative solution (on the North Korea nuclear issue).âBut the North does not seem interested in talking with the U.S. or the South, and even with China, its largest benefactor, the ambassador added.Lippertâs comments echo those made in response to criticism earlier this year that South Korea and the U.S. had failed to present a unified North Korea policy. Park had pursued talks while Obama had increased sanctions on Pyongyang over the Northâs reported hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment.Lippert was forced to forgo much of his breakfast as he took time to answer multiple questions from South Korean lawmakers at the morning meeting. Most of the questions focused on the U.S.â North Korea policy, and the communist stateâs nuclear missile program.But Rep. Park In-sook of the governing Saenuri Party was able to squeeze in a question regarding the comfort women issue toward the end of the meeting.âI would like to ask what is the U.S.â stance on the sex slaves issue,â Rep. Park said in English. Lippert initially pointed to Obamaâs statements last April that Japanâs treatment of the comfort women was a âterrible, egregious violation of human rights.âBut he appeared to avoid getting the U.S. involved in the sensitive issue.âWe continue to not mediate, but encourage both sides to come to a solution that is suitable and appropriate which will satisfy both governments, allowing them to move forward. But we recognize that this is a difficult, emotional issue,â he said.Rep. Park expressed disappointment with the ambassadorâs remark in a phone interview with The Korea Herald later Tuesday.âI was extremely disappointed,â the lawmaker said regarding the U.S.âs refusal to mediate and take a firmer stance on what she called âJapanâs efforts to destroy history, especially on the sex slaves issue.âSouth Korea blames Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâs revisionist views on history for worsening ties between Seoul and Tokyo. Abe has made comments contradicting former apologies by Japanese leaders over the countryâs aggression and war crimes during World War II.âI think this is something most of the people here in Korea want. The U.S. must take a more active role on (the comfort women issue),â Rep. Park added when asked if others in the Saenuri Party shared her opinion.Last month, Abe vowed to campaign against U.S. textbooks that referred to the comfort women as sex slaves, saying the depiction was not true.McGraw-Hill, one U.S. publisher, has refused to rewrite related textbooks.âI would like to give (McGraw-Hill) a pat on the back,â Rep.

China's claim could push the demarcation line close to South Korean shores, a condition not accepted by Seoul.As little progress has been made, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed last July to expedite negotiations on the issue this year.Adding to the EEZ issue, Seoul and Beijing remain at odds over China's 2013 declaration of its new air defense identification zone over the East China Sea that encroaches upon South Korea's and includes the Seoul-controlled submerged rock of Ieodo.Ieodo, which is 4.6 meters below sea level, lies within the overlapping EEZs of South Korea and China. Although international maritime law stipulates that a submerged rock cannot be claimed as territory by any country, South Korea effectively controls Ieodo, which is closer to it than any other country.Ieodo is located 149 kilometers southwest of Korea's southernmost island of Marado and 247 kilometers northeast of the nearest Chinese island Tongdao.South Korea has reinforced its jurisdiction over the islet, and as part of such efforts, it built an unmanned maritime research station on it in 2003 to monitor weather conditions and survey maritime features in the area.

Earlier this month, the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea following the North's alleged hacking attack on Sony Pictures.""We do not have concerns with the speed or scope of the inter-Korean dialogue as proposed by President Park (Geun-hye). We are quite comfortable and there is no daylight between us,"" Lippert said in an interview with a group of reporters.Lippert, 42, said that Seoul seems to be ready to dialogue with the North unconditionally, but North Korea is putting ""conditions and caveats"" on the resumption of the inter-Korean talks.""In the case of North Korea, what you don't have is a serious interlocutor on the other side of the table. You've seen most recently conditions and caveats to resume the inter-Korean dialogue,"" he added, when asked about a difference between North Korea and Cuba.The ambassador said that the U.S. is still open to dialogue with Pyongyang, but the ball is in North Korea's court as it should show sincere commitment toward denuclearization.Â ""When North Korea is ready for credible negotiations leading to complete, irreversible and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, (the U.S.) administration stands ... ready to engage in dialogue,"" Lippert said.Touching on frayed Seoul-Tokyo ties, the U.S. envoy said that the U.S. will not play a mediator role between South Korea and Japan, but it will ""encourage"" the two sides to have further talks to explore improvement in their relations.Â ""Our role is not to mediate but to encourage two great nations with two democratically elected leaders to come to a resolution on this.""He expressed hope that dialogue between Seoul and Tokyo, including the sex slavery issue, could produce a satisfactory conclusion that could help the bilateral ties move forward in a ""more robust fashion.""This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between Seoul and Tokyo and it also marks the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's 1910-45 colonial rule.The two countries hope to mend their strained ties this year, but Japan's refusal to sincerely apologize over its wartime atrocities, such as its coercion of Korean women into sex slavery, has been the main stumbling block.Lippert said that the matter of so-called ""comfort women"" is a ""tough and very emotional"" issue, saying that the U.S. remains supportive of previous Japanese governments' apologies for the sex slavery and its colonial rule.Â ""We continue to have expressed support for the Kono Statement and the Murayama Statement as well and continue to believe that those are important statements that undergird the issue,"" he said.Lippert's remarks came amid growing concerns that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may issue a new statement that doesn't include Tokyo's apology over its wartime wrongdoing in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the country's defeat in World War II.Abe said last week that he would not use key words from Japan's previous apologies for its wartime atrocities in his new statement.Japan issued two key statements containing apologies for past wrongdoing -- the 1993 apology on the sex slavery issue, named the Kono Statement, and the 1995 apology for Japan's colonial rule, named the Murayama Statement.Lippert assumed the post in late October 2014 as the youngest U.S. ambassador to South Korea.

Weâve been able to broaden our design spectrum through new crafts and concepts.â Professor Ha Ji-soo, who teaches textile merchandising and fashion design at the university and directed the event, said, âWe are so grateful to Kopenhagen Fur and the Danish Embassy for their support. The scope of assistance was truly beyond our imagination.âAs a de facto developed country, Denmark has the capacity to invest heavily and wisely in long-term partnerships.âThrough bilateral cooperation, secured through a memorandum of understanding last March, students received high-quality materials, a sewing machine and expertise in working with furs, while Kopenhagen Fur has gained innovative designs.Aside from collaborating year-round, a weeklong Korea-Denmark exchange took place last year featuring workshops and training. The exchange helped expand mutual cultural understanding, according to the professor. âAt first, there were students who were thin-skinned about making fur coats due to the killing of animals,â Ha said. âBut our main philosophy has been to break the stereotypes that fur coats are unethical, expensive and wasteful. We have worn furs for millions of years. We can also wear them as casual, affordable and friendly clothes.âModels pose at the âFuture Furâ fashion show at Seoul National Universityâs Museum of Art last Tuesday.

""The first thing to do is to address the reason for the suspension of the tour.""It's unusual for a senior South Korean government official to say openly and clearly that Seoul hopes to send travelers again to the mountain along the North's east coast.The inter-Korean project was suspended in 2008 right after a South Korean tourist there was shot dead by a North Korean coast guard.The South has demanded the North offer a formal apology and guarantee the security and safety of tourists. Although Pyongyang is apparently eager to restart the tour program, it has rejected Seoul's call and instead searched for foreign partners.The Park Geun-hye administration, Ryoo said, is well aware of the international community's concern that the North is seeking to earn hard cash through the tour business for its nuclear and missile programs.Some observers say the Mount Kumgang project, if resumed, would violate the U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang.The minister said it's a matter to be judged by the U.N.Security Council.On the possibility of inter-Korean talks, Ryoo said he is still cautiously optimistic.In his New Year's address, the North's leader Kim Jong-un vowed to make every effort to improve bilateral ties. He said he is open to summit talks with the South's president if appropriate conditions are created.Ryoo, however, said the Park government is not interested in any summit for the sake of a summit.

It was the first time that the summary in Korean contained Tokyoâs claim to Dokdo.âWe issued a strong protest to the Japanese defense attache in the morning so that this kind of inappropriate act would not be repeated,â a ministry official told reporters, declining to be named. âWe have returned all 57 copies to the embassy.â The Japanese Embassy delivered the copies to the ministryâs information division last Friday. The copies were handed over to the ministryâs division in charge of East Asian affairs on Tuesday.A ministry official said that the response to Japanâs claim to Dokdo, called Takeshima in Japan, came late because the official who first received the copies was not aware of their importance as they did not concern any urgent security issues.Japan has claimed sovereignty over Dokdo in its defense whitepaper for the past decade. The tensions over Dokdo flared up at a time when the two countries are attempting to improve their ties. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations, and growing security threats from the North have underscored the importance of security cooperation between the two neighbors.The diplomatic spat over Dokdo is expected to escalate further next month when the Japanese prefecture of Shimane observes its Takeshima Day. Since 2013, the Abe government has sent senior officials such as vice minister-level figures to attend a ceremony to mark the day, prompting strong protests from Seoul. Drawing the ire of Koreans, Tokyo has also created a video clip to reassert its claim to Dokdo. A state agency in charge of territorial issues reportedly posted the 17-minute clip on YouTube on Dec. 24 to argue that Japanese people fished in waters surrounding Dokdo in the past.Japan incorporated Dokdo as part of its territory in 1905 before colonizing the entire peninsula. Korea has been in effective control of them with a small coast guard unit posted there since its liberation in 1945.Along with the territorial issue, historical antagonism has been a major hurdle to improving the bilateral ties. Seoul has raised pressure on Tokyo to compensate and fully atone for its wartime sexual enslavement of Asian women, which it regards as a broader human rights issue beyond the bilateral relationship. However, Tokyo has yet to respond to Seoulâs demand, saying that this issue has already been settled under a 1965 bilateral normalization pact.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","in seoul to protest japan ,ministry came under fire wednesday ,protests from seoul drawing the ,embassy in seoul to protest ,seoul to protest japan description","['South Korea âs', 'Defense Ministry', 'Tokyo', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Korean', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'east asian', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Shimane', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'Tokyo', 'YouTube', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'asian', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30377755  0.35552198

Suh Chung-won, a seven-term lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party with reportedly close ties to Park, is scheduled to hold meetings with Japanese political leaders and attend a New Year's meeting with Korean residents in Japan.The group could also meet with Abe on Thursday, although planning is still under way, according to sources close to the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A main focus of attention in the visit has been on whether Suh will carry a personal letter from Park to Abe.Sources have said Park did not send a letter.In October, Abe delivered a letter to Park through a Japanese parliamentary delegation, saying he would like to improve their countries' soured relations through summit talks.Park has insisted on holding a summit only after Tokyo demonstrates sincerity about resolving South Koreans' grievances over Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.

The plan calls for, among other things, increasing the country's potential growth and employment rates to 4 percent and 70 percent, respectively, while also boosting its per capita income to over $40,000.Park called on labor and management to make concessions to ensure that they can produce measures to reform the labor market.One of the key issues of South Korea's labor market is a divide between regular workers and non-regular workers.Critics say regular workers are being overprotected, a development that causes some companies to shun recruitment and instead rely on non-regular workers they can fire more easily.The latest government data showed that the number of non-regular workers in Korea came to 6.08 million as of August, about 32.4 percent of the country's total salaried workers. It was the first time that the number of non-regular workers exceeded 6 million since related data started to be compiled in 2002.She also said the ultimate purpose of structural reform is job creation, and reiterated her call for deregulation.Park has been pushing to lift or ease all but core regulations to help reinvigorate the country's economy, calling unnecessary business restrictions ""our archenemy"" and a ""cancer.""

Five doctors and four nurses will carry out their mission from Jan. 26-Feb. 20 after taking on-the-job training for five days, it said.Initially, Seoul had planned to send 10 medical staff for the second team, but as one nurse failed to pass the rigorous training, the government plans to send the final and third batch of 11 medical workers instead next month.Seoul's first bath of 10 medical workers kicked off their operation in late December, but one medical worker was airlifted to a hospital in Germany last week to undergo a three-week monitoring on infection concerns.The worker's index finger came in contact with a needle through a partly ripped glove while collecting blood from an Ebola patient. As the team member's blood tests showed negative results three times, there is a very low chance of contraction, according to the foreign ministry.South Korea has joined global efforts to fight Ebola by sending medical workers and offering a combined US$12.6 million in assistance.

The two Asian economic powerhouses have regularly held the consultative meeting since its inception in 1999. ""Both sides positively assessed the sustained development of their economic ties over the past 50 years and shared the view that they should more closely cooperate in order to make their economic cooperative relations more forward-looking,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Since establishing diplomatic ties in 1965, bilateral trade jumped 400-fold to an estimated US$90 billion in 2014, the ministry said, adding that the countries positively assessed their economic partnership on the international stage.Private economic associations of the two countries are planning a number of celebratory events to mark the 50th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties this year and the two governments agreed to review ways to back up the events, the statement also said.They also agreed to find ways to support joint overseas business projects pursued by companies from the two countries, it added.Discussions about South Korea's import ban on Japanese seafood imposed after the Fukushima nuclear reactor accident in 2011 took up a major part of the Thursday meeting, a South Korean ministry official said, adding that Seoul is still far from lifting the ban.""It's hard to say (South Korea's moving toward lifting it). We will decide it later, after reviewing the result of private experts' examination,"" the official said. A group of South Korean experts plan to depart for Japan next week for the examination, he added.He also highlighted that ""Having had frank, constructive, serious discussions on all kinds of issues (with Japan) is a very positive sign, per se, at a time when the South Korea-Japan relations are under various (negative) assessments."" ""The latest meeting was very meaningful in that both countries had comprehensive reviews of bilateral economic issues and interests and discussed ways to strengthen cooperation in a forward-looking manner,"" according to the ministry statement.This year's meeting comes amid an unusually high diplomatic tension between the neighbors. The countries have been at odds for a few years over territorial and other issues stemming from their shared history.President Park has yet to hold her first one-on-one summit meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, although they have met several times on the international stage.
