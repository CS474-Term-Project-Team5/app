(Yonhap)The performances by the Moranbong Band were supposed to begin at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing at 7:30 p.m., but they were called off just three hours before. They were scheduled to continue three days from Saturday.Following the cancellation of the performances, which were seen as a sign of improvement in ties between China and the North, troupe members boarded a train bound for Pyongyang. The members refused to talk to reporters. China’s stat-run Xinhua news agency attributed the cancellation to “communication issues at the working-level,” without further elaborating.The rare concert was arranged amid growing expectations for the restoration of relations between Beijing and Pyongyang.Since China sent a high-ranking official to the North’s 70th anniversary of the founding of its Workers’ Party on Oct. 10, bilateral ties appeared to be improving. Before then, their relations were strained due to Pyongyang’s recalcitrance over stopping its provocative acts, including its nuclear and missile tests. The sudden cancellation of the troupe’s concert came just two days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was reported to have claimed that his country had developed a hydrogen bomb, an apparent indication that the North had secured considerable technology to build nuclear weapons.Beijing’s Foreign Ministry criticized Kim’s claim, urging him to “do things that are helpful for easing (tensions) in the security circumstances.” Observers say that such criticism might have enraged the North Korean leadership to the point of calling off the performances. Beijing, for its part, might have found it difficult to allow the musical event to highlight the close partnership between the two nations when the international community is increasingly concerned about the North’s evolving nuclear threats, analysts said.“North Korea may seek to create an impression that by sending the female troupe to China and having it perform here, China is okay with Kim’s remarks (about the hydrogen bomb),” said Kim Heung-kyu, political science professor at Ajou University. “China, of course, does not want to give that kind of an impression (to the world).”News reports said that Beijing had lowered the level of Chinese officials to attend the performances by the female troupe due to Kim’s remarks about the hydrogen bomb, and that the decision triggered a conflict between the two sides.“North Korea wanted Chinese leader Xi Jinping or Premier Li Keqiang to attend the performances. But China did not accept the demand, and proposed a member of the politburo of the Communist Party,” Yonhap news agency quoted a Beijing source as saying.Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the local think tank Sejong Institute, claimed that the performances appeared to have been canceled as the communist regime declared a period of mourning Saturday to mark the fourth year of the death of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.“According to a source informed of North Korea’s internal situations, the regime banned dancing and singing songs to mark the fourth year of Kim’s death,” he said. “Thus, the organizer in charge of the performances in Beijing will be reprimanded according to the source.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","troupe were canceled abruptly saturday ,canceled abruptly saturday sparking many ,airport to leave china saturday ,calling off the performances beijing ,were canceled abruptly saturday sparking","['China', 'north korean', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'the Moranbong Band', 'North Korea', 'China', 'the Moranbong Band', 'the National Center for the Performing Arts', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Xinhua news agency', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Beijing', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Kim ’s', 'north korean', 'Beijing', 'North ’s', 'Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Kim', 'Kim Heung - kyu', 'Ajou University', 'China', 'world).”News', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Li Keqiang', 'China', 'the Communist Party', 'Beijing', 'Cheong Seong - chang', 'Sejong Institute', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim ’s', 'Beijing', 'song Sang - ho']",17,"[ 9.          4.          8.         ... -0.14807069  0.27418575

Initially, 238 women were on the list of government-registered former sex slaves.   Choi, who was born in 1919, was forced into sexual slavery when she was 15. She came back home after Korea was freed from the Japanese colonial rule.  Only 238 women have been registered with the South Korean government as former sex slaves, though historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced to work at front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war.  South Korea has urged Japan to resolve the grievances of the victims, saying the issue is becoming increasingly urgent as most victims are elderly, well over 80 years old, and may die before they receive compensation or an apology from Japan. Tokyo, however, insists the issue was settled under the normalization treaty of 1965.

In 1951, the U.N. culture agency set up a textbook factory in South Korea to help print school textbooks and formulated a plan for rebuilding education.She also said education could help sow in the minds of children in conflict zones the seeds of reconciliation over hatred, dialogue over violence and hope over despair.""The answer lies in none other than education,"" Park said, noting addressing social and economic root causes that feed terrorism is critical to ending violent extremism.She also vowed to take active part in international endeavors to combat terrorism.On Monday, she visited the site of the deadly terror attack in Paris after attending the U.N. climate change summit, in a symbolic gesture that underscored South Korea's solidarity with France.Park laid white chrysanthemums in front of the Bataclan Theater and paid silent tribute to those who were killed in the attack on Nov. 13. Park also said South Korea will collaborate on education to make a better world, saying the case of South Korea shows that education offers ""the surest and most sustainable foundation for fostering peace and prosperity.""South Korea's education fervor helped transform the country into Asia's fourth-largest economy from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a former South Korean foreign minister, has said that education was the key to South Korea becoming the first former aid recipient to join the ranks of official donors in a half-century.UNESCO chief Irina Bokova also said South Korea's enthusiasm for education made it possible for Seoul to become an aid donor and it should share its experiences with other countries.Touching on inter-Korean issues, Park held out the prospect of greater inter-Korean exchange and cooperation if South and North Korea build trust and restore a sense of shared identity through sustained cultural exchanges.Despite political ups and downs, the two Koreas have been cooperating in preserving the ruins of Manwoldae, the royal palace of the Goryeo Dynasty that ruled the Korean Peninsula from 918 to 1392.South Korea believes that cultural cooperation could help restore a sense of common identity between the two Koreas, which have been divided for decades.The Korean Peninsula was divided into the capitalistic South and the communist North after its liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. The 1950-53 Korean War ended with a cease-fire agreement, not a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically still at war.Also Tuesday, Park observed the signing of a deal with the U.N. culture agency on setting up a center in South Korea that is designed to conduct research and educate others on South Korea's traditional martial arts.Park later left for Prague for a summit with regional leaders.

If the North has the ""strong will"" for improved ties with the South, Kim Yang-gon, the top communist party official in charge of daily inter-Korean affairs, should come to the bargaining table himself, Cheong stressed.Kim joined the so-called two-plus-two negotiations on Aug. 25 which also involved Hwang Pyong-so, the North's chief military official on political affairs. Their southern counterparts were President Park Geun-hye's top security advisor Kim Kwan-jin and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.They produced a set of landmark deals on ending a military crisis and paving the way for additional dialogue.Analysts also took issue with the venue for the upcoming meeting.South Korea hoped to hold it in either Seoul or Pyongyang as agreed in the Aug. 25 accord.

Plans to use the overpass for other purposes, such as a park, should also be discussed with the Korea Rail Network Authority, it added.Seoul City, adamant about carrying out the project that has become one of Mayor Park Won-soon’s signature urban projects, said it will be closing the overpass from Dec. 13. The overpass, which was constructed in the 1970s, received a grade “D” in a safety test in 2006. Instead of tearing it down, the mayor vowed last year to transform it into an elevated pedestrian park similar to the High Line Park in New York City as part of the city’s urban restoration project. The plan, however, has faced hurdles, as the police delayed the review of the city’s traffic measures, citing them as insufficient and saying the Transport Ministry’s approval was required first. The city argued the police were deliberately delaying it on political motives. Some raised speculation the police had been influenced by the central government to contain Park, who is considered a potential presidential candidate for the main opposition party.The city had threatened to close the overpass from Nov. 29 and partially tear it down for safety purposes on its own authority. It is authorized to discretionally tear down construction or control and restrict traffic if there are obvious public safety risks.

The city had conducted on-site inspections with blind residents since March over the braille blocks around subway stations, bus stations, parks, walking paths and entrances to buildings. It found that nearly half of them needed maintenance and reinforcement, with 26 percent of facilities not even having the blocks, officials said. While most areas around subway stations were well equipped with braille blocks, about 40 percent of areas around bus stops did not have enough installed. Over half of the braille blocks around parks and entrances to buildings were also below standard, the authorities said. More than 42,000 blind residents lived in the capital as of last year, according to the city government. About 1,300 of them on average use the public transportation every day, with the majority taking the subway, it added.The number was estimated based on an analysis of surveillance cameras set up at bus stops and subway stations, the city said. In April, the city vowed to boost pedestrian rights for the transportation vulnerable, such as the elderly and disabled.It pledged to change the material of the braille block from PVC to concrete to prevent slipperiness in the rain. It also said it would lower the crosswalk sills from 20 centimeters to 1 centimeter.

In May, Ban planned to visit the North Korean border city of Kaesong, where South Korea runs an industrial complex, but the trip was called off at the last minute because Pyongyang abruptly withdrew its invitation for no clear reason.Some analysts said at the time that Pyongyang appeared to have taken issue with Ban's remarks that North Korea's missile launches represent a violation of U.N.

The 54-kilometer railway between the North’s Rajin and Russia’s Khasan is used to transport Russia’s bituminous coal to the North and then to the South by ship.During the latest test operation that will run until Nov. 30, a total of 120,000 tons of Russia’s Siberian coal and 10 shipping containers carrying Chinese mineral water will be transported to the South, Seoul’s Unification Ministry said.Russian coal will be sent to Gwangyang in South Jeolla Province and Pohang in North Gyeongsang Province, while the Chinese water will be transported to the southern port city of Busan. For this operation, two 45,000-ton Chinese-administered bulk ships and one 10,000-ton container ship have been mobilized.South Korean firms POSCO, Hyundai Merchant Marine and the Korea Railroad Corporation are participating as a consortium for the project.Seoul has pushed for the project as part of its “Eurasia Initiative” through which it has strived to bolster economic cooperation with Eurasian states by establishing a pan-Eurasia system of transport and energy networks that link Korea to those states.Seoul has promoted the initiative to revitalize the regional economy, create jobs, push Pyongyang toward openness and reform, defuse cross-border tensions and lay the groundwork for national reunification.The project involving the North, in actuality, violates the so-called May 24 sanctions that ban any new investment for the North. But Seoul has carried out the project as an exception to the sanctions that were placed in 2010 after Pyongyang’s torpedo attack on a South Korean warship.For Russia, the project is crucial as it has been seeking to develop its Far Eastern region and diversify its energy export routes. Pyongyang has also tried to use this project as it seeks to secure sources of revenues from outside and shore up its debilitated economy. By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","koreas and russia began tuesday ,tuesday with seoul officials conducting ,russia began tuesday with seoul ,began tuesday with seoul officials ,tuesday with seoul officials","['Koreas', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Rajin', 'Sonbong', 'North ’s', 'Russia', 'Rajin', 'North ’s', 'the North ’s Rajin', 'Russia', 'Khasan', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'siberian', 'chinese', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'russian', 'Gwangyang', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'chinese', 'Busan', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'POSCO', 'Hyundai', 'Marine', 'the Korea Railroad Corporation', 'Seoul', 'eurasian', 'pan - eurasia', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Russia', 'far eastern', 'Pyongyang', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56198323  1.03262937

President Park Geun-hye (left) and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe mourn before the first session of the G20 Turkey Leaders Summit held at a convention center on Monday. Yonhap News“If North Korea abandons the nuclear (weapons) and takes a path toward openness and cooperation, (South Korea) will join hands with the international community to assist in infrastructure investment in Northeast Asia where annual demand is expected to be $63 billion a year,” said Park at the summit held in the resort city of Antalya. For this, the president offered to launch a multinational development bank to finance infrastructure works in Northeast Asia.“It will be good if we could establish a development bank specializing in Northeast Asia and cooperate with ADB, which oversaw Asia’s development for a long time, as well as the AIIB,” she said, referring to the Asia Development Bank. The ADB was conceived in 1966 for postwar rehabilitation in Asia and the Pacific, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has been proposed by China as a new international financial institution for infrastructure construction in the Asia-Pacific region.Park’s top economic aide told reporters later the proposal was offered on the premise of Pyongyang discarding its nuclear weapons under development for deterrence against what it calls Washington’s hostile policy.The remark came a few days after Park expressed her hopes for an inter-Korean summit.Before she left for a 10-day tour for three separate regional meetings on Saturday, Park said that she has “no reasons not to hold a summit” with the North.At the meeting with leaders of the 20 advanced countries, Park sat next to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the sessions, where they exchanged pleasantries after their first-ever summit in Seoul earlier this month.According to Kyodo news agency, Abe told Park that there has been a good atmosphere in Japan over bilateral ties since their summit in Seoul. Park told Abe that she was glad to hear that, the Japanese media said, quoting Japan’s Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshige Seko.Kim Kyou-hyun, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, later confirmed that Park and Abe had a chat, but they didn’t talk about the issue of former sex slaves, he said. In the previous meeting, Park and Abe agreed to speed up the negotiations this year on Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II, without setting a specific deadline. Korea wants a proper apology from Japan and compensation for sex slaves, while Tokyo claims the issues have been settled in 1965 when the two normalized their diplomatic ties.On the sidelines of the G20 meeting, Park also held a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron and offered condolences for the British citizens who died in the Nov. 13 Paris terror attacks.To improve capabilities to better deal with crises, the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral ties, said Park’s spokesman. Last year, South Korea helped evacuate nearly 50 British people from Libya.The two leaders also agreed to cooperate in peacekeeping operations in Africa and to expand ties to end the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.South Korea completed its Ebola relief mission in the West African nation earlier this year. The mission was the first case of the South Korean government sending an emergency relief team overseas to fight the epidemic outbreak.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","president offered to launch multinational ,the g20 turkey leaders summit ,for an inter korean summit ,south korea completed its ebola ,g20 meeting park also held","['Park Geun - hye', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'G20', 'Turkey', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'the G20 Turkey Leaders Summit', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Antalya', 'AIIB', 'the Asia Development Bank', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Park', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Kyodo', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Hiroshige Seko', 'Kim Kyou - hyun', 'Park', 'Abe', 'Abe', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Park', 'british', 'David Cameron', 'british', 'Paris', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea', 'british', 'Libya', 'South Korea', 'west african', 'south korean', 'Cho Chung - un']",14,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.68667895  0.87899858

At the Group of 20 summit in Antalya, she also displayed her resolve to ramp up humanitarian assistance to Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and countries that provide shelter to those who have fled their conflict-stricken homes, calling terror, violent extremism and refugees “issues directly linked with human dignity.”  Members of the French Embassy in Seoul on Monday pay silent tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris, France. (Yonhap)“No one is any longer safe from the rise of violent extremists led by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the advent of foreign terrorist fighters and the spread of extremist messages on the Internet,” Park said at a dinner session on terrorism and the refugee crisis. “Our government strongly condemns the terror attacks in Paris and the bombing last month in Ankara as an act of crime against civilization and humanity, and would like to express deep condolences to the victims and the people of France and Turkey.” With the world reeling from the brutal attacks in Paris over the weekend, terrorism and refugee issues appeared to be dominating the two-day premier economic forum. The forum brought together the leaders of 20 advanced and emerging economies, including U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister David Cameron. To expedite the global drive, Park called for setting in motion a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted in September 2014, as well as various bilateral and regional antiterrorism measures, such as those aimed at cutting off terrorist financing. While striving to close socioeconomic gaps around the world, the international community should urgently formulate a political solution to tackle unbridled instability in Syria, Libya and other transitional countries, she said. “The massive refugee outflow chiefly stemming from the prolonged Syria crisis is posing a grave challenge to the overall international humanitarian regime,” Park said. “I believe the G20 should lead the efforts to share burdens and responsibilities being laid on the sources of refugees, their destinations and the countries in between. ... Korea, too, will help resolve the refugee problems by expanding humanitarian aid.”Park’s remarks came as Seoul seeks to step up its contributions to global challenges as a middle power, bridging the worlds of the rich and poor, and as part of its increasingly multifaceted security partnership with Washington. On the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly last year, she pledged a “thorough” implementation of Resolution 2178 on terrorists and unveiled plans to deploy an additional engineering unit to assist reconstruction and humanitarian activities in conflict zones. Seoul has since been pushing to enact special legislation to facilitate its future overseas dispatch of forces and participation in non-U.N. peacekeeping operations. Faced with IS threats itself as a staunch U.S. ally, however, her renewed pledge to boost the global antijihadist movement will inevitably be limited, with Seoul opting for financial support or other means rather than participation in military operations. “We have since been strengthening our psychological readiness, mindful of the possibility of a similar terror here, and rechecked for potential safety hazard factors at key national and military facilities as well as overseas units,” said Joint Chief of Staff spokesman Col. Jeon Ha-kyu at a news briefing Monday. “We are maintaining close cooperation with the National Intelligence Service, police and other agencies responsible for antiterrorism.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","the weekend terrorism and refugee ,paris over the weekend terrorism ,at dinner session on terrorism ,join global campaign against terrorism ,weekend terrorism and refugee issues","['Park Geun - hye', 'Turkey', 'Islamic', 'Paris', 'Group of 20', 'Antalya', 'Syria', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'the French Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Paris', 'France', 'the Islamic State of Iraq', 'Levant', 'Paris', 'Ankara', 'France', 'Turkey', 'Paris', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'british', 'David Cameron', 'Park', 'U.N.

He said the plan also goes against the global trend, referring to criticism mounting on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has also emphasized “one history.”“The biggest problem is that governments do not know how to do history ... Imagine Donald Trump deciding what should be in a history textbook ― it would end up as a comic book,” he said in an email interview with The Korea Herald. “The politicians will choose those historians, naturally favoring those who agree with them about which history seems correct to them.” Bruce CumingsSouth Korea’s Education Ministry confirmed Tuesday the plans to use state-authored history textbooks for secondary education from 2017, on grounds that current privately published textbooks are “biased in favor of the leftists.” Park has stressed the need to “normalize history lessons” through “correct history textbooks.”But Cumings stressed that there is no such thing as correct history. “Historians are trained to interpret primary documents ― those historical materials that allow us to get closest to the truth of what happened ― and to develop suppositions, arguments and theories as to what happened in the past and what it means,” he said. “History is not about neutrality; it is about human beings imposing their judgments on what happened in the past, and why.”Cumings is one of 181 scholars outside Korea who signed a joint statement opposing the government’s plan to reinstate government-issued textbooks. The historian also said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea’s approach to resolve social conflict via a unified textbook was misleading.“The way to bridge social and ideological conflict is to let the truth come out, let people debate the truth in a truly democratic manner, and thus use history to pursue reconciliation with those who think differently than you do.”Cumings accused the Korean government of seeking to denigrate scholars attempting to deal with difficult subjects, including the 1950-53 Korean War and the Jeju Uprising of 1948, which followed the shooting of protesters in an antigovernment rally.“The model of what historians can do collectively (against such efforts) was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,” he said, referring to a special committee set up in 2005 to investigate past rights abuses. “Because of the great work of that Commission, so much toothpaste is out of the tube that it can never be put back in. Anyone can go on the Internet or to the library and read about these events; what good would a state-issued textbook do?”At the center of the textbook controversy in South Korea is its hostile northern neighbor, North Korea. The government alleges that current textbooks depict Pyongyang in a positive light.While the government said the textbooks did not criticize Pyongyang enough, Cumings said that the appropriate approach instead should be a balanced treatment of the country, which is “the first step toward reconciliation between the two Koreas.”Cumings is a writer and a professor specializing in modern Korean history and contemporary international relations. He is particularly well known for his work on the Korean War.Cumings dedicated his 2010 book “The Korean War” in memory of the late former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who is famous for his “Sunshine Policy” that pushed for cross-border exchanges and reconciliation. He became the first recipient of the Kim Dae Jung Academic Award for Outstanding Achievements and Scholarly Contributions to Democracy, Human Rights and Peace in 2007.The professor said he agreed with those who say Park’s move to reinstate government-issued textbooks was influenced by her father’s authoritarian rule, who was the Korean leader to introduce state-authored textbooks in 1974. But the issue is also directly influenced by Japan, who colonized Korea from 1910 to 1945, according to Cumings.“It goes back to the Japanese government and politicians, now and in the past, who also prefer centralized state textbooks, and who deeply fear independent historians,” he said. “By going down this same road of centrally controlled textbooks, President Park is playing into the hands of (Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe and appearing to be just like him.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history bashed the seoul government ,expert on korean history bashed ,korean history bashed the ,korean history bashed the seoul ,on korean history bashed the","['U.S.', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Bruce Cumings', 'University of Chicago', 'korean', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'imagine Donald Trump', 'the Korea Herald', 'Bruce CumingsSouth Korea ’s', 'Education Ministry', 'Korea', 'Hwang Woo - yea ’s', 'korean', 'the Jeju Uprising', 'the Truth and Reconciliation Commission', 'Commission', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'cuming', 'Koreas', 'korean', 'south korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Park', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Cumings', 'japanese', 'Park', 'japanese', 'Shinzo', 'Abe']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33835253  0.63599294

20,20,20,[Newsmaker] Abe in Seoul amid frosty ties,"After years of bitter ties between Seoul and Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived at Seongnam Airbase, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday, for a trilateral meeting and his first-ever talk with President Park Geun-hye on Monday.Though previous leaders of the two countries have held summits at least once a year ― visiting each other quite on a regular basis ― Monday’s summit is the first of its kind since May 20...","After years of bitter ties between Seoul and Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived at Seongnam Airbase, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday, for a trilateral meeting and his first-ever talk with President Park Geun-hye on Monday.Though previous leaders of the two countries have held summits at least once a year ― visiting each other quite on a regular basis ― Monday’s summit is the first of its kind since May 2012, when Park’s predecessor Lee Myung-bak sat down with the then Japanese Premier Yoshihiko Noda, before Abe resumed office later that year.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (Yonhap)For Abe, it is the first visit to South Korea in nine years, having last come to meet South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun 2006, during his first stint as prime minister.The first summit in three years and five months brings some level hope that the two might mend ties, but also reflects how long the two countries have remained at odds over historical and territorial issues.The relations between the allies had soured over the past few years, due to disputes over Japan’s wartime atrocities and its claim over Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo.Despite the summit on Monday, the two countries face a tough road ahead with their apparent failure to see eye to eye on key thorny issues including the wartime sex slavery by Japan during World War II.The obvious rift between Park and Abe makes prospects of a breakthrough bleak.Park on Friday expressed hope that the two countries could resolve the issue of South Korean women who were sexually enslaved by Japan during wartime ― also referred to as “comfort women” ― by urging Tokyo to take “sincere measures” for the victims in an interview with the Japanese press. But Japan has insisted that all compensation related to the country’s colonization of the peninsula have been settled with a bilateral treaty with Korea in 1965, a position by which Abe stands.Later in the day, Abe’s deputy chief cabinet secretary Koichi Hagiuda reiterated that the country’s stance on comfort women has not changed.Experts say that Abe’s relatively short two-day trip and 30-minute talks with Park ― which will not include a luncheon ― is indicative of the icy relationship between the two countries.Yang Ki-ho, a professor of Japanese studies and Japanese politics at Sungkonghoe University, told local media that there was little possibility that the two countries will see progress on the issue. “Japan has consistently demanded not to include the (comfort women) issue in the agenda. ... The two countries will continue to mediate up until the summit is held, but it is hard to expect the two parties to reach a specific conclusion,” he said. “The Abe administration is very strict when it comes to the issue of comfort women.”With the two leaders gearing up for a summit, the foreign ministers of Korea and Japan met Sunday morning, and agreed that meeting should be “a good starting point for Korea-Japan relations.”According to the Foreign Ministry, the ministers had a “comprehensive discussion” about the items in the agenda, although it denied to elaborate on the specifics.As Abe’s visit come amid historic and territorial dispute between the two countries, protests by local civic groups against the talks erupted across Korea.The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan held a demonstration in front of Japanese Embassy in Jongno-gu, central Seoul and demanded Japan apologize for its wartime atrocities.Lee Yong-su, one of the surviving comfort women, urged Abe “not to come at all” if he has no intention of resolving the comfort women issue.Civic groups protesting Japan’s Dokdo claims also held demonstrations, decrying Tokyo for its comments related to collective self-defense.Korea and Japan recently divulged their differences in Japan’s overseas operations, particularly in North Korea.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korea and japan met sunday ,first ever talk with president ,first summit in three years ,that year japanese prime minister ,to meet south korean president","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seongnam Airbase', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'japanese', 'Yoshihiko Noda', 'Abe', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Abe', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Park', 'Abe', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Abe', 'Abe ’s', 'Koichi Hagiuda', 'Park', 'Yang Ki - ho', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Sungkonghoe University', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Abe', 'Korea', 'the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan', 'Japanese Embassy', 'Jongno - gu', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Lee Yong - su', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Yoon Min - sik']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71455878  0.84900141

The Ministry of National Defense and the ruling Saenuri Party agreed Tuesday to expand the quota for military enlistment by 10,000 in 2016 and 2017. They decided to budget some 60 billion won ($53 million) to accommodate the increase in the number of enlisted service members. “We agreed to address the youths’ struggles to join the military,” said Rep. Kim Sung-chan of the ruling Saenuri Party after the meeting, which was also attended by Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Defense Minister Han Min-koo.“We have come up with measures to accommodate those enlisting, including budget issues and administrative procedures,” Kim said.  The ruling Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung (left) and National Defense Minister Han Min-koo. YonhapKim also noted that the government had decided to increase enlistment from 4,000 to 6,000 for those who choose to do alternative service instead of joining the army.  The Defense Ministry estimates that about 50,000 candidates have been on the waiting list for enlistment. An increasing number of children of young men have been applying for the service amid a bleak youth job market.Young people have traditionally considered the military service, which lasts at least 21 months, to be a career liability. But there has been a changing trend for them to think of it as an opportunity to find jobs or add to their resume, experts said. “Back in the days, college students used to delay their enlistment for academic reasons or other reasons related to their career. Now they embrace the military service more proactively because more companies give credits to those who served in the military and have a bias against those who didn’t,” said Lee Byoung-hoon, a sociology professor at Chung-Ang University.Yet the military’s demand for draftees has continued to decline in line with its ongoing reform plan, a move to streamline South Korea’s military by decreasing the active-duty troop level to 522,000 from the current 633,000 by 2020. According to the statistics compiled by Rep. Chung Mi-hyung of the Saenuri Party, only 84,224 out of 630,427 applicants were enlisted in the Army, Navy and Air Force or Marine Corps. This means that only about 1 in 7.5 applicants were accepted, although the figure counts multiple applications by individuals. “We consider the oversupply (of enlistment) to be an isolated case due to the surge of the birthrate (among baby boomer parents). We expect that the number of those waiting for enlistment will fall by 2017,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok told reporters Tuesday.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday to expand the quota ,more applicants for compulsory military ,party agreed tuesday to expand ,accepting more applicants for compulsory ,won 53 million to accommodate","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Sung - chan', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Kim', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Han Min - koo', 'YonhapKim', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Lee Byoung - hoon', 'Chung - Ang University', 'South Korea ’s', 'Chung Mi - hyung', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Marine Corps', 'Defense Ministry', 'Kim Min - seok', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",10,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.3634415  0.1663384  0.6008116]

Han Min-koo hosted his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani, who arrived for a three-day stay primarily designed for his participation in the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition. The six-day trade fair began early in the day at Seoul Airport in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. With North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats and three-way cooperation involving the U.S. topping the agenda, the sides discussed Japan’s envisioned exercise of its right to collective self-defense following its recent overturn of its pacifist constitution, which will enable its military to play a greater role.  Defense Minister Han Min-koo (right) speaks with his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani during their talks in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)After briefing Han on the new security law, Nakatani said that should the Self-Defense Forces see the need to operate off of their soil, Tokyo will seek consent from the country “under international law” and the principle will apply anywhere, including South Korea, officials here said. In response, Han said North Korea is stipulated as South Korean territory under its constitution, reemphasizing that Tokyo ought to secure Seoul’s approval if the SDF was to enter the North. Yet his counterpart simply replied that the issue should be discussed in the framework of the trilateral partnership including the U.S. Their conflicting interpretations of the scope of the SDF’s operations on the peninsula highlight steadfast concerns over the former occupier’s military activities, which have been further fanned by the Shinzo Abe administration’s revisionist push and lack of repentance toward its World War II atrocities.Controversy persists as Seoul is stepping up efforts to mend fences and reinforce bilateral security cooperation with Tokyo without receiving a sincere formal apology for the country’s imperial past. Nakatani’s trip marks the first visit by Tokyo’s defense chief since January 2011, and came about five months after his talks with Han on the sidelines of an international security conference in Singapore. “The two nations share security interests,” the minister said at the outset of the talks. “The bilateral security partnership should not stay in the region, but expand globally. Based on the perception, the two nations need to strengthen security cooperation.” The resumed consultations came as the U.S. ramps up pressure on South Korea to defrost ties with its old foe and boost bilateral and trilateral security partnerships, such as through intensified intelligence sharing and logistics support, to better counter Pyongyang’s growing military threats amid an ongoing budget cutback at home.Seoul, Washington and Tokyo sealed an arrangement to facilitate the sharing of their military intelligence last December. On the margins of ADEX, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Jeong Kyeong-doo held separate talks with Gen. Harukazu Saito, chief of staff of Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force. Early this month, Tokyo’s Parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Kenji Harada visited Korea to attend the Military World Games in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province, meeting with Seoul’s Vice Defense Minister Baek Seung-joo. South Korea also sent the 4,400-ton class destroyer Daejoyoung for the first time in 13 years to a fleet review that took place Sunday in waters off the Yokosuka U.S. naval base south of Tokyo. During his trip, Nakatani was scheduled to join a welcome dinner for ADEX, visit Seoul National Cemetery and the border village of Panmunjeom and meet with a Korean War hero before returning home Thursday.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","talks in seoul on tuesday ,dinner for adex visit seoul ,in seoul on tuesday yonhap ,seoul on tuesday yonhap after ,in seoul on tuesday","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Han', 'japanese', 'Gen Nakatani', 'the Seoul International Aerospace', 'Defense Exhibition', 'Seongnam', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'japanese', 'Gen Nakatani', 'Seoul', 'Han', 'Nakatani', 'the Self - Defense Forces', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'Han', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'SDF', 'U.S.', 'SDF', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Nakatani ’s', 'Tokyo', 'Han', 'Singapore', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'ADEX', 'Air Force', 'Jeong Kyeong - doo', 'Harukazu Saito', 'Japan', 'Air Self - Defense Force', 'Tokyo ’s', 'Defense', 'Kenji Harada', 'Korea', 'Mungyeong', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Seoul', 'Baek Seung - joo', 'South Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Nakatani', 'ADEX', 'Seoul National Cemetery', 'Panmunjeom', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45004484  0.4144282

Lee Soon-gyu (center, sitting), 85, is surrounded by officials and the press as she registers with the Korean Red Cross on Monday at Hanwha Resorts in Sokcho, Gangwon Province, where the participants gathered for the separated family reunions to be held at Mount Geumgangsan in North Korea from Tuesday. Lee is set to be reunited with her husband Oh In-se, 83. (Yonhap)The three-day reunions, which were arranged as part of the Aug. 25 deal to defuse cross-border tensions, will take place in two separate rounds. The first round will begin Tuesday and last until Thursday, while the second will run from Saturday to next Monday. Those who came here Monday were given the chance to attend the first round, as 96 families living in the North, which Pyongyang has selected, have sought to rendezvous with them.During the second round, 255 people from 90 families, which the South’s Red Cross selected through a computer lottery, will meet their relatives in the North.On Tuesday, they will travel to the mountain resort across the heavily fortified border via bus. They will be accompanied by 143 people including the medical staff and 29 press people. Seoul officials have paid particular attention to the health of old participants. The oldest South Korean participant is Kim Nam-kyu, who is 99 years old. He is to meet his long-lost sister Kim Nam-dong, 83. During the three-day program, the participants have six meetings with their relatives, for two hours each session. They will meet for two group reunions, a welcome reception, one individual gathering, one joint dinner session and a farewell.Since August 2008, the two Koreas have held family reunions in the North 19 times. They have also held video-linked reunions seven times in that time.

Schools choose from any of the eight textbooks, while primary schools have a single set of state-authored history textbooks.  Park also said she could hold in-depth consultations with U.S. President Barack Obama on peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia, citing a series of summits between regional leaders.  She made the comments three hours before leaving for Washington for summit talks with Obama.  Last month, Park met with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing, followed by a summit between Obama and Xi in Washington.  South Korea, China and Japan are also scheduled to hold trilateral summit talks at the end of the month or the start of next month. A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to tensions mainly over Japan's attempts to whitewash its wartime atrocities and colonial occupation.

But if anybody attacks us, Japan doesn't have to do a thing. That's the way we run things.""Trump said the reason why the U.S. has huge defense budget is because ""we're defending all these countries.""""It's not helping us. So we are going to change things around, and we're going to make America great again. Believe me,"" he said.Trump's criticism shows his ignorance about American security interests and policy.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the Asian ally from the communist North, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces. Last year, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won ($886 million) for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in 2014, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.

He arrived in Seoul on Wednesday for a three-day stay.""Since 1965, when South Korea and Japan normalized their diplomatic ties, the two countries have maintained cooperative relations. (In his letter), Abe expressed his hope for building future-oriented relations with Seoul,"" Yamaguchi said.Yamaguchi said he hopes that Park and Abe can hold summit talks on the sidelines of an upcoming trilateral summit among South Korea, China and Japan.The three countries are expected to hold their first trilateral summit in more than three years in South Korea at the end of this month or the start of next month.Japan's refusal to face up to its wartime atrocities has been the main source of diplomatic tension between Seoul and Tokyo.Since taking office in early 2013, Park has shunned a summit with Abe, calling for Japan to sincerely apologize for its sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.With regard to Yamaguchi's proposal, Park did not make any comments on a possible summit with Abe, according to a government source.Touching on the sex slave issue, the Japanese politician said Park showed her strong will to resolve the matter as it warrants urgency, given the victims' old age.South Korea demands Japan acknowledge state responsibility for the issue and offer proper compensation, while Tokyo insists the matter was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral ties. In 2007, more than 120 South Korean victims were alive, but the number has since dropped to 47, with their average age standing at nearly 90.""I told Park that there needs to be strong political will to deal with many issues, vowing hopes for efforts by Seoul and Tokyo to resolve this issue,"" Yamaguchi said.On concerns over Japan's greater military role abroad, Yamaguchi said that Japan will make efforts to dispel worries by its neighboring country over Tokyo's recent legislation on security to South Korea.Japan's Diet enacted contentious security legislation in late September that allows Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense. The move permits Tokyo to fight alongside its allies even when it is not under attack.

(Yonhap)The communist  nation will repatriate Joo Won-moon, a New York University student alleged to have attempted to illegally cross the border from China, through the truce village of Panmunjom at 5:30 p.m. today, according to a ministry official. The North informed the South of the plan via fax.""It's a relief that North Korea has decided to repatriate our national, Joo,"" the official noted, adding that the North should also send back home three other South Koreans now held in the country.The move comes as North Korea has ratcheted up its missile and nuclear threats, raising tension on the Korean Peninsula following the hard-won conciliatory mood over long-strained inter-Korean ties.South and North Korea reached a landmark deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tension and resume the reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.But the North has vowed to launch a long-range rocket or hinted at conducting a fourth nuclear test as it is preparing for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, which falls on this Saturday.In an interview with U.S. news cable network CNN in May, Joo admitted that he had intentionally entered the North on the belief that his arrest could have a good effect on inter-Korean relations.With the repatriation of Joo, the North is holding three South Koreans -- missionary Kim Jung-wook, Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil.The North has held the 52-year-old Kim Jung-wook in captivity since October 2013, calling him a spy for South Korea's National Intelligence Service, who sneaked into the country with the purpose of inciting dissent. He was sentenced to hard labor for life in May 2014.In June, the North handed down the same sentence to the other two South Koreans for spying for the South's intelligence agency.

The North has called itself as a nuclear power in its constitution and adopted a policy of simultaneously developing nuclear arms and its economy.Apart from his scheduled meeting with Yun, Amano will also attend a dinner reception, hosted by Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, and meet with Science, ICT and Future Planning Minister Choi Yang-hee, , and Lee Un-chul, the chairman of the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission. He will also meet Kim Jong-kyung, president of Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.

Ambassador Li Jinjun made the remarks on Wednesday when he paid his tribute to the Chinese troops killed during the war. Wednesday marked China's Martyrs' Day on the eve of the country's National Day. The Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950, when tank-led North Korean troops invaded South Korea. The United States and 20 other allied countries fought on the side of South Korea under the United Nations flag, while Chinese soldiers came to help North Korea. The conflict ended in a cease-fire on July 27, 1953. During his visit to a cemetery of Chinese war dead in North Korea, Li praised the role of the Chinese intervention in the Korean War.

The Chinese intervention in the Korean War ""revived the cold breeze of China, safeguarded peace and stability in the region and around the world,"" Li said. Despite warming ties between South Korea and China, the Chinese view of how the Korean War started also remains controversial.

She was invited to a World War II anniversary event held in Moscow in May.But she did not visit there partly due to the Ukraine crisis, disappointing Russian officials.She attended a military parade in Beijing in September to mark China's war anniversary.Bilateral economic cooperation has also shown clear signs of slowing amid Russia's economic woes attributable to Western-led sanctions and a decline in oil prices.Two-way trade volume tumbled nearly 44 percent to $7.7 billion in the first half of this year from the same period in 2014.The Trans-Siberian Railway initiative has made little progress, with the trilateral logistics and gas supply projects also involving North Korea in the doldrums.The chill in South Korea-Russia relations marks a contrast to Russia's fast developing ties with China and North Korea.""South Korea-Russia cooperation appears to be in a stalemate amid a combination of Russia's bureaucracy, insufficient institutional support and economic troubles,"" a diplomatic source said.South Korea's interest in Russia is apparently reducing despite their ""strategic cooperative partnership,"" added the source.

We protect Germany. We protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world, Saudi Arabia. We protect everybody. We protect everybody and we don't get reimbursement,""Trump said during a news conference to announce campaign pledges on tax reforms.""We lose on everything. We lose on everything, so we're going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that's going to get the cost down for running our country very significantly,"" he said.Trump said the trade deals the U.S. has with other countries ""are not sustainable"" and he would renegotiate them, but did not elaborate. South Korea also has a free trade agreement with the U.S. that has been in effect since 2012.It was the third time Trump has publicly criticized South Korea over the American troop presence.In July, he said that whenever South Korea ""is in trouble, our military takes care. You know we get nothing."" In August, Trump also said that South Korea is making a fortune, but the U.S. sends its troops to defend the Asian ally in exchange for ""nothing."" The criticism shows Trump's ignorance about American security interests and policy.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the Asian ally from the communist North, a legacy of the1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, which left the divided peninsula still technically at war.Seoul has long shared the cost of stationing U.S. forces. Last year, the two countries renewed their cost-sharing agreement, known as the Special Measures Agreement, with Seoul agreeing to pay 920 billion won ($886 million) for 2014 for the upkeep of the U.S. troops, a 5.8 percent increase from a year earlier.Moreover, the American military presence on the peninsula is seen as in line with U.S. national interests in a region marked by a rising China.Trump has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination for next year's election as he made a series of unbridled remarks on immigration and other sensitive issues that apparently struck a chord with conservatives.

Traditionally in Korea, big eyes with double eyelids and a pronounced nose used to be the typical standard of beauty. While this is still common, the interest has recently moved on to having a so-called “V-line face,” referring to a narrow jawline that resembles the shape of the letter V. In both surgical and nonsurgical ways, women attempt to reduce the size of their face and make them more oval. “These days, many people are interested in reducing the size of their face and making it closer to the shape of a V, which is thought to help them look youthful,” said a plastic surgeon who wished to remain anonymous.To create the V-shaped look, doctors have introduced facial contour surgery and double-jaw surgery in addition to the traditional jaw surgery. The facial contour procedure focuses on cutting away parts of the cheekbone and jaw in order to make the overall facial shape look smoother. The double-jaw surgery cuts each side of the jawbone to shorten its length, thereby making the face appear smaller. In addition to the bone-cutting procedures, many also opt for nonsurgical ways to temporarily reduce the size their faces, such as through Botulinum toxin type A injection, commonly known as Botox. The Botox injection temporarily paralyzes the muscles, thereby reducing the muscles’ size for a few months. It is commonly used for jaws. Such bone-cutting jobs and nonsurgical methods have also attracted many foreign tourists, especially those from China, who visit Korea for plastic surgery. As of 2013, over 211,000 visited the country for medical tourism, with more than 26 percent of them being Chinese, according to government data. This is a tenfold increase from 2009.Last year, plastic surgery clinics across the country earned over 125 billion won ($105 million) from foreign patients, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Along with the usual interest in eye and nose jobs, many Chinese have shown interest in surgeries related to facial size, as well as repeat operations, industry insiders said. “Over 70 percent of our Chinese patients are people who are discontent with surgery that they had in China. The most common complaints are the unsatisfactory design of double-eyelids and nose function problems that were caused by an unprofessional nose job,” said overseas marketing director Johnny Chung at Dream Plastic Surgery in Seoul. source: Dream Plastic SurgeryInfection or skin adhesion can occur if the nose job is misconducted, he added. Despite foreign tourists’ high demand for plastic surgery here, the industry has recently seen a decline in sales after the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak struck the country. “Since the MERS crisis hit the country, the number of Chinese patients plummeted by 80 percent,” said an anonymous doctor who runs a plastic surgery in southern Seoul.According to the Korea Association of Travel Agents, the number of foreign visitors dropped by 82 percent in July and August compared the same period last year. Of them, Chinese declined by 84 percent to about 130,000. As part of the efforts to revive the medical tourism industry, the government vowed to temporarily offer tax refunds for a year to foreign visitors having plastic surgery here. From April next year, tourists who have six types of plastic surgery -- double-eyelid surgery, nose jobs, breast jobs, liposuction, wrinkle removal and cosmetic dentistry -- will get 10 percent tax back, officials said. Foreigners who arrange plastic surgery through illegal brokers, however, will be not be eligible for tax refunds, they added.

Speculation is rampant that North Korea is expected to launch a long-range missile around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.The ministry said in a report to the National Assembly that there is a possibility that the North could fire a missile to commemorate the anniversary as it is currently finishing construction at its rocket launch facility in Dongchang-ri on its west coast border.In recent satellite imagery, a new 67-meter-tall gantry has been spotted on the site, which experts says can be used for the launch of long-range missiles twice the size of the 30-meter Unha-3 that was launched into orbit in December 2012.Whether the North fires a long-range missile near the anniversary is under spotlight as the move will likely hamper the hard-won conciliatory mood on the Korean Peninsula.South and North Korea reached a landmark deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tension and make efforts to mend their long-frayed relations following the North's land-mine blasts near the border in early August.North Korea is under heavy sanctions by the United Nations Security Council for its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.Defense Minister Han Min-koo told lawmakers that there has been no sign of a missile launch by the North so far.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said the government does not exclude the possibility of North Korea's long-range missile launch, given the unpredictability of the North's regime.""The government is closely watching related situations,"" Yun said. ""Seoul plans to drum up global support to encourage the North to sincerely implement the inter-Korean deal and to prevent it from making an additional provocation.""Touching on a follow-up to the agreement, Han said that South Korea is preparing for the possibility that inter-Korean talks between ranking military officials could take place.""Seoul is preparing for possible military talks with Pyongyang as the deal calls for holding high-level talks,"" the minister said.The ministry also said it will conduct aggressive military operations near the demilitarized zone which bisects the two Koreas, where the North has frequently made provocations.""South Korea plans to renew its military posture by taking into account the North's land-mine provocations and the outcome of joint military drills between Seoul and Washington,"" the ministry said.""In particular, the South plans to draw up measures to conduct aggressive military operations at the DMZ.""It marked the first time that the government vowed to take aggressive operations near the heavily fortified border following the North's land-mine incident, which seriously injured two South Korean soldiers.The North expressed ""regret"" over the incident, but it later claimed that its regret does not equal an apology, rebutting Seoul's argument that it is the equivalent of an apology by international standards.Han said that Seoul is ready to resume the now-suspended loudspeaker campaign against Pyongyang at any time if the North makes provocations.""We are mulling various countermeasures as the military is always ready to counter the enemy's provocation,"" he said.

The reunions would be the first since February 2014.South and North Korea Red Cross officials pose for a photo during their talks to arrange the reunions of separated families. (Unification Ministry)Under the agreement, Seoul and Pyongyang will exchange on Sept. 15 lists of 250 and 200 applicants, respectively, who claim to have relatives across the border. They will, then, narrow down the numbers based on further confirmation of the applicants’ status and exchange the final lists of 100 people each by Oct. 8.The reunions will be held in two separate rounds, one for 100 South Korean applicants seeking their North Korean relatives, and vice versa.The South’s list will include 50 more applicants who wish to meet with relatives thought to have been captured by the North as prisoners of war or to have been abducted, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry. Since 2000 when the first family reunions took place, 35 people, who were purportedly taken by the communist regime against their will, have met with their relatives from the South through official reunion events.At the talks that began at 10:50 a.m. on Monday and continued for some 24 hours, the two sides also agreed to hold additional Red Cross talks “in the near future” to discuss a range of issues surrounding the separated families, the ministry said in a press release.“The two Koreas shared the view that they should work together to fundamentally address this humanitarian issue,” said Lee Deok-haeng, who led the three-member South Korean delegation, during a news conference.The Red Cross talks were held after the two sides agreed on Aug. 25 to hold the reunions around Chuseok, a major Korean holiday that falls on Sept. 27, as part of a comprehensive deal to defuse military tensions. The major bone of contention during the talks was the date for the reunions. Seoul hoped to hold the reunions at the earliest date possible, particularly before Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, during which time observers say Pyongyang could launch provocations such as a missile launch to strengthen internal unity and show off its military presence.But Pyongyang wanted to hold the event in late October, citing the amount of time to prepare for the event, including time for finalizing its own list of those to attend the reunions, Seoul officials said. At the talks, the South Korean side pushed to put a series of issues on the agenda to “fundamentally” resolve the issues of separated families. The agenda included exchanging lists of the surviving members of the divided families, allowing the family members to exchange letters and meet through video links and holding reunions on a regular basis. The agreement on the family reunions is expected to reinforce the momentum for a cross-border thaw. But uncertainties linger as analysts say the North could engage in provocative acts that could dampen the emergent reconciliatory mood.The South’s Red Cross will begin its selection of the applicants through a lottery system on Wednesday, officials said. It will first pick 500 out of the 66,000 people who claim to have relatives in the North and remain still alive, before finalizing the 100-member list later.Seoul has regarded the issue of the separated families as an urgent humanitarian one, a reason President Park Geun-hye proposed during her Aug. 15 Liberation Day speech that the two Koreas work together to identify those with loved ones across the border.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","agreed tuesday to hold reunions ,tuesday to hold reunions ,the two koreas agreed tuesday ,koreas agreed tuesday to hold ,tuesday to hold reunions of","['Koreas', 'Red Cross', 'inter - korean', 'Panmunjeom', 'North Korea Red Cross', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'Red Cross', 'Koreas', 'Lee Deok - haeng', 'south korean', 'the Red Cross', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'the South ’s Red Cross', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Koreas', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.13610272 0.83508134 0.48633659]

Presidents Park Geun-hye and Xi Jinping announced after their meeting on Wednesday they will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Seoul in late October or early November. The event is also likely to set the stage for first-ever talks between Park and Abe. “We’re hoping to have further communication with China and Korea to fine-tune the date, venue and other details about the meeting,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a news briefing in Tokyo. On the bilateral summit with Park, he added that Tokyo will respond positively “if the other side makes a request,” as it has been saying they need talks to resolve problems.  Seoul’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (center) and his Chinese and Japanese counterparts, Wang Yi (right) and Fumio Kishida, pose after their meeting on March 22 in Seoul. (Yonhap)Washington relayed support for better relations between the three neighbors, while lauding the agreement between Park and Xi to work more together for an early restart of six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing North Korea. “We believe that good relations among countries in the region promote peace and stability and are in their interests and in the interests of the U.S.,” State Department spokeswoman Katina Adams said in her commentary. “The U.S. is committed to working with its partners and allies in the region to achieve consensus on the terms for authentic and credible negotiations to implement the September 2005 Joint Statement and bring North Korea into compliance with applicable Security Council resolutions through irreversible steps leading to denuclearization.” Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo launched the gathering in 1999 to boost cooperation on Pyongyang’s nuclear threats, trade, sociocultural exchanges and other fields. But the summit has not taken place since May 2012 as spats escalated between China and Japan over remote islands in the East China Sea, Abe visited a controversial war shrine and spurred his revisionist push.In a bid to revive the initiative, their foreign ministers had their first consultations in about three years in March. The reconciliatory move came as South Korea has been stepping up efforts to mend icy relations with Japan, partly to soothe the U.S.’ pressure over the prolonged strain between its top two regional allies and views about Seoul’s deepening partnership with Beijing whose rise and growing assertiveness remain a source of concern for Washington. Abe, for his part, had apparently attempted to carry a more remorseful tone in his Aug. 15 statement marking the 70th anniversary of its defeat in World War II, though it stopped short of offering a new apology and thus incited criticism at home and abroad.

It is associated with the earlier part of the dynasty.Three of the roughly 140 ceramics from the ship had the word ""Naeseom"" inscribed on them, which was a government office in charge of managing items for use in palaces, according to the institute.Also among the relics were some 60 wooden tablets that mostly have the words ""Naju"" and ""Gwangheungchang"" written on them, meaning the ship departed from the city in South Jeolla Province headed to Gwangheungchang, the name of a major rice granary during the period.""We believe the ship sunk in waters off Mado Island while heading to Gwangheungchang carrying goods from Naju in the period ranging from the 1410s to 1420s,"" the institute said.Excluding Mado No. 4, 13 ancient shipwrecks have been found in South Korea up until now. Among them, 10 are thought to be from the Goryeo Dynasty, which preceded Joseon, two from 13th-14th century China and one from the Unified Silla (668-918). But this marked the first time that a Joseon-era ship was identified in the country's history of maritime archeology and excavation.

Urging the need to turn the crisis into an opportunity for the two Koreas’ relations, the parties called for the prompt arrangement of separate family reunions and follow-up measures to prevent similar provocations from the North in the future.“I am really glad that high-level talks ended on a sound note,” said the ruling Saenuri Party’s chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung. “We owe the success to the people and the military who stood united,” said Kim. NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in also offered rare commendation to the government, saying: “I appreciate the government’s efforts to ease cross-border tensions through the high-level talks. Taking this incident as an opportunity, I hope that both sides will take follow-up measures to prevent another such abnormal incident along the Demilitarized Zone.”NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in. (Yonhap) NPAD’s senior lawmaker Rep. Park Ji-won, who chairs the party’s Special Committee for Peace and Security, meanwhile urged the government to consider an inter-Korean summit to further the momentum. The last inter-Korean summit was held in 2007.But Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office who represented the South during the negotiation, dismissed such speculation during a midnight press briefing, saying that it is “too early” to consider the summit at the current stage. While the parties showed rare bipartisan support and refrained from politicizing the event, the NPAD also took time to mention the government’s handling of the agreement that they said left room for misinterpretation of the deal that could later undermine the historic agreement’s trustworthiness.“Upon hammering out the agreement, South Korea’s chief negotiator Kim Kwan-jin announced that North Korea agreed to apologize for the land mine incident and prevent a reoccurrence. That differs from the actual wording in the agreement and could be considered as a distortion of what both sides agreed on,” said Moon.Under the joint communique, North Korea expressed regret over the land mine explosion.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","korea rival parties tuesday welcomed ,south korea rival parties tuesday ,korean soldiers this month urging ,korea rival parties tuesday ,latest military standoff urging seoul","['South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'North Korea ’s', 'south korean', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Kim', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park Ji - won', 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'NPAD', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'North Korea', 'Moon', 'North Korea', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37390694  0.45341048

From the North, Hwang Pyong-so, vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission and director of the General Political Bureau of the (North) Korean People’s Army, joined hands with Kim Yang-gon, director of the North’s United Front Department and a secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, to steer the talks. Across the negotiating table were Kim Kwan-jin, chief of Cheong Wa Dae’s National Security Office, and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo.  Delegates of the two Koreas sit facing each other at their talks in Panmunjeom on Saturday. From left are: South Korea’s Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, South Korea’s National Security Office Chief Kim Kwan-jin, North Korea’s National Defense Commission Vice Chairman Hwang Pyong-so and North’s United Front Department Director Kim Yang-gon. (Unification Ministry)The two-plus-two meeting came after Seoul requested Hwang instead of Kim Yang-gon as the counterpart of Kim Kwan-jin. Pyongyang then demanded Hong, a former professor in North Korean studies, to accompany the former defense minister. While 73-year-old Kim Yang-gon is known for orchestrating cross-border affairs, Hwang, as a top military leader and one of the closest aides to leader Kim Jong-un, was seen holding the key to a possible breakthrough. The 67-year-old Hwang’s meteoritic rise came to light in April 2014 when the North’s state media announced his promotion to four-star general and the rarefied, coveted rank of vice marshal. The decision made by the party’s Central Military Commission spurned rampant speculation over the standing of Choe Ryong-hae, then chief of the politburo who was apparently flexing political muscle especially in the aftermath of the December 2013 execution of Jang Song-thaek, the young ruler’s once-formidable uncle and former NDC vice chairman. Having since taken over the positions of both Choe and Jang, Hwang frequently escorts Kim Jong-un on his public outings, appearing at a close distance. Hwang is believed to have won the trust of Kim’s late mother Ko Yong-hui in the run-up to his power succession, following the death of longtime dictator Kim Jong-il in December 2011, and had taken university classes together with Kim Kyong-hui, the leader’s aunt. He became a three-star general in April 2011 and the first vice director of the party’s organization guidance department in March 2014.  Last October he made a surprise trip to the South alongside Choe Ryong-hae and Kim Yang-gon primarily to attend the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon. Hwang and Kim Kwan-jin held their first talks during the one-day visit, which was also attended by Hong, who was then a presidential unification secretary. Kim Yang-gon, meanwhile, remains one of the few figures from the late leader’s era who has weathered a string of bloody purges and personnel shakeups under Kim Jong-un. He rose to fame as a prime engineer in key inter-Korean events, especially during the progressive administrations of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. He took charge of the party’s international affairs in 1997 and has overseen the department since the mid-2000s. In 2007, he made his debut by participating in a meeting between then-Unification Minister Chung Dong-young and Kim Jong-il in 2006 and a summit the following year between then-President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il. He has visited Seoul on several occasions, including for a meeting with Roh in 2007 and for the funeral of Kim Dae-jung in 2009. His work as Pyongyang’s point man on cross-border affairs continued even during the Lee Myung-bak presidency, with him having a covert meeting with Lee’s special envoy in Singapore in 2009. In August 2014, Kim Yang-gon delivered on behalf of Kim Jong-un a condolence message and flowers in commemoration of the fifth anniversary of Kim Dae-jung’s death to the South Korean delegation led by Rep. Park Jie-won of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. With Hwang’s political clout and Kim’s decades-long experience, hopes had grown that the sides will manage to reach a compromise and build momentum for rapprochement. Yet the talks, which stretched into the third day, appeared fragile and prone to another collapse given the seemingly irreconcilable differences over who is to blame for the recent land mine blast in the Demilitarized Zone. There have often been cases in the past where hard-won impetus vanished into thin air as the two sides failed to narrow their differences. During the October meeting, they had agreed to reopen high-level dialogue soon, only to see the plan die out in days as tensions flared over anti-Pyongyang leaflets launched by civic groups here.  By Shin Hyon-hee  (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","tensions flared over anti pyongyang ,hwang political clout and kim ,preachers for cross border thaw ,professor in north korean studies ,meeting between then unification minister","['inter - korean', 'North', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'National Defense Commission', 'the General Political Bureau', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'the North ’s United Front Department', 'Workers ’ Party ’s Central Committee', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Cheong', 'National Security Office', 'Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'Koreas', 'Panmunjeom', 'South Korea ’s', 'Hong Yong - pyo', 'South Korea ’s', 'National Security Office', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'North Korea ’s', 'National Defense Commission', 'Hwang Pyong - so', 'North ’s United Front Department', 'Kim Yang', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Pyongyang', 'Hong', 'north korean', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'Hwang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Hwang', 'North ’s', 'Central Military Commission', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'Jang Song - thaek', 'Hwang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Hwang', 'Kim', 'Ko Yong - hui', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Kyong - hui', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'Kim Yang', 'Incheon', 'Hwang', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'Hong', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'Kim Jong - un', 'inter - korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Chung Dong - young', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Seoul', 'Roh', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee', 'Singapore', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Dae - jung ’s', 'south korean', 'Park Jie - won', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Hwang', 'Kim', 'anti - pyongyang', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",0,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5439195   0.32878858

(Yonhap)The Army’s intranet homepage has been swamped with messages of encouragement from Army members for the two soldiers who were injured in an Aug. 4 land mine explosion in the Demilitarized Zone. North Korea has denied responsibility for the blast.The internal efforts to boost troop morale came as tensions spiked with Pyongyang forward-deploying a majority of its submarine forces, artillerymen and other offensive assets despite the ongoing bilateral talks aimed at defusing tensions.“I cannot leave my comrades behind and just get discharged at this time of crisis,” said Kang Beom-seok, a 22-year-old sergeant in the 15th Division who was to complete his 21-month service this week.“The troops of the 1st Division’s search team (who suffered from the land mine attack) put themselves behind to help their comrades even in a crisis. Like them, I will fulfill my mission until the end and bring my service to a successful conclusion.”Cho Min-soo, a 22-year-old sergeant of the Army’s 3rd Division, also delayed his discharge from the military even though he is to begin a new job next month.“I just take pride in the fact that I am a member of the 3rd Division, a unit the North is said to be fearful of,” he said. “It is only natural for me to remain here to defend our nation now in a military crisis.”Chang Woo-min, a 23-year-old marine conscript, also postponed his discharge from the military, which was due Monday. He said he could not violate the “marine principle” not to leave comrades behind in a battle zone.“I have always told junior soldiers that they should remain confident and courageous at all times. My decision is only a chance for me to execute what I think is important,” he said. “I will be proud of my decision even after my discharge.” The move was in contrast with North Korea’s state media’s reports over the weekend that South Korean troops deserted their bases amid the cross-border standoff and that South Korean men subject to military service left the country to avoid conscription.“(Due to South Korean men who are going abroad to avoid conscription), the prices of plane tickets have increased tenfold,” said Uriminzokkiri, a propaganda website run by the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland.Contrary to North Korea’s reports, swarms of online messages filled South Korea’s main portals, websites and social network services condemning North Korea’s move and pledging allegiance. “We are ready. Just call us,” one netizen said in his message posted on the Defense Ministry’s Facebook account.

On Thursday, North Korea gave a 48-hour ultimatum that the South remove all loudspeakers and stop the broadcast campaign, threatening to launch ""a strong military action"" otherwise.

South Korea accused the North of planting the mines inside the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas, a charge denied by North Korea.North Korea views the psychological warfare critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as an insult to its dignity.

""Rather than getting caught up in wordy and ambiguous expressions, we will continue to press Japan to put in practical efforts for sincere remorse over its past and for peace.""Abe said in the statement: ""Japan has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war.""While Kim noted that even an indirect reference to remorse and apology rendered the statement significant, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) argued that Abe still lacked sincerity.NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo said the Japanese prime minister only sought to ""evade responsibility.""""By making colonization seem an inevitable choice, (thestatement) virtually got Japan off the hook as a perpetrator,"" Kim said. ""It's quite regrettable that it only referred to the comfort women as those whose honor and dignity were hurt. We can only view this statement as something that only tried to evade responsibility through diplomatic rhetoric, rather than offering heartfelt apology and remorse over colonization.""Kim stressed that Japan ""will never develop into a future-oriented nation"" if it continues to avoid accepting responsibility for its past action.Civic groups echoed NPAD's sentiment that Abe lacked sincerity in his statement. Some were particularly upset with Abe's hinting that Japan has already done its share as far as apologizing goes.""We must not let our children, grandchildren and even further generations to come, who have nothing to do with that war, be predestined to apologize,"" Abe said.Yang Sun-im, president of the Association for the Pacific War Victims, said Abe might as well not have issued a statement at all.""When he says the future generations won't have to apologize, he's essentially saying they can start another war,"" Yang said.""Abe is turning his people into warmongers.""Lee Joo-sung, who heads a cooperative body of families of wartime forced laborers, said he doesn't consider Abe's statement an apology at all.""If Abe had just followed former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and apologized, the issue would have been settled,"" Lee said, referring to Murayama's landmark 1995 statement in which he offered ""a heartfelt apology"" over Japan's past ""aggression"" and ""colonial rule.""""The future generations won't be able to usher in a new era of Korea-Japan relations this way,"" Lee added.One surviving victim of wartime sex slavery also voiced her displeasure over Abe's lack of apology.Kang Il-chool, who watched Abe reading from his statement on television, was reduced to tears of anger.""There are victims who are still alive here, and he only talked about how the atomic bombings hurt his people,"" the 87-year-old said at the House of Sharing, a home for former sex slaves in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, just south of Seoul. ""The people who started the war made no mention of the victims.""There are 47 surviving victims, after eight have died this year alone. Only 238 women have been registered with the South Korean government as former sex slaves, though historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were sexually enslaved by Japanese troops during World War II.

Earlier on Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was delivered a report by a group of experts from Japan on their opinion on what should be included in the premier's statement to be released next week. The report cited acknowledgment of Japan's wartime aggressions, but at the same time it reportedly did not contain any calls for an apology, and instead refers to the South Korean government as having been moving around the ""goal post"" for the two country's history-related issues. ""(The report) runs counter to the Japanese government's declarations that it will carry forward the perception of history drawn up by the country's previous cabinets,"" the South Korean foreign ministry said, referring to the landmark Murayama and Kono statements that had offered an apology for Japan's wartime atrocities. ""Furthermore, some parts of the report show one-sided and farfetched views on the post-war Seoul-Tokyo relations, and are not at all helpful for the reconciliation between the people of the two nations,"" the ministry said. South Korea and Japan had been seeking to better their frayed ties as this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of their bilateral relations. The year is also the 70th anniversary of Seoul's liberation from Tokyo's colonial rule in 1945.

In July, the North threatened to cancel the trip, citing South Korea's alleged provocations.Lee is the widow of former President Kim Dae-jung, who held the first inter-Korean summit with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of current leader Kim Jong-un, in 2000.

Talks are also under way to arrange bilateral meetings with the U.S. and Japan.The two Koreas, Japan, China, Russia and the U.S. are members of the stalled six-party talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear program, talks that have drawn new attention in light of the recent progress in international efforts to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong will also join the ARF, the only regional security gathering to which the communist state is a party.He arrived in Kuala Lumpur just hours before Yun.""Minister Yun will stress the need for the international community to urge North Korea's denuclearization with one voice at the ARF meeting, while urging North Korea's meaningful return to denuclearization talks and expressing his will to improve inter-Korean ties through the resumption of South-North dialogue,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a press release Monday.Yun and Ri are expected to have several opportunities to meet each other due to their partly overlapping schedules, which include a gala dinner hosted by the Malaysian foreign minister on Wednesday and the ARF meeting on Thursday.Last year, the two ministers shook hands during the gala dinner at the ARF meeting in Myanmar, but did not hold official talks.South Korea has said it is open to dialogue with the North, but critics have raised doubts about a meaningful meeting between the two as inter-Korean tensions persist over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and human rights abuses, among other issues.North Korea on Monday approved a visit to the communist country by Lee Hee-ho, the widow of the late former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. South Korea has stressed that the four-day trip starting Wednesday will be of a private nature.Aside from North Korea's nuclear program, the ARF meeting is expected to be dominated by a fierce debate over the territorial dispute in the South China Sea, with China and the U.S. vying to have their voices heard.South Korea's position in the dispute has been that it is in its interest to maintain peace and stability in the waters that serve as a key trade route for the country.

Asked by one reporter whether he plans to meet with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se during his stay, he left without an answer.Reporters waiting for him at the hotel also missed him as he entered through a back door and headed straight for the elevator.The ARF participants include all the members of the six-party talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program, setting the stage for various bilateral and multilateral meetings on the issue.The six-party talks have not been held since late 2008, but the forum has drawn attention again in light of the recent progress in international efforts to curb Iran's uranium enrichment program.But North Korea has stepped up its rhetoric in recent weeks, saying it is not interested in unilaterally giving up its nuclear program first.Keen attention is being paid to whether the two Korean ministers will meet in between their partly overlapping schedules, which include a gala dinner on Wednesday and the ARF meeting on Thursday.South Korea has said it is open to dialogue with the North, but critics have raised doubts about a meaningful meeting between the two as inter-Korean tensions persist over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and human rights abuses, among other issues.Difficulties could be added by South Korea's efforts to include a clause condemning North Korea's nuclear and missile development in the ARF chairman's statement concluding the forum.Ri's visit has also drawn interest amid speculation of a possible meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, which would indicate efforts to mend bilateral ties that have soured in recent years due to North Korea's nuclear weapons drive.Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said earlier that Ri and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss their ""bilateral agenda and peace settlement in the Korean peninsula.""Japan's Kyodo news agency also reported that talks are under way to arrange a meeting between Ri and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday.From Malaysia, Ri will make official visits to Thailand and Brunei, according to the North's state media.

A chartered South Korean passenger airplane and two transport planes will also join the session. After touching down in Alaska, the pilots will undergo one week of pre-training to adapt themselves to the Alaskan airspace before joining the main exercise, according to the statement. This is South Korea's third year of participation in the annual exercise. The Air Force's F-15K combat jets joined the multiplatform coordinated drill in 2013, and FK-16 fighters took part in 2014. Before 2013, the South Korean Air Force dispatched transport helicopters on seven occasions to join the drill's transport segment, according to the statement. This year's training will cover joint operations like airborne alert interdiction and midair escort in a war simulation. The South Korean Air Force will engage in a live-fire training using the GBU-31 bomb, the first of its kind to be operated by the country's F-16 fleet, the statement showed.  ""The joint drill is expected to help increase the ability of space management and combat fleet operations through exercises spanning all sectors,"" the Air Force noted.  Following the drill, the South Korean fighters will fly back to the country's 19th Fighter Wing in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province, on Aug. 25.The combat jets were to fly about 8,100 kilometers nonstop to Alaska, a near 10-hour flight that's made possible by midair refueling 11 times from the U.S. Air Force's KC-135 aerial tanker, the statement said.

But they will now move out through their newly-built northern gates, making it difficult for South Korea to strike them promptly and accurately.“We have identified recent changes in the shape of the caves for the howitzers in an artillery unit under the North’s 4th Corps in Hwanghae Province. They have closed the southern entrances of the artillery caves and made the northern entrances,” the source told media.“It was relatively easier for our forces to destroy the southern entrances with our artillery and missiles. But now, it is more difficult for us to neutralize the artillery threats as the howitzers face the north in the opposite direction.”Pyongyang’s repositioning of its artillery came as the South has bolstered its counterstrike capabilities with the deployment of new weapons systems such as Israeli-made Spike missiles, which are capable of launching precision strikes on the North’s hidden coastal artillery. In an armed conflict, the North’s howitzers will move out through the northern gates, fire at its enemy forces and return to their caves. To destroy the artillery caves, Seoul plans to use combat aircraft to release the Guided Bomb Unit-28, better known as bunker busters, or the GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition. But with the artillery put on the reverse slope, it would become more difficult to conduct aerial strike missions, experts say.The North’s 170-mm howitzers have a range of 54 kilometers, putting the Seoul metropolitan area within striking range. The North is said to have reinforced its mountain caves and underground facilities to better protect its artillery forces.Meanwhile, the U.S. has been making a detailed map of North Korea’s underground military facilities in preparation of a military contingency, and running an educational program for both U.S. and South Korean officers, according to Yonhap News.Army Maj. Park Sung-man of the Special Warfare Command revealed in his contribution to a monthly magazine of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the U.S. Forces Korea has been running the program called “UGF,” or Underground Facility.The U.S. Army has run the UGF program since the mid-1990s and instituted the program for the USFK in 2007. South Korean officials have participated in the program since last year. The USFK spent more than six years making a map of North Korea’s underground facilities based on accounts from North Korean defectors.Alarmed by the massive air strikes by the U.S. during the 1950-53 Korean War, the North has been paying much attention to the underground fortification.

""We found it meaningful to expand our scope of customers more than generating short-term revenue."" Instead, the company said it will tap into other businesses by capitalizing on the wide scope of those using the app, which boasts 5 million orders monthly from around 3 million smartphone users.The existing commissions accounted for around 30 percent of its combined revenue, the company said, adding the new change will not excessively hurt its earnings. The company's revenue came to 29 billion won ($24.9 million) in 2014.It will, however, continue to charge regular monthly subscription fees to shop owners, which stand at around 30,000 won to 50,000 won. Around 150,000 shops are registered on the application.The company said South Korea's food-delivery market stands at around 12 trillion won to 14 trillion won annually, adding the application takes up around 1.7 trillion won of the combined volume.First distributed in 2010, the app provides users with services similar to the likes of the U.S. counterpart GrubHub Food Delivery & Takeout.The company said it will also launch a new service, ""Baemin Fresh,"" which will deliver foods, such as fruits and cooked dishes, through refrigerated trucks between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. to customers' doors in order to add to their convenience.The company came under the spotlight when U.S. financial firm Goldman Sachs said last year it will invest 40 billion won in the firm.Goldman Sachs officials then reportedly said the food-ordering program for smartphones is a ""locally made service with innovative ideas,"" with which the investment bank ""hopes to form a partnership and support further development.""

Yun plans to join the Warsaw-Berlin leg of the journey, according to the ministry's spokesman Noh Kwang-il.  The program is aimed at drawing attention to South Korea's cross-continent railway ambitions.   President Park Geun-hye and her administration have pushed for the ""Eurasia Initiative"" aimed at linking energy and logistics infrastructure across Asia and Europe. South Korea hopes to eventually link its rail network to Russia's Trans-Siberian Railway via North Korea.  Before the ride, Yun is scheduled to hold talks with his Polish counterpart, Grzegorz Schetyna, in Warsaw on Wednesday. It will be the first foreign ministerial meeting in seven years between the two nations.  Yun will also attend a K-pop concert and a seminar on Poland's experience in reconciliation with Germany.  The minister will then head to Berlin, the final destination of the Eurasia Express train, along with other passengers, and take part in various events to mark the end of the three-week train journey and publicize the need for the reunification of Korea.

Pyongyang claims that Seoul should first end its confrontational policy toward it.  But in what could be seen as a conciliatory gesture, the North, albeit at the non-government level, has proposed to have preparatory talks for the joint event.  On Sunday, the North's Korean Central News Agency said that the North will hold a variety of events to mark the 70th anniversary in Pyongyang and the truce village of Panmunjom on Aug. 13-15. The Korean Peninsula was under Japan's colonial rule from 1910-45.  North Korea ""keeps the door open to South Koreans"" who hope to take part in the events, the KCNA said.  In June, the two Koreas failed to hold a joint ceremony to mark the 15th anniversary of an inter-Korean summit as the North abruptly proposed holding separate events.  This time, the South's civic group may propose that the two sides hold anniversary events in both Seoul and Pyongyang and each other's representatives would visit the other's event venue, officials said.  If the joint event for Liberation Day is held, it will mark the first time since 2005 that such a joint anniversary event takes place.  The South Korean government earlier said it will promote inter-Korean civilian exchanges in the landmark year of 2015 in non-political areas, such as cultural activities and sports, if they can help promote national unity.

It is particularly so when it comes to a defense initiative that is costly and could be perceived as a security threat to its neighbors. In this July 16 phpoto, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attends a plenary session at the lower house in Tokyo. (AP-Yonhap)Despite its mantra of active contribution to peace, or “active pacifism,” Tokyo’s pursuit of heavier armament and an expanded security role remains a tough sell to both domestic and international audiences, due to its lack of efforts to secure domestic and international support.The U.S. has, of course, given full support -- if not pressure -- for its core security ally, Japan, to loosen the shackles of its war-renouncing constitution and play an active role to preserve the regional power balance, which has been challenged by the reemergence of China.However, domestic opposition and neighboring states’ growing suspicions about Tokyo’s intentions are posing a significant hurdle to Tokyo’s push for a “normal” state, which could potentially impede the U.S.’ security policy in Asia as well.At home, opposition to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push for collective self-defense -- the use of force to support its ally, the U.S., under attack -- seems to be greater than once thought. On Tuesday, more than 11,600 Japanese scholars voiced their opposition to Tokyo’s push for the passage of 11 security bills that would enable its troops to fight around the world to support the military operations of the U.S. under the collective self-defense concept.This collective opposition came after a survey by Tokyo Shimbun of 328 Japanese Constitution scholars found that 90 percent deemed Japan’s exercise of collective self-defense unconstitutional.After the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, New Komeito, passed the security bills in the lower house of the Diet last week, a survey by the Sankei Shimbun and Fuji News Network showed that public support for the Abe government dipped to 39.3 percent, a decrease of 6.8 percentage points from the previous month.The critics’ opposition seems to underscore their concerns that a cohort of nationalists including Abe are unbridled in pushing to nullify the pacifist constitution when the opposition political forces and civil society have failed to rein them in.Abroad, opposition to Abe’s hawkish security agenda is even greater.Koreans still regard Abe’s security drive as a potential security threat, although they do not feel threatened at all by military initiatives that the U.S., Britain or Australia take -- a good case that constructivist theorists may want to cite as an example of how the historical animosities can forge a culture of distrust and affect bilateral ties.Some Koreans even talk of the seemingly implausible scenario that Japan’s past militarism could reemerge with ultranationalist politicians taking center stage in policymaking, even though militarism can hardly be compatible with a consolidated democracy.Under the 1947 pacifist constitution, Japan has built a strategic culture that shuns provocative military actions with civilians leading the defense establishments and its government strictly adhering to international norms and law that promote global peace and stability. Its economic interdependence -- along with the U.S.-Japan alliance that has tamped down possible remnants of Japan’s imperialist ambitions -- has also made it inconceivable for Japan to revert to its past militarism.The current identity of Japan is totally different from that of the militarist Japan, which was institutionally unencumbered with military leaders wielding an enormous influence in the archipelago state’s policymaking.But an increasing number of Koreans appear to believe Abe’s nationalist moves could, in the long run, encroach upon their country’s national interests and part of its territory -- the easternmost islets of Dokdo which Tokyo has claimed in its defense white paper for 11 straight years.The deepening of Korea’s enmity toward its neighbor results largely from the lack of Tokyo’s efforts to build trust with Korea. Some observers say Japan is in a structurally difficult position to forge trust with Korea given its domestic circumstances that may favor a strong, nationalist leader to shore up Japan’s national pride that has been sapped by the rise of its neighbors, social angst emanating from frequent natural disasters and long periods of economic malaise.Whatever the reasons may be, Japan needs to take sincere steps to improve confidence with Korea, or at least refrain from taking actions that would further provoke Koreans and worsen the bilateral relationship. On Korea’s part, it should be ready to accept Japan’s possible overtures for trust-building. International relations pundits often say it takes “excruciatingly painful” steps for a country to restore trust with its onetime foe in international politics. Korea is not asking Japan to take “painful” steps and disarm or to do anything to that effect. Korea wants Japan to face up to history and undertake a security role in a transparent manner that would command the respect of its neighbors rather than sparking a security dilemma for itself. The U.S. may help Japan go in that direction.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","growing suspicions about tokyo intentions ,japan to take painful steps ,states growing suspicions about tokyo ,growing suspicions about tokyo ,japan is in structurally difficult","['japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Tokyo', 'AP', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo Shimbun', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Liberal Democratic Party', 'New Komeito', 'Diet', 'the Sankei Shimbun', 'Fuji News Network', 'Abe', 'Abe', 'Abe ’s', 'Koreans', 'Abe ’s', 'U.S.', 'Britain', 'Australia', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Abe ’s', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.88033962  0.05801793

The government has been pushing to give corporate management more leeway in laying off workers as the country strives to revive the faltering economy.  She warned that it would be even harder for young people to find jobs next year unless a wage peak system properly takes root.  The system is designed, among other things, to provide job security for older employees through a gradual wage cut after a certain age. The money saved can be used to hire more young people.  The unemployment rate for young people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 10.2 percent in June, compared with the overall jobless rate of 3.9 percent in the same period, according to government data.  She also called for reform in the finance and public sectors as well as education.  Separately, she instructed Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to concentrate government resources on rooting out corruption and fixing abnormalities across society.  Hwang told Park that he will press ahead with the anti-corruption drive, calling it a must to become an advanced country. He also vowed to ensure a system is in place to verify budgets and their implementation of major government projects.  The comments came more than a month after a rear admiral was arrested for alleged corruption in connection with the country's arms procurement projects, the latest in a series of bribery scandals that have hit the Navy.  Chung Ok-geun, who served as Navy chief of staff from 2008-2010, was arrested in January on charges of receiving more than 700 million won ($605,000) from local defense firms.

Hwang Joon-kook will be in Shanghai until Tuesday and visit Beijing from Tuesday to Friday for talks with university scholars, think tank researchers and journalists, among other experts.


Hwang also plans to meet with Wu Dawei, China‘s special representative for Korean Peninsula Affairs.


Both Hwang and Wu are their governments’ top envoys to the now-stalled six-way talks on Pyongyang‘s nuclear weapons drive. The negotiations also involve the U.S., Japan and Russia.


Prior to his departure, Hwang told Yonhap News Agency that he believes China needs to take the “initiative” in solving the North Korean nuclear problem.


“North Korea hasn’t responded to calls for dialogue, and the Pyongyang-Beijing ties have also been strained,” he said. “South Korea and China need to strengthen their strategic communication and find a breakthrough (with the nuclear issue), and in particular, I think China needs to play a role and take the initiative.”


A South Korean government source said Hwang‘s trip comes at a key juncture, with consultations between Seoul and Beijing on Pyongyang rendered more necessary following the recent agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue.


“China must be thinking long and hard about its relationship with North Korea,” the source said. “It’s the right time for us to share our thoughts with China.”


China, as North Korea‘s economic lifeline and diplomatic backer, appears to hold the key to pressuring Pyongyang to return to the six-party talks.

More than 200 South Koreans gathered at Seoul Station before setting out on a 20-day, 14,400-kilometer journey on the “Eurasia Express,” displaying their resolve and sharing their mission statement. They then flew to Vladivostok, the train’s starting point, while some 50 others departed for Beijing to take a branch line designed to merge with the main route through Berlin in the eastern Russian city of Irkutsk on July 19 via Ulaan Bator. The participants include high-flying figures from the political, business, academic and cultural sectors as well as the offspring of independent fighters and other special guests and ordinary citizens who won a contest. Participants pose at a ceremony celebrating the opening of a special express train route linking Asia and Europe at Seoul Station, Tuesday. Attendees included Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong (second from right, front row); Chung Chong-wook (third from left, front row), vice chairman of the presidential committee on unification preparation; and KORAIL president Choi Yeon-hye (center, front row). (Yonhap)The project is a signature piece of President Park Geun-hye’s “Eurasia Initiative,” aimed at expanding partnerships with other countries there by connecting roads and railways such as the Trans-Korean Railway and the wider Trans-Siberian Railroad reaching Europe. “I wish the express will be a meaningful event to distribute and share our people’s dreams, hopes and resolve for peace and unification with the international community,” Park said in a video message unveiled at the launching ceremony. “We should realize our dream of a peaceful unification by reconnecting the broken tracks between the South and North and make our way to a country that contributes to global peace and mutual development by making Eurasia a continent that represents creativity and peace.” Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong called the train a “hardware for integration” to embody one continent, saying it may help overcome the disconnect between the two continents and form a broad economic bloc through comprehensive transportation and logistics infrastructure. “The Korean Peninsula, which has over the past decades become a virtual island, is now taking a first step in the crucial process of being reborn as a bridge between the Eurasia and Asia-Pacific economic blocs,” he said in his congratulatory remarks. “I believe this will contribute to realizing Eurasia’s potentials and world peace and shared prosperity, benefiting all nations.” At each stop including Moscow and Warsaw, there will be forums and seminars such as on business, logistics, cultural exchanges, foreign affairs and unification. The biggest events are scheduled in Berlin, the final destination, such as a music concert in front of Brandenburg Gate, a conference on unification and a march to the Berlin Wall marking the 25th anniversary of the unification of East and West Germany and the 70th anniversary of the separation of the Korean Peninsula.

It did not specify how many people will be granted pardons.""The DPRK cabinet and relevant organs will take practical measures to help the released people settle down in their works and living,"" the KCNA said.The DPRK is the acronym of North Korea's official name: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The move comes amid reports that some mid-ranking North Korean officials have sought asylum to escape the young leader's reign of terror. It is widely designed to placate the public sentiment and reinforce loyalty for the leader, experts say.The planned pardons would be the first since 2012, when the North made a similar move to mark the 100th birthday of the North's late founder Kim Il-sung and the 70th birthday of Kim Jong-il, the late father of the current leader Kim Jong-un.In 2005, Pyongyang carried out an amnesty to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Korea's liberation and the founding of its party.Liberation Day falls on Aug. 15, and the date for the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea is Oct. 10.South Korea's state spy agency earlier said that the North's leader Kim has tightened his grip on his power base in a brutal way, including the execution of about 70 senior officials, since taking office in late 2011.On Saturday, North Korea confirmed the purge of former defense chief Hyun Yong-chol as it called Pak Yong-sik the minister of the People's Armed Forces.

Under the slogan “One Dream, One Eurasia,” high-profile figures from the political, business, academic and cultural circles as well as dozens of special guests and ordinary citizens will gather in Seoul before flying to Vladivostok and Beijing for two different itineraries covering 14,400 kilometers in total. In Vladivostok, about 200 of them will take the 12,000-kilometer main route on a charter journey to Berlin, with five additional stops in Russia and one in Warsaw. A branch line carrying another 50 is to depart from Beijing to join the others in the eastern Russian city of Irkutsk on July 19 via Ulaan Bator. “The railway is aimed at ushering in a new era for Eurasia based on better communications and cooperation with the vast continent,” Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said after unveiling singer Yoon Jong-shin and actress Ko Sung-hee as honorary ambassadors for the program last week. “If Eurasia’s logistics networks meet a trans-peninsular railroad, it will improve the connectivity between Asia and Europe and eventually help lay the groundwork for a peaceful unification of the two Koreas.”  A Trans-Siberian train (KORAIL)The project is a key feature of President Park Geun-hye’s “Eurasia Initiative,” which she unveiled last October to boost ties with other related nations by connecting roads and railways such as the Trans-Korean Railway and the wider Trans-Siberian Railroad reaching Europe. She also proposed the launch of the “Silk Road Express” running from South Korea to Europe via North Korea, Russia and China, as well as an integrated Eurasia power grid and a logistics hub that covers China, Central Asia and Eastern Europe.It is also in line with Park’s proposed vision to foster peace and trust in Northeast Asia, starting with cooperation on climate change, antiterrorism and other nonpolitical matters, and ultimately progressing to security partnerships.“Eurasia has various strategic values that can benefit not only a divided peninsula but also a reunified Korea,” Ko Jae-nam, a professor at the state-run Korea National Diplomatic Academy, wrote in a recent report, citing its ample resources reserves, markets for exports and investment, and know-how for peace processes and multinational diplomatic cooperation. “Given that the Northeast Asia and Eurasia initiatives are built on a mutually driving mechanism also involving the so-called peninsula trust-building process, an expansion and strengthening of security cooperation with Eurasia nations is pivotal for the policies’ success.” Yet skepticism remains over the project’s limited efficacy, based on Pyongyang’s nonparticipation and a perceived focus on showy events. With the North being aloof toward the rail programs, the train will inevitably set out in Vladivostok, skipping the upper part of the peninsula. At each stop, the passengers will take part in forums and seminars on business, logistics, cultural exchanges, foreign affairs and unification, among other subjects. The final destination will house major events such as a music concert in front of Brandenburg Gate, a conference on unification and a march to the Berlin Wall marking the 25th anniversary of the unification of East and West Germany and the 70th anniversary of the division of the peninsula. The Foreign Ministry and the state-run Korea Railroad Corp. have channeled 1 billion won ($896,000) and 600 million won, respectively, into the event. With contributions from businesses, the total budget is forecast to top 2 billion won, officials say.“While the Rajin-Khasan project was a pilot project on freight carriage for the Eurasia Initiative, the express train marked its demonstration of passenger transportation,” said Na Hee-seung, a senior researcher at the Korea Railroad Research Institute. He was referring to the Russian-led initiative to refurbish the North Korean port city of Rajin and a railroad reaching the nearby Russian town of Khasan, involving three South Korean companies ― KORAIL, POSCO and Hyundai Merchant Marine. “Though North Korea is not taking part in this project, it will send a positive message about inter-Korean railroad cooperation and help expedite its participation in future programs.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","250 south koreans are poised ,berlin with five additional stops ,gather in seoul before flying ,three south korean companies korail ,20 day journey across asia","['South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Eurasia', 'Seoul', 'Vladivostok', 'Beijing', 'vladivostok', 'Berlin', 'Russia', 'Warsaw', 'Beijing', 'russian', 'Ulaan Bator', 'Eurasia', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Yoon Jong - shin', 'Ko Sung - hee', 'Eurasia', 'Koreas', 'Trans - siberian', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Eurasia Initiative', 'Trans - korean Railway', 'Trans - siberian Railroad', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'China', 'Eurasia', 'China', 'Park ’s', '“eurasia', 'Korea', 'Ko Jae - nam', 'Korea National Diplomatic Academy', 'Eurasia', 'Eurasia', 'Pyongyang', 'vladivostok', 'Brandenburg Gate', 'West Germany', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'Korea Railroad Corp.', 'Rajin', 'Khasan', 'Na Hee - seung', 'the Korea Railroad Research Institute', 'Russian', 'north korean', 'Rajin', 'russian', 'Khasan', 'south korean', 'KORAIL', 'POSCO', 'Hyundai', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",1,"[ 2.          1.          2.         ... -0.36636582  0.73809588

(Yonhap)Lee Hee-ho, the widow of former President Kim Dae-jung, will take a direct flight over the West Sea to Pyongyang on Aug. 5 for a four-day visit, her aides said Monday after their talks with the North Korean side, raising expectations for her role to thaw frosty inter-Korean relations.The 93-year-old widow of the former leader, noted for his efforts for cross-border reconciliation and cooperation, is to stay in the Baekhwawon Guesthouse in Pyongyang and visit a child care center, a children’s hospital, the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital and Mount Myohyang, they said.Lee last visited the North in December 2011 to attend the funeral for former North Korean ruler Kim Jong-il. “Kim Jong-un, the first chairman of the (North’s) National Defense Commission, has made a proposal for Lee to travel to the North by air in consideration of her health. Lee also agreed to that,” Kim Sung-jae, the director of the Kim Dae-jung Peace Center and former culture minister, told reporters as he returned to the South after his talks with North Korean officials in Gaeseong.“Whether the North would send an airplane to the South or we will use a South Korean plane … this has yet to be determined, and we will have to further discuss it.”Kim added that the two sides have not reached any decision over whether Lee will meet the North Korean leader during her stay in the communist state. She is thought to have met with Kim during her visit to the North in 2011.Five officials, including Kim, and the five-member North Korean delegation, led by Maeng Kyong-il, vice chair of the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, reached the agreement at a meeting in the North Korean border city.The meeting followed the previous one held last Tuesday, during which Lee’s side reportedly delivered her wish to visit the North within the month for a four-day trip. Lee has expressed her hopes to deliver relief supplies along with knitted caps and scarves to young children.Her planned visit has been drawing keen attention as it could help create much-needed momentum to improve the strained relations that have continued to deteriorate due to Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear arms and its provocative rhetoric and actions. Lee’s visit has been sought since North Korean leader Kim offered a handwritten invitation to her last year. The invitation was delivered after she sent a wreath to Kim last December to mark the third anniversary of the death of his father, former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.Lee’s side initially proposed holding talks with Pyongyang in April to arrange her visit to the North. But the North rejected the talks amid cross-border tensions that escalated due in large part to Pyongyang’s angry response to the South Korea-U.S. military drills and other issues.Inter-Korean tensions have shown no signs of abating.On Monday, through the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, the North threatened to strike South Korea should it set off what it calls “provocations.” It portrayed inter-Korean relations as “coming to a devastating end.”“South Korea talks of a two-track policy mixing pressure and dialogue, and crazily calls for us to give up our nuclear program,” the daily said. “The gist of the South’s provocative move is a rivalry between the two systems, and its objective is to wage a war to invade the North.”The establishment on June 23 of a U.N. field office in Seoul to monitor North Korea’s human rights abuses has been drawing the ire of Pyongyang, which has argued that the office is designed to overthrow its regime by politicizing the issue and meddling in domestic affairs. Inter-Korean ties were further strained after Seoul imposed financial sanctions on June 26 on six Taiwanese individuals and entities and a Syrian institution over suspicions that they traded arms and gave support to the North.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraladcorp.com)","her aides said monday after ,2011 to attend the funeral ,visit her aides said monday ,widow of former president kim ,her aides said monday","['Kim Sung - jae', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'the Customs , Immigration and Quarantine Office in Paju , Gyeonggi Province', 'Yonhap)Lee Hee - ho', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'inter - korean', 'the Baekhwawon Guesthouse', 'Pyongyang', 'the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'National Defense Commission', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Kim Sung - jae', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'north korean', 'Gaeseong', 'south korean', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Maeng Kyong - il', 'north korean', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Pyongyang', 'Lee', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Lee', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'North ’s', 'Workers ’ Party', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Korea', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'taiwanese', 'syrian', 'Song Sang - ho']",1,"[ 0.          8.          0.         ... -0.38264516  0.40610909

Boeing’s KC-46 and Israel Aerospace Industries’ B767 MMTT were in the competition.The decision defied the prevailing speculation that in its military procurement decision, Seoul would focus on variables associated with its alliance with the only security ally, the U.S., and interoperability with American forces. Observers said that Seoul’s decision might have sent a signal to the U.S. that in future arms deals, it would prioritize cost-effectiveness and overall utility issues rather than allowing political and diplomatic factors to affect its key procurement decisions.“I am a little cautious to comment as details of the negotiation process are not available. But this time, South Korea placed its top priority on the costs and practical utility aspects though they are also aware of the importance of the alliance factors,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.“The decision may help raise South Korea’s bargaining power in future negotiations over the purchase of expensive U.S. military equipment.”Some critics have claimed that in some cases, U.S. dealers have raised prices of their products much higher than initially proposed, thinking that Seoul would put its top priority on factors related to interoperability with U.S. forces. They added that Tuesday’s decision would allow South Korea to diversify its options to purchase high-tech military equipment. According to the annual Global Defense Trade Report of the research institute IHS, South Korea was the world’s seventh-largest importer of defense equipment in 2014. But, nearly 80 percent of the country’s imports came from the U.S.Some analysts noted that if the summit between President Park Geun-hye and her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama had been held as scheduled last month, Seoul might have put more stress on the alliance factors in its decision over the tanker project.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday seoul picked airbus a330 ,introduce four tankers from 2018 ,two decades boeing kc 46 ,four tankers from 2018 2019 ,procure four aerial refueling tankers","['South Korea ’s', 'european', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Airbus', 'Korea', 'european', 'Boeing', 'Israel Aerospace Industries', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Park Won - gon', 'Handong Global University', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Global Defense Trade Report', 'ihs', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64680558  0.77347726

This will lead to emissions of 536 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, the Environment Ministry said. The new goal was finalized at a Cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. “(The government) raised the target from the previous plans as it has acknowledged Korea’s leading role in anticarbon efforts in the global community and the need to take this opportunity to innovate in the renewable energy industry and manufacturing business,” Hwang said. Earlier this month, the government unveiled four proposals that would cut carbon by 14 percent to 31 percent from the BAU level of 2030 in consideration of feasibility, gross domestic product forecasts and potential economic impacts. The government’s toughened pledge came after public criticism that the state’s four post-2020 plans were a sharp backslide compared to the 2009 plan. In 2009, the government proposed limiting the emissions to 543 million tons by 2020, a 30 percent cut from projected levels, although Korea was not obligated to cut the emissions. All four proposals this year, however, were likely to allow more emissions by 2020, stirring both local and international criticism.  Sustainable Development Solutions Network Korea for the United Nations had urged the government to redraft the commitment, claiming that all the options would “seriously damage Korea’s credibility in the world and chill down the heat of green innovation and creative economy efforts.” U.S. President Barack Obama had also asked his counterpart Park Geun-hye to offer an ambitious plan for the long run during a phone call on June 12. The call was made after Park’s visit to Washington was postponed in light of the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. Although the government pledged to set a stronger aim, critics see little improvement. The industry sector will be responsible for 12 percent of the emissions cut, the same as in the original plan, in consideration of potential business damage. But the final plan was still opposed by the business and the civic sectors.“The government’s excessive cuts plan will act like another ‘cancer-like’ regulation that holds business back,” the business union Federation of Korean Industries said, demanding a plan review.Civic groups, on the other hand, argued that the business sector must shoulder much more of the anticarbon burden, as it is the largest emitter in the country. “Giving relatively lighter anticarbon responsibility to the industry, which contributes to 70 percent of the emissions in the country, suggests that the other sectors, such as the transportation business or households, have to shoulder the rest of the cuts burden, ” Ahn Byung-ok, the head of the Institute for Climate Change Action, told The Korea Herald. Green experts also claimed that the scheme to reduce emissions by an additional 11.3 percent may strategically take advantage of other countries’ climate efforts.The environment authorities vowed to utilize the international market mechanism for the additional cut plan. Under the IMM, countries are allowed to buy and sell emission rights by using carbon credits. “Purchasing emission rights also takes financing. The state, however, has not mapped out the funding plan yet. The final proposal does not show the government’s active will to tackle the climate issue,” Ahn added. As of 2012, Korea had become the seventh largest emitter in the world with emissions per capita standing at sixth. As part of its efforts to help the carbon cut of the business sector, the government said it would support anticarbon technology development and consider building more renewable energy facilities and nuclear power plants as an alternative to coal-powered stations. The business union, however, refuted, saying that nuclear power plants cannot be a realistic option due to fierce resistance from environmentalists. It also added that renewable energy may only hike the electronic fare, considering the cost and benefits.  “The figure ’37 percent’ seems like the state drastically improved the post-2020 plan, but the proposal is actually very weak. The government needs to use this time as an opportunity to set up a long-term strategy over how to cut emissions and manage the industry environment,” SDSN Korea Director Young Soo-gil said. The final plan was submitted to the U.N. later in the day. The proposal will be evaluated for an international climate pact to be adopted at the U.N. conference in Paris in December.

The WHC is expected to make its decision over the listing of the sites on Friday or Saturday.Seoul has demanded either that seven of the sites be excluded from the candidate list, as nearly 57,900 Koreans were forced to work there during the 1910-45 colonial era, or that Tokyo clearly present the facts about forced labor for visitors to know the dark side of the sites’ history.After the meeting with his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida on June 21, Seoul’s Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told reporters that “from a broad perspective,” the two sides had reached an agreement. His remarks were construed as Tokyo having agreed to specify that forced labor took place at the sites.The decision at the WHC session is usually to be made based on consensus among the 21 WHC members. But a vote could be set up should the members fail to reach consensus ― a situation that all want to avoid because the voting procedure could undermine the committee’s consensus-based decision-making process and lead to a politicization of the issue.To avoid the situation, Seoul and Tokyo have engaged in intense talks. Last week, Choi Jong-moon, Seoul’s ambassador for cultural and UNESCO affairs, met with Jun Shinmi, director-general for cultural affairs at Tokyo’s Foreign Ministry, to discuss how to implement the “broad” agreement that their foreign ministers had reached.Observers say Japan could present the facts about slave labor by specifying it in a WHC decision document, installing signposts to explain the facts at the sites, distributing pamphlets about slave labor at the sites or putting the facts on the Internet homepage of the sites.During the WHC session that will last through next Wednesday, it will determine the fate of nearly 40 candidate sites including South Korea’s historic sites of the ancient Baekje Kingdom (18 B.C.-660 A.D.) for world heritage status.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","bonn germany sunday amid talks ,saturday seoul has demanded ,sunday amid talks between seoul ,opened in bonn germany sunday ,intense talks last week choi","['the World Heritage Committee', 'Japan', 'Meji', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan ’s', 'the World Heritage Sites List', 'WHC', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Seoul', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Tokyo', 'WHC', 'WHC', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Choi Jong - moon', 'Seoul', 'UNESCO', 'Jun Shinmi', 'Tokyo ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Japan', 'WHC', 'South Korea ’s', 'Baekje Kingdom', 'B.C.-660 A.D.', 'Song Sang - ho']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77104241  0.57772112

It is abandoning the duty of politics that should stand for the people.”President Park Geun-hye attends the Cabinet meeting at Cheong Wa Dae, Thursday. YonhapPark exercising her veto came 10 days after the bill was sent to the Cabinet last Monday. It is her first veto of a bill since she took office in early 2013 and the 73rd presidential veto since the beginning of the Syngman Rhee administration in 1948.Park had stood in stern opposition to the bill, saying she would use her veto power if no changes were made to the bill before it reached the stage of her endorsement. Though the parliament sent through a toned-down version agreed on by the two main parties, the presidential office reiterated that it still violates the constitutional principle that stipulates the division of powers. Park said that her use of veto power was “inevitable,” stressing that the bill could also paralyze the function of the executive branch and court a national crisis.With the president returning the bill, the parliament is required to put the bill up for a vote again. The bill needs approval from more than two-thirds of attending lawmakers to override the veto. If it fails to meet the quorum, the bill will automatically be scrapped.Shortly after Park vetoed the bill, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy threatened to boycott parliamentary sessions.“Our party has accepted the Assembly speaker’s offer to compromise (with the ruling party to revise the wording of the act) to avoid political wrangling at a time of state emergency,” said NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in.“Politics has vanished, only the president’s stubbornness and obstinacy remain.”The NPAD, however, decided to separately deal with the passage of MERS-related bills. A sub-parliamentary committee on health and welfare Thursday afternoon approved a set of 19 MERS bills, sending the package to the legislation and judiciary committee for legal review before they are put to a vote.The ruling party also appeared divided but remained cautious over Park’s biting criticism. Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung said that the party has decided to “respect the president’s decision.” During an emergency meeting held later in the afternoon, the governing party lawmakers agreed to abandon the bill, turning down the opposition’s demand to endorse it again.On Park’s blistering remarks on the party leadership, Saenuri floor leader Yoo Seung-min defended himself, saying that he had done his best in leading a bipartisan negotiation with the NPAD. Yoo and his opposition party counterpart agreed to pass the Public Servants’ Pension bill in tandem with the revised Assembly bill.Park bombarded Yoo, holding him responsible for succumbing to the opposition party’s demand to pass the bill and casting a slur against him for being critical of her major policies. “It is questionable what the ruling party leadership has done to support the government and the party’s efforts to revive the economy,” said Park.By Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com)","thursday vetoed the controversial revision ,president also inveighed the politicians ,threatened to boycott parliamentary sessions ,the president stubbornness and obstinacy ,after park vetoed the bill","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly Act', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'YonhapPark', 'Cabinet', 'Syngman Rhee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Assembly', 'NPAD', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seung - min', 'Assembly', 'Yoo', 'Cho Chung-un(christory@heraldcorp.com']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40844172  0.59460694

""Because nations that disregard diplomacy and use coercion and intimidation to settle disputes or turn a blind eye to aggression of others only invite instability and undermine the collaborative goals of the international community.""In an apparent swipe at China's computer piracy, Biden also said that countries that use cyber-technology as an economic weapon or profit from the theft of intellectual property ""are sacrificing tomorrow's gains for short-term gains today.""Chinese officials called for respecting ""each other's core interests.""""As long as our two countries adopt an overall perspective, respect and accommodate each other's core interests and be committed to a constructive approach to reduce misunderstanding and miscalculations, we can manage our differences and maintain our common interests,"" Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong said.Vice Premier Wang emphasized the importance of dialogue.""On some issues, perhaps, consensus still eludes us. However, talking to each other could help pave the way to finding a solution, or at least help keep our differences under control,"" he said. ""Although dialogue may fall short of expectation, and sometimes nothing much is achieved, leaving everybody unhappy, yet it would always be more preferable than confrontation.""Kerry said that this week's talks will discuss regional security in the Asia Pacific, ""including stability in the Korean Peninsula,"" and the need to reduce tensions rather than add to them in the South China Sea and the East China Seas.Last week, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel said that the U.S. will use the strategic talks with China to discuss ways to get North Korea out of the ""fantasy"" that it can revive its broken economy without having to give up its nuclear program.

The absence of top-level dialogue has resulted in a lack of mutual understanding and amplified mistrust between them,” Nishino told The Korea Herald.“Of course, they can hardly strike the same chord on historical issues, but dialogue would allow them to grasp why their views diverge, and seek common ground, based on which they can pursue future-oriented cooperation.” Junya Nishino, political science professor at Keio University, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald at a hotel in Seoul, Saturday. (Song Sang-ho/The Korea Herald)Amid ongoing historical and territorial feuds, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have yet to hold a bilateral summit. The two sides met for a trilateral summit arranged by U.S. President Barack Obama in March 2014. Among various issues that require bilateral coordination, Seoul and Tokyo need to address “perception gaps” concerning China and North Korea ― two major factors that affect the regional security landscape, the scholar pointed out.Japan has viewed a rising China as a potential security challenge in light of its long-simmering territorial conflict with China over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea, while South Korea views China as a crucial strategic partner. Views on the North have also differed at times. Under the liberal Seoul governments between 1998 and 2008, cross-border ties improved with the two sides holding summits twice and Seoul viewing Pyongyang as a neighbor to embrace. But negative views about the provocative regime prevailed in Tokyo during the period, due to Pyongyang’s persistent nuclear and missile threats and the issue of Japanese nationals adducted by the North.“Due to differences in terms of geopolitical conditions, historical experiences and national power, the two sides have divergent views on China. To narrow their differences, the two sides need to consult on the issue,” he said,“Different views about North Korea could affect the issue of peninsular unification. The two sides thus need to sit down and discuss how they can work together to ensure a stable, prosperous post-unification era.” Mentioning a set of reasons why historical issues have been highlighted in recent years, Nishino noted that there had been moves in both countries to “reevaluate their identities,” which led to the politicization of historical issues.Some Japanese have sought to use the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II this year to review the historical path that their country has taken since then. In Korea, which has developed into a vibrant, pluralistic democracy featuring a broad spectrum of opinions, voices have also been rising to reevaluate their history and redefine Korea-Japan relations, the professor explained.Coupled with people’s focus on history, domestic social and economic challenges have made bilateral efforts to improve the strained ties “stagnant,” he noted.“After the ferry disaster in Korea in April 2014, things in Korea seemed to come to a standstill, while there have been moves in Japan to extricate itself from the so-called ‘two lost decades’ with a major earthquake in eastern Japan in 2011 having shocked the Japanese,” he said.“Thus, people in both nations have paid more attention to domestic issues and been affected by nationalism in a sense, which has made it difficult for the two sides to make progress over history issues and move their relationship forward.” Commenting on the five decades since the two countries normalized their diplomatic ties, Nishino expressed dismay that the cooperative aspect of the Korea-Japan relations has been overshadowed by the inordinate focus on historical issues.“In the relations, economic issues have taken a larger portion while there has been an increase in people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Since 1990s, the two sides have also cooperated over security issues involving North Korea,” he said.“We should look at the relations through this whole, entire picture accurately.”Despite seemingly endless historical disputes, Nishino painted a positive outlook for relations, pinning hopes on the younger generations in both nations who share largely positive feelings towards one another.He suggested that each government encourage civic groups to bolster their exchanges and cooperation and push for various youth exchange programs such as school field trips to help future generations better understand one another.“Cooperation in civil society sectors has already been active. I hope politicians can help bolster such cooperation rather than hindering it,” he said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","their historical tensions japanese scholar ,mitigate their historical tensions japanese ,feuds south korean president park ,coordination seoul and tokyo need ,historical tensions japanese scholar","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Junya Nishino', 'Keio University', 'Tokyo', 'Nishino', 'the Korea Herald', 'Junya Nishino', 'Keio University', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Tokyo', 'Pyongyang', 'japanese', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Nishino', 'Japanese', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'Nishino', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Nishino', 'Song Sang - ho']",14,"[ 5.          0.          0.         ... -0.64602834  0.44709986

It turns out, he had a problem with American Airlines’ paperwork for his pooch, a basset hound named Grigsby, and he thus detoured to Los Angeles to fly instead with Korean Air to Incheon.

It turns out, he had a problem with American Airlines’ paperwork for his pooch, a basset hound named Grigsby, and he thus detoured to Los Angeles to fly instead with Korean Air to Incheon. The details on what happened remain unclear. While the episode may not have been pleasant for the U.S. flag carrier, it highlighted the Texas-headquartered airline’s stringent rules on pet policy, relative to the Korean airline, which somehow made Grigsby’s trip possible. The ambassador specifically thanked Korean Air upon arrival, and the airline later reportedly explained the dog flew in the cargo bay and that it had no quarantine issues.Increasingly, the culture of catering to the needs of dogs, or more specifically their owners, is budding in Korea. But such a change is not yet universal or supported by regulations and infrastructure necessary to foster a healthy pet-keeping culture. U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert holds his dog Grigsby at an outdoor event at his residence in Seoul on April 22. (Yonhap)Dog owners still often struggle to use public transport, dine in restaurants and take walks in recreational forests with their four-legged companions ― even with a leash. Even in condominiums and apartments that allow pets, many owners get into arguments with their neighbors, who are irked by the animals’ barking, excrement or odor. Yoon So-ra, a 30-year-old company employee in Songdo, Incheon, said she had lived in a pet-friendly apartment until last year with her 3-month-old Shiba Inu. One day while she was checking her mailbox, he dribbled a little bit of urine on the lobby’s floor, which triggered the rage of a janitor. “I was going to clean it up of course and had paper towels and everything. But then a freaked out janitor rushed to me out of nowhere, yelling that I could not live with him here and dogs are stinky and dirty,” she said. “I felt like I was being robbed of my right and raised issue with the chief of the resident association later on, but nothing changed. That was one of the reasons I moved out after the contract expired.” Yoon stressed that the central and local governments should step up efforts to devise detailed instructions on taking pets to public places, which is not covered in the otherwise expansive Animal Protection Act. The bulletin boards run by Seoul City, Seoul Metropolitan Facilities Management Corp. and Seoul City Council are brimming with calls from pet owners to amend a city ordinance to let them use the paths by Cheonggyecheon, a stream flowing through downtown Seoul, with their dogs. Legislation steps and public education should also take place to address complaints about irresponsible dog owners, some also suggest.In New York, where dog walkers are ubiquitous, had to deal with more than 18,000 tons of animal feces left on the streets every year until it enacted a statute in 1978 requiring owners to pick it up themselves. Now the city lists animals that are illegal to own and issues a license to pet owners, while giving instructions on dog management and banning animal fighting and abuse. American Airlines’ website also details travel restrictions by breed and destination, kennel guidelines, certificates required for the dog or cat’s health and their food and water. The Korean government, for its part, has been striving to improve its policy. Having started from mid-2014, all pet owners must register their animals with local governments or face a fine of up to 400,000 won ($360). Yet its efforts have apparently borne little fruit. Around the country, registration rates are poor and in many regions no fines have been collected and more dogs were found abandoned. To prevent social tension and foster responsible pet culture, efforts should be made to raise public awareness and mutual understanding between owners and others through administrative steps, experts say.In one reply on the website of the SMFMC, an official in charge of Cheonggyecheon management said that no progress has been made regarding any legislative revision, citing persistent opposition from other citizens. “It is a matter that entails a long-term review and improvement in social consciousness,” he said.

Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in late November.  The conference is meant to produce a legally binding deal on climate. Scientists have said heat-trapping gases are to blame for global warming.  Park told Obama that she will make the utmost efforts, noting internal discussions are under way to finalize South Korea's long-term commitments to climate change.  Options being considered in South Korea range from the minimum 14.7 percent to the maximum 31.3 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the country's business-as-usual level by 2030.

The city, instead, will dispatch police and supervisors for applicants placed on watch for MERS infection to take their test at home.The Seoul Human Resource Development Center said that the examination to select public officials for the city will proceed as planned since its postponement could cause confusion and aggravate groundless panic.Applicants who are isolated at their homes ― to be monitored for possible MERS infection ― will be allowed to take the test indoors, each under the watch of two test supervisors, a nurse and a police officer, president of SHRDC Ahn Joon-ho said in a press briefing. The center is in charge of selecting and educating the city’s public officials.“We will be making sure that there are no doubts about fairness by ensuring that the exam is conducted in the same manner as it would at the actual venue,” Ahn said.The city has been checking the list of all 130,033 applicants, and identified single-digit numbers of MERS suspects, city officials said.Seoul City, under the vanguard of Mayor Park Won-soon, has been going all-out to take preventive measures against the outbreak. He had slammed the central government for downplaying the virus and vowed to take all due measures saying that “being overprotective is better than being belated when it comes to safety of the citizens.”Critics have condemned Park for fanning public fear of MERS but later being inconsistent by deciding to push ahead with the exam that would involve large crowds gathering in an enclosed space.Seoul City has so far canceled most of its large-scale cultural and sports events and is currently operating a 24-hour transportation service for MERS suspects while expanding the workforce at call centers.“Mayor Park who has openly favored ‘overprotective measures’ has presented a sloppy plan for the examination. … What about those with symptoms still coming to take the test using public transportation?” said ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Ha Tae-keung on his Facebook account earlier this week.The city said it will receive requests to take the exam at home by Friday. Such applicants will be required to submit a notification of MERS watch certified by the respective public health centers.On the day of the exam, the city will open just one entrance and minimize the flow of traffic. All participants will be required to sanitize their hands and get their fever checked.

(Yonhap) The White House responded that Obama is willing to host the summit with her and will try to cooperate with South Korea to stop MERS.“President Obama looks forward to welcoming President Park to the White House at a mutually convenient time in the future to discuss the U.S.-Korea alliance and the critical role it plays in assuring regional stability and security,” said White House National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey, according to the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.“As just one example of this partnership, the United States is working closely with our Korean partners to support their response to the MERS cases in South Korea,” he said.Her trip was seen as crucial in seeking to reaffirm the alliance with the U.S. as inter-Korean tension remains high. The Seoul government has also received increasing calls to bolster its diplomatic stance in light of the tightening alliance between the U.S. and Japan.The president, however, was facing growing calls to delay her trip as the country struggled to contain the disease that has killed nine so far. As of Wednesday afternoon, 108 patients are confirmed of MERS while 3,439 are being monitored. Authorities have shown confidence in containing the disease, saying that all of the confirmed cases were hospital-related. But speculations have been spiking on the possibility of the virus being transmitted to the general community following a number of cases where patients were moved around before being confirmed of having the disease.Education offices have canceled classes at schools, kindergartens and day care centers in some parts of the country in the face of parents’ demands to ensure their children’s safety. Calls have also been mounting for the president to take a leading role in the government’s all-out efforts to combat the disease. On Monday, the president delegated special authorities to a task force of civilian experts and Health Ministry officials to control overall quarantine measures. A separate pangovernmental organization was also launched to provide necessary administrative support to handle the crisis.Observers said Park may have delayed the trip as it remains uncertain if South Korea will be able to stop MERS from spreading to the general public. The pending confirmation of her prime minister-designate may have also played a part in delaying the U.S. trip, they added. Premier-designate Hwang Kyo-ahn completed his three-day confirmation hearing Wednesday as the opposition remained opposed to the prosecutor-turned-justice minister, citing alleged ethical lapses and political bias.The president is also under growing pressure with her performance ratings dropping rapidly in recent surveys.According to Realmeter, her approval rating sank 4.4 percentage points to 40.3 percent last week. More than 50 percent of respondents said they would want her to delay the trip to the U.S. while 39 percent said that the president should go as planned, according to the pollster.

In cases of emergencies, people should go to hospitals with separate emergency treatment facilities, they said.South Korea’s MERS toll as of Wednesday morning reached nine deaths and 108 confirmed cases.With regard to prevalent criticism towards poor communication and information sharing among government bodies and municipalities, Choi said that they would work to minimize such confusion.“As MERS infection is occurring simultaneously and at a large scale, there tends to be confusion,” he said.He added that they will abide by the principle of releasing all countermeasures information in real time through the headquarters set up at the Health Ministry.To a question of whether he expected the MERS spread to abate this week, Choi said that “proper management” of the situation would be key, noting that the incubation period of those connected to the 14th patient infected at Samsung Medical Center ends this week.“The government is putting maximum capacity with a sense of urgency that if the MERS situation is not controlled this week, things will get much more difficult,” he added.Meanwhile, ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung echoed the government’s call for cooperation saying, “At this rate, it would be safe to say that (the MERS situation) will begin to settle down.”Adding that the people should trust the scientific views and world-class skills of Korean medical professionals, Kim said, “There are a very few cases of NIMBY (‘not in my backyard’) syndrome where they stigmatize (MERS) patients or oppose thedesignation of their nearby hospitals to accommodate them. That should never be the case when the country is in hardship.”From news reports (khnews@heraldcorp.com)","patient infected at samsung medical ,hospital the government also advised ,hwan on wednesday pleaded for ,treatment visit nearby hospitals instead ,14th patient infected at samsung","['Choi Kyung - hwan', 'the Health and Welfare Ministry', 'South Korea ’s', 'Choi', 'the Health Ministry', 'Choi', 'Samsung Medical Center', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'korean', 'Kim']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.04949863 0.64978075 0.29442391]

Park on Tuesday met Rep. Moon Jae-in, the leader of main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, and vowed to consolidate efforts to address the outbreak that left seven people dead, close to 100 infected and 2,892 under quarantine as of Tuesday afternoon.The meeting came as part of the mayor’s efforts to take the lead in combating MERS. He has taken independent steps to prevent the disease and criticized the government’s mishandling, a move widely applauded by the public. Park Won-soon (Yonhap)His move could help prove his leadership and demonstrate his capacity for the next presidency, observers said. “It is hard to deny that he would emerge as a strong presidential hopeful,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University. “The Seoul mayor is often considered to be on the road to the presidency. After all, the government changed its stance due to his remarks. He made a necessary call while the whole nation, even the government, was plunging into panic amid the MERS crisis,” Yoon said. Park held a press conference on June 4 to criticize the government for withholding information on MERS. He accused the Ministry of Health and Welfare of letting a confirmed MERS patient go to a public gathering where 1,565 residents attended, putting the public in danger of contracting the disease. President Park Geun-hye blasted the mayor’s decision, claiming it further confused the public amid the outbreak. She urged the local municipalities, including Seoul, to communicate with the central government during the crisis. But the mayor fired back, saying that the municipalities’ “overreaction” was better than the government’s “belated response.” He asserted that there is no place for debate in the face of the people’s call for public safety. Experts said the mayor’s decision has weight as he was exercising his right as mayor. “As an elected mayor, he is entitled to take matters into his own hands to ensure public safety,” said Kim Wook, a political professor at Baejae University.Other experts gave him credit for successfully positioning himself against the incumbent administration, but added that would not be enough. “Contrary to the president, the mayor’s response was decisive and swift,” said Choi Jin, the chairman of the Institute of Presidential Leadership.“(The mayor) could score quick political points through this kind of move. But he should continue on by showing the public his own policy. Simply going against the president will not help him in the long run,” said Choi.

It was the first time that a senior U.S. official has publicly mentioned the role of Seoul with regard to long-festering maritime disputes in the South China Sea.  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel. (Yonhap)“The role for the Republic of Korea is the role of a major stakeholder in the international order. It’s the role of a country of laws. It’s the role of a trading nation. It’s a role of a country that has flourished under the international system,” Russel said during a forum cosponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Korea Foundation. “The fact that, like the United States, the Republic of Korea is not a claimant, in my view, gives Seoul all the more reason to speak out because it is speaking not in self-interest, but speaking in support of universal principles and the rule of law.”Russel’s demand came as China has been turning numerous rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands into artificial islands to construct military bases equipped with naval harbors, airstrips, radar facilities and other equipment.Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have engaged in intense territorial claims with China, while Beijing has delineated its claim to the vast majority of the South China Sea with “the nine-dashed-line” ― a maritime demarcation line that takes in more than 80 percent of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer sea.Regarding Russel’s remarks, Seoul officials said they believed the senior U.S. official was mentioning the “universal principle,” which Seoul sticks to as a law-abiding member of the international community, denying that it was pressuring Seoul to take a stand against China.Washington’s apparent moves to pressure Seoul to take up a role in addressing China’s maritime assertiveness pose a daunting diplomatic challenge, as Seoul hopes to maintain a close strategic partnership with Beijing ― its core partner for trade, tourism and efforts to denuclearize North Korea.China has recently revealed its “active defense” strategy, which shifted its naval operations focus from “offshore waters defense” to “open seas protection” and stressed a longer-range projection of military might, heightening tensions between the two major powers. Observers say China’s hardened military posture could make it even tougher for Seoul to make diplomatic and defense-related decisions such as allowing the U.S. to deploy its strategic missile defense asset ― the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system ― to the peninsula.The U.S. concerns over the artificial islands stem from the possibility that Beijing’s maritime ambitions may hurt Washington’s efforts to safeguard what it calls “global commons,” namely freedom of navigation in the world’s most crucial transport route for energy and trade.The concerns have led the U.S. to come up with the military concept of “Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons,” and pushed it to concentrate its state-of-the-art military assets including the stealthy Zumwalt destroyers and Littoral Combat Ships in the western Pacific areas.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","on wednesday prodded south korea ,daunting diplomatic challenge as seoul ,wednesday prodded south korea ,wednesday prodded south korea to ,china sea complicating seoul strategic","['U.S.', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'sino - U.S.', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Pacific Affairs', 'Daniel Russel', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing ’s', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Pacific Affairs', 'Daniel Russel', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Russel', 'the Center for Strategic and International Studies', 'the Korea Foundation', 'the United States', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Taiwan', 'Brunei', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Zumwalt', 'Littoral Combat Ships', 'Song Sang - ho']",19,"[ 7.          0.          3.         ... -0.7341128   0.51906747

These locations were used in the shooting of “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” which drew more than 10 million viewers earlier this year.The Avengers tour program will also include visits to neighboring attractions such as the Korean Film Museum and the Mullae artists’ community to offer a more complete tour course, the city said. Seoul City has seen a rise of visitors after the film was released. The number of daily visitors to the Floating Island, the manmade island that appeared as geneticist Helen Cho’s laboratory in the film, doubled to about 7,000 last month, compared to March, it said. Having projected that the nation’s brand value would jump by 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) by participating in the film, the Korean government provided various assistance for filmmaking, including 4 billion won of financial support and public traffic restrictions. The authorities had also expected that the film would draw more than 600,000 overseas tourists. Some people, however, have raised doubts over the film’s influence on tourism, saying that the promotional impact has been exaggerated. “I think the new tour program will only waste money. The Korean background of the movie barely offered meaningful scenes in the film, as it was just quickly passed by, without giving a significant vibe,” said film critic Kim Yu-jung at Gangnam University. The new tour route will be available from Friday, the city said.

All people who are believed to have come in close contact with the first patient have been placed in isolation at their own homes following the diagnosis of the first patient last Wednesday.The health minister noted the measures taken so far complied with all guidelines provided in the government manual.Still, he said, ""the government will not be bound by the existing manual from now on and actively take preemptive measures under the assumption of the worst case possible.""""It will set up a 24-hour monitoring system, and immediately test and quarantine anyone who shows any sign of abnormality after coming in contact with a patient,"" he added.Meanwhile, the CDC said a new suspected case of MERS was reported Wednesday from a 25-year-old female, who began to show minor symptoms of the flu after returning to the country on Saturday following a 4-month stay in the Middle East.MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans, with only 1,142 reported cases in 23 countries since the first case was confirmed in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

The move allows the two sides to buy time for talks on the more sensitive issue of Pyongyang's unilateral wage hike.The Seoul government urged Pyongyang to accept its offer for the joint committee on the industrial park to meet and discuss the wage hike and how to improve the system that governs the complex.""South Korea is ready to have talks with North Korea if the North comes to the negotiation table,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, the ministry spokesman, said at a press briefing.In August 2013, the two Koreas decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park following the North's unilateral move in April of that year that shut down the park for about four months.The committee is an integral part of a deal that called for reopening the complex and adopting safeguards to prevent any work stoppages in the future. The committee has not met since June last year due to the North's refusal.The two Koreas have been embroiled in the wage dispute as North Korea unilaterally decided in February to hike the wage by 5.18 percent to US$74 per month. Seoul has rejected the North's move.Friday's deal will allow 124 South Korean firms to pay the wage based on the $70.35 per month that was originally set, according to government officials.

Critics say hearings frequently end up humiliating the nominee mainly over his or her past records or ethical lapses, and do not focus on the skills required for the job.Also Tuesday, she again asked the parliament to pass a bill meant to overhaul civil service pensions in a way that would require public officials to pay more while in service and receive less after retirement.The public employee pension reform is a key agenda of the Park administration, along with reform in the country's rigid labor market.""The structural reform of the labor market is something that can be neither delayed nor abandoned,"" Park said, noting it could help create jobs for young people.Young South Koreans are struggling to find jobs as some companies shun recruitment and instead rely on non-regular workers that they can fire more easily.The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 fell to 10.2 percent in April from 10.7 percent a month earlier.Data, however, showed April's tally is the highest reported for the month since March of 1999, according to government data.She also called on the public sector to introduce a wage peak system in order to encourage the private sector to embrace the job-sharing measure.The system is designed to provide job security for older employees through a gradual wage cut after a certain age. The money saved can be used to hire more young people.

""I thought that my administration had the legitimacy to help safeguard and reform the nation's economy, and so we came up with several measures and passed those bills,"" he said. In a move to reduce unemployment and help boost Germany's economic growth during his tenure, Schroeder unveiled a series of reform measures between 2003 and 2005 called the Agenda 2010.Dubbed the Hartz plan, the measures called for a cut in unemployment benefits to entice people to get back into the workforce as well as increase labor flexibility by allowing for more part time jobs, among others. South Korea is now faced with a similar problem as negotiations for a more flexible labor market have been stalled with unionized workers resisting the government's push to give corporatemanagement more leeway in laying off workers as part of efforts to improve its stagnant economy. Although the policies may face opposition and criticism, the ex-chancellor said the government should accept the risks ""for the sake of the nation's overall benefit.""""Without any risk-taking and courage to carry out one's convictions for the beneficial measures, any kind of reform efforts will make no progress,"" Schroeder said. In regards to South Korea's youth unemployment rate, which reached an over 12-year high last month, Schroeder said the country should work to narrow the income gap between large conglomerates and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). ""Personally, I think the problem in South Korea is that the difference between getting a job at a global firm and an SME is too big,"" Schroeder said.""When youths graduate from university here, everyone looks for a job at a multinational firm because of the large income gap between those companies and smaller ones,"" he added.

The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy appeared more ambivalent.Against the backdrop of divisive views, Seoul has so far stuck to its neutral stance on THAAD, despite recent U.S. officials’ increasing comments backing the system in Korea. South Korean presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook said Wednesday that Seoul would form an “independent decision” from Washington.“If we need (THAAD) then we should bring the weapons here,” Saenuri Rep. Choung Byoung-gug, member of the parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said on a morning radio show in Seoul. “Waiting for the North to make the first move is a losing policy,” he added.Saenuri Rep. Shim Yoon-joe, also a foreign affairs committee member and ex-senior diplomat, told The Korea Herald that the South should support THAAD if the U.S. brought the weapons here to protect U.S. citizens in Korea.“If the U.S. decides it needs THAAD to protect its people in Korea, we should support their plans, as part of the spirit of the South Korea-U.S. alliance,” he said.But the Saenuri Party does not have a set-in-stone official stance, party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo told The Korea Herald.Main opposition lawmakers repeated their doubts over the weapons, saying THAAD would be ineffective due to South Korea’s proximity to the North.“THAAD is not applicable to Korea’s war terrain,” NPAD Rep. Ahn Gyu-baek, a member of parliament’s National Defense Committee, told The Korea Herald. “The weapons shoot down incoming missiles in high altitudes. We need something that will shoot down missiles at lower heights (as missiles fired from the North would not have to fly high to reach the South).”NPAD Rep. Baek Kun-ki, a former four-star Army general, suggested the cost-benefit analysis did not support deploying THAAD to Seoul, in a phone interview with The Korea Herald.“The cost-benefit calculations don’t show for it,” he said. “If we use billions to buy THAAD, we wouldn’t have money to improve our own missile defense system,” the former general said, referring to the Korean Air and Missile Defense, an indigenous ballistic missile defense plan.Baek based his assertion on the premise that the South would have to fund a major portion of the cost of deploying THAAD to Korea.But NPAD lawmakers said they were not against THAAD if it was used to protect U.S. citizens and servicemen in South Korea.United States Forces Korea maintains a 28,500-man garrison in the South. Thousands of families of the servicemen and women also reside here.“If the U.S. brings them to protect their own, I don’t think we have reasons to oppose such plans,” Baek said. However, Ahn told The Korea Herald he would support a THAAD deployment if the U.S. shouldered most of the cost.Ahn suspected that recent statements by high-level Washington officials such as those by Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday supporting THAAD in Korea was part of a U.S. public opinion campaign.“I think that the recent push by U.S. officials for THAAD (in Korea) is a public opinion campaign aiming to create favorable public opinion, and compel the (Seoul government) to pay a large part of the bill.”Shim of the Saenuri Party disagreed.“I don’t think those comments were meant to pressure us,” he said. “The U.S. has not formulated any official opinion of its own on THAAD deployment to Korea. I think those comments are part of the debate within the U.S.,” Shim said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","thursday complicating seoul domestic debate ,korea herald main opposition lawmakers ,seoul domestic debate the conservative ,south korean presidential spokesman ,south korean presidential spokesman min","['South Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Pyongyang', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Saenuri', 'Choung Byoung', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Shim Yoon - joe', 'the Korea Herald', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kim Young - woo', 'the Korea Herald', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Ahn Gyu - baek', 'National Defense Committee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Baek Kun - ki', 'Army', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Korean Air', 'Missile Defense', 'Korea', 'NPAD', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'United States Forces Korea', 'U.S.', 'Baek', 'Ahn', 'the Korea Herald', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'THAAD', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Saenuri Party', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Jeong Hunny']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35777262  0.74137473

It also showed Seoul’s dilemma over the contentious deployment that is hotly debated domestically, although the allies have yet to begin any official consultations over it.“(South Korea) will make its own, independent judgment and decision based on its comprehensive consideration of (THAAD’s) military efficacy and national security interests,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Min Kyung-wook told reporters.“We understand that an internal consultation process is still ongoing in the U.S., and the results are yet to come out.”Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Curtis mentioned the need for THAAD, reigniting the controversy over its deployment, which China and Russia believe could target them and undermine their security interests.The controversy further escalated as another senior U.S. official said Tuesday that Washington is considering “permanently stationing” a THAAD battery in Korea, although no internal decision has been made yet.“Although we’re considering the permanent stationing of a THAAD unit on the Korean Peninsula, we have not made a final decision and we’ve had no formal consultations with the Republic of Korea on a potential THAAD deployment,” Frank Rose, assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance, said at a security seminar in Washington D.C.“However, let me be clear on a couple of points. THAAD is a purely defensive system that would improve our ability to intercept short- and medium-range missiles from North Korea. It does not and cannot impact broader strategic stability with Russia or China.”Touching on China’s dogged opposition to the THAAD deployment to Korea, Rose said China appears to be using the THAAD issue to disrupt Washington’s regional alliance system.“I think part of what China is trying to do is create a wedge in the U.S. alliance system in the region,” he said.U.S. officials’ mention of THAAD came amid growing public angst here over North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats including those from its submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Pyongyang recently claimed it succeeded in conducting an underwater test of the SLBM.As Rose noted, some experts have raised the possibility that the THAAD issue could undercut the South Korea-U.S. alliance with Seoul showing reluctance over the dispatch and seeking to strengthen its partnership with China, its largest trading partner.Some observers say that the THAAD issue is expected to be included in the agenda for the summit between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and U.S. President Barack Obama in the U.S. next month. Cheong Wa Dae refused to comment on the agenda.Seoul has so far maintained the so-called “3-noes,” arguing that there have been no consultations between the allies, no request from the U.S. for any official talks and no decision reached. But with Washington officials apparently raising pressure on Seoul to positively consider the deployment, the 3-noes policy can no longer be maintained, observers said.The THAAD is a core element of the U.S.’ multilayered missile defense program. It is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the terminal phase of flight after detecting the missiles with land-based radar that has a maximum range of about 1,800 km.A THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors (eight per launcher), a fire control and communications unit and an AN/TPY-2 radar.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","summit between south korean president ,korea evolving nuclear threats ,korea on potential thaad deployment ,north korea evolving nuclear threats ,also showed seoul dilemma over","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Min Kyung - wook', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Curtis', 'China', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Korea', '’ve', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Frank Rose', 'Washington D.C.“However', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'China', 'China', 'Korea', 'Rose', 'China', 'thaad', 'Washington', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'thaad', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'China', 'thaad', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'U.S.', 'Dae', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Song Sang - ho']",6,"[ 6.          0.          0.         ... -0.37170759  0.86511302

No explanation was given for this last-minute change,"" Ban said during a speech at the Seoul Digital Forum. ""This decision by Pyongyang is deeply regrettable.""  U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visits the National Assembly in Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)Ban, who announced his planned visit during the World Education Forum on Tuesday, would have been the first U.N. chief to visit the complex since its launch in 2004.   He would also have been the first U.N. chief to visit North Korea in more than 20 years.  In announcing the visit Tuesday, Ban said he hoped to help promote reconciliation between the two Koreas.  ""However, I, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, will not spare any efforts to encourage the DPRK to work with the international community for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and beyond,"" he said. The DPRK is the acronym for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  In a separate meeting with South Korean parliamentary leaders, Ban also said he will make efforts to ease tension on the divided peninsula. National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa called North Korea's decision a ""discourtesy"" to the U.N. and urged North Korea to invite Ban to Pyongyang as a sign of an apology.  Many expected his trip to help resolve stand-offs between the two Koreas, including the wage row at the complex, where about 53,000 North Korean workers are employed there by 124 South Korean firms.  The joint factory park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation following a landmark inter-Korean summit in 2000. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North and is where South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.  The Ministry of Unification expressed regret on Wednesday over North Korea's abrupt decision and called on Pyongyang to make efforts to improve inter-Korean relations.  ""It is regrettable that North Korea rescinded its approval of Ban's visit to the complex, which had been pursued to bring peace and security to the peninsula and to help improve the inter-Korean ties,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, ministry spokesman, told a press briefing.  Lim said that Seoul is urging Pyongyang not to further walk on a path to international isolation and to make efforts to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula.  North Korea's move is widely expected to dampen hopes that Ban's visit may serve as a catalyst for the improvement in the frayed inter-Korean relations.  North Korea has continued to make provocations in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions banning the North from conducting nuclear tests and missile launches. The North recently claimed that it successfully test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.  The North's alleged brutal execution of its defense chief Hyon Yong-chol has also added to concerns about a reign of terror in the communist regime and the North's leader Kim Jong-un's erratic behavior.  It was not the first time that Pyongyang made a last-minute cancellation of trips by high-profile figures to the North, including a 2014 scuttled visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights.  Experts said that the North's move seemed to reflect the bellicose country's intention not to have dialogue with Seoul. The North also might show its complaint against the South over what it believed were annoying comments on the North's rule.  President Park Geun-hye said last week that the North's reign of terror has stoked security concerns in the region.  ""North Korea might think that it may be better for it to raise tension on the peninsula for its response to the global community's pressure against the North and to tighten its grip on internal politics,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies under Seoul National University.

Leaders of the main political parties ― Kim Moo-sung of the ruling Saenuri Party and Moon Jae-in of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy ― attended the memorial ceremony marking the May 18 Democratic Uprising in Gwangju and sang the song with the choir. However, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, who attended the government-sponsored event as acting prime minister, and Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs Park Sung-choon refused to sing along, highlighting the long-standing political division over the 1980 democratic movement. “March for Our Beloved,” has been subject to heavy political debate as the conservatives criticize it for being pro-North, while the progressives insist it is a symbol of the nation’s democratic movement. Composed by student Kim Jong-ryul and written by novelist Hwang Sok-yong, the song was dedicated to a spiritual marriage of young protestors killed by soldiers, two years after the 1980 massacre. New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Moon Jae-in (from right), Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung and National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa sing the song “March for Our Beloved” at a memorial ceremony for the May 18 Democratic Uprising in Gwangju, Monday. (Yonhap)On May 18, 1980, Gwangju citizens, led by students, rose up against then-military junta leader Chun Doo-hwan, who took power after former President Park Chung-hee was assassinated. More than 200 people died in the brutal crackdown by the military regime. While the uprising has been widely hailed as a stepping-stone for democracy in Korea, the Chun administration and right-wing politicians labeled it a rebellion triggered by communist sympathizers.For more than a decade, participants at the annual memorial service sang “March for Our Beloved” together since the liberal Kim Dae-joong administration designated May 18 as a national memorial day in 1997 and the song as an official commemorative theme.But when the conservative former president Lee Myung-bak took power in 2008, he declared that the song should be sung only by a choir, refusing to recognize it as an official song for the 1980 democratic movement. The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, the host of the memorial service, confirmed last week that the song would officially be sung only by a choir at this year’s event.Taking issue that it was used as background music for 1991 North Korean film “Symphonic Poem for the Beloved,” the ministry insisted that the mass sing-along could undermine “national unity” as it might reignite dispute over the meaning of “beloved” and “new day” in the lyrics. Some right-wing activists go as far as to claim that “beloved” refers to late-North Korea leader Kim Il-sung.The move, however, faced strong resistance from local politicians and civic organizations based in Gwangju, who denounced the ministry’s decision as “a step against the May 18 spirit for democracy.”Enraged by the government’s decision, the council of May 18 bereaved families and local organizations boycotted the memorial service and held a separate ceremony at the same time in front of the former South Jeolla Provincial Office in the southwestern city.Saenuri leader Kim, who sang the song at the memorial service, also lashed out at the government’s decision. “I sang this song 10 times a day while fighting for Korea’s democracy as a student,” he said. “I cannot find any pro-North content in the lyrics (as claimed by the government.)”Despite Kim’s efforts to appeal to Gwangju citizens, he was forced out of the pre-memorial event held on Sunday night following a protest by some of the attendees. They swore and threw water at him, which led him to leave the scene shortly after he arrived.Gwangju, the opposition party’s traditional home turf, also showed hostility to NPAD leader Moon. “You are not welcome here” and “The NPAD is no different from the Saenuri party,” some shouted at him, blasting the party’s continued factional strife.Meanwhile, Acting Prime Minister Choi, who did not sing the song, made a speech, calling for a fight against corruption. “The long-accumulated corruption and irregularities should be rooted out while a new culture of change and innovation should be created for all sections of our society,” Choi said.Regarding the May 18 democratic movement, he said that “Upholding the spirit of the May 18 movement, the country should leap to an advanced society by one more step.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","democratic uprising in gwangju monday ,sang the controversial song march ,annual memorial service sang march ,korean film symphonic poem for ,spiritual marriage of young protestors","['South Korea', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Patriots', 'Veterans', 'Park Sung - choon', 'pro - north', 'Kim Jong - ryul', 'Hwang Sok - yong', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Korea', 'Chun', 'Kim Dae - joong', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the Ministry of Patriots', 'Veterans Affairs', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Kim Il - sung', 'South Jeolla Provincial Office', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'NPAD', 'Moon', 'Saenuri', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.04940958  0.1387223

So, it's just two data points but they point in the same direction. At least, he's less secure than we often assume,"" he said during a discussion hosted by 38 North, a Johns Hopkins University program specializing in North Korea issues.Kim took over control of the North after his father and later leader, Kim Jong-il, died in late 2011. Since then, he has purged a series of senior officials, including his powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek, as he consolidated his grip on power.Jackson, who served as a strategy adviser and a senior country director for the Pentagon from 2009 to 2014, also expressed concern about North Korea's massive arsenal of missiles, saying South Korea's defense against the North's missile threats is not enough.""Current missile defense posture on the peninsula is not great.It's woefully outgunned relative to what North Korea has and can do. Over a thousand missiles of various shapes and sizes from short range cruise missiles to ICBM capability, even if it's rudimentary,"" he said.Some of the North's missiles are even said to be capable of carrying nuclear payloads, he said.""Whether that's true or not, eventually they could all be capable of that,"" he said.Jackson stressed that South Korea needs a ""deep penetrating radar coupled with layers of interceptors,"" which he said gives ""multiple tries, as many tries as possible at the same missile that's coming in."" Deploying the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude AreaDefense) system would be of great help, he said.The possibility of the U.S. deploying a THAAD battery to South Korea is one of the most sensitive defense and political issues in Seoul as China has expressed strong opposition to such a deployment, which it regards as a threat to its security.Jackson rejected Chinese concerns.""The biggest concern that I heard from China was that the radar associated with THAAD would be able to see inside China ... But it can't see inside the Chinese bedroom. What can the radar see? It can see emitters off of incoming missiles,"" he said.""So unless China is in the business of firing missiles at South Korea, the radar argument is a weak lead. It's spurious,"" he said.

The International Council on Monuments and Sites, or ICOMOS, has recommended the registration of 23 sites of “Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution,” built in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. They were credited with contributing to Japan’s rapid industrialization and adaption of western technologies to its needs, according to Tokyo’s Cultural Affairs Agency. Yet Tokyo’s campaign triggered stiff opposition from Seoul as it includes seven facilities where hundreds of thousands of Koreans were forced into slave labor under Japanese colonial rule.  Hashima undersea coal mine off Nagasaki, known as “Battleship Island,” one of the 23 sites of “Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution” Japan is pushing to have registered as World Heritage sites. (Yonhap)Among them are the Hashima undersea coal mine off Nagasaki, known as “Battleship Island.” The workers, mostly conscripted from Korea and China, had to work more than 12 hours a day, isolated from the outside world and facing frequent tunnel collapses, gas explosions, falling rocks and other harsh work conditions. Koreans were also mobilized to build warships, torpedoes and other military supplies in the Nagasaki shipyard run by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Many of them died, either in the U.S.’ atomic bombing in 1945 or while carrying out reconstruction work afterward. A formal decision is forecast to be made at a World Heritage Committee meeting in July in Bonn, Germany. With both countries being among the 21 members, they are expected to ramp up diplomatic efforts ― Japan to clinch the listing and Korea to fend it off. Yet Seoul will likely struggle to turn the mood around, given that few sites recommended by ICOMOS have so far been rejected in the final stages. Tokyo also opted to package the 23 sites spanning some 1,300 kilometers across eight prefectures in the form of a “serial nomination,” which could facilitate UNESCO’s assessment while watering down controversies concerning its wartime atrocities. “Despite our efforts to carry our position, ICOMOS appears to have made the recommendation only from the technical aspect in line with its customs,” Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “We’re making our utmost efforts to have our sensible concerns taken into account that it runs counter to the fundamental spirit of the World Heritage Convention to beautify the facilities as purely industrial ones and include them as World Heritage sites without acknowledging that forced labor took place there.” A successful entry of the seven facilities is expected to deepen the quandary of Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, who has recently come under fire for what critics call complacent responses to pressing diplomatic issues such as Japan’s accelerating revisionist push backed by Washington, a possible stationing of advanced U.S. missile assets on the peninsula, and Seoul’s belated joining of a China-led development bank project and a U.S.-led transcontinental trade pact. Some lawmakers called for his resignation at a parliamentary session on Monday. Yun responded he did not insist on maintaining the top diplomat job, but defended his actions. “Some may view that there is a problem with our foreign policy but basically the international community is criticizing Japan’s revisionist drive,” he said. “But as the Japanese government would not easily make concessions and given the nature of the matter, it is appropriate to work with the U.S., Germany, the European Union and other countries.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","final stages tokyo also opted ,industrial revolution japan is pushing ,the final stages tokyo also ,tokyo campaign triggered stiff ,japan to clinch the listing","['Japan', 'UNESCO', 'World Heritage', 'Seoul', 'the International Council on Monuments and Sites', 'ICOMOS', 'Japan ’s', 'Japan', 'Tokyo ’s Cultural Affairs Agency', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Hashima', 'Nagasaki', 'Japan ’s', 'Japan', 'World Heritage', 'yonhap)among', 'Hashima', 'Nagasaki', 'Korea', 'China', 'Koreans', 'Nagasaki', 'Mitsubishi Heavy Industries', 'U.S.', 'World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'ICOMOS', 'Tokyo', 'UNESCO', 'ICOMOS', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'the World Heritage Convention', 'World Heritage', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'U.S.', 'Germany', 'the European Union', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",14,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.60146129  0.37420326

Reform of the money-losing public servants' pension system is one of President Park Geun-hye's key campaign pledges.Drafted by a task force of government officials and experts, the bill calls for raising contribution rates from current 7 percent to 9 percent over the next five years while lowering the payment rates from current 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent over the next 20 years.Should it be approved by a bipartisan special parliamentary committee, the bill is expected to pass through the main floor session next week, according to officials from the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.""We have never agreed to the proposed plan to change the contribution rate to 1.7 percent and the payments to 9 percent and any other changes,"" the Korean Government Employees' Union said in a statement.

A second prison official confirmed the execution.Amnesty said Islamabad was gaining a reputation as one of the world's leading executioners.A moratorium on the death penalty had been in force since 2008, but after the school attack it was lifted for those convicted of terrorism offences. In March it was extended to cover all capital offences.The European Union, the United Nations and human rights campaigners have all urged Pakistan to reinstate the moratorium.Critics say the country's criminal justice system is marred by police torture, poor legal representation for victims and unfair trials.Amnesty estimates that Pakistan has more than 8,000 prisoners on death row, most of whom have exhausted the appeals process.""In reaching this shameful milestone of 100 executions in just over four months, the Pakistani authorities are showing total disregard for human life,"" said David Griffiths, the group's deputy Asia Pacific director, in a statement.""Our concerns are heightened by manifestly unfair trials in many cases that fall well below minimum standards set by international law. This conveyor belt of killing will do nothing to address the root causes of crime and terrorism, and must end immediately.""Campaigners have particularly highlighted the case of Shafqat Hussain, whose lawyers say he was a juvenile at the time of his murder trial. They say evidence obtained as a result of torture was used against him.Hussain is due to be hanged on May 6 after the government ordered an investigation to try to determine his true age.The probe, carried out by the Federal Investigation Agency, found Hussain was an adult at the time of his conviction, according to media reports, though its results have not been published officially.","100th execution since lifting moratorium ,taliban gunned down 154 people ,country bloodiest ever militant attack ,the taliban gunned down 154 ,shameful milestone of 100 executions","['ISLAMABAD', 'AFP', 'Pakistan', 'Amnesty International', 'Taliban', 'Munir Hussain', 'Vehari', 'Punjab province', 'Syed Babar Ali Shah', 'Vehari', 'Shah', 'Hussain', 'Amnesty', 'Islamabad', 'the European Union', 'the United Nations', 'Pakistan', 'amnesty', 'Pakistan', 'pakistani', 'David Griffiths', 'Asia Pacific', 'Shafqat Hussain', 'the Federal Investigation Agency', 'Hussain']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52655649  0.48919392

It is scheduled to end on Friday, according to the Combined Forces Command and Seoul's defense ministry officials. ""The tactical training has been carried out without a hitch,"" said a CFC official, noting that the exercise mobilized about 200,000 Korean and 3,700 American troops and has involved a set of land, sea and air maneuvers as originally planned. Five countries -- Australia, Canada, Denmark, France and Britain -- have participated in the drill, with the Neutral Supervisory Commission observing and monitoring them to ensure they do not break the Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.Drawing attention was the participation of the USS Fort Worth, a 3,450-ton Freedom-class littoral combat ship, in the drill for the first time. The combat ship, complete with surface warfare mission package capabilities, is capable of getting closer to shore than larger ships during diverse scenarios, which brings speed, maneuverability and shallow draft to this exercise, according to the U.S. navy.Foal Eagle is one of two major annual exercises between the allies, along with the computerized command post exercise, called Key Resolve. The two-week war game ended in mid-March.Expressing a strong opposition to the exercises and issuing threats of harsh retaliation, North Korea had fired rounds of rockets multiple times during the exercise period, with the latest in early April when Pyongyang test-fired four short-range projectiles believed to be the KN-02 ground-to-ship missiles into the West Sea.""The level of the North's provocations during the exercise period does not seem to be as intense as last year,"" an official of Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on condition of anonymity.""But we are closely monitoring their moves,"" he said, pointing to chances of live-fire drills or test-firing rockets to mark the foundation of the North's military that falls on Saturday.The North has repeated its long-held claims that the exercises are ""dress rehearsals"" for a northward invasion with nuclear weapons, while Seoul and Washington have stressed the exercises have been staged on a regular basis and they are defensive in nature.

The Ministry of Public Safety and Security recently confirmed that all safety countermeasures were properly taken at the facilities.The aquarium and theater at the 123-story building have been closed since December last year after a dozen safety problems prompted concerns. A water leak was found at the aquarium and cracks were spotted on the concrete floor and on a faulty movie screen. Numerous casualties were also reported including a worker who was found dead at the construction site of the skyscraper last year. Only the lower levels of the building have been open to the public since October, with the upper floors still under construction. The suspension was ordered after the city issued a final warning to Lotte Group over its “negligent countermeasures” in response to the series of accidents. Korea’s tallest skyscraper is scheduled to be fully opened by 2016. As part of a safety review process, Seoul City will carry out an on-site inspection with safety experts next week after a discussion Thursday, officials said. “(The city) will make a decision with a top priority on safety. It will conduct a thorough safety inspection over the concerned facilities,” the city said. “The reopening should not be hastily pushed just for business concerns.” Business owners at the tower have urged the city government to allow the reopening, citing damage to sales.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","of accidents korea tallest skyscraper ,reopen facilities at lotte controversial ,week after discussion thursday officials ,seoul city said wednesday ,faulty movie screen numerous casualties","['Seoul City', 'Lotte ’s', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Jamsil', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'Lotte Group', 'Korea ’s', 'Seoul City', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32155147  0.33368507

South Korean officials characterize pyroprocessing as ""recycling"" spent fuel, while it has yet to be commercialized.Pyroprocessing is said to have less chance of being converted into a program to produce nuclear weapons as it leaves separated plutonium mixed with other elements.The agreement will allow South Korean scientists to conduct research into the untested technology at existing local facilities.Besides, Seoul will be able to push for a low-enrichment program through consultations with Washington.The allies have decided to establish a high-level standing commission to consult on the sensitive issue, with the U.S. represented by its deputy secretary of energy and South Korea its vice foreign minister. ""It is meaningful that we have opened the pathway for uranium enrichment, albeit not in the foreseeable future,"" a senior ministry official told reporters on background.

Mike Honda (D-CA) said.Honda, who has long spoken out for the victims of sexual slavery, used the 20-minute speech to explain in detail the sufferings of the victims and how Japan's government has attempted to whitewash the crime and evade responsibility.As one surviving victim, Lee Yong-soo of South Korea, looked on from the audience, Honda explained how she, then 16 years old, was kidnapped in 1944 and forced to work as a sex slave in Taiwan while experiencing beatings, torture and disease.""There is nothing more important right now than for a democratic country like Japan to apologize for its past mistakes. A government is a living, breathing organism that is responsible for its past, present and its future,"" Honda said.He also urged Tokyo to learn from Germany.Historians estimate more than 200,000 women, mainly from Korea which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.Fewer than 100 victims are now alive and they are dying by the day, Honda said.""They deserve what has been due to them for the past 70 years.They deserve the justice that has been denied them,"" he said.The lawmaker also rejected claims that Japan has apologized enough.""To those people, I would say, given this continued revisionist attempts, for every step forward toward peace and reconciliation, the government of Japan takes two steps backwards,"" he said.""Enough is enough.

Seoul on Tuesday strongly condemned the ritual donations by Abe and a series of other cabinet ministers and top politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine to commemorate a spring festival. Since his visit to the shrine in December 2013, which enraged Korea and China and invited criticism from other countries, he has instead sent the “masakaki” tree for the event, which is held every April and October. The temple venerates some 2.5 million Japanese war dead including 14 “Class A” World War II criminals, such as Gen. Hideki Tojo, who orchestrated the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (AP-Yonhap)Late Monday, Abe signaled he will not reiterate previous official apologies for Japan’s sex slavery and other wartime wrongdoing in a highly anticipated statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War. In an interview with a local broadcaster, Abe said he did not see the need to reiterate past apologies, such as the one issued in August 1995 by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, since he has expressed his willingness to uphold the “basic thinking” behind them. “There is no need for a new statement if it were to be the same,” he told BS-Fuji television.While blasting the premier’s contribution, Seoul’s Foreign Ministry warned him against “missing his good chance of clearly declaring the Japanese government’s historical view to neighboring countries and the international community. “Japan’s political leaders must recognize that their display of respect and gratitude for such a shrine represents their denial of the premise on which Japan was able to return to the international community following the war, as well as of the post-war international order,” ministry spokesperson Noh Kwang-il said at a news briefing. Calls are increasing around the world for Abe to facilitate a thaw with neighbors by sincerely atoning for the country’s imperial past ahead of key addresses including an Asia-Africa summit Wednesday in Indonesia, where Korean Deputy Premier Hwang Woo-yea and Chinese President Xi Jinping will also take part. Abe is also due to speak at a joint session of U.S. Congress in Washington next week. Speculation is mounting that the forthcoming text will not contain an explicit apology and terms such as “aggression” and “colonial rule,” given Abe’s apparent attempts to dilute Japan’s history and his strong revisionist belief. “(Abe) has publicly expressed remorse for the war and said he will honor Japan’s past apologies for its aggression, including the sex slavery. Yet he has added vague qualifiers to his comments, creating suspicions that he doesn’t take the apologies seriously and will try to water them down,” the New York Times said in an op-ed Monday. “But Japan cannot credibly fill that broader role if it seeks to repudiate criticism of its past.”The Washington Post also pointed out that though the nationalist premier has publicly shown remorse over the war and said he will embrace the 1995 statement “in general” or “in its entirety,” he has refused to be drawn out on whether he will repeat the two keywords. “But making only a cursory reference to historical issues ― particularly the Japanese army’s use of Korean and Chinese women as sex slaves at ‘comfort stations’ ― will further inflame tensions in East Asia in this pivotal year,” the newspaper said.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","war shrine seoul on tuesday ,tuesday strongly condemned the ritual ,seoul on tuesday strongly condemned ,million japanese war dead ,shrine seoul on tuesday strongly","['Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Seoul', 'Abe', 'the Yasukuni Shrine', 'Korea', 'China', 'japanese', 'Hideki Tojo', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'AP - Yonhap)Late', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Tomiichi Murayama', 'bs - fuji', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Noh Kwang - il', 'Abe', 'Indonesia', 'korean', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Abe', 'U.S. Congress', 'Washington', 'Abe ’s', 'Japan', 'Abe', 'Japan', 'the New York Times', 'Japan', 'Washington Post', 'japanese', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.03571721 0.66406065 0.05231716]

South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki agreed on the need to pursue “future-oriented cooperation,” despite their historical and territorial feuds, during a trilateral meeting in Washington that included U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken.The unprecedented meeting touched on a wide range of regional and global issues, including North Korea’s evolving missile and nuclear threats, climate change, maritime security and global health security. It was hosted by Washington, which is seeking to promote trilateral cooperation between the three countries.  From right: South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki hold a joint press conference at the U.S. State Department on Thursday. (Yonhap)Cho hinted at the talks that Seoul would exert more flexibility in bilateral cooperation with Tokyo. But he reiterated that Seoul’s stern stance over historical issues would remain unchanged. Bilateral relations have worsened due to Japan’s failure to fully atone for its wartime atrocities.“My government’s policy on Korea-Japan relations is that on the one hand, we are maintaining a consistent, principled position and stance on the issues of history, and that will continue to be the case,” said Cho during a joint press conference.“On the other hand, we are promoting cooperation between Korea and Japan on other issues, including North Korean issues and other issues where cooperation is necessary and beneficial to both governments.”The three-way meeting came as Washington was seen seeking to defuse historical tensions between Seoul and Tokyo and encouraging the countries to enhance three-way cooperation to tackle North Korea’s nuclear threats and other challenges.The meeting was held prior to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to the U.S., where he will deliver a speech at a joint session at U.S. Congress later this month. South Korean President Park Geun-hye is expected to visit the U.S. possibly in June.Touching on the long-running historical enmity between America’s allies, Blinken said a shared perspective on the challenges facing South Korea and Japan “far outweighs” their historical differences.“When you look at everything we talked about today, when you look at the work that our countries are doing together bilaterally, trilaterally, and all of the different configurations, there is a common agenda, a common approach, common interests, and common values,” he said.“That’s what unites us and that’s what will continue to unite us going forward.”Regarding bilateral history issues, the Japanese vice minister argued that Japan acknowledges history “squarely” and the responsibility rests on both countries to improve bilateral relations.“Both sides are responsible for making the relationship better, and Japan, for its part, will continue to make efforts to improve the relationship with its Korean friends. And I’m hoping that our Korean friends are also going to do the same thing with us,” he said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","japan on thursday reaffirmed their ,cooperation to tackle north korea ,month south korean president park ,during trilateral meeting in washington ,seoul and tokyo and encouraging","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea ’s', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'japanese', 'Akitaka Saiki', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Tony Blinken', 'North Korea ’s', 'Washington', 'south korean', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Tony Blinken', 'japanese', 'Akitaka Saiki', 'the U.S. State Department', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Cho', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'North Korea ’s', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe ’s', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'America', 'Blinken', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'korean', 'Song Sang - ho']",8,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.40977609  1.24924684

We're simply encouraging our closest friends to have the strongest possible relationship because it matters to us. Our ability to tackle together the many challenges we talked about is enhanced when the relationship between us is as strong as possible,"" he said.  Cho said South Korea is taking a two-track approach to relations with Japan, maintaining a ""consistent and principled position"" on historical issues while trying to promote cooperation on other issues where cooperation is beneficial to both sides.  ""Although we have differences, I don't think that will be the end of our undertaking,"" he said. ""In spite of the differences, we find ways to cooperate on issues and areas where cooperation is good and beneficial to Korea, as well as to Japan. Diplomacy is about working, trying to find the way to work together while we have healthy differences on issues.""  Saiki said Japan squarely faces history and the onus for improving the ties is on both sides.  ""Both sides are responsible for making the relationship better, and Japan on its part will continue to make efforts to improve the relationship with our Korean friends, and I'm hoping that our Korean friends are also going to do the same thing,"" he said.  Frayed relations between the two allies have been a key cause for concern for the U.S. as it seeks to bolster three-way security cooperation as a key pillar for President Barack Obama's ""pivot to Asia,"" aimed in part at keeping a rising China in check.  Earlier this week, Blinken expressed optimism, saying Seoul-Tokyo relations now appear to be ""on a profoundly positive trajectory,"" citing a recent series of meetings between the two sides, including the resumption of a security dialogue that had been suspended for five years.  Indeed, South Korea and Japan have increased meetings in recent months, especially since the two countries and China held their first foreign ministers' talks in three years last month and agreed to work toward resuming a long-suspended trilateral summit.  Earlier this month, Seoul and Tokyo also held tourism ministers' talks for the first time in four years, and senior defense officials of the two countries also held annual trilateral cooperation talks with the U.S. in Washington on Thursday.  Despite the budding signs of rapprochement, the two sides have continued to spar over historical and territorial issues, with Tokyo renewing its claims to South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo in a foreign policy report and school textbooks, while Seoul lodged strong protests.  This shows that any improvement in their ties can easily be short-lived. Tensions could flare anew at any time and genuine reconciliation between South Korea and Japan will be difficult to achieve unless Tokyo fundamentally addresses the sexual slavery and other historical issues.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's upcoming trip to the U.S., including an address at a joint session of Congress, is seen as a key gauge of how the Seoul-Tokyo ties will go, amid widespread views that the relations are unlikely to get any better unless Abe offers a sincere apology for Japan's imperialistic past and wartime atrocities.

None of the 124 South Korean firms have paid March wages to the North Korean workers.In 2008, the North notified Seoul of its decision that Pyongyang is able to impose an arrears charge of 15 percent per month if South Korean companies do not pay wages at the proper time for North Korean workers at the industrial park.Seoul's unification ministry warned Wednesday that it cannot accept the North's possible bid to impose an arrears charge on South Korean firms.""Seoul does not think that Korean firms do not pay wages timely if they follow (the wage-setting) guidance for the industrial park,"" unification ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol said at a press briefing. ""We will not accept the North's possible move if it tries to collect the arrears charge.""Seoul has not accepted the North's unilateral move, saying that Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for two quasi-government committees from each side to set the wages together. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent.The talks have gained urgency as North Korea will take days off on Wednesday and Thursday to mark the April 15 birth anniversary of its late founder, Kim Il-sung.The industrial complex opened in the early 2000s, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.

Pentagon officials said Carter will reiterate the strong U.S. commitment to South Korea's security.  Carter's trip to South Korea has drawn keen attention because of the possibility of him raising the need for deploying the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile defense system to South Korea. But U.S. officials said they have decided not to bring up the issue this time.  South Korea has been badly divided over whether to accept a THAAD battery, with supporters saying the deployment would help better protect against North Korea's ballistic missile threats, and opponents claiming it would unnecessarily inflame tensions with China and Russia.   About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter North Korea.  In Japan, Carter plans to meet with senior Japanese officials to discuss the defense strategic guidelines review and a number of other matters of mutual interest ahead of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Washington at the end of April.  ""We will be working to complete a new set of Guidelines on Defense Cooperation -- the foundational document for our alliance  -- to allow us to take our cooperation to a whole new level and into new areas like space and cyberspace,"" Carter said at the McCain Institute speech.  South Korea and Japan are two of the strongest U.S. allies in Asia. Washington has sought to increase trilateral security cooperation with the two countries in part to keep China's growing influence in check, but such efforts have been stymied by historical tensions between Seoul and Tokyo.  Carter stressed the importance of such three-way cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, hailing the military information sharing agreement that the three countries signed in late December, saying the deal is the first of its kind.  Carter said the U.S. an other countries are ""deeply concerned"" about some Chinese activities.  ""Its opaque defense budget, its actions in cyberspace, and its behavior in places like the South and East China Seas raise a number of serious questions.

Families of those who died in the Sewol ferry accident start a march from Ansan, Gyeonggi Province on Saturday. YonhapMore than 200 people are participating in the march from Ansan city to the capital Seoul, mostly the parents of the 250 students from the same high school who perished when the overloaded ferry sank off the southern island of Jindo on April 16.   With the first anniversary of the tragedy drawing near, the 35 kilometer march is being held to call for the sunken ferry to be brought to the surface to recover those bodies still unaccounted for.   The marchers started off from a public park in Ansan where a giant altar to the victims, complete with their black-ribboned portraits and flowers, has been in place over the past year.   Some wept as they set off carrying pictures of their daughters and sons.Before the march started, many parents shaved their heads in a show of grief and determination.   They chanted slogans and held banners alleging that the government was ""insulting""  victims' families by ""waving money under their noses"" instead of seeking to ensure a thorough and independent investigation.   Over the past year, families have repeatedly staged street protests and sit-ins, demanding a meeting with President Park Geun-Hye and urging her to deliver on her promise to continue the search for those still missing.   ""Almost a year has passed since the tragedy but the president has not delivered on her promise. We are going to Seoul to hear from her,"" said Chun Myeong-Sun, a representative of the families.   The accident--blamed by many on regulatory failings, official incompetence and the ship's illegal redesign--prompted Park to vow a complete overhaul of national safety standards.   Following months of political bickering, the South Korean parliament passed a bill in November initiating an independent investigation into the sinking.   But relatives have accused the government of seeking to hamper the probe and contain any political fallout by appointing government officials to key posts in the 17-member inquiry committee.   Committee chairman Lee Suk-Tae--one of the members nominated by the families--said this week that the government, which should be the very subject of the investigation, was seeking to lead the committee, something he labelled ""unacceptable.""   More than 50 people have been put on trial on charges linked to the sinking, including 15 crew members--who were among the first to climb into lifeboats.   The Sewol's captain was jailed in November for 36 years for gross negligence and dereliction of duty, while three other senior crew members were sentenced to jail terms of between 15 and 30 years.   The families plan to hold a candle-lit vigil when the protest march arrives in Seoul on Sunday.

Laughter fills the room as the dads help the kids finish their masterpieces. Clutching the sand-filled bottle in one hand as a souvenir, and holding the father’s hand in the other, the children return home beaming.This simple activity class is a part of the district’s program designed to encourage bonding between fathers and children. It is a precious opportunity to “learn” how to become good parents. The curriculum of the weekly class ranges from dance and art to physical activities. A father and his daugther tear newspapers as part of Seoul City’s program for dads and children at City Hall in Seoul. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)“Fathers can learn how to play with their children at home and how to communicate with them. As long as the parents know the methods, they can contribute a lot to child care,” said program coordinator Park Hye-mi at Seocho-gu Office. Joo Dan-ha, a 33-year-old office worker who raises his 4-year-old daughter and six-month toddler, is one of the fathers in the class. He found out about the program through advertisements.“When playing with my kids, I try to apply what I have learned in class. I can see how I have changed after starting the class,” Joo said. To make classes more convenient for working fathers, district offices carry out the classes only on Saturdays. Seongbuk-gu Office in the northern capital runs ice-skating classes from last year. Guro-gu Office in southwestern Seoul launched a baseball team comprised of children and fathers in 2010. Besides independent programs by districts, the city government offers diverse programs teach child care in general.For an hour every Thursday, fathers take parenthood lectures while having lunch at Seoul Support Center for Childcare Center near City Hall. Fathers are only required to pre-register for the class and pay 5,000 won ($4.50) for the meal. The center’s chief, Lee Nam-jung, said learning how to become a good father was not something men should be embarrassed about, but a necessary and natural process. “Unfortunately, fathers in our generation have never seen their fathers sharing extra time for them, other than working hard. That’s why learning is more important for Korean fathers than any others,” said Lee. “We aren’t all naturally born to be parents. Fathers and mothers have to be made.”Fathers’ contribution to child care greatly affects their children’s self-esteem, according to child development and education professor Kim Jin-wook at Myongji University. “When kids share time with their fathers, they think they are becoming the entire world of their fathers. The more time they spend with each other, the more the children’s self-esteem tends to improve,” said Kim. Meanwhile, the government has come up with measures for working fathers as part of efforts to encourage them to participate in child care. Employers, who allow their employees to take a leave of absence are eligible for monthly subsidies of 100,000-200,000 won ($182), depending on the size of the company. Fathers who wish to temporarily work part-time to make room for child care, can receive 60 percent of their ordinary wages up to a year. Under the current law, each parent can take up to one year of parental leave for children aged 8 or younger. Employers who do not allow parental leave can be fined up to 5 million won.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","thursday fathers take parenthood lectures ,seoul city program for dads ,having lunch at seoul support ,fathers take parenthood lectures while ,parenthood lectures while having lunch","['Seoul', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan', 'Park Hye - mi', 'Seocho - gu Office', 'Joo Dan - ha', 'Joo', 'seongbuk - gu Office', 'Guro - gu Office', 'Seoul', 'Lee Nam - jung', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Kim Jin - wook', 'Myongji University', 'Kim', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23151401  0.54740947

Kim takes up the post at a time when tension between Seoul and Beijing is brewing over a possible deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system in South Korea.Kim, a 67-year-old former defense minister who headed the National Security Council at the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae until May last year, made the comments upon his arrival at the Beijing airport earlier in the day. The U.S. has said it is considering deploying the missile defense system, known as the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), in South Korea, home to about 28,500 American troops, to better cope with the growing threats of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities.Arguing that the U.S. missile defense system could also target China, Beijing has publicly pressed Seoul to refuse to allow the THAAD battery to be deployed. On March 17, South Korea's defense ministry blamed China for trying to ""influence"" Seoul's security policy.Asked about South Korea's direction of diplomacy between the U.S. and China, Kim replied, ""By frequently making contact with China and the U.S., we should make efforts not to undermine our issues."" ""In the middle of cooperation between the U.S. and China, we need to let our interests have a mutual synergy effect,"" Kim said, stopping short of mentioning sensitive issues between South Korea and China, including the U.S. missile defense system.Kim became South Korea's first top diplomat to China with a military background since the two nations established diplomatic ties 23 years ago.

The process, she added, begins with education.Using technology to create an environment for students from different countries to communicate and study together could contribute to achieving world peace, she claimed.“Our goal is to make an international virtual school system in which it is natural for students to study with their counterparts from other cultures,” she said. This was the objective when she designed International Virtual Elementary/Secondary Classroom Activities, an e-learning program that provides a virtual environment for youngsters across the globe ― from South Korea to the U.S., Bhutan and Mexico ― to share while studying and socializing.Students from Namyang Elementary School in South Chungcheong Province participate in an IVECA program with their counterparts from LAMB Public Charter School in Washington D.C. (IVECA)Over the course of a semester, the students would interact with each other via blog posts and Skype calls to explain various aspects of their culture to each other, such as books, games and food.The 42-year-old former elementary school teacher said the idea for her program came about when she realized that despite undergoing the entire education system, she knew very little about other cultures.“Korea’s education system fails to provide a chance for students to understand foreign cultures and communicate with foreigners. ... World policy is all regarded as simple study material, failing to garner students’ interest,” Jung said. This results in students being confined within their own culture. “They view foreigners as if they are aliens, as I once did,” she said.Jung Eun-hee. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)Due to their poor understanding of other cultures, Korean college students often have trouble working with foreign students. Some 41.3 percent of foreign students said they became a target of racial discrimination during their time here, according to a survey by University-Tomorrow Research Laboratory for the Twenties.“The traditional way of understanding other cultures ― discussing them with your classmates ― has limits in the sense that it involves people with similar backgrounds,” Jung said, explaining that direct contact with people from other cultures can expand the scope of understanding for students.Jung said a lack of understanding between cultures can plague those in other countries as well. She pointed to the “axis of evil” remark about North Korea made by former U.S. President George W. Bush, which failed to grasp the complicated nature of the country. “It appeared that he did not understand the multidimensional relationship between the two Koreas in a way that he just labeled it ‘friend or foe.’ I felt like even a U.S. leader could be making policies without full understanding of a foreign culture,” she said.Scholars like political scientist Samuel P. Huntington have foretold of clashes between civilizations, since the difference between civilizations are too basic to overcome in a short period of time. While such a task is not an easy one to accomplish, Jung said the first step can be taken through education. She said “intercultural competence,” the capacity to communicate effectively and appropriately with people of other cultures, is critical in the 21st century.“Accepting various viewpoints on a specific issue allows students to expand one’s scope of thinking. That way, students become more creative and can proactively seek the most effective way ― not being confined by one’s preconceptions,” she said. While true interaction across cultures had been restricted by distance and cost in the past, technological advances have paved a way for cross-cultural interaction and education, she said. But greater access could mean a greater risk of cultural conflicts, Jung pointed out, which is why education needs to provide a guideline on how to work better with people from other cultures.Jung also stressed that a greater use of technology in education is necessary. For example, educators should be aware of not getting hung up on the technology itself.In the past few years, the Korean government has stepped up efforts to adopt smart education by installing infrastructure and distributing gadgets at schools. But experts have raised criticism that the lecture-based teaching method itself remains largely unchanged and that many of the programs focus on just using educational software.“What is the purpose of education? It is to seek knowledge and to prepare for life,” she said. “When kids enter society, there will be far different technology than today. The important thing is not to teach existing technologies, but to prepare them for using new tools and gadgets to solve the problems of the future.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","through education she said intercultural ,she designed international virtual elementary ,survey by university tomorrow research ,beliefs also intensified jung eun ,make an international virtual school","['Jung Eun - hee', 'New York', 'International Virtual Elementary / secondary Classroom Activities', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Bhutan', 'Mexico', 'Namyang Elementary School', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'iveca', 'LAMB Public Charter School', 'Washington D.C.', 'Skype', 'Jung', 'Jung Eun - hee', 'Lee Sang - sub', 'Korea', 'korean', 'University - Tomorrow Research Laboratory', 'Twenties', 'Jung', 'Jung', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'George W.

Daniel Russel, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, stressed that the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system is aimed at warding off North Korea’s unabated missile threats against South Korea and the U.S., and reiterated that they have not yet made any decision on its deployment.“I find it curious that a third country would presume to make strong representations about a security system that has not been put in place and that is still a matter of theory,” he told reporters after talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Kyung-soo in Seoul. “(The allies) face a significant threat from North Korea’s ballistic missile program. … Our military authorities have a responsibility to consider systems that would protect the Republic of Korea and its citizens, protect the United States from that threat.” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel speaks to reporters after talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Kyung-soo in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)THAAD is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal stage. The U.S. Forces Korea last week confirmed that the military has conducted a site survey for its possible stationing around the country. But Seoul is struggling to balance its security and diplomatic priorities in the face of China’s stringent opposition to what it deems a U.S. effort to contain its rise by having a key regional ally on board its global missile defense scheme. As Washington spurs its move, Beijing on the pressure appears to also be piling up. On Monday, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao openly displayed discomfort, calling on Seoul to make an “appropriate decision” on THAAD taking his country’s “interests and concerns” into account. Further stoking the U.S.-China rivalry is Beijing’s initiative for the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. South Korea has reservations on China’s request for participation as a founding member due partly to Washington’s resistance to the $50 billion mechanism that may sway the U.S.-led regional financial order. With the end-March deadline nearing for a decision, Seoul’s calculations are becoming convoluted since the U.K. announced its joining as the first major Western power and even Australia hinted at reconsidering its initial skepticism last week. Russel reiterated Washington’s position regarding the AIIB ― that it perceives it to lack transparency in its principles and governance structure ― while tacitly urging Seoul to consider its viewpoint of similar values regarding the need for infrastructure growth.“(The U.S. and South Korea) each would like to see the expansion of economic and financial support for infrastructure in the Asia pacific region,” he said. “We would like to see that done in ways that are consistent with the principles, the standards, the good governance and the transparency that have become a hallmark of truly multilateral development banks.” Russel signaled that joining the envisioned bank could be premature before Beijing ensures “unmistakable evidence” and clear governance standards in line with other multilateral development institutions. He touched down in Seoul late Monday for a two-day trip designed to keep up the two countries’ policy coordination and reaffirm their commitment to the alliance in the aftermath of a knife attack on U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert here.During meetings with Lee and Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong, Russel expressed gratitude for Seoul’s response to the incident and the public support, and discussed future high-level exchanges and other bilateral, regional and global issues. “The sides concurred on the AIIB’s necessity in developing and expanding infrastructure in Asia and agreed to continue consultations,” a senior Foreign Ministry official told reporters after the talks, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “But THAAD was not discussed, nor was it on the agenda ― it is an issue that primarily requires our military and technical consideration. We’ll make a decision after looking comprehensively into our national interests.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday threw jab at beijing ,korea unabated missile threats against ,beijing over its opposition to ,washington on tuesday threw jab ,monday chinese assistant foreign minister","['Washington', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'Daniel Russel', 'U.S.', 'East asian', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Lee Kyung - soo', 'Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Republic of Korea', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'State', 'East Asian', 'Daniel Russel', 'Lee Kyung - soo', 'Seoul', 'the U.S. Forces Korea', 'Seoul', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Chinese', 'Liu Jianchao', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'U.K.', 'western', 'Australia', 'Russel', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'Lee', 'Cho Tae - yong', 'Russel', 'Seoul', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",6,"[ 2.          0.          4.         ... -0.25924376  0.56982481

As part of the plan, students will be able to make use of multiple tools and software, including calculators.Some experts say calculators will free students from simple calculation, granting them a chance to explore more creative answers.Jang Gyeong-yun, head of the Korea Society of Educational Studies in Mathematics, said using calculators can allow students to focus on understanding the principles of mathematics, rather than getting hung up on complicated calculations. “This can help students understand the usefulness of the subject,” said Jang, who headed the advisory committee on the ministry’s plan.Students gave mixed reactions to the idea.“I think the measure will help us save a lot of time doing ‘meaningless’ calculations. After we’ve already worked out the formula, doing simple multiplication and division is just time-consuming work,” said a 16-year-old high school student surnamed Choi.A 20-year-old student at a Seoul-based university said she found it very convenient to use calculators in class but added it had some unexpected side effects, making problem solving more difficult. “Since I am not used to using calculators, using one (in college) tends to slow down my thought process as I depend on the device for calculations.”Some students also expressed doubts whether the policy would be effective in helping students get more invested in math.“Students who give up math don’t necessarily do so because of the calculations. They do it because they have trouble understanding the concept,” said an 18-year-old student surnamed Yoon at Hansung University. The percentage of students who failed to achieve a minimum level of academic achievement in math rose from 4.2 percent in 2011 to 5.6 percent in 2014, the ministry’s statistics show.A positive aspect that could come from the new measure is that it will reduce the number of students who give up on math because it is too difficult, according to the ministry. However, the plan also invited concerns that the use of calculators in class could result in Korean students losing their edge over their global counterparts.The latest results of the Program for International Student Assessment showed Korea ranking fifth overall after Shanghai, followed by Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. It was also the highest-ranked member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Korea, Singapore, China and Japan, which ranked No. 2 among OECD members, all ban their students from using calculators. But the U.S., one of the most notable countries allowing calculators in class, finished 26th out of 34 OECD countries in math.Korea is not the only country that has debated the use of calculators in school. In 2012, the U.K. government banned the use of calculators for math tests on the state exam students take at age 11, starting in 2014.While U.K. officials acknowledged the benefits of calculators, they said they need to ensure that “students can perform calculations using efficient written methods” prior to using the tools.At the time, the U.K. had fallen to 26th place among OECD members in math achievement.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","calculators in math classes plan ,mathematics education revealed sunday aims ,of calculators in math classes ,more invested in math students ,of calculators for math tests","['Korea', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Jang Gyeong - yun', 'the Korea Society of Educational Studies', '’ve', 'Choi', 'Seoul', 'Yoon', 'Hansung University', 'korean', 'the Program for International Student Assessment', 'Korea', 'Shanghai', 'Singapore', 'Taiwan', 'Hong Kong', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Korea', 'Singapore', 'China', 'Japan', 'OECD', 'U.S.', 'OECD', 'Korea', 'U.K.', 'U.K.', 'U.K.', 'OECD', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50210673  0.17483351

That gave an impression that Dokdo belongs to Japan.  After learning of the omission, South Korea's foreign ministry asked the U.S. to fix the map.   The revised map showed Dokdo marked as the Liancourt Rocks, a neutral name that the U.S. has used to refer to the islets in an effort not to take any side amid Japan's territorial claims to the East Sea islets. The name came from a French whaling vessel that sighted the islets in the 19th century.  The State Department still refers to the body of water between the Korean Peninsula and Japan as the Sea of Japan, despite Seoul's demand that it should be called the East Sea.  In January, the U.S. restored the neutral name of the islets in the CIA's World Factbook map, a day after removing its usual reference to the islets in its latest edition, saying that it made a technical mistake.  Japan has long laid claim to the islets, but Seoul has rejected Japan's claim as nonsense as it regained its independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule and reclaimed sovereignty over its territory, including Dokdo.

They are also expected to touch upon security and diplomatic matters, namely the intensifying debate over Korea’s position in the tug-of-war between the U.S. and China over Washington’s push to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system in Korea and the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Development Bank initiative.Park invited the ruling Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and the main opposition leader Rep. Moon Jae-in last week to present the achievements she made on a recent trip to the Middle East.The president is likely to ask the leaders to help her reform package get parliamentary endorsement within this year. Her reform drive is aimed at eliminating corruptive practices and breaking down unnecessary regulations in four sectors ― labor, education, finance and public office.Observers say that she might also raise the issue of the possible deployment of the THAAD system. Officials at Cheong Wa Dae, however, said the president would only reiterate her earlier position and not elaborate on the issue. Cheong Wa Dae earlier said there had been no request, no consultation and no decision about stationing Washington’s advanced missile defense system in Korea. The meeting is expected to draw public attention as it will be Park’s first face-to-face meeting with her former presidential election rival Moon since the 2012 election.Since taking over to the party’s chairmanship last month, Moon has been intensifying his criticism against Park’s economic and welfare policies, vowing he would stage an all-out war with the government.Moon is expected to request Park to revise her economic policies and consider raising the minimum wage by 10 percent and capping prices in Korea’s long-term leasing system to control the skyrocketing market price. The opposition leader is also expected to urge Park to hold inter-Korean talks this year and withdraw economic sanctions on North Korea.Park hosting the three-way meeting is viewed as an attempt to cast off her uncommunicative image and request bipartisan support for her reform drive and pending economy-related bills.The meeting came amid Park slowly recovering the public confidence. According to a local pollster, Park’s approval rating rose back above the 40 percent mark last week, for the first time in nine weeks. Realmeter, a Seoul-based polling agency, said Monday that her job rating showed 42.8 percent, the second-highest record this year, in a survey conducted between March 9 and 13. Park’s job rating stood at 43.2 percentage on the first week of January, but continued to spiral downhill for more than two months in the face of political scandal involving Cheong Wa Dae officials as well as inconsistencies in welfare and tax policies.The sharp increase indicates that conservative supporters have returned to support Park amid an ongoing investigation into the March 5 knife attack against the U.S. ambassador to Korea and its possible connection with pro-North Korean forces, the pollster said.The percentage of respondents who expressed negative views also dropped 4.4 percentage points from last week to 50.2 percent. The survey asked 2,500 adults nationwide and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points with 95 percent of confidence level.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","meet on tuesday with controversial ,tuesday with controversial economic issues ,presidential election rival moon since ,on tuesday with controversial economic ,tuesday with controversial economic","['Park Geun', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'Beijing', 'Asian Infrastructure Development Bank', 'Saenuri', 'Kim Moo - sing', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Moon', 'Moon', 'Park ’s', 'Moon', 'Korea', 'Park', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'north korean', 'Cho Chung - un']",10,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.6466924   0.7285918

Chung said later he was misquoted.  The new minister, meanwhile, said he is neither ""dovish"" nor ""hawkish"" when it comes to North Korea policy.  ""If you ask me about that, you may call me an owl,"" he quipped, as he briefly met reporters.

It also said it would collect 15 percent of their basic wage plus overtime payment as ""social security."" Currently, the South's firms pay 15 percent of the basic wage alone.It would enable North Korea to earn $450,000 in additional revenue from the Gaesong district, according to the ministry.Around 53,000 North Korean workers are employed by 124 South Korean firms, mostly small and medium-sized, in the zone created in 2004 as a result of the historic inter-Korean summit four years earlier.On Thursday, the communist nation argued its wage hike decision is a legitimate measure under its sovereignty.Speaking to Pyongyang's propaganda website, Uriminzokkiri, a spokesman for the country's Central Special Development Guidance Bureau said it is not a matter to be decided through consultations with the South's government. The bureau is in charge of operating the complex,South Korean officials are apparently gearing up for a drawn-out dispute with the North, bearing various scenarios in mind. ""We do not rule out the possibility of the North withdrawing its workers from the facilities,"" Lim said. ""We have advised companies there to follow the government-set guidelines (in any case).""In April 2013, the North withdrew all of its workers and blocked the entry of South Koreans into the complex, suspending its operation for five months.The ministry, meanwhile, dismissed the North's claim that its laborers in Gaesong are not being paid enough for their ability.The North said their wage is still low for their heightened skills and productivity and in comparison with the wage level in special economic zones in other nations.""The average monthly wage for the North's workers in the Gaesong Industrial Complex is $141.4,"" a ministry official said on background. It's far higher than $74, the average wage per month in Bangladesh, and $120 in Cambodia, he pointed out.""We were also told that the North's workers want to work in the Gaesong complex as its wage level and working conditions are better than those in other areas in their country,"" he said.The government is willing to discuss the wage issue but it can't allow the North to make a unilateral decision, he added.

The signs, offers of food, flowers, cards and well-wishes on Twitter, Facebook and our blogs, these and other acts of kindness have touched us deeply,” Lippert said in a news conference at Yonsei Severance Hospital in Seoul.“I am eager to get back to working on this strong and dynamic relationship. We will continue our work to grow this relationship not only in terms of our critical military alliance but also in our vibrant economic ties and important diplomatic partnership and deep friendship between the Korean and American people.”  U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert waves as he enters a press conference before being discharged from Yonsei Severance Hospital on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The remaining stitches on Lippert’s right chin were removed earlier in the day as he has shown a speedy recovery, the medical staff said. The stitches on his wrist have not been taken out yet but an orthopedist will visit the envoy every day for a checkup, they added.During his stay, Lippert was visited by high-profile well-wishers, including President Park Geun-hye, who met him immediately upon her return from a Middle East tour. Meanwhile, controversy escalated over the manner in which the police are conducting the probe into the allegations of the attacker Kim Ki-jong’s pro-North Korean links. Kim was arrested last week on charges of attempted murder, assault on a foreign diplomat and obstruction of official duties after attacking the top U.S. envoy. Along with those allegations, the authorities have been separately looking into whether the suspect also violated the National Security Law. During the raid at Kim’s house and office on Friday, investigators found dozens of suspicious books and periodicals that may indicate that he has pro-North Korean views. An examination is underway to detect if there are any “enemy benefiting” contents in the materials, the police said. Of these, 10 books were already confirmed to have contained law-violating contents, they added. While the police legally searched his house and office with a search warrant issued by the court, some law experts claimed that the search and seizure at his places violated the principle of warrant.Under Korean law, investigators are only allowed to seize items that are related to the allegations written on the warrant.“If attempted murder charges are written on Kim’s warrant, the police are only supposed to search things that are related to the knife, such as where the suspect bought the knife. Unrelated search and seizure is unlawful,” said lawyer Seol Chang-il, a member of Minbyun ― Lawyers for a Democratic Society. “If investigators sought a ‘comprehensive warrant’ for ‘determining the crime motive,’ (seizing the North Korea-related materials) may not be a problem. But it is highly unusal for such comprehensive warrant to be issued,” he added. Accompanying antisecurity investigators during the raid also fueled doubts that the authorities went with the intent to seek evidence of National Security Law violations by the suspect.The police, however, claimed that the seizure process was legal as it was part of the probe to reveal the suspect’s planning and motive for the crime.

The North claims the drills are a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.North Korea's state media hailed the attack on Lippert, saying it was ""deserved punishment"" for a warmonger such as the U.S. (Yonhap)","annual seoul washington military exercises ,seoul over the bloody attack ,election campaign in seoul strongly ,koreans consolation the five minute ,annual seoul washington military","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Park', 'Mark Lippert', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'Lippert', 'Park', 'Korean', 'Park', 'Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', ""South Koreans '"", 'south korean', 'Lippert', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Lippert', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Lippert', 'Severance Hospital', 'Seoul', 'Lippert', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'State Department', 'Marie Harf', 'Lippert', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'the U.S.In Seoul', 'National Security', 'Kim Kwan - jin', 'the National Security Council', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Koreas', 'Key Resolve', 'North Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'Lippert', 'U.S.']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37898791  0.14095719

The ambassador had been eating breakfast before a speech during the forum organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation.The bleeding diplomat was rushed to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment and then to another where he received surgery for the cut stretching from his right cheek to his chin and another injury on his left arm. He is in stable condition, hospital officials said. U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Lippert hurries into a vehicle while pressing on his wounds after a knife attack at a seminar at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Seoul on Thursday morning. (Yonhap)Kim was held down by the forum participants right after the attack and arrested. The assailant claimed his attack was aimed at “stopping a war on the Korean Peninsula” citing his opposition to the ongoing joint South Korean-U.S. military drill, which is strongly opposed by North Korea.After his surgery, Lippert wrote on his Twitter account that he was “doing well and in good spirits” and that he was “deeply moved by the support” he had received. “(I) will be back ASAP to advance U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) alliance!” he wrote.The incident came after the public sentiment against the U.S. deteriorated following U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman’s recent remarks that suggested Seoul and Beijing were to blame for frayed relations with Japan over history issues.This is the first time a U.S. ambassador to South Korea has been attacked. The incident occurred about four months after Lippert, a close confidant of President Barack Obama, assumed office at age 41 to become the youngest-ever American ambassador to Seoul.Mindful of possible negative ramifications on its alliance with the U.S., Seoul expressed “shock and deep regrets” over the attack. It held an emergency meeting of vice ministers and decided to “sternly” punish any Seoul officials in charge of protecting the U.S. diplomat. Cheong Wa Dae also convened a National Security Council meeting to discuss follow-up measures. Police vowed to thoroughly investigate the case and beefed up their security measures for U.S. Embassy staff and buildings.Lippert’s surgery lasted for some 2 1/2 hours, and medical officials said that it was “successful.”“The cut on his face was 11 cm long and 3 cm deep, and the cut on his arm was about 2 cm long and 2 cm deep. He received some 80 stitches on his face,” said Chung Nam-sik, head of the Yonsei University Health System at a news conference.“He will need hospitalization for some three to four days. And we will need to watch him carefully, but our concerns for now are about the scars on his face and any aftereffect from the cuts on his wrist.” The medical staff said that the scars and aftereffects were expected to almost disappear in one or two years. During the seminar, Kim, the head of the leftist group Urimadang, was sitting at a table next to the head table where Lippert was preparing for a speech. Witnesses said the attacker abruptly approached the diplomat, pushed him onto the table and slashed him.Right after his arrest, Kim shouted, “I carried out the terror attack. I have prepared to disseminate leaflets to oppose the (South Korea-U.S.) military exercise for a war.”In the leaflets, he called for the “suspension of the exercise that blocks inter-Korean dialogue and Seoul’s retaking of wartime operational control (from Washington).”Kim claimed his right ankle was broken when the police restrained him. He was carried away on a stretcher, and told reporters, “I oppose the military drills, a reason why the two Koreas can’t hold the reunions of separated families.”He also said that he prepared for the attack for some 10 days, and that he had no accomplices or directives from others to carry out the attack. “I made a sacrifice myself so as to stop the Key Resolve exercise,” he said.Issuing an apology to the nation, the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, the organizer of the morning seminar, said that its president Hong Sa-deok had tendered his resignation to take responsibility for the incident.Officials of the forum said that Kim was not invited to the event, but they could not block him from entering because he expressed a strong wish to attend, and the organizers had no authority to block his entry. It was not Kim’s first attack on a foreign diplomat. In 2010, he hurled blocks of concrete toward then-Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie while he was giving a lecture in Seoul. He was given a two-year jail term that was suspended for three years.According to intelligence officials, Kim shifted his focus from anti-Japan activities to anti-U.S. campaigns after multiple visits to North Korea.Viewing the attack as an act of terrorism, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency set up a special probe team consisting of nearly 80 investigators. They will focus on verifying Kim’s motives for the attack and whether he had any accomplices, officials said.Police plan to search Kim’s house and seek an arrest warrant to detain him for a longer period on charges of attempted murder and possession of a lethal weapon, and will seek separate warrants to secure Kim’s telephone records and other personal communication data.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","after knife attack at seminar ,seminar in downtown seoul thursday ,leftist activist during morning seminar ,knife attack at seminar ,in downtown seoul thursday leaving","['U.S.', 'Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Kim Ki - jong', 'the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'yonhap)kim', 'south Korean', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Lippert', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Wendy Sherman', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Lippert', 'Barack Obama', 'american', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Dae', 'National Security Council', 'U.S. Embassy', 'Lippert ’s', 'Chung Nam', 'the Yonsei University Health System', 'Kim', 'Urimadang', 'Lippert', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation', 'Hong Sa - deok', 'Kim', 'japanese', 'Toshinori Shigeie', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'anti - u.s.', 'North Korea', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Song Sang - ho']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.2800746   0.25045571

212,212,212,[Newsmaker] Lippert: More than just Obama's friend,"When U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert began his term here last October, local reports expressed hope that Lippert’s friendship with U.S. President Barack Obama would help strengthen the alliance between the two nations.Lippert, the youngest-ever Washington ambassador to Seoul at 42, lived up to the expectations of boosting ties, not through his relationship with Obama, but through what appeared to be his ...","When U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert began his term here last October, local reports expressed hope that Lippert’s friendship with U.S. President Barack Obama would help strengthen the alliance between the two nations.Lippert, the youngest-ever Washington ambassador to Seoul at 42, lived up to the expectations of boosting ties, not through his relationship with Obama, but through what appeared to be his genuine urge to get to know the everyday people on the streets here.Lippert has been an Obama ally since 2005, working with the future president at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When Lippert deployed to Iraq in 2007 as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy, Obama had reportedly texted him, “I miss you, brother.”In Obama’s 2008 campaign team, Lippert served as the top foreign policy adviser, before working as the deputy national security adviser and the National Security Council’s chief of staff. Lippert deployed once more to Afghanistan after returning to active service in October 2009. U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert (Korea Herald)In South Korea though, Lippert’s connections with Obama did not mean as much as his dog Grigsby, his awkward Korean language skills, and his newborn son James, whose middle name is Sejun, a common Korean boy’s name.During the past few months in Korea, Lippert could often be seen out walking with Grigsby, a short-legged basset hound that enjoys over 600 followers on his own Twitter account. In another photo on the ambassador’s social networking account of him on a visit to Busan, Lippert has written in Korean, “I was at Busan last night. Food delicious!!! Made new friends!!! Fish and sushi house thank you!!! Had fun!!!”Lippert’s effort to learn the Korean language can also be seen on his blog, entitled “The Lipperts in Korea.”In a video posted on the blog, Lippert greets viewers in Korean with his wife Robyn, before asking viewers in English to “please stop us on the streets when you see us (and) please say hello to Grigsby.”On a posting on Jan. 30, Lippert introduces readers to his new son born in Seoul earlier that month -- James William Sejun Lippert. Sejun was given his middle name so he could remember his “history here in the Republic of Korea,” Lippert said.When the ambassador was attacked Thursday by a man wielding a 23-centimeter knife at the Sejong Arts Center, the South Korean public rose in a unified voice condemning the assault.Online postings expressing regret were commonly found on newsfeeds in Naver, South Korea’s most often-visited Internet portal. “We are sincerely sorry,” one message read, while another read, “this is an embarrassment to our country,” in apparent criticism of the lax security put on the envoy who had trusted the level of safety here.Politicians from the governing Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy showed a rare moment of bipartisanship when they denounced the violence against Lippert as “intolerable.”“We express thanks to President Park Geun-hye, Vice Foreign Minsiter Cho, the political parties, and the public who have expressed (their sorrow),” U.S. Embassy official Robert Ogburn said later in the day.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","brother in obama 2008 campaign ,new son born in seoul ,youngest ever washington ambassador ,friendship with president barack obama ,obama ally since 2005 working","['U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'Lippert ’s', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Lippert', 'Obama', 'the Senate Foreign Relations Committee', 'Lippert', 'Iraq', 'the U.S. Navy', 'Obama', 'Obama ’s 2008', 'Lippert', 'the National Security Council ’s', 'Lippert', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Mark Lippert', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Lippert ’s', 'Obama', 'Grigsby', 'korean', 'James', 'Sejun', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Lippert', 'Grigsby', 'Busan , Lippert', 'Korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Lippert', 'Korean', 'Robyn', 'Grigsby', 'Lippert', 'Seoul', 'James William Sejun Lippert', 'Sejun', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Lippert', 'the Sejong Arts Center', 'south korean', 'Naver', 'South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lippert', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Minsiter Cho', 'U.S. Embassy', 'Robert Ogburn', 'Jeong Hunny']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37442541  0.51329893

Sherman unjustly portrayed South Korea and China's calls for an apology from Japan as provocations and indulged Japan, the civic activists said. ""It's deplorable to see the U.S. trying to defend Japan for its national interest,"" they said, calling on the U.S. government to offer an apology and reprimand Sherman.They also urged the South Korean government to lodge a complaint with the U.S. and receive an apology.Feuds stemming from shared history among South Korea, China and Japan have often strained Japan's relations with the two neighbors, as the country has failed to atone fully for atrocities committed during World War II, including the imperial Japanese army's sexual enslavement of Korean and Chinese women.SEOUL.

""Obviously our three countries share a lot in common.

""As we have said many times, the apologies extended by previous Japanese Prime Minister Murayama and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono marked an important chapter in Japan improving relations with its neighbors.""The official was referring to the 1993 Kono statement and the 1995 Murayama statement in which Japan apologized for the sexual slavery issue and the 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The statements of apology have been considered the basis of South Korea's relations with Japan.""The trafficking of women for sexual purposes by the Japanese military during World War II was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights,"" the spokesperson said, adding that U.S. President Barack Obama has urged Japan to address the issue and treat the surviving victims ""with dignity and respect.""Meanwhile, Harf also denounced North Korea's latest missile launches.""We've certainly seen those reports that they launched two short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea,"" she said, using the Korean name for the body of water between South Korea and Japan. ""If confirmed, which I can't do independently, such missile launches would represent a threat to regional peace and security and would be a violation of multiple U.N.

Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul is scheduled to deliver a keynote address on Tuesday at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which kicks off Monday for a four-day run. He is expected to stress the need for follow-up measures in line with last year’s General Assembly resolution calling for perpetrators to be brought to the International Criminal Court. From left: South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yongShortly before Cho’s speech, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong will take the podium and likely attempt to undermine a landmark survey by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry, emboldened by a recent retraction of some testimonies by Shin Dong-hyuk, one of the best-known North Korean defectors and a key witness in the report. The 400-page document detailed harrowing accounts from defectors and witnesses of rape, murder, torture and other “systematic, widespread and gross” rights violations entailing crimes against humanity in the reclusive country. The North has blasted the study as a “fabrication” designed to overthrow the country. Shin’s confession has apparently helped fuel the North’s argument, though members of the U.N. panel and other officials and experts elsewhere dismissed the issue, saying the absolute majority of the findings and testimonies stand true. Ri’s delegation is also stepping up diplomatic efforts to water down a council resolution to be adopted at the closure of the session later this month. The text is currently being authored by longtime sponsors the European Union and Japan in consultation with South Korea, the U.S. and other countries. Last year, the 47-member council endorsed a text recommending the U.N. Security Council to take appropriate action including referring the situation to an “international criminal justice mechanism.”“The resolution has been adopted for years so North Koreans would try to persuade other countries, especially those with close ties, to vote against it,” a Seoul official said on customary condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “I think Ri’s participation per se represents how significant this issue is to them, and their resolve that they cannot sit idle when their ‘highest dignity’ is coming under threat.” During his speech, Cho is also predicted to call on Japan to resolve the issue of its sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II, highlighting this as part of the universal agenda of women’s rights. Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se struck a relatively tough tone last year, criticizing Japan by name and calling its wartime sexual slavery an “unresolved problem that is still haunting us today.” The level of this year’s message is being fine-tuned, the Seoul official noted. “What I can say now is that the issue will be raised in the context of universal women’s rights.” Later this week, both Cho and Ri are slated to attend the Conference on Disarmament, also in the Swiss city. Cho plans to give a speech calling for Pyongyang to renounce its nuclear ambitions and for global efforts to strengthen the nonproliferation regime, according to the Foreign Ministry.

At his first Cabinet meeting as prime minister since he took office on Feb. 17, Lee said he would push for dismissal of both corruption-ridden and underperforming officials, stipulating that the targets involve ministers, vice ministers, chiefs of state-controlled agencies and other senior officials.“The Prime Minister’s Office plans to conduct overall performance evaluations of them twice a year,” he said at the Seoul Government Complex. “According to the Constitution and laws, (the office) would exercise the authority of asking (President Park Geun-hye) to discharge (some of) the Cabinet members.”He clarified that the stern personnel policy was part of the administration’s efforts toward economic vitalization and weeding out improper practices in civil service.“To reach this goal, it is urgent to gain credibility from the public. The state tasks will not be achievable unless there is tightened discipline among government officials,” he told the Cabinet members.The prime minister stressed that “the easygoing attitude from the passive stance is the biggest problem in bureaucratic society.”It is expected that the office would carry out assessments of the ministers and others’ performances, with one in each half of the year. The initial results for the first half of 2015 will likely be released in July or August.President Park Geun-hye and the ruling Saenuri Party are pinning their hopes on the new prime minister as the administration must prevent entering lame-duck status by appealing to the public with its economic policy performance.Lee also reiterated the urgency of the moves, noting Feb. 25 was the beginning of the third year of Park’s five-year presidential term. There are 14 months until the 2016 parliamentary elections and 34 months until the 2017 presidential election.Later in the day, Lee visited Saenuri Party floor leader Yoo Seung-min and main opposition New Politics Alliance Democracy chairman Moon Jae-in at the National Assembly.Lee is to undergo an interpellation session with a group of Assembly members, slated for Feb. 25-27.

Woo Yoon-keun of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The two met for the first time since Lee’s tough confirmation hearing earlier this month.Woo and Lee began an unlikely friendship last year as the floor leaders of their respective parties, conducting lengthy negotiations over divisive draft bills. During the talks, Lee earned the trust of Woo and other NPAD moderates through his affability and mediating skills. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo (right) shakes hands with New Politics Alliance for Democracy floor leader Rep. Woo Yoon-keun at the National Assembly on Tuesday. (Yonhap)When President Park Geun-hye designated Lee as prime minister nominee on Jan. 23, analysts hence expected him to receive Assembly approval smoothly.Not only did Lee’s governing Saenuri Party hold a majority, but his friendship with Woo appeared to guarantee the support of the opposition. Woo even gave him a book entitled “The Best Prime Minister, and the Worst Prime Minister” as a congratulatory present.But fate turned against Lee when reports surfaced that the third-term lawmaker had speculated on real estate, evaded conscription, and intimidated journalists to deter them from writing critical stories of him. The ensuing public backlash compelled Woo and the NPAD to vote against Lee’s nomination.The prime minister was approved despite the opposition. But his tarnished reputation had stripped him of his political value to President Park, who had hoped Lee’s image as a moderate, and outspoken supporter of bipartisanship would boost her public ratings.“I was truly sorry,” Woo said calmly with watery eyes on Tuesday, “that I couldn’t help Rep. Lee.” Lee put his arms over Woo’s shoulders, as if to say it was OK.“Rep. Lee is more than just a prime minister to me. He was a great counterpart with whom I could conduct fair negotiations in an atmosphere of trust.”“I will offer him constructive criticism as the opposition’s floor leader, but I will cooperate every time I can,” Woo added.The Woo-Lee duo is remembered for coming up with compromises on tough bills including the special Sewol bill and this year’s government budget. The special Sewol bill authorized an investigation into the April sinking of the ferry, which had left over 300 dead or missing. The accident continues to stir immense criticism of the Park administration for its handling of the rescue operations.Governing party lawmakers had opposed the bill, saying prosecutorial investigations and an earlier parliamentary probe had already looked into the disaster, while the NPAD had supported the bill.Woo and Lee were also credited with playing key roles in passing the 2015 budget before the constitutionally mandated Dec. 2 deadline for the first time since 2002. They had agreed on a compromise spending plan hours before midnight of Dec. 2 last year, following weeks of partisan fights over potential tax hikes and public education funding, among other things.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","on tuesday yonhap when president ,national assembly on tuesday yonhap ,following weeks of partisan fights ,tuesday yonhap when president ,assembly on tuesday yonhap","['Lee Wan - koo', 'the National Assembly', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'Assembly', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Woo', 'Lee', 'Lee ’s', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', '”“I', 'Park', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Jeong Hunny']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35103923  0.32937023

Curtis Scaparrotti said in a statement. ""Exercising our multinational force is an important component of readiness and is fundamental to sustaining and strengthening the alliance.""  Separately, the allies are scheduled to hold the field training exercise Foal Eagle, which involves a set of land, sea and air maneuvers, from March 2 to April 24.  The two-month tactical training will mobilize about 200,000 Korean and 3,700 American troops, mostly from overseas.  Drawing attention is the participation of the USS Fort Worth, a 3,450-ton Freedom-class littoral combat ship, in the drill during its rotational deployment to the 7th Fleet.  ""It is the first time an LCS has trained with the South Korean Navy and 7th Fleet ships in Northeast Asia,"" U.S. Naval Forces Korea spokesman Arlo Abrahamson said in a statement. ""The exercise provides a great chance to increase our combined readiness, which ultimately contributes to greater stability for the region.""  The combat ship, complete with surface warfare mission package capabilities including an MH-60R helicopter and Mark 110 57-millimeter gun, is capable of getting closer to shore than larger ships during diverse scenarios, which ""brings speed, maneuverability and shallow draft to this exercise,"" according to the U.S. navy.  Five countries -- Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, and Britain -- are scheduled to participate in the exercises, with the Neutral Supervisory Commission to observe and monitor them to ensure they do not break the armistice agreement signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.  The large-scale annual drills are expected to further heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with Pyongyang issuing near-daily threats of harsh retaliation of ""hostile"" forces.  Repeating its long-held claims that the exercises are ""dress rehearsals"" for a northward invasion with nuclear weapons, the North said in its main newspaper Rodong Sinmun Tuesday that ""chances of dialogue or diplomatic resolutions are all gone and vowed to strengthen war deterrence at the full scale and respond militarily.""  South Korea and the U.S., however, have said they will go ahead with the plan, as the regular exercises are defensive in nature and aim solely to bolster readiness against a possible invasion by North Korea.  ""Earlier in the day, the Military Armistice Commission of the United Nations Command informed North Korea about the exercise plan,"" a CFC official said, requesting anonymity.

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The Korea Herald: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will attend Russia’s 70th anniversary event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany in Moscow this May according to the Kremlin. If President Park does not participate, how would this affect Cheong Wa Dae’s regional diplomacy?Park Byung-in: We have to remember that, back in 2005 for the 60th anniversary of the event, all five leaders of the six-party-talks nations, except North Korea, participated: Russian President Vladimir Putin, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, U.S. President George W. Bush, Chinese President Hu Jintao and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. For Kim Jong-un, the event will be a platform to flaunt his foreign policy achievements to his people ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Workers’ Party in October.This will undoubtedly put President Park in a tough spot, as she will have to choose between Moscow and Washington. If she does not participate, her centerpiece foreign policy proposal, the Eurasian Initiative, will likely be scrapped by the withdrawal of Russian support. Garnering Russian support for future inter-Korean and unification policies will be out of the question. U.S. President Barack Obama has said he will be absent, but toeing Washington’s line would downgrade Korea’s sovereignty. It is important to recognize that international sanctions are secondary to our own national interests.KH: How have Russia-North Korea relations evolved from the Soviet era to the Putin era?Park: Pyongyang played a hedging strategy between Moscow and Beijing during the communist era, as national leader Kim Il-sung consolidated his power with Soviet backing and China fought alongside the North during the Korean War (1950-53). But as tensions between Russia and China intensified over the years, Pyongyang started to tread an independent path using the “juche” ideology of self-reliance. Meanwhile, Kim Il-sung used Russia as leverage against China, and his son Kim Jong-il worked hard to enhance ties with Moscow by holding four summits.The Kremlin’s recent cordial approach is not only a response to Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine, but also a product of a long-held regional aspiration. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia stepped up diplomacy with the West and South Korea, deserting North Korea. This caused a rift between Moscow and Pyongyang.The second North Korean nuclear crisis in 2002 was dealt with by China, the U.S., North Korea and South Korea. Russian officials, fearing being shunted aside in regional politics, strove to keep a high-profile and got onboard the six-party talks in 2003. They realized North Korea’s strategic role in advancing Russian ambitions to control Northeast Asia and develop its Far East. Putin has pushed a rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific to clinch Russia’s stake in the regional order dominated by the U.S. and China. Pyongyang, in an effort to level-off dependence on China, embraced Moscow’s advances.KH: From Beijing’s perspective, how will improved Pyongyang-Moscow ties affect China’s interests?Park: The top foreign policy priority of both Russia and China is maintaining peace and stability in East Asia. To offset American influence in the region, the Kremlin and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) have elevated their partnership to a historic high. China has faced growing pressure from the international community to play a leadership role in disciplining Pyongyang. In this light, China sees improved Russia-North Korea relations as beneficial to its own national interests, as Russia will help relieve some of its burden regarding the belligerent ally. However, this does not mean that Russia-North Korea relations will replace China-North Korea relations in any significant degree. Moscow is oriented geopolitically closer to Europe than Asia. The level of trade between China and North Korea in 2013 was 58 times that of Russia and North Korea. North Korea exported $9 million worth of textiles, musical instruments and rare-earth resources to Russia and imported $103 million worth of oil, railway vehicles, machinery and wood materials.Both Russia and China seem to believe that enhanced inter-Korean relations can give it leverage against America’s clout in the region. A Russia-North Korea partnership will prompt competition over the strategic nation between Russia and China, which will activate renewed cooperation between the three Cold War allies. In the same vein, Seoul should not be overly concerned about the current cooperation. It will kick-start a new growth engine for our economy and expand our commercial horizons. We need a forward-looking vision to capitalize on this opportunity.KH: Will Moscow-Pyongyang harmonization help or get in the way of multilateral denuclearization efforts?Park: Once Pyongyang believes it has no ally to trust and count on, it will further isolate itself from the world and press on with its nuclear development. As Moscow signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a nuclear-armed North Korea would not serve Russia’s interests. But Moscow has perceived Pyongyang’s nuclear capability as an indirect threat and sought to change its behavior rather than its leadership. The improved relations between Moscow and Pyongyang have the potential to empower Kim’s regime and deflect international sanctions. But at the same time, Russia can play the role of an honest broker and trustworthy ally to dissuade Pyongyang from its brinksmanship.KH: How will enhanced ties between Russia and North Korea help bring about President Park’s Northeast Asia Peace Initiative, Eurasia Initiative and Korean Peninsula Trust Process?Park: The Northeast Asia Peace Initiative is an envisioned supranational schema comparable to the European Union. It traces its roots to former President Roh Moo-hyun, whose own vision descended from former President Roh Tae-woo’s Nordpolitik policies, which helped normalize relations with communist nations. The Eurasia Initiative falls under the umbrella of the NAPI.Under the slogan, “one continent, creative continent and peaceful continent,” the Eurasia Initiative aspires to recover Korea’s continental connection, which was severed by the division of the peninsula. After the Korean War, South Korea effectively became an island and lost its continental identity. This initiative cannot be accomplished without the support of Russia and North Korea. Whereas the NAPI may be somewhat idealistic and far-fetched, the Eurasia initiative is more implementable and concrete. When Dmitry Medvedev, Kim Jong-il and Lee Myung-bak were national leaders (of Russia, North Korea and South Korea, respectively) in 2011, they were all open to the idea of developing a natural gas pipeline from Sakhalin Island to South Korea. This joint project, currently stymied by the May 24 Measures, is one of the blueprints outlined in these initiatives. Seoul must take a front seat in this project without looking for Washington’s approval. The positive developments between Moscow and Pyongyang must be acted upon. KH: What are the deeper intentions behind Moscow’s overtures to Pyongyang? What is the significance of border area enterprises such as the Rajin-Khasan project?Park: Moscow agreed to fund a $25 billion project last year that would modernize 3,500 kilometers of North Korea’s railways and mining, transportation, hydro and electrical infrastructure. In return, Russia would gain privileged access to the North’s rich reserve of minerals.Given Russia’s economic difficulties following the ruble’s collapse, this project seems unlikely to be realized as planned. Moscow’s ulterior motive may be to elicit Seoul’s participation in constructing natural gas pipelines from Russia to South Korea, and a trans-Korean railway linked with Russia’s Trans-Siberian Railway. Knowing full well North Korea’s strategic utility, the Kremlin has used the Pyongyang card to engage Seoul and garner its support for its continental project.To jump-start these schemes, Russia waived $10 billion of Pyongyang’s $11 billion debt from the Soviet era, announced that it would expand bilateral trade 10-fold to $1 billion a year by 2020 and use the ruble as currency. Russia also invested $250 million to develop North Korea’s northeastern city of Rajin into a logistics hub and link it with Russia’s Khasan through the Trans-Siberian Railway. In November 2013, the first batch of 40,000 tons of Siberian coal was shipped to the port city of Pohang in the southeastern part of (South) Korea.South Korea needs to realize that, whereas sanctions against Pyongyang are short-term and subject to volatile international politics, these economic projects last for decades. More practically, they can help make our NAPI, Eurasia Initiative and Korean Peninsula Trust Process into reality. Korea’s alliance with the U.S. considered, I do not think it is an issue that will damage our relations.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)Park Byung-in graduated from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in 1990 with a degree in Chinese language.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Cho emphasized in particular the importance of education in reducing extremism and said South Korea will place greater emphasis on vocational training when providing development assistance to less well-off nations, the ministry said.In addition, Cho pledged to help raise the awareness of the issue among South Korean social networking services and strengthen their capabilities to cope with messages of violent extremism.In countering violent extremism, Obama stressed the importance of making people economically better off through vocational training and job creation, resolving political grievances through democratic principles and respect for human rights and actively engaging younger people to ensure they are not swayed by violent extremism.U.N. chief Ban said he will convene a special event in the coming months that will bring together faith leaders from all around the world to promote mutual understanding and reconciliation.Based on this week's conference, the participants agreed to strengthen information sharing and take other follow-up steps, including holding regional conferences, and hold a leaders-level conference in September to check on progress, the ministry said.

But Lee faces daunting challenges as he is taking office at a critical time, with the Park Geun-hye government seeking a way out from a deepening political crisis and pushing for her reform drives. Critics say that Park likely intends to use Lee as the chief mascot for her policies, and as a channel of communication with the main parties.Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo listens to President Park Geun-hye during his appointment ceremony at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. (Yonhap)“That would shield the president from direct criticism for policy failures,” said Kyung Hee University professor Yoon Seong-yi.“What (Park) will do now with Lee remains up in the air, though,” he said, in reference to Lee’s less-than-stellar performance at his confirmation hearing.But as recently as 26 days ago, when Park named Lee as her new prime minister, Lee appeared to be the just the man to rise above the office’s usual titular status and exercise meaningful political influence.Lee, 64, is a third-term lawmaker with four decades of public service. He has served in the National Police, as a diplomat working in the Korean Consulate in Los Angeles and as governor of South Chungcheong Province from 2006 to 2009. When Lee served as the governing Saenuri Party’s floor leader last year, he received acclaim for mediating on divisive partisan issues. Lee’s persuasive rhetoric even won him the trust of his political rivals in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Park likely had such skills in mind when she picked Lee as her new deputy. Park supporters hoped Lee’s bipartisan clout would raise the president’s falling public ratings, which have hovered near 30 percent according to polls by Gallup Korea and Realmeter earlier this year.The Park administration has also sponsored a dozen draft bills that remain pending in the National Assembly, including revisions to the retired civil servants’ pension, bills to legalize telemedicine and boost crowdfunding, and others. Despite the Saenuri Party’s parliamentary majority, the bills could remain stalled indefinitely if the party does not convince the NPAD to cooperate. The main opposition party can withhold draft bills from going over to a final vote due to amendments in related laws made in 2012.Officials had hoped Lee’s bonhomie with the NPAD would smoothen the bills’ passage.But Lee’s hard-won political credibility was torpedoed at last week’s confirmation hearing when NPAD officials uncovered alleged wrongdoings during his career.NPAD officials said Lee faked having flat feet to evade military service, using his influence as a civil official. Lee was also found to have intimidated reporters, threatening to have them fired if they wrote critical stories about him. In a recording, he said he knew higher-ups in the media industry.Analysts say the list of accusations may have tarnished Lee’s image enough to force him into a role he promised not to take ― a ceremonial prime minister. “I take it that President Park chose Lee to use him as a driver of her policies that have been stalled in the National Assembly,” Hanshin University professor Yoon Pyung-joong said last week immediately after Lee’s confirmation hearing.“It appears (that it will be) difficult for Park to use Lee in any major capacity for the time being,” Yoon said, in reference to the allegations.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","her new prime minister lee ,president falling public ratings ,office tuesday he will face ,raise the president falling public ,the president falling public ratings","['Lee Wan - koo', 'South Korea', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Park Geun', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Yoon Seong - yi', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the National Police', 'Los Angeles', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee', 'Lee ’s', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'NPAD', 'Lee ’s', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'NPAD', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the National Assembly', 'Hanshin University', 'Yoon Pyung - joong', 'Lee ’s', 'Lee', 'Yoon', 'Jeong Hunny']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52860594  0.3846651

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Lee warned that North Korea’s increasing economic dependence on China poses grave long-term consequences for the unified Korean economy, and it is critical to restart inter-Korean cooperation on a wide range of initiatives. “Unless we prescribe policies that enable the regime to be part of the international capitalist system and coexist with the market, the North Korean quandary will stay,” Lee stressed.The Korea Herald: The China-North Korea relations have turned sour after Pyongyang’s last nuclear test in 2013. Beijing has yet to offer an official recognition of Kim Jong-un’s legitimacy. How have the Beijing-Pyongyang ties evolved since President Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un took power? Lee Hee-ok: Over the years, the official rhetoric describing China-North Korea relations has changed from a “friendship sealed in blood” (a testament to China’s involvement in the Korean War of 1950-53) to “normal state-to-state relations.” Frankly speaking, they are not traditional allies anymore. Pyongyang’s third nuclear test in 2013 ― following the first and second in 2006 and 2009 ― is regarded as the turning point; senior level exchanges, which used to occur about 40 times annually, has stalled since; and Xi on multiple occasions said that Pyongyang cannot assume Beijing’s unconditional assistance in the event of a war. Mutual suspicion and dislike have intensified. This is because Pyongyang has decidedly jeopardized China’s national interests by escalating confrontation and neglecting reform and opening. North Korea’s bellicose acts invited the U.S. military presence in Northeast Asia ― part of the rebalancing or “pivot” toward Asia ― to the detriment of China. As a result, Beijing, which used to be Pyongyang’s “patron,” has become intolerant of its “client’s” wayward behaviors. KH: There have been increasingly critical voices within China that it should stop condoning its unruly neighbor. Does the Xi government view the Kim regime as a strategic liability or asset?Lee: China sees North Korea both as a strategic liability and asset. But undoubtedly the North still functions as a buffer zone against the U.S. military presence. Peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is one of China’s vital strategic interests. For this reason, Beijing is not willing to let the Pyongyang regime collapse or destabilize. In the eyes of the Chinese leadership, Kim Jong-un is a highly unpredictable and uncontrollable leader. His father Kim Jong-il, having a shrewd understanding of international politics, knew just the right buttons to push to get what he wanted and acted rather predictably. But due to his young age and the ambition to flaunt his power, Kim Jong-un behaved like a bouncing football. Beijing has stood by its principle of “no reward for military provocations.” It also pressured Pyongyang to cooperate more with Seoul. Although Kim has consolidated power after purging his uncle Jang Song-thaek in late 2013, his regime is still sitting on a house of cards. Jang was the chief interlocutor between Pyongyang and Beijing. His purge meant the annihilation of an advisory group capable of planning the country’s future constructively. Consequently, we have seen more of Kim Jong-un’s political will transpire in government policies and actions.KH: How has China’s rise as a “global superpower” affected its North Korean policy? Lee: Unlike his predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who viewed the Beijing-Pyongyang ties bilaterally, Xi sees it within a multinational framework. This reflects China’s growing economic, political and military might as a vying, global hegemon. Despite lagging behind the U.S. globally in military strength, research and development, education, quality of life and other soft-power areas, China believes the “G2” system exists in Northeast Asia. It has thus reframed its relations with the U.S. as a “new type of great power relations.” To realize “China’s Dream” ― a term popularized by Xi since 2013 to describe “national rejuvenation, improvement of people’s livelihoods, prosperity, construction of a better society and a strengthened military” ― Beijing will not tolerate any country that undermines its regional strategic interests. Xi has called on North Korea to halt and end its nuclear development to prevent an arms race in Northeast Asia, an agenda shared by the U.S. KH: What is China’s position on unified Korea? How will the U.S.-Korea military alliance change in a unified Korea vis-a-vis China? Lee: Currently, China does not have a policy regarding a unified Korea. China will want a nuclear-free and ideologically neutral Korea. Korea’s peaceful division is not a bad scenario for Beijing. But once North and South Korea make headways by cooperating, China is likely to play a constructive role to anchor its stakes.As the threat of North Korea will disappear, the nature of the U.S.-Korea military alliance is also likely to evolve, becoming more flexible. China and the U.S. are more likely to cooperate than clash in and around unified Korea. KH: What is China’s position on the six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing North Korea? Lee: Beijing has demanded Pyongyang to put forth a clear position on nuclear disarmament. Denuclearization has become the red line the Chinese Communist Party is not willing to redress. Rather than talking with Pyongyang directly, Beijing now prefers a multilateral framework of the six-party talks.Pyongyang has demanded resuming the talks without conditions. Previously, it asked for security guarantee, financial aid and construction of light water reactors for participating. Seoul and Washington have insisted on the North’s preemptive statement or action to denuclearize. China, meanwhile, has maintained that once the negotiation begins, progress will be made. Beijing also criticized Seoul and Washington for setting the bar too high for Pyongyang to enter the bargaining table. KH: Why did Beijing oppose referring the Kim regime to the International Criminal Court following the adoption of the human rights issue by the United Nation’s Security Council last December? Lee: China sees the North Korean human rights issue as sovereign affairs of another country. China and Russia ― the U.N. Security Council permanent members with veto powers ― have signed a partnership of strategic cooperation in 1996, which outlined their position against interfering in other countries’ human rights issues. China’s rise and its renewed global status have put Beijing in a tough spot over its position on the North Korean human rights issue. To counter international pressure, the CCP has published white papers outlining the improvements in domestic human rights situation. KH: There has been increasing concern over North Korea’s growing economic dependence on China. Conversely, there are those who say that increased trade and investment with China will help modernize North Korea. Is it a boon or bane? Lee: North Korea’s increasing economic dependence on China poses grave long-term consequences. When Chinese capitalists invest, build factories in North Korea and extract the materials to China, they create “industrial linkages” that are perpetually difficult to break. Even when South Korean, American and foreign capitals try to penetrate the North Korean market later, the entire business operations will run along the pre-established industrial linkages. The North has already developed a large trade deficit with China. Nearly 90 percent of Pyongyang’s entire foreign trade ― $7 billion a year ― was with China in 2013. It currently exports minerals and marine products, and since the early 2000s, Chinese firms have invested in North Korea’s infrastructure, agriculture, mining and retail sectors. Pyongyang is well aware of the dangers and is trying to break out of it by diversifying its diplomacy with Seoul, Tokyo, Moscow and even Washington. It is in Seoul’s interest to take a front seat in the inter-Korean economic cooperation. KH: North Korea has initiated a series of economic reforms ― “June 28 Measures” and “May 30 Measures” ― to accommodate the growing market. In what direction do you project the market developing in North Korea over the next decades based on China’s reform and opening since 1978?Lee: The so-called “modernization theory” assumes that following the market expansion, a fledgling middle-class will up their demands for democracy, eventually toppling the authoritarian government. But looking at China’s experience, the state and the market colluded rather than contended. The market and the civil society grew in faithful collusion with the bureaucratic instruments, in stark contrast to the Eastern European liberals that cracked open the Iron Curtain. North Korea is likely to change along the lines of China: “state capitalism.” Far from being a threat to the regime, the market has the potential to empower the elites’ vested interests. The issue at hand is whether the Pyongyang elites will allow their powers to be institutionalized to accommodate the increasing complexities of burgeoning markets. An institutionalized power is more “flexible” than an autocratic one, because the decisions are made within a safe, predictable range of institutions and legislations. Doing so will lower the risks of investing in North Korea. Continuing to clench authority will create tensions and schisms, laying the ground for a revolution. If Pyongyang can act as an objective arbiter between foreign and national firms, by setting up fair rules of the game like China did, market can take root in the Hermit Kingdom. For the North Korean economy to land softly, the external foreign relations should be smooth. Opening North Korea will not happen without recognizing the Kim regime and guaranteeing its survival. If we try to collapse the regime, as President Obama recently said, Pyongyang will only close its doors more tightly. Unless we prescribe policies that enable the regime to be part of the international capitalist system and coexist with the market, the North Korean quandary will stay.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","president obama recently said pyongyang ,korea china will want nuclear ,pyongyang and beijing his purge ,china dream touted by president ,denuclearizing north korea lee beijing","['China', 'North Korea ’s', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee Hee - ok', 'chinese', 'China', 'Sungkyunkwan University', 'Seoul', 'Xi Jinping', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Xi', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Lee', 'North and South Korea', 'China', 'Lee Hee - ok', 'Sungkyunkwan University', 'the Korea Herald', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea herald)lee', 'North Korea ’s', 'China', 'korean', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald :', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Xi Jinping', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Lee Hee - ok', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Xi', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'Xi', 'Kim', 'China', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Jong - il', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Jang Song - thaek', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'China', 'north korean', 'Lee', 'Jiang Zemin', 'Hu Jintao', 'Beijing', 'Xi', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Xi', 'Beijing', 'Xi', 'North Korea', 'the U.S. KH', 'China', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'China', 'Lee', 'China', 'Korea', 'China', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Beijing', 'North and South Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Lee', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'the Chinese Communist Party', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Kim', 'the International Criminal Court', 'the United Nation ’s Security Council', 'Lee', 'China', 'north korean', 'China', 'Russia', 'the U.N.

I don't think it's appropriate to say everything (he) knows,"" Ryoo said.  He also took a jab at Lee for his aborted scheme to scrap the unification ministry, which specializes in inter-Korean affairs, in 2008.  It is unusual for a sitting South Korean minister to openly condemn the country's former president.

President Park Geun-hye speaks at a security meeting with top officials at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. (Yonhap)“The security situation of the peninsula has become difficult to predict,” Park said in a security meeting with top officials at Cheong Wa Dae. “At a time like this, our military should maintain a firm, thorough military readiness to deter (possible) provocations by North Korea.”The remark came amid escalating tension following Pyongyang’s intensified threat against Seoul over anti-North leaflets and its planned joint military drills with Washington.Propaganda leaflets critical of North Korea have long been a source of tension between the Koreas. The two sides traded fire in October after the North fired heavy machine guns, apparently aiming at balloons released by civic groups carrying leaflets denouncing the communist regime, $1 bills, radios and other items.Park criticized the North for its continual threats, despite the South Korean government’s offer of high-level talks. North Korea has remained silent on the offer to hold ministerial talks to discuss such bilateral issues.The president pointed out North Korea’s alleged cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment late last year“Early this year, (the South Korean) government proposed a dialogue without conditions, but North Korea has continued its threats and made a series of demands,” said Park. “Even in these circumstances, the interest of the global community in North Korea’s human rights condition has grown.”Park also said that the security situation of the peninsula has become unpredictable following the hacking attack on Sony Pictures in the United States. The U.S. has imposed another set of sanctions on North Korea over its alleged hacking to protest the comedy film “The Interview,” which depicts a plot to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-un. The FBI has concluded that North Korea was behind the attack. Pyongyang denied its involvement while describing the attack as “a righteous deed.”In the meeting which was attended by more than 230 officials from the military, the police and local governments, Park called for joint efforts to maintain national security from new types of threats as well as from natural disasters.“As we have seen, indiscriminate terrorism and killing committed by IS, threats by terrorists, conflicts and disputes across the globe are growing at alarming rates,” she said.“Security officials should make a thorough examination of our security and safety systems, to cope with the changing situation.”By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","preparedness to deter north korean ,president pointed out north korea ,leaflets critical of north korea ,park said in security meeting ,military drills with washington propaganda","['Park Geun', 'north korean', 'korean', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'anti - north', 'Washington', 'propaganda', 'North Korea', 'Koreas', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Sony Pictures', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'FBI', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33563808  0.41189572

If confirmed, I will ensure that we draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, these threats,"" he said.  North Korea's history of proliferation activities amplify the dangers of its asymmetric programs, he said.  In addition to deploying more missile interceptors, Carter also said he would enhance the Pentagon's ability to highlight and disrupt the illicit proliferation networks that North Korea uses and promote cooperation with partners to interdict shipments of proliferation concern.  ""With respect to ballistic missiles that could threaten the United States, I think that's one of the reasons why we need to keep our missile defenses and especially our ICBM defenses current, capable and large enough in size to deal with both the prospective Iranian threat and the also very real North Korean ICBM threat,"" he said during the hearing.  North Korea's missile program has long been a key security concern in the region and beyond.   The communist nation is believed to have developed advanced ballistic missile technologies through a series of test launches. In its latest rocket launch, conducted in late 2012, the North succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit aboard a long-range rocket.  The test sparked fears that the North has moved closer to ultimately developing nuclear-tipped missiles that could potentially reach the mainland United States. The country has so far conducted three underground nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.  Carter said the North remains ""one of the most intractable security problems"" for the United States. He pointed out the communist nation continues to take destabilizing actions, including nuclear and missile tests as well as the cyberattack against Sony Pictures.  He added the limited information on the North, leader Kim Jong-un and the regime's motivations ""add to my concern.""  ""Despite the recent signals from both North and South Korea about openness to inter-Korean engagement, the U.S. should remain vigilant against the strong possibility that North Korea will use brinkmanship and provocations to try to coerce the United States and its allies and partners back into negotiations on its own terms,"" he said.   Carter also vowed to further strengthen the alliance with South Korea, saying the alliance is ""the critical linchpin to deterring North Korean aggression and maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula.""  He rejected the North's recent offer to suspend nuclear tests if the U.S. and South Korea halt joint military exercises, saying the annual drills are ""routine, transparent, and defensive exercises that are meant to strengthen military readiness and alliance preparedness.""  ""There is no equivalence between conducting these exercises and North Korean nuclear tests, which are violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions,"" he said.  Carter said the North's hack on Sony is ""serious and deserving of a response"" but that he does not believe it rises to the level of an ""act of war.""

I have argued that President Park (Geun-hye of South Korea) should lift the May 24 sanctions,” he said, referring to the sanctions banning inter-Korean economic exchanges, which were imposed after the North’s torpedo attack in March 2010.“We should let private actors and NGOs decide what they want to do vis-a-vis the North, and force the regime there to make key strategic choices as well. ... Commercial relations have the best likelihood ― even if limited ― of changing the nature of the North Korean economy.”Stressing the importance of commercial interaction with the isolated state, he pointed out that the world’s strategy to deal with the North should include “getting people in and getting people out.” But he noted the strategy would be a “very long game.”Touching on the North’s stepped-up diplomacy with Russia to apparently reduce its reliance on China, the scholar said the regime’s moves would not produce much success. “China is too close and too dynamic for North Korea to significantly diversify away from its dependence on the country,” he said.Haggard also cast doubts over the prospects of two-way trade between North Korea and Russia, noting that an economically -strained Moscow might have to shoulder the financial burden for bilateral projects. “The DPRK (North Korea) will need imports of capital, intermediate and consumer goods as well as raw materials; Russia is not going to be an important supplier of those items,” he said. “In addition, North Korea will need wide market outlets if it pursues a more export-oriented strategy, and the natural partner for that effort would be Chinese and Korean ― not Russian ― firms.”The following is the interview with Dr. Haggard.Korea Herald: North Korea has recently beefed up its diplomacy with Russia, while its relations with China and South Korea remain shaky or have worsened. What do you think about Pyongyang’s intentions behind its recent diplomacy?Stephan Haggard: It has been clear for some time that China is losing patience with North Korea, even though it is unwilling to exercise overt ― or at least visible ― pressure to bring Pyongyang back to the bargaining table. But the issue is deeper. Since the onset of the second nuclear crisis in 2002, the DPRK has become increasingly dependent on Chinese trade and investment. The leadership is seeking to diversify relations in order to reduce that dependency at the margin. I don’t believe these efforts will yield much success; China is too close and too dynamic for North Korea to significantly diversify away from its dependence on the country.KH: China accounts for some 90 percent of all of North Korea’s trade, meaning it is the most important economic partner for the isolated regime. How do you think Pyongyang will strive to improve its relations with China? Haggard: As just noted, it will be extremely difficult for North Korea to fundamentally reorient its foreign policy away from Beijing. But the Chinese leadership has been quite consistent in stating its preference for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, which at this point means disabling and ultimately dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program. However, North Korea has institutionalized its commitment to the maintenance of nuclear weapons in the announcement of the so-called “byungjin line” in early 2013 ― the simultaneous pursuit of economic development and nuclear weapons. This is the ultimate source of the undercurrent of distrust in China-DPRK relations at the moment.KH: There has been growing talk of North Korea becoming increasingly antithetical to China’s national interests due to its provocative, unruly behavior. Do you think China’s stance toward the North will change?Haggard: There is now ample evidence of an internal debate in China about the strategic benefits and costs of its alliance with the DPRK; it has even spilled over on to social media. To date, conservatives appear to have won this debate, however. Despite its stated interest in denuclearization, China has been unwilling to undertake the tough actions that would be required to force Pyongyang back to the bargaining table, such as cutting off financial ties or seriously curtailing oil shipments. The United States and South Korea insist that negotiations can only resume with some concrete sign on North Korea’s part that it is willing to participate in such negotiations, and in good faith. Even restating a commitment to the goals of the 2005 joint statement has proven difficult, let alone more concrete steps such as an unconditional and monitored freeze on its nuclear program. KH: With Kim Jong-un taking power, the international community has hoped that the North could change course and move toward reform and openness. But its international isolation has only deepened. What do you think are the reasons?Haggard: I still think it is too early to be pessimistic. My colleague Marc Noland and I, as well as South Korean analysts, have tracked reform efforts over the last three years. There is some evidence that Kim Jong-un tried some modest reforms in 2012, but these did not move forward or were rolled back. Emphasis in the first two years naturally focused on consolidating power. New signs of reform efforts, although modest, are now leaking out. But the regime appears to have placed the greatest emphasis on attracting foreign direct investment when the most important reforms are ultimately domestic.KH: How do you think Kim Jong-un will make his debut on the international diplomatic stage? Russia expects Kim to attend a ceremony in May in Russia to mark the 70th anniversary of its victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.Haggard: It is a sign of both DPRK-China relations and the deterioration in Putin’s relations with the West that one of Kim Jong-un’s first foreign trips will be to Russia. It is clear that the Xi Jinping is avoiding direct contact. Russia has expressed a willingness to undertake large-scale trade and investment with North Korea, but most of the projects in question involve quite substantial financing that will have to come from Russia. There may be some opportunities for transshipment of coal and other commodities, but I am doubtful that the ambitious targets for two-way trade between the two countries will materialize. The DPRK will need imports of capital, intermediate and consumer goods as well as raw materials; Russia is not going to be an important supplier of those items. In addition, North Korea will need wide market outlets if it pursues a more export-oriented strategy, and the natural partner for that effort would be Chinese and Korean ― not Russian ― firms. The DPRK’s natural trading partners are China and South Korea.KH: The international community has stepped up pressure on North Korea to improve its human rights conditions. How do you think North Korea will respond to this pressure, particularly the growing calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer the case to the International Criminal Court?Haggard: China will veto a referral of the Commission of Inquiry report to the International Criminal Court, but the issue is now on the U.N. Security Council agenda; China cannot block further discussion of it in the face of majority support. Although the report is powerful, the human rights community itself is not entirely clear of where to go next. I support efforts by Europe, the U.N. and select neutral NGOs like the Red Cross to take the lead at this point. It is hard for the U.S. or even South Korea to lead on human rights; pressure needs to be accompanied with modest dialogue in which the central message of the COI report can be delivered ― that it will be hard for North Korea to gain diplomatic support if the most egregious rights abuses, like the political concentration camps, continue in place. KH: How do you evaluate Washington’s policy toward North Korea, which some commentators have called “strategic patience”? Do you think the U.S. will take any bold initiative similar to those it took to normalize ties with Cuba and Myanmar?Haggard: There are a number of reasons why the United States is not likely to take a bold initiative on North Korea. President Obama was burned by the early missile and nuclear tests in 2009, by the sinking of the Cheonan and Yeonpyeongdo shelling, and also by the breakdown of the so-called Leap Year deal in 2013. In addition, the Sony hack has played a much more significant role in U.S.-North Korea relations than is realized. North Korea apparently believed that they could get away with this hack and deny involvement. But the released Snowden documents from the end of last year confirm that the U.S. intelligence community had surprisingly good information on Pyongyang’s involvement. The Obama administration has been surprisingly confident on the intelligence, and with a Republican Congress in place, initiatives from Washington are unlikely unless North Korea makes a bold move. KH: It seems that many conservatives in U.S. academia and some in political circles think that the world has no option but to encourage a regime change for the North to give up its nuclear arms. What do you think about this? Haggard: Regime change is a goal that we all share, but it is not a policy. Both conservatives and liberals in the U.S. would like to see North Korea change. The question is how. The current policy is trying to combine ongoing pressure, including purely defensive sanctions against proliferation, with an ongoing effort to convince North Korea to make a gesture of interest in serious negotiations. I don’t see most forms or pressure currently under discussion, such as increased sanctions, as having much effect. More attention is ― and should be ― given to information strategies that allow North Koreans to have a more balanced picture of both their own situation and the diplomatic setting.KH: President Park Geun-hye of South Korea has been striving to lay the foundation for national reunification, which she said would bring about an economic bonanza. Do you have any advice on Korea’s preparations for reunification? Haggard: With Washington unable to move, the initiative on the peninsula needs to come from Seoul. I have argued that President Park should lift the May 24 sanctions. My reasons are somewhat different from those arguing for engagement with North Korea, however. President Kim Dae-jung argued for the separation of politics and economics, and this was farsighted. We should let private actors and NGOs decide what they want to do visa-vis the North, and force the regime there to make key strategic choices as well. Gaeseong is effectively subsidized, (The Mount) Geumgang (tour program) still sits under the shadow of the death of Park Wang-ja (a South Korean tourist shot to death in 2008). Aid can be offered, but commercial relations have the best likelihood ― even if limited ― of changing the nature of the North Korean economy. At some point, President Park will have to make this move, probably through (North Korea’s northeastern port city of) Rason.KH: Do you think in a tightly controlled police state like North Korea, there could be an uprising or revolt for democracy or anything to trigger a change in the current repressive governing system? Haggard: In general, I think the chances of rebellion from below are small. There are no independent social organizations, it is virtually impossible to organize because of deep surveillance and it is hard for opponents of the regime to operate from neighboring countries, such as China. The regime has also invested heavily in keeping residents of Pyongyang happy. However, we have seen low-level resistance to the repressiveness of the regime through market activity, listening to South Korean music and DVDs and so on. Under such circumstances, the public may become less tolerant and small incidents could trigger localized actions that push back against the regime and force it to moderate its behavior; this is what occurred in Tunisia.KH: Many believe increased economic exchanges and interdependence between the two Koreas would help them better understand each other, deter confrontation and encourage a flow of outside information into the tightly controlled hermit state. Do you agree with this? How do you think the two Koreas can step up economic cooperation? Haggard: I have long argued that our strategy toward North Korea should including “getting people in and getting people out” However, we also need to understand that this is a very long game and the effects will only be apparent over time. I think that more commercial interactions would help: it would put (South) Korean firms into direct contact with North Korean counterparts. It is important to understand that this does not currently occur at all in Gaesong, where relations between the South and North Koreans are tightly monitored. Wider commercial relations and NGO activity stresses the ability of the state to control over point of contact (to promote cross-border commercial interaction).KH: Out of personal curiosity, what was your motivation to study North Korea? And based on your longtime study of the country, what would be your definition of North Korea as a state? Obviously it is a unique state in many aspects. Haggard: My interest in North Korea began with the famine, and my book with Marcus Noland “Famine in North Korea: Markets. Aid and Reform.” I was mystified by how such deprivation could occur in the most rapidly growing region in the world, and ultimately found the answer in underlying characteristics of the regime itself. I then turned to the question of refugees, the external face of the North Korean tragedy, in my second book with Noland called “Witness to Transformation: Refugee Insights into North Korea.” When we launched that second book, we also initiated a blog ― blogs.piie.com/nk/ ― which has allowed me to communicate widely about the North Korea puzzle. But I think my main reason for continuing to work on North Korea is that it constitutes one of the great moral challenges of our time; I cannot think of a more repressive regime nor one in which the gains from even marginal reform or liberalization would be so great. Changing North Korea ― even at the margin ― would immediately affect the lives of over 20 million people. That is a substantial prize, and one worth arguing about.This is the seventh installment in a special New Year’s series of interviews with preeminent scholars on international politics and security. ― Ed.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sanctions banning inter korean economic ,seoul to lift its economic ,korea preparations for reunification haggard ,banning inter korean economic exchanges ,losing patience with north korea","['Seoul', 'north korean', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Sony Pictures', 'U.S.', 'Stephan HaggardIn', 'the Korea Herald', 'Stephan Haggard', 'North Korea', 'University of California , San Diego', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Geun - hye', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North ’s', 'north korean', 'the North ’s', 'Russia', 'China', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'korean', 'russian', 'Haggard', 'Korea Herald', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'North Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Marc Noland', 'south korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Russia', 'Kim', 'Russia', 'Nazi', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'korean', 'russian', 'China', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'the U.N.

In Seoul, Sherman was expected to meet Seoul’s First Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong on Thursday to discuss ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation on regional and global security, as well as to reaffirm the Korea-U.S. alliance on North Korea. She also plans to meet Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and visit the presidential office on the same day.

It was in reaction to last year’s survey ― jointly conducted by both ministries ― in which only 53.5 percent of students said unification was necessary, according to a Unification Ministry official. The survey also showed that 18 percent of teachers said their school does not have such lessons, the biggest reason being the lack of time. As of now, about 42 percent of schools that do manage to squeeze in the lessons only conduct less than two hours of the subject. Most of the unification education ends up being just perfunctory lessons, dominated by video watching and lectures ― 78.2 percent and 66.5 percent, respectively. The lack of expertise was another problem. According to the National Assembly Budget Office, only 55.2 percent of the unification lecturers have degrees related.Inviting someone who actually has in-depth knowledge of the communist country ― such as North Korean defectors and researchers who studied the case of German unification ― will ensure that the cited lessons are effective, said an official from the Education Ministry’s school policy division. “The duration of these classes is important, but even more crucial is the quality. We need to persuade students that unification is something that we really need,” he said. The ministry has not announced any penalty for schools that fail to deliver such education, but it is reportedly mulling using unification-related lessons as one criteria for assessing local education offices.If the officials reach an agreement on the new measure, it could be implemented as early as the first semester of 2015.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","percent of students said unification ,wednesday the unification ministry recently ,eight hours of unification education ,53 percent of students said ,officials said wednesday the unification","['the Unification Ministry', 'the Education Ministry', 'Unification Ministry', 'the National Assembly Budget Office', 'north korean', 'german', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.12118485  0.39450821

North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013. Pyongyang has called for the resumption of the six-party talks without preconditions following its third nuclear test in February 2013. But Seoul and Washington have insisted that the North should first show its sincere commitment toward denuclearization.The North offered on Jan. 10 to temporarily halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends its annual military exercises with South Korea this year, a proposal flatly rejected by Seoul and Washington.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Moscow received a positive signal from Pyongyang over the invitation for Kim. On Saturday, U.S. funded-broadcaster Voice of America reported, citing an email response from the Kremlin, that Kim is likely to accept the invitation. ""There is a possibility that Kim Jong-un could visit Russia in May, given the current frosty relations between North Korea and China,"" said the diplomatic source in Beijing. ""To my knowledge, North Korea has not given a final decision on whether to accept the Russian invitation,"" the source said on the condition of anonymity. The South Korean government is ""closely watching"" the development between North Korea and Russia, according to the source. North Korea is seeking to deepen both diplomatic and economic ties with Russia at a time when its political relationship with China remains frosty amid international pressure over its nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. Putin, who has been under intense pressure over the conflict in Ukraine, is also eager to bolster ties with North Korea in an apparent effort against America's pivot to Asia. Putin invited Kim to attend the May 9 ceremony during a meeting with Kim's special envoy in November. China is North Korea's main economic benefactor, but political ties between the allies remain strained, particularly after the North's third nuclear test in early 2013. In what many analysts believe was a message to North Korea, Xi paid a state visit to South Korea last year, breaking a long-standing tradition by Chinese heads of state of visiting Pyongyang before Seoul.Last week, China sounded positive about Kim's possible visit to Russia in May, with the Chinese foreign ministry saying, ""Such exchanges between North Korea and Russia will contribute to the peace and stability of the region.""

The state media gave weight to the news by saying that Kim called Col. General Choe Yong-ho, the commander of the KPA Air and Anti-Air Force, and Maj. General Choe Hak-song, chief of staff to the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, prior to the drill and handed them instructions for a combat flight drill. The media also lashed out at the South Korean government, which it claimed is doing nothing about the anti-Korea leaflets that activists regularly send to the North, saying the KPA and all other men are ""filled with the surging hatred"" at the ""vile human scum"" who slander in challenge to Kim's New Year's address. In his New Year's address on Jan. 1, Kim made a surprise remark that ""There's no reason not to hold the highest-level talks,"" alluding to a possible inter-Korean summit with South Korean President Park Geun-hye.

They had agreed to hold high-level contact between late October and early November during a surprise visit to South Korea by a high-powered North Korean delegation. But the North later backtracked on the deal in protest of the leaflets.For years, North Korean defectors in the South and conservative activists have flown propaganda leaflets to the North via balloons to help encourage North Koreans to eventually rise up against the Pyongyang regime.

It follows more than two months of pro-democracy protests, which failed to win concessions from the government on the way the city's next leader is elected, and ties in with concerns that civil liberties are being chipped away.Before Britain gave the city back to China in 1997 it offered Hong Kongers a special ""British National Overseas"" status to calm those worried about their future under Beijing's rule.Holders can enter the UK without a visa and get consular assistance abroad, but have no right to live in Britain.Around 400,000 Hong Kong residents hold the BNO passport and some are now calling on Britain to allow them residency as they seek to escape rising tensions.""It is an extra option for Hong Kong people -- it's a right they deserve,"" says Sampson Noble, a 30-year-old Hong Kong Chinese resident who runs the BritishHongKong campaign group.""I was born British,"" he added. ""It should not relate to my ethnicity.""The group's forum has 3,000 members and has sent letters to British lawmakers, as well as a statement to a UK parliamentary inquiry into Hong Kong's post-handover relationship with Britain.In that statement the group called Britain's stance ""discriminative"".""We were ruled for 156 years and we are being discriminated against,"" said Humphrey Lau, a campaigner for the group.""There is a feeling of being betrayed.""Popular Facebook page ""BNO Concern"", which also calls for right of abode, has 6,000 likes with users dismissing their status as ""rubbish"" and pushing for change.Twenty- and thirty-somethings are particularly frustrated, says political columnist Martin Oei. ""Young people are disappointed to see how Hong Kong is greatly affected by the 'Chinese way',"" he said.""People now want to think of a way out.""      - Desperate measure -   =====================   Before the handover, 50,000 selected Hong Kongers -- mainly white-collar professionals and civil servants -- were given British passports, but more than three million had to make do with BNO status.Signing up was optional and the status can be held alongside a Chinese passport. Applying was only possible before the handover, but holders can renew their BNO every 10 years for around HK$1,000 ($130).For 33-year-old Peter, a pilot, renewing his BNO passport is a desperate measure.""(It) is just like someone who is drowning would grasp whatever he can reach,"" he told AFP, saying the recent democracy protests spurred him to renew the document.The rallies were sparked by Beijing's insistence that candidates in the city's 2017 leadership vote must be vetted by a loyalist committee, which critics dismiss as ""fake democracy"".Attacks on outspoken media figures and the arrests of protest leaders have added to fears that Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status is eroding. Peter told AFP the failed protests proved ""how we are ignored by our government and how helpless we Hong Kong people are"". ""The BNO passport may save me one day, when Hong Kong is no longer a place for us and we cannot call ourselves Hong Kong people any more,"" he added.      - Saving face -     =================   Despite the growing calls, there is no sign that Britain will budge.""There are currently no plans to amend British Nationality legislation to give holders of BNO status the Right of Abode in the UK, or to extend the right to apply for BNO status,"" a consulate spokeswoman told AFP.Critics are sceptical that Britain would ever risk its relationship with China over Hong Kong. UK Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire suggested the strictly-controlled election offered by Beijing could be ""better than nothing at all"", as he gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry on Hong Kong last week. The creation of BNO status was itself widely seen as a bid to keep China happy by not offering Hong Kongers alternative citizenship. It also prevented an influx into Britain. ""The key was to save face on the diplomatic arrangements,"" says Chung Kim-wah, assistant professor of social science at Hong Kong's Polytechnic University.""The benefits for Hong Kong were not a primary concern.""Chung said young people's current discontent was ""embarrassing"" for China.The older generation are demanding change, too -- Hong Kong residents who served Britain as soldiers have taken their call for right of abode to the UK parliament. Unless large numbers of BNO-holders can ""create noise internationally"" there is little chance of change, says Chung.But for campaigners like Lau, there is no choice but to keep up the pressure.""If we stop it, we'll get nothing,"" he said.

There were no incidents linked to the threats.Nuclear officials said the information released by the group were noncritical data, but their laid-back response raised fears that hackers, including those with possible North Korean links, could target the nation's key infrastructure. South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it gets about 30 percent of its electricity supply, and is building several more.The commission also said it will establish legal frameworks covering all processes ranging from design to shutdown of a nuclear reactor to prepare for closing of aging reactors in the future.A nuclear security revision bill was passed by the parliament in December, but it has not yet gone into force.Under the law, new nuclear reactors must have a decommissioning plan in order to get an operation approval, and nuclear facilities currently operating need to submit such a plan within three years.Old reactors face growing pressure to shut down in the next decade, while nuclear officials try to extend their lifespan to meet the country's energy demand.The NSSC last week delayed a decision on whether to extend the operation of a 32-year-old nuclear reactor amid strong opposition from residents and civic groups over its safety, with the upcoming meeting scheduled for next month.The commission said it will set up 20 more radioactive detectors at the nation's ports to toughen control over imported cargo and to require importers of recycled steel to submit safety check certificates.In August, South Korea returned some steel scrap imported from Japan due to radiation contamination, the first such action since Seoul heightened nuclear safety monitoring in 2012 after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.As part of efforts to root out corruption in the nuclear industry, the watchdog plans to adopt a special investigatior system to better monitor parts suppliers and officials.""To prevent corruption such as fake certificates for nuclear parts, (officials) should be able to conduct on-site investigations,"" Kim Yong-hwan, a senior commission official, said. ""(The commission) will adopt the special investigation system to step up monitoring activities."" Some 100 officials in the local nuclear energy industry were charged with corruption in 2013 after they were found to have issued safety guarantee certificates for substandard parts that were used in nuclear reactors.

The leaflets were designed to make North Koreans aware of the brutality of the dictatorial regime.The move came after the Seoul government requested last Thursday that the group refrain from sending the balloons in consideration of the safety of the residents in border areas.“There appears to be little sincerity (in its intentions to improve cross-border ties) given that the North demanded the cancelation of the annual South Korea-U.S. military drills following Seoul’s offer of dialogue,” Park Sang-hak, the head of the activist group Fighters for a Free North Korea, said during a press conference in central Seoul.Saying that his group would stop floating the leaflets until before the Lunar New Year holiday next month, Park stressed, “It is now time for Pyongyang to answer Seoul’s calls for inter-Korean dialogue.”Also joining the press conference was Thor Halvorssen, president of the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation. Some HRF members participated in Park’s campaign to send the leaflets to the North on Monday night.Halvorssen said his group hoped to send 100,000 copies of “The Interview” to the North. He also said his group, along with other activists, had been exploring various ways to more effectively deliver the leaflets to North Koreans such as using unmanned aerial vehicles. Seoul reiterated its stance against forcibly regulating the cross-border distribution of the leaflets, saying it would take due steps only when the leaflets posed a “clear threat” to the security of the residents in the border region.“Our stance on the distribution of the leaflets remains unchanged. It is about the basic right to the freedom of expression and we cannot forcibly regulate it. It is for the civilians (to decide whether to stop the distribution),” said a senior Seoul official, declining to be named.“We will take necessary steps only when there is a clear threat to the security of the residents in the border areas. We will continue to call on the groups (sending the leaflets) to make careful decisions,” he added without elaborating on the steps.Park of the activist group FFNK told the media that unless the Seoul government makes a formal written request, rather than a verbal one, his group would continue to send the leaflets to the North. Seoul officials said that the government was not considering issuing a written request. The HRF also vowed to continue launching the balloons.“Kim Jong-un’s regime, displaying the hallmarks of narcissism and psychopathy, threatens activists with death and tries to bully the international community by saying that it will halt dialogue unless these balloons are stopped,” said Thor Halvorssen in a statement.“We are an independent civil society organization made up of individuals devoted to nonviolence, education and the defense of human rights, especially freedom of speech and assembly. These rights are nonnegotiable,” said Halvorssen.Inter-Korean tension over the leaflets has escalated at a time when the two Koreas’ attempts at dialogue have been shelved due to Pyongyang’s insistence on pursuing nuclear development and provocative rhetoric and behavior.Pyongyang has persistently demanded that Seoul block the spread of the leaflets, and warned that the mood for inter-Korean dialogue will be broken should the activists continue to send the leaflets, which it says insult its highest authority.Last week, a news report said that the North had completed drills to “devastate” the South Korean border areas from which leaflets were sent.

His comments were released by the finance ministry here.In the case of the FTA with China, the government will establish a comprehensive utilization plan to make it possible for companies to take full advantage of the agreement once the pact is approved by lawmakers, Choi said.The official on several occasions had stressed that the FTA with Beijing will not only help trade, but fuel inbound investment from abroad.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister for economic policies, added that the country needs to take steps to ensure that the signing of so-called mega FTAs, such as the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, does not compromise the national interest.""There is a need to take a more active part in the TPP talks,"" he said.

On the other hand, sluggish growth predicted for Japan, Europe and emerging economies could adversely affect overall trade.    Other efforts this year include reaching open trade pacts with partners in the Middle East, Latin America and Central Asia.The government is planning to announce a new policy roadmap next month to help expand corporate presence in emerging markets.Besides these areas, the official said the country's economy must become stronger and better insulated to cope with any shocks coming from outside.Macro-fiscal health must be maintained along with around-the-clock monitoring of overseas risks so the country can pro-actively react to external threats and developments, he said.To help local firms make inroads into overseas markets, Choi said more attention needs to be placed on tackling climate change. A comprehensive overseas ODA (official development assistance) plan will be announced in February that can help South Korean firms win projects that use funds provided by the aid program.

Currently, the amount of spare time for soldiers is not fixed and depends largely on their unit.""We are going over measures to give the soldiers four hours from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. during which they can take their meals, wash up and clean their barracks on their own without the presence of a duty officer,"" an official said.The idea is to create a kind of routine similar to that of a regular worker outside of the military so that soldiers can also ""leave the office"" and get off work, the official added.In addition, the defense ministry is also mulling assigning one soldier per living compound chosen through voting to supervise the group during those free hours. The selected soldiers will be in charge of nightly roll calls, although bed checks will still be carried out by duty officers.The latest plan is one in a series of reform measures put out by the defense ministry following several deadly incidents of bullying and violent practices among enlistees.Earlier in April last year, an Army private first class died after suffering from persistent physical and mental abuse by his senior comrades. About two months later, an Army sergeant went on a shooting spree in a separate incident, killing five, after allegedly being bullied by his colleagues.In a country facing North Korea across a heavily secured border, all able-bodied South Korean men are sent to compulsory military service for about two years. Conscripts mostly in their early 20s account for a large portion of the country's 650,000-member military.

North Korean leader Kim demonstrated his desire to hold a “top-level meeting” with the South and restore cross-border ties in his New Year’s address. But Park requested that the communist state show its commitment first, as a series of previous proposals have ended in failure. President Park Geun-hye speaks at a Cabinet meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. (Yonhap)“I was glad to hear that North Korea demonstrated its will to promote inter-Korean talks and exchanges in the New Year’s speech,” she said. “I believe it is important for North Korea to show its sincerity and action at this point in time.”Park’s request was seen as a test of whether Pyongyang is truly committed to talks with the South. She wants Pyongyang to accept Seoul’s offer first to hold ministerial talks in January to discuss a wide range of issues including the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.However, questions remain about whether North Korea would hold talks with the South, amid escalating tension with the United States. The U.S. imposed new economic sanctions Friday against Pyongyang in retaliation for its alleged cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.Last year, the two Koreas had agreed to hold high-level talks. But the North turned down the deal suddenly in protest against anti-Pyongyang leaflets sent by North Korean defectors in South Korea. The North has also demanded that the South halt its annual military exercises with the U.S. as a prerequisite for inter-Korean talks. Seoul has remained firm, saying that it has no plan to suspend the joint drills.Reiterating the significance of holding a cross-border dialogue this year, the president urged the North to work together with the South to usher in “the era of unified Koreas” and to put an end to the “tragic division” of two Koreas. This year marks the 70th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan. Under the influence of two foreign powers, the United States and former Soviet Union, Korea was divided soon after it was liberated from Japanese rule in 1945.At the Cabinet meeting, Park ordered officials to make efforts to revitalize the nation’s economy and accelerate the drive to reform both the public and private sectors. She also vowed to complete the reform of the civil servant pension system within her term. Her presidency ends in early 2018. However, she remained silent about the prosecution’s investigation into a leak of documents involving her former aides. The prosecution concluded on Monday that a police superintendent who worked as an intelligence officer at Cheong Wa Dae fabricated the so-called “Chung Yoon-hoi documents” and delivered them to the president’s brother under the instruction of his “direct superior” Cho Eung-cheon. Her senior press secretary told reporters earlier in the morning that the investigation had revealed that a few people within the presidential office “rocked the nation” because they had “ulterior motives.”By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","dialogue last week north korea ,presiding over weekly cabinet meeting ,hye on tuesday urged pyongyang ,hold summit talks north korean ,weekly cabinet meeting at cheong","['Park Geun - hye', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Cabinet', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Yonhap)“I', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'Sony Pictures Entertainment', 'Koreas', 'anti - pyongyang', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'Koreas', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'the United States', 'Soviet Union', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Cabinet', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Cho Eung - cheon', 'Cho Chung - un']",1,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.58394831  0.49621567
