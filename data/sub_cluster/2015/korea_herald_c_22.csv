The year had already been riven with conflicts over education, ideology, labor and other social issues that are likely to continue in the coming year.Social division is expected to only deteriorate as the nation enters major elections, starting with the April 13 general election, which is shaping up as a prelude to the 2017 presidential race. A major economic downturn alongside soaring government and household debt would further dim prospects of the country reconciling its ongoing conflicts. Participants in an antigovernment rally march in Seoul on Dec.5., protesting the government’s labor reform measures and reintroduction of state-authored history textbooks. (Yonhap)Protests are expected to continue over the Dec. 28 Korea-Japan agreement on settling the comfort women issue “irreversibly.” Groups representing the victims have vowed to fight on with the opposition parties joining the bandwagon of lambasting the government for the rushed negotiation that did not reflect the demands of the victims.The agreement amplified the surging dissatisfaction mainly among the younger and more progressive constituents against Cheong Wa Dae, which has continued to face criticisms of oppressing freedom of expression, retrogressing democratic processes and monopolizing decision-making procedures.The main opposition party’s bungled struggle to scrape together the support of dissatisfied moderates is also expected to dent its fortunes. At best, it will bolster alternative political forces’ stature. At worst, it will swell the number of those apathetic about politics. Education-related standoffs will become an issue from the get-go, as the government had been warning of the “child-care crisis” that will result in the failure of the Nuri program, which subsidizes kindergarten and day care centers. Local education offices have been refusing to allocate budgets for the program, expected to cost 2.1 trillion won ($1.8 billion) for 2016 alone, saying that the law states regional education budgets only cover educational facilities, under which day care centers do not fall.But another giant confrontation is being heralded concerning the Park Geun-hye administration’s much-disputed flagship education policy of reinstating government-issued history textbooks for secondary education. Professors from major universities including Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University and Hanyang University have refused to participate as authors in protest, and the government has said they will keep the identity of participating authors under wraps to protect them from criticism. The textbook war stems from the left-right standoff over views of Korea’s modern history. Evaluation of conservative political figures such as ex-President Park Chung-hee -- the incumbent leader’s father -- and Rhee Syng-man --- the country’s founding president -- along with descriptions about Japan’s 1910-1945 colonialization of Korea and depiction of communist North Korea has been one of the most hotly contested issues in Korea. State textbooks were one of the main rallying points behind the three massive antigovernment rallies of November and December in 2015, but the other pillar of the protests was the contentious labor reform. Park had bemoaned, denounced and even threatened the National Assembly -- particularly the opposition -- for failing to pass bills that would allow her labor reform bills, accusing them of being “a proxy for the privileged.” The five-point law revision encompasses reduction of working hours, improvements in benefits for the unemployed, adopting the “wage peak” system, expanding sectors that employed temporary workers and extending the working period of temporary workers.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, led by Han Sang-kyun who was arrested for leading illegal rallies, is among thousands of workers who, along with the opposition, say the reform will prolong the time of workers’ nonguaranteed contracts. They have also raised concerns that the new bill allowing companies to dismissed underperforming employees will allow “easy firing.”The government maintains that the reforms will improve labor conditions, such as by providing more jobs for young people via the wage peak system. The Finance Ministry said on Dec. 23 that implementing the wage peak system at state-run organizations has created over 4,000 new jobs. Park, who linked the high unemployment rate to the low birthrate, said that the older generation should “concede” to the younger generation.But Park’s rhetoric unwittingly touched on another thorny issue: intergenerational conflict that had emerged amid the economic slump, differences in political views and a shift in values.As Korean society has traditionally had its roots in Confucian values, respect for elders had been among the most important elements. The younger people are practically mandated to use different language and wear different attire when addressing elders. But frustration over the economic slump, intensified by the sense of deprivation, has driven the younger generation away from the older generation. According to Lee Shin-hye, a member of the Seoul city council, the Seoul Metropolitan Government allocated just 80.6 billion won for youth-related policies, while spending 1.2 trillion won on those aged 65 or older.The derogatory term “noseulachi,” a combination of “no” for old and “byeseulachi” for government official, represents the hostility youngsters have built toward the elderly.In a survey of 1,000 Koreans aged 13 or over, conducted jointly by the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion and local daily DongA Ilbo, 79.6 percent of respondents said Korea suffered from “severe” conflict between the older and younger generations. Over 60 percent of those in their 20s and 30s said they perceived elderly citizens in a negative way, citing stubbornness, obsession with the past and a supposed lack of respect for younger people.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","presidential race major economic downturn ,massive antigovernment rallies of november ,2017 presidential race major economic ,race major economic downturn alongside ,the textbook war stems","['Japan', 'Seoul', 'yonhap)protest', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'group', 'Nuri', 'Seoul National University', 'Korea University', 'Yonsei University', 'Hanyang University', 'Korea', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Rhee Syng', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'the korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Han Sang - kyun', 'the Finance Ministry', 'Park ’s', 'korean', 'confucian', 'Lee Shin - hye', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Koreans', 'the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion', 'DongA Ilbo', 'Korea']",13,"[ 3.          2.          1.         ... -0.41116136  0.42848158

The online survey, conducted by the Global Times, published by the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, found that 95 percent of 10,686 respondents say the deal between South Korea and Japan on wartime sex slaves ""can't"" apply to China. The remaining 5 percent say the deal ""can"" apply to possible talks between Japan and China in resolving the issue of Chinese victims who were forcibly mobilized at front-line Japanese military brothels during World War II.Under the deal with South Korea announced on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologized to the Korean victims and Tokyo agreed to provide 1 billion yen (US$8.3 million) to a fund for the victims.The deal, hailed by both South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Abe, paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to solve one of their thorniest issues. The deal was in line with diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama to form a united front with South Korea and Japan against China's increasingly assertive behaviors and North Korea's defiant pursuit of missiles and nuclear weapons. While the deal was welcomed in Washington, China's state-run media cast a wary eye on the deal, calling it insincere. According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea but also China and other parts of Asia, were coerced into sexual servitude at front-line Japanese brothels during World War II.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles delving into the reality and the country’s efforts to restrain the violence. This is the second installment. --Ed.It wasn’t too hard for Yoon Eun-ji -- not her real name -- to find out that her senior colleague had been bullied by one of the executives of her company earlier this year. It wasn’t difficult because the board member made it very clear that she was not happy with her pregnant colleague.“The executive humiliated her in front of everyone,” said the 29-year-old, who works for a local conglomerate. “She yelled at the pregnant woman. One of the things the executive said was that there was no reason for her to ‘suffer’ because of the colleague.”Yoon later found out that the reason why the female executive, in her 50s, was upset was because she received a disciplinary measure from the human resources department for overworking the pregnant employee. Under Korea’s labor laws, it is illegal for employers to make pregnant workers do night shifts. Workplace bullying against women is often linked to pregnancies and maternity leaves in South Korea. (123RF)The pregnant worker, who had no choice but to stay late in the office to finish her assigned tasks -- the company does not allow employees to take their work home for security reasons -- never reported her boss to the authorities. The human resources team found out through the company’s time-tracking system, which automatically calculates each worker’s time spent at work as they clock in and out.“My senior colleague ended up taking her maternity leave earlier than scheduled, mostly because of the stress (due to her relationship with the executive),” Yoon said. Alarming statistics The case of Yoon’s colleague reflects South Korea’s workplace harassment that is getting more rampant, complex and cruel. According to a report submitted to the National Assembly by the Korea Women’s Development Institute earlier this year, 16.5 percent of 4,589 surveyed Korean workers said they have been harassed at the workplace at least once in their lives. The state-run think tank claimed that the rate is about 1.5 times higher than the world’s average proportion of victims, which is about 10 percent.Some of the most high-profile workplace harassment cases in Korea include the “nut rage” incident, in which the former Korean Air vice president Cho Hyun-ah ordered a departing jet from New York to Seoul to return to the terminal gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport, after being dissatisfied with the way a flight attendant served her nuts on the plane last year. “There are many factors behind Korea’s workplace bullying situation,” said Lee Myung-sun, head of the KWDI, in her open letter to the Assembly, stressing that women and contract workers are some of the most vulnerable to the violence.“The (Korean) work culture that emphasizes competition and productivity, the increasing number of temporary and contract workers with limited job security, as well as the nation’s long work hours and hierarchal work relationships together contribute to this problem.”Among the surveyed Koreans who said they had been harassed at work, 58.4 percent said they were purposely given too much work, while 48.5 percent said they were constantly monitored by their employer to a degree where they felt an invasion of their privacy. Also, 44.1 percent said they have been purposely given work that was too easy as an insult, while 43.2 percent said they had been assigned to do a task that was either beyond their capabilities or control. Forty-one percent also said they had been either verbally insulted or humiliated at work. Meanwhile, 68.5 percent of the harassed participants said they were attacked by their bosses, while 32 percent said they had been harassed by their clients. Also, 31 percent said they were bullied by the executives of their companies.Other research reports have shown that the situation may be more serious. In a survey by the Korean Finance and Service Workers’ Union of its 3,065 members in June, 48.8 percent said they had been bullied at work. A 2012 survey by Saramin, an online recruitment website, showed 45 percent of the 2,975 working Koreans who participated had a coworker who was bullied. Among them, 61.3 percent said the bullying problem was very serious, and 58.3 percent said they saw a colleague quit after being bullied.Rep. Lee Jasmine of the ruling Saenuri Party said not many Koreans are aware that workplace harassment is a systemic problem. “The ‘nut rage’ incident has brought the issue of workplace harassment into the limelight,” she said. “But many Koreans still consider it as personal conflicts with people at work, rather than as potential illegal activities or a systemic problem.”Gender and job security A number of studies have shown that women, young employees and contract workers are more vulnerable to workplace harassment than those with full-time positions and male employees in Korea.A report by KWDI released last week, which surveyed 1,000 female workers in the nation’s service sector, showed that 45.9 percent of those working under a contract have experienced workplace harassment. Meanwhile, 29.2 percent of the workers who work full-time have endured the same. The report also showed that the younger workers were more vulnerable to workplace abuse. Among the surveyed, 46.3 percent of those in their 20s said they had been harassed at work, compared to 30.3 percent of those in their 40s and 36.5 percent of those in their 30s.In a 2014 study by Seo Yoo-jeong from the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, 85.7 percent of the victims who participated in her research said their perpetrators were men, while only 9.6 percent of them said they were attacked by women at work. According to a 2011 research by local law firm Korean Public Interest Lawyers’ Group, which surveyed 1,633 women employees, 60.6 percent said they had been sexually harassed at work at least once in their lives. Last year, four full-time workers at Seoul Grand Park, a park complex run by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, received disciplinary action after it was revealed that they had been sexually and verbally harassing a female contract worker who was hoping to get a full-time offer at the time.The victim was junior to the four perpetrators -- three male and one female. Among the abuse she experienced included being forced to attend drinking gatherings and enduring unwanted touching and sexually explicit jokes. The victim, when reporting to the city government’s human rights office, said she did not resist in part as she was desperate to get a full-time position.The KWDI report also mentioned a sexual harassment case at Renault Samsung Motors, where a female employee was sexually harassed by her male superior for over a year starting in 2012. The report claimed that the victim and those who supported her faced additional harassment at work after her boss received a disciplinary measure from the company following her report to the authorities. According to the report, the human resources department spread false rumors about the victim, claiming she purposely seduced the perpetrator, a married man, first, and that sexual harassment in fact never happened, but she fabricated the facts to falsely report him. The victim, whose work performance had been stellar prior to the case, received poor grades in her work evaluation after she reported her boss. She was also abruptly told not to pursue the projects that had been originally given to her prior to the case, and instead assigned to do errands such as purchasing office items. One of her coworkers, who openly supported her when the victim reported the perpetrator, was also demoted allegedly for no specific reason and received very poor work evaluation.Workplace bullying against women is also often linked to pregnancies and maternity leaves. Last year, the Korean Health and Medical Workers’ Union revealed that among its 1,902 female members -- all nurses -- who are or have been pregnant, 17.4 percent have been encouraged by the employers to avoid pregnancy or get pregnant at a certain time so their maternity leaves do not coincide with their co-workers'. Also, 21.9 percent said they had to endure night shifts while pregnant, although the law prohibits it, and 18.7 percent experienced either miscarriages or stillbirths because of work-related stress and long work hours.  According to a 2011 research by a local law firm, which surveyed 1,633 women employees, 60.6 percent said they had been sexually harassed at work at least once in their lives. (123RF)In 2012, a former bank employee won a suit filed against her employer and coworkers, who bullied her after returning from a year of maternity leave. The banker, who had been in charge of accounts and mostly worked as a teller before taking the break, was asked to be an usher instead when she returned. Her desk was gone, and as an usher she had to stand the whole time. When she confronted her boss, he told her: “I no longer consider you as my employee. If you feel this is unfair, you should take the case to Cheong Wa Dae.” The KWDI report showed that her boss told all of the employees to “cooperate” in isolating her in the office, so she would eventually give up and quit. The victim suffered depression because of the experience.Labor issueIn October, representatives from labor, management and government reached an agreement that permitted employers to fire underperforming workers in exchange for hiring more full-time workers. Meanwhile, a number of bills to tackle workplace bullying have been proposed since 2013, but are currently pending at the Assembly.Lawyer Lee Jong-hee from the Korean Public Interest Lawyers’ Group, who also filed a report on the situation of workplace bullying to the Assembly, said limited job security resulting from being more vulnerable to getting fired may create more abuse cases at workplaces. “When you are on the verge of losing your job, you can’t report your boss for abuse,” the lawyer said in the report. “Research has shown that women workers are more unstable in the labor market and the change may make them even more vulnerable to workplace bullying than before.”Among the 360,000 who joined the temporary workforce in Korea over the past decade, 89 percent were women, according to the KWDI. Also, female temporary workers earned only 36 percent of full-time male workers’ average salary last year.“(Korean) women are constantly exposed to sexist behavior when they are in the workforce,” Koo Mi-young from the KWDI. “For example, married women are still often expected to do housework even they are working, while their husbands are simply expected to ‘help out’ when they can, rather than fully share the responsibilities. Such experiences can make women unaware of the problems, and make them incapable to recognize even when they are harassed by someone else.”Lawyer Lee said the laws should try to protect every worker’s dignity. “We need to talk about the system that makes it almost impossible for many workers to live with dignity,” the lawyer said in the report. “We need to talk about the system in order to tackle this issue (of workplace harassment).” Last month, Rep. Lee In-young from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy proposed a bill that newly defines workplace harassment and therefore make them punishable by the laws. It includes spreading malicious rumors and gossip that is not true; removing areas of responsibilities without reason for more than six months; insulting or criticizing a person persistently or constantly; assigning unreasonable or useless duties which are unfavorable to the person; and excluding or isolating someone socially at workplace. The bill also stipulated that in all lawsuits that involve workplace bullying, the accused must prove their innocence while the plaintiff does not have to prove the damages they suffered.However, along with a number of other bills tackling the issue, Rep. Lee’s proposal is currently pending at the National Assembly.According to a report by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training released in June, a single workplace bullying case can cost a company up to 15.5 million won ($13,300), as it negatively affects the workers’ productivity and mental health.A number of countries, including Finland, Belgium and Canada, have legislations about workplace violence and harassment. In France, the Supreme Court held that it is an employer’s obligation to prevent workplace bullying and therefore renders them liable for bullying committed by their employees.

Job ads are displayed on a board in a college in Seoul. (Yonhap)Comparatively, only 5.1 percent of middle-school graduates and 22.9 percent of high-school graduates were classed as NEET.The report said that Korea tended to show higher NEET ratio among those with higher educational backgrounds, whereas other similar countries tended to show a high NEET rate among those with less education.In France for instance, the NEET ratio by education level is 19.0 percent (middle school graduates), 17.6 percent (high school graduates) and 11.0 percent (college graduates).The report suspected that many Korean NEETs have not given up on looking for jobs but are studying in nonregular education institutions such as national examination academies to find better jobs. “The reason Korea shows higher number of college graduates in NEET groups is that the well-educated young people tend to seek quality jobs by lengthening their job-hunting time,” report head Lee Man-woo said. The NEET numbers also include those preparing for state-run tests such as for public servants and bar exams.Overall, 18.5 percent of Koreans aged between 15 and 29 (regardless of education level) were NEETs, coming in at 8th after Turkey (31.3 percent), Greece (28.5 percent), Spain (26.8 percent), Italy (26.1 percent), Mexico (22.3 percent), Hungary (20.5 percent) and Slovakia (19.1 percent).The report divided the NEET into two -- those without jobs who are looking for employment and those who are economically inactive and are not seeking jobs.

The Administrative Court dismissed the steelmaker’s request to revoke the Environment Ministry’s action to allocate a set amount of carbon credits to the company. This is the first verdict released over the controversial carbon credit quota after a number of companies filed lawsuits against the state to nullify the carbon credit move earlier this year. In December last year, the government gave a certain quota for carbon credits to 525 companies, including 84 petrochemical firms, ahead of the opening of Asia’s first-ever carbon trade market in January this year. If companies exceed the emissions allowed, they are mandated to purchase the carbon credits. The business sector, however, has complained about the insufficient quota, claiming the ministry allocated only 80 percent of carbon credits they had requested. Earlier this month, the Korean government pledged in Paris to cut emissions by 37 percent from the expected business-as-usual level by 2030. The industry has raised suspicion over the efficacy of the carbon credit trading system. As of this month, the total trading amount in the market recorded 0.8 percent of this year’s allocated amount of carbon credits -- 543 million tons, officials said.

According to OECD Better Life Index released this year, 2.09 percent of people reported falling victim to assaults and other types of crimes last year, less than the OECD average of 3.9 percent. It ranked sixth in terms of safety among the surveyed 37 countries. Gari L. Baki, police chief of Papua New Guinea, talks to a Korean police official at an outdoor exhibition held to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Korean police on Oct. 21, at Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul. (KNPA)Korea established a “K-cop center” in April as part of its efforts to spread its policing techniques and know-how in various fields covering public safety, scientific investigation and cybercrimes to mostly emerging countries, according to the police. This year alone, the Korean police offered training to 189 officers from 25 countries including Indonesia and Guatemala, to share the nation’s policing system, field experiences and counterterrorism intelligence. The investment for “K-cop wave” projects has soared, with the number of Korean police officers and crime experts dispatched abroad having risen ninefold from 10 in 2014 to 89 this year. The budget also increased fivefold to $20 million over the four years. The police aim to send a total of 300 South Korean cops and experts abroad by 2018, the police said. On the back of the heightened interest in Korean policing, the country has seen a rise in exports of police gear including smart cars equipped with IT technology, water cannons and riot shields. Korean firms sold police gear worth $171 million abroad from 2005 to 2014, with the exports worth $58 million as of September. The government will provide financial assistance through the nation’s international cooperation agency of nearly $20 million to Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Philippines by 2018 to build policing infrastructure there. As Kim Jong-yang, commissioner of the Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency, was elected as one of the two vice presidents for Interpol executive committee, the police will also dispatch skilled officers to Interpol to help nurture policing capability for those from all over the world. “I think that Korea has become known for its exports of superior policing system and equipment to countries around the world, which we call ‘K-cop wave,’” said Kang Sin-myeong, general commissioner of the Korean National Police Agency. Exporting Korea’s policing skills, coupled with enhanced cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, could benefit Koreans abroad, he expected.“We plan to expand the Korean Desk to seven more cities in the Philippines and dispatch Korean investigators to the crime scene so that we can help Filipino police officers swiftly probe cases involving our citizens,” Kang said. Following a string of crimes targeting Korean nationals in the Philippines, the police launched a “Korean Desk” in 2010, setting up two offices in the two major cities of Manila and Angeles. The desk is aimed at better protecting its citizens abroad by dispatching Korean investigators to work together with Filipino authorities in criminal cases involving Korean nationals. In the last four years, a total of 38 Koreans were murdered in the Philippines where about 100,000 Koreans reside. According to the police, they plan to set up the Korean Desk in Vietnam next January. They are in talks with Indonesia to start one, too. The police chief said he has asked Japan and China to create a trilateral committee with Korea to bolster cooperation in policing, though both neighboring countries seem to be cautious in taking the proposal forward.

From autopsies and fingerprint recognition to DNA and psychological analyses, the Korean police have improved over the years.Korea Crime Scene Investigation agents demonstrate how they secure evidence and investigate a crime scene. (Yonhap)Among the technologies that have been developed, the advancement of fingerprint analysis is especially noticeable since its introduction to Korea in 1984.Fingerprints often provide crucial clues in many criminal cases. Over 120 distinguishing points exist on a single fingerprint. The police can identify a suspect with just 12. In June last year, Korea’s fingerprint recognition technology played a major part in a high-profile case. When the de facto owner of Sewol ferry Yoo Byung-eun -- who absconded after his ship sank off the southwestern sea in April, killing 304 -- was found dead in a remote village in South Jeolla Province, there were doubts whether the badly decomposed body was actually his.Simultaneously, with tooth identification, the police conducted a “high temperature-moisturizing method”-- which instantly expands fingers in 100 degree Celsius water so the fingerprints can be secured using adhesive fingerprint tape. The police were successful in securing one fingerprint.This advanced fingerprint technique was introduced by Korean police officer Yoon Kwang-sang in the early 2000s. It was widely recognized in 2004 when Yoon and some agents were dispatched to Thailand to support the relief operations during the Indian Ocean tsunami tragedy. They were able to identify 18 victims with this method.Yoon, who later acquired a patent for the “high temperature-moisturizing method,” received the top scientific investigation award from the police in 2014 in recognition of advancing scientific investigation technology. Since 2013, the Korean police have annually provided training on the fingerprint analysis to forensic experts from Bahrain and Guatemala, and the technology is also exported to countries such as the U.S. for use by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the police.In Korea, the police have identified 1,157 bodies out of 3,032 mysterious deaths in the last five years with the fingerprint analysis method, the police said.Hand in hand with such advanced technologies, criminal profilers also play a crucial role in solving high-profile cases, especially in finding serial killers. Criminal profilers are criminologists who psychologically analyze a suspect’s behavior and motive for clues. In many cases, their work involves screening separate criminal cases and looking for a connection.Although patience, sharp observation and ability to meticulously analyze a suspect’s psychological mind are essential for profilers, there is one attitude that is crucial when questioning suspects, experts say.“Whenever profilers question suspects, they should not be dominated by a psychological game with suspects. Unless profilers have a firm belief and standards about good and evil, they can get confused over the difference between right and wrong in the game when listening to suspects,” said Bae Sang-hoon, the head of police studies at Seoul Digital University. Bae was one of the first profilers recruited by the government in 2005. He worked as a profiler until 2010. The role of profilers was not widely recognized until the murderer of 20 women over years, Yoo Young-chul, was caught in 2003. Yoo’s premediating plans and cruel murder methods raised public calls for the police to expand the pool of profilers.According to the police’s data, 26 profilers work across the country as of this year. They have tackled more than 2,200 criminal cases from 2011 to September this year. As crime skills evolve, the police’s focus is also changing. The government, nowadays, is injecting efforts to preventing cybercrimes, which are increasing in the country. As of last year, Internet fraud topped cybercrimes with some 56,600 cases, followed by online financial fraud with 15,600 cases. The government launched an anti-cybercrime department last year. It also expanded the number of officers with expertise in digital forensic science, computer programming and engineering. “The investigation skills are evolving with the changing profile of crimes. Internet crimes are growing in Korea, which has a well-developed IT infrastructure. Digital forensic technology has also developed, such as in decoding and analyzing seized hard drives or securing electronic evidence,” said Lee Soo-jung, forensic psychology professor at Kyonggi University.

The 37-year-old claimed he was seeking national interest as the conflict-ridden country has a lot of sales opportunities.The court, however, ruled that the damage he could have incurred by getting involved in a dangerous situation is much larger than the profits he would have brought to the country by selling local products. It also pointed out that the company's sales outcome does not have a direct relation to national interest.In 2007, 23 South Koreans were abducted by the Taliban while traveling unescorted in Afghanistan on a medical aid mission.

It brought together leaders from more than 140 countries, including U.S.President Barack Obama, as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The conference is set to run through Dec. 11 to try to produce a deal that will be applicable to all countries and seeks to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.""The Paris conference is not the final destination. It is a new beginning,"" Park said. ""Let us rally together for a new climate regime.""Still, negotiations do not appear to be easy as some countries are at odds over funds needed to tackle climate change.Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that a new climate deal must include a clause on financial assistance to developing countries by advanced countries and that advanced countries must keep their promise to create US$100 billion each year.A total of 184 countries -- which account for 94 percent of global emissions -- have put forward climate targets for post-2020.In June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it lets business run as usual.Park vowed to spearhead efforts to cut carbon emissions through new energy industries and meet South Korea's climate target.South Korea's southern resort island of Jeju ""will transition into a carbon free island by replacing its entire fleet of cars with electric vehicles and meeting 100 percent of its energy needs through renewable energy sources,"" Park said.She also said net zero buildings will be mandated in phases and large plants will eventually be transformed into smart factories that harness information and communications technologies.""These efforts will enable us to unlock a new market in the neighborhood of US$100 billion by the year 2030 and generate some 500,000 jobs,"" Park said.She also vowed to join discussions to set up a global carbon market with enthusiasm, saying the market for carbon will ""no doubt play a critical role under the new climate regime.""Also Monday, Park called for collaboration among countries to help make clean energy widely affordable.""No single nation can, on its own, succeed in tackling climate change and innovating clean energy technology,"" Park said in the text of her speech posted on the website of Mission Innovation.""More countries should join Mission Innovation to share their technologies and conduct collaborative research in promising new fields,"" Park said.

Some 500,000 Koreans are expected to have traveled there by the end of this year, according to the Indonesian Tourism Ministry, which held a press conference in Seoul last Tuesday. “As Korean tourists prefer outdoor activities, they have flocked to Bali and Lombok on honeymoons, family trips and golf tours,” Indonesian embassy minister Cecep Herawan told journalists. Tourism generates 5 percent of Indonesia’s gross domestic product, employing over 10 million people. To entice over 10 million tourists this year and 20 million by 2019, the government has upgraded infrastructures, hospitality services and promotional programs.Korean golf lovers have increasingly visited the archipelago’s 140 golf courses, spectacularly nestled between beaches, mountains and townships, said Noviendi Makalam, the international marketing director at the tourism ministry.  Noviendi Makalam, the international marketing director at the tourism ministry. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldBintan Resort Cakrawala group general manager Abdul Wahab said: “Most international travelers are familiar with Bali, but our Riau Islands could rival Bali in offering.” Bintan Island, part of the Riau Islands Province in western Indonesia, was developed 20 years ago. Only an hour from Singapore by high-speed boat, travelers can get the best of Singapore’s cosmopolitan culture and Bintan’s tranquil nature in a package covering the neighboring island of Batam. During weekdays, five ferry trips connect Singapore and Bintan, with 10 trips on weekends. Some 2 million people come to the Riau Islands from Singapore each year. Bintan also offers incentives for conferences and exhibition facilities. “If you are planning a wedding, do it in Bintan,” Wahab highlighted, adding that visitors will get a once-in-a-lifetime experience on the picturesque island. Wahab turned attention to the removed clearance approval for foreign yachts entering Indonesia, stressing that it would benefit the 700,000 expatriates in Singapore, including a large number of Koreans. In Bintan, visitors can enjoy diving, snorkeling, scuba diving and jet skiing, as well as ride elephants, go hiking, take in the sights from a small aircraft, tour ancient sites and relax in spas. Bintan has 15 hotels in operation and 20 under construction. Bintan Lagoon Resort has Ian-Baker Finch and Jack Nicklaus golf courses; Ria Bintan Club Med and Spa has 310 rooms and a 27-hole Gary Player golf course; and Laguna Bintan and Nirwana Gardens has hotels, spas, restaurants, villas and beach clubs. The Plaza Lagoi shopping center sells traditional handicrafts and food. Visitors come to Bintan by sea, but an airport is currently being constructed to be operational by mid-2018, offering direct flights to Korea. Indonesia has five international airports ― Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta, Ngurah Rai in Bali, Kuala Namu in Medan, Juanda in Surabaya and Hang Nadim in Batam ― in addition to seaports across its string of islands.

According to Statistics Korea, the suicide rate in Seoul stood at 24.7, meaning 24.7 Seoul residents in 100,000 committed suicide last year, as the nation’s average suicide rate was 27. By age group, Seoul citizens aged 60 or over had the highest suicide rates, with 50.3 seniors taking their own lives last year alone. The suicide rate for those aged 45 to 64 was the second highest at 31.9, followed by those aged 25 to 44 at 27.9 and those aged 15 to 24 at 10.4.Poverty among the elderly has been blamed for the growing rate of senior citizen suicide here. According to the Korea Labor Institute, 48.6 percent of the country’s elderly were living in poverty in 2014, defined as living off of 50 percent or less of median household income.Experts have also pointed out that the elderly who commit suicide mainly fall into two groups: those who do not want to burden their children with financial issues and those who grow estranged from their families as they get older.By district in Seoul, those living in Jungnang District, one of the poorest districts in Seoul by household income, saw the highest suicide rate at 35.7, while residents in Seocho District, one of the richest districts in Seoul, saw only 15.3 people in 100,000 having killed themselves last year.According to Seoul Metropolitan Government, Gangnam District was the richest among 25 districts in Seoul, collecting 104 billion won ($89.9 million) in income taxes, while Jungnang District raked in only 3.6 billion won. Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicate that Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among its 34 member countries, with 29.1 Koreans per 100,000 people taking their own lives, compared to the OECD average of 12.1.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","suicide rate in seoul stood ,suicide rates with 50 seniors ,income saw the highest suicide ,highest suicide rates with 50 ,100 000 committed suicide last","['Seoul', 'Statistics Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Labor Institute', 'Seoul', 'Jungnang District', 'Seoul', 'Seocho District', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Gangnam District', 'Seoul', 'Jungnang District', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'OECD', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",2,"[ 0.          8.          0.         ... -0.64595568  0.56203228

We are finally back to the supersonic age,"" he told reporters as he inspected the ""Golden Eagle"" jets.Gazmin has said the aircraft could serve as both trainers and fighters, and that among the areas they would be posted will be the western island of Palawan, the country's closest point to the South China Sea where the Philippines has a territorial dispute with China.China claims most of the South China Sea even up to the coastline of its neighbours. Other countries have conflicting claims and the Philippines has been the most vocal in opposing China despite its overwhelming military superiority.The cash-strapped Philippines, which is also battling internal communist and Muslim insurgencies, has long neglected external defence, relying on ageing ships and aircraft to patrol the disputed waters.It retired the last of its supersonic fighter jets, US-made F-5 Freedom Fighters, in 2005 due to their age and since then has relied on propeller-driven planes and the Italian-made S211.The S211s are intended for training new pilots and are not capable of supersonic flight. But the military has been forced to use them for other roles such as patrolling territory and conducting bombing missions on insurgents.However, as the country's economy improved, Philippine President Benigno Aquino has been upgrading the military, acquiring two surplus frigates from the United States and new aircraft from different sources.","country return to supersonic fighter ,military acquiring two surplus frigates ,two fighters flown from seoul ,the country return to supersonic ,supersonic fighter jets us made","['Philippines', 'AFP', 'Philippines', 'south Korean', 'China', 'Manila', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'philippine', 'US', 'Clark', 'Defence', 'Voltaire Gazmin', 'Gazmin', 'Palawan', 'Philippines', 'China', 'China', 'Philippines', 'China', 'Philippines', 'muslim', 'US', 'Italian', 'philippine', 'Benigno Aquino', 'the United States']",0,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.67868656  0.33224893

The World Talent Report 2015 by the Institute for Management Development said South Korea came in at 54th among 61 economies across the world in terms of its employees’ motivation at work. Asia’s fourth-largest economy also saw a serious outflow of local talents, landing at 18th among the surveyed economies in terms of human capital flight. According to a 2014 survey by the state-run Institute for International Trade of 320 local candidates and graduates for masters and doctorate degrees, 73.1 percent of them responded they would be willing to look for employment abroad, with 90 percent of them saying they would certainly take a job abroad if it were offered. Half of them cited their desire to acquire advanced knowledge and technology behind the decision, while 48.6 percent of them responded seeking higher salary and 37 percent pointed to the unstable job situation here. The majority took issue with the closed, stiff office culture and long work hours in Korea’s research and business environment. South Korea’s business environment appeared to be less friendly to foreign talents, sitting in the 37th spot in terms of drawing highly skilled foreign workers to the country. The data showed that the country’s senior managers lacked international experience and its employees had insufficient foreign language skills. According to 2013 government statistics, the number of Korean students overseas stood at 144,000, 2.5 times more than the number of foreign students in Korea. The least affected country by the brain drain was Norway, which was followed by Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and the United States. The Switzerland-based management institute conducted a survey of business executives from 61 economies, including both the China mainland and its special administrative region Hong Kong, asking them about their perception of competitiveness in each nation. In the overall ranking, South Korea stood at 31st this year, up nine notches from a year earlier, and its highest in a decade. Among the three main factors in the ranking, the country placed 32nd in both investment development and its appeal to highly skilled workers worldwide, while snatching 31st place in terms of readiness to accept talents. Looking into details, the country received high scores in terms of personal income tax (13th), growth rate in the labor force (ninth), health infrastructure (16th) and 15-year-olds’ academic performance in PISA tests (fourth). But it fared poorly in female labor force participation (47th), pupil-teacher ratios in primary and secondary education (26th and 28th, respectively), cost of living (56th) and quality of life (40th). Switzerland topped the list for nine years straight, with northern European countries ― Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands ― rounding out the top five. The United States came in at 14th, with Japan’s ranking at 26th and China at 40th. Singapore was the highest ranked Asian country, taking the 10th spot. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","work asia fourth largest economy ,students in korea the least ,asia fourth largest economy ,senior managers lacked international experience ,asia fourth largest economy also","['South Koreans', 'swiss', 'the World Talent Report', 'the Institute for Management Development', 'South Korea', 'Institute for International Trade of 320', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Norway', 'Switzerland', 'Finland', 'Sweden', 'the United States', 'Switzerland', 'China', 'Hong Kong', 'South Korea', 'PISA', 'Switzerland', 'european', 'Denmark', 'Luxembourg', 'Norway', 'Netherlands', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'China', 'Singapore', 'asian']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.73159629  0.57693642

They deserve to be validated as pioneers in the history of Korea’s women, the Korean Nurses Association said.At least 33 female nurses and midwives fought for Korea’s independence at home and abroad from 1907 to 1945, according to the association. But only 13 of them have been awarded the Order of Merit for their works. The group cited a study organized by professor Kang Young-sim at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. According to Kang’s research, some 3 million Koreans, including nurses, worked as independence activists during the colonial era. However, only 13,000 of them have been recognized by the Korean government as people of national merit. Among them, only 241 are women.   Korea`s first nurses Kim Martha (right) and Lee Grace (Korean Nurses Association)In her research, Kang summarizes the lives of two nurses, who devoted their lives to independence activism after working as nurses. One of them is Park Ja-hye (1895-1943), who became a nurse after spending the first 10 years of her life as a child maid in the royal palace. She decided to become an independence activist after treating many patients who were injured while participating in the March 1st Movement, one of the earliest public displays of Korean resistance against the Japanese rule in 1919.To become more involved, she moved to Beijing, where she met her future husband and fellow independence activist Shin Chae-ho. After marrying Shin and giving birth to their first child, Park was forced to move back to Korea alone, as the couple was financially struggling. She was pregnant with her second child at the time. In Korea, she supported her husband’s activism in China, while fighting poverty and raising her two children alone. Shin died in 1936 while serving time in prison in Korea. In the same year, Park’s second child, who was 14 at the time, also died. Park died in 1943, two years before Korea was liberated.The other nurse described in professor Kang’s study is Jeong Jong-myeong, who was forced to quit her studies and get married at age 17 because of poverty and was widowed at age 19. Instead of living with and serving her in-laws, which was the norm for Korean widows at the time, she chose to become a midwife and became involved in the nation’s independence movement.In 1927, she established a women’s rights group called Geunwoohoe, which also functioned as an independence activism group. As a member, she also wrote for an independence magazine and gave speeches on women, labor and poverty.Since 2008, the KNA has been researching prominent Korean female nurses in history, especially those who also worked as independence fighters and those who were sent overseas, such as to Germany, during South Korea’s rapid economic development in the 1960s and ’70s. It’s also been also demanding the government build a special museum dedicated to the history of Korea’s women. The National Assembly approved the notion in 2013 and the current National Women’s History Exhibition Hall is scheduled to be renovated into a museum.Kim Ok-soo, director of the Korean Nurses Association, said learning about the history of Korean nurses resonates with today’s women.“During the colonial rule, almost all Korean women lacked access to education and were therefore illiterate,” she said. “They were not allowed to make their own life decisions. “But many of the nurses went against the social norms in spite of their class status and gender. They were the very first Korean women who voluntarily chose to have a specialized career that required very specific skills and training, while fighting for Korean independence.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","researching prominent korean female nurses ,korean female nurses in history ,midwives fought for korea independence ,are women korea first nurses ,prominent korean female nurses","['South Korea ’s', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'the Korean Nurses Association', 'Korea', 'Kang Young - sim', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul', 'Kang ’s', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Kim Martha', 'Lee Grace', 'Korean', 'Kang', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Beijing', 'Shin Chae - ho', 'Shin', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'China', 'Shin', 'Korea', 'Park ’s', 'Korea', 'Kang', 'Jeong Jong - myeong', 'korean', 'Geunwoohoe', 'kna', 'korean', 'Germany', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly', 'National Women ’s History Exhibition Hall', 'Kim Ok - soo', 'the Korean Nurses Association', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Claire Lee']",12,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.15929781  0.441789

Despite rapid changes, education has been criticized for failing to foster the talent that can most effectively contribute to society.Steven K. Lee, the newly appointed president of George Mason Korea, says higher education institutes need to be at the forefront in leading society, rather than taking a backseat, by providing a network through which students can accumulate invaluable experience that better prepares them for the challenges of the real world. “There has to be an interactive process in cooperation between colleges and government agencies,” he said. “I think it’s high time now that education take the lead and say we have highly prepared students in certain fields so the companies and government agencies make policies based on what is available: the (human) resources.” Steven K. Lee, the president of George Mason University Korea, speaks during his inauguration ceremony at the Incheon Global Campus concert hall Thursday. (eorge Mason University Korea)George Mason Korea takes advantage of being located in Songdo, Incheon, where offices of various international companies and global bodies reside. The university expanded to Korea in March 2014 at Incheon Global Campus, where three other foreign universities ― State University of New York, the University of Utah and Ghent University ― have set up Korean campuses. But the most distinct merit of Mason Korea, Lee pointed out, is that Korean students can access the U.S. curriculum without leaving the country. Because of this, students can maintain a connection with the local community and do not have to readjust to Korean culture when they graduate, as students who study abroad do.“Adjusting to (the culture of) Korea-based companies is pretty tough. We (as a university) are in a position where students are able to become fully bilingual and bicultural,” he said.By taking on a more active role ― instead of maintaining a passive approach ― Lee said students are able to make the jump from the classroom to contributing to society with greater ease. Lee, a U.S.-educated scholar who replaced interim chief Joy Hughes as the institute’s head, said that George Mason Korea is implementing various efforts to ensure students receive such a boost on campus, one of the key words being “experience.”“The traditional method of education is academic, test-centered and goal-oriented,” he said. While such experience encompasses cognitive and intellectual learning in the classroom, education must also provide experience outside the classroom, namely engaging in societal and community services, he said. “I want the students to fully utilize the time they have in college so that they are well prepared not only intellectually, but psychologically and mentally as well.”The mental preparation of students centers on what Lee called the “three C’s”: confidence, competency in discipline or profession and compassion for humanity. “I think it begins with confidence in oneself. Once you have that confidence, you can grow from that confidence to go and care for the world,” he said. Once one has sustained a certain level of confidence, along with competence in his or her respective field, then the student can become passionate about humanity, he explained. In a bid to provide experience that aids in fostering such values, Lee said George Mason Korea encourages students to engage in internship opportunities available to students of all grades via multiple memorandums of understanding with major organizations. These institutions include multinational organizations like the World Bank, the United Nations, Green Climate Fund, local firms like Kookmin Bank and education institutions like Chadwick International.“Being a college is an opportunity for us to network with the society. We cannot exist in isolation. We have to be able to blend in with people of organizations around us,” he said.George Mason Korea currently runs economics, management and global affairs programs, and plans to add conflict analysis and resolution, accounting and finance, system management and other courses in the near future. As much as activities outside the classroom matter, learning opportunities provided inside the classroom matter in students’ development, Lee stressed. “One of the key attractions and resources for GMU as a system is innovation. GMU Korea is no exception,” he said, explaining the university is set to move into a new seven-story building to be completed by the end of this year. The central theme of the structure would be to provide classroom experience rooted in integrated technology. The technology installed in the classrooms ― which the new president boasts the university has invested more effort in than any other part of the school ― will open doors to interactive lessons with not only students and lecturers at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, but also with partners across the globe.Just as it is important for schools to procure technology for smart education, having the proper lesson plans conducted via technology is crucial to achieving smart education, Lee said. “Having the perfect platform is one, how you use technology is equally as important. After all, learning is about human experience,” he said. “Beyond what, it is how.”But as George Mason Korea ventures into all the opportunities rolled out by the state-of-the-art technology, Lee stressed that the university has to be discreet about planning. This is to ensure that the new education methods do not become mere fads that fade into obscurity after a few years, but are established into long-term strategies. The key to achieving this, he said, is to recognize diversity in what students seek to accomplish via education, and cater to their respective needs by utilizing different methods of teaching.Lee claimed that the merit of George Mason Korea is not confined to the curriculum and faculty ― more than 50 percent of whom are from the Fairfax campus ― but also in the student body itself. “We have students from more than 20 different countries, based on where they attended secondary school. Global diversity in the classroom is a value that cannot be bought,” he said. Earlier this year, a local lawmaker complained that foreign education institutes in Korea have too many Korean students. Lee, however, pointed out that contrary to what the students’ lineage may suggest, most of the students at his university, even Koreans, have global backgrounds, contributing to diversity.“We live in a global world now. Many of us are more bicultural,” he said. “More individuals who are described by the experience, not by the origin of birth.”The diversity in its classrooms is the edge George Mason Korea has over even some of the prestigious colleges and universities, he said. “U.S. universities expect students to perform in an American way. We don’t bring that attitude here. When students come here, they are able to be supported by diversity.” The institution’s goal now, Lee said, is to utilize the unique position it has as a Korea-based U.S. university. “We are classified as American institution, but how we practice it has Korean elements. Our existence here is to balance the best practices of Korean education and American education, because no country’s education is perfect,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","rapid changes education ,new president boasts the university ,interactions despite rapid changes education ,the new education methods do ,despite rapid changes education","['Steven K.

Seven of them fell in critical condition but survived, while 49 died from the side effects.The report came out about three months after South Korea’s Health Ministry announced its plan in August to boost its clinical trials industry, to attract multinational clinical research organizations, as well as pharmaceutical and medical device companies to initiate their trials and partnerships here. 123RFAs of last year, South Korea ranked seventh in the world in the number of clinical trials conducted, making up 3.12 percent of all trials worldwide. The government aims to rank No. 5 by 2020. Back in 2007, the country ranked 19th in the world. By city, Seoul ranked first in the world in 2013, followed by New York and Houston. A total of 1.04 percent of all clinical trials in the world were conducted in Seoul that year. The city is a popular destination for multinational pharmaceutical companies, such as GSK, for its research infrastructure and government support for clinical trials. Last year, the Korean government approved a total of 652 clinical trials, 607 in 2013, 670 in 2012 and 503 in 2011. Chae Jin-byung, a 24-year-old university student, participated in his first paid clinical trial back in 2012. He had to stay as an inpatient at a hospital, taking drugs for high blood pressure three times a day for two days. For that, he was paid about 400,000 won ($341). “I was busy with extra-curricular activities and my schoolwork,” he told The Korea Herald. “There was an emergency and I needed cash immediately. Taking part in clinical trials seemed like a great option. I’d earn about 50,000 won a day by doing other part-time jobs, such as handing out flyers.”Since then, Chae has participated in such trials two more times. One was for drugs for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the other for steroids. Although he did not experience any adverse effects during and after his hospital stays, he doesn’t remember being informed about potential risks of the trials, either. “I was simply told that since these drug aren’t ‘completely’ new, nothing is going to go wrong,” he said.Dr. Jeong Hyung-joon, the director of the Association of Physicians for Humanism, claimed that the government plans to deregulate the industry by sharing the personal information of participants in paid trials with pharmaceutical companies. “This is inhumane,” he said through PSPD.  “Many of those who participate in such trials are those with low income. Many do it without adequate information.”According to PSPD’s research, which surveyed 1,187 young Koreans in their 20s, 16.3 percent of them have engaged in dangerous part-time jobs, such as multi-level marketing, voice phishing and clinical trials. Among them, 35.8 percent they did it because they needed money urgently, while 26.4 percent said it was an easier and faster way to make money. Meanwhile, 18.1 percent said they did it to pay off their university tuition as soon as possible. “The government should do more to inform the public about possible adverse effects instead of promoting them as if nothing can ever go wrong,” said Jeong. University student Chae said he had been encouraging his friends to participate in trials to make easy money. “But after listening to what PSPD found, I don’t think I’ll ever do it again,” he said.

The Mahayana school of Korea’s Buddhism ― one of two main branches alongside the Hinayana school ― was introduced to the ancient Kingdom of Baekje (B.C. 18-A.D. 660) in 384 by monk Maranatha, native of Gandhara, the historical records say. The triangular tract largely to the west of the Indus River and bounded to the north by the Hindukush Mountains includes the Peshawar Valley, Taxila, Swat, Dir, Buner and Bajaur. In ancient times, it was a religious melting pot of Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and Hinduism, whose coexistence was encapsulated in coins, sculptures and paintings. From left: Pakistani Embassy secretary Anna Kim, Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation managing director Kabir Ahmad Khan and Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan speak at a press conference on Nov. 9 to promote the Gandhara Civilization. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldIn an effort to showcase the region’s trove of treasures, the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation and the Tourism Ministry will hold the International Celebrations on Gandhara Civilization and Buddha Heritage in March next year. Buddhist monks, scholars, followers and journalists from Korea, Japan, China, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan and Thailand will tour the holy sites in Taxila, Swat and Northern Areas.To help promote the event in Korea, the Pakistani embassy organized a press conference on Nov. 9 that invited the country’s Buddhist communities, media and academia. Monk Jukgyeong of the Bonginsa Temple in Namyangju City, Gyeonggi Province, who visited the region in October 2014, recalled his experience. “What I saw was the mankind’s first ‘fusion culture,’” he told the participants. “It was apparent that Gandhara combined different civilizations’ ideologies, cultures and arts to a great degree, as I saw in one artwork the Greek mythological hero Hercules being portrayed as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism.”(From left) Monk Jukgyeong of the Bonginsa Temple, Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan and the National Buddhist Council for the Security of Korea president Lee Gun-ho. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldHistorians claim that the invasion of regional center Taxila by Macedonian King Alexander the Great in B.C. 326 led to the marriage of Hellenic and Buddhist cultures, which gave birth to the Greco-Buddhist art and the Mahayana Buddhist religion. Under the Indo-Greeks and the Kushans, the hybridized culture connecting the Occident and the Orient flourished in Gandhara before spreading southward to India, according to researchers. The Greco-Buddhist art also advanced northward to Central Asia, strongly influencing the art of the Tarim Basin, before reaching China, Korea and Japan.As an example, scholars claim UNESCO World Heritage List item Seokguram Grotto, which is part of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, is inspired by Gandharan art. Some highlight similarities between Korea’s gilt-bronze “Pensive Maitreya Bodhisattva in Meditation” and bronze statue “The Thinker” by French sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917). Both works show men immersed in contemplation with their right arms resting on their knees ― the posture that harks back to Gandhara’s Bodhisattva sculptures.A diagram showing similar Buddhist sculptures by Professor Park Kyo-soon of Fatima Jinnah Women University in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.“Gandhara is a wellspring of research for soul-searching,” Jukgyeong said. “It is my hope that we see through these objects of art Buddha’s message: the love of humanity over divinity.” Mahayana Buddhism is today the world’s largest denomination with more than half of practitioners in Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam, Tibet, Malaysia, Mongolia, Bangladesh and other countries. Meaning “the Great Vehicle,” the school’s central tenet aspires to carry humanity from disorientation to enlightenment through learning.The region’s noted remnants include the first written manuscripts of Buddha’s teachings; Buddhist learning centers for Chinese pilgrims, monks and scholars; the Yogacara school, which trains the mind and consciousness; and the world’s oldest university in Taxila, dating back over 2,700 years.To this day, timeworn stupas, shrines and courtyards stand to represent the holy land of Buddhism. In particular, the familiar image of Buddha ― with his gracious facial expression, hair tied in a bun and body wrapped in monastic robes ― is unearthed.As an offshoot, the Bodhisattva sculpture, capturing Buddha’s exuberant youth before enlightenment, clads the holy figurine in lavish jewelry, headwear, loincloths and sandals, contrasted with the austere portraits of his post-metamorphosis state. Monk Jukgyeong of the Bonginsa Temple (center). Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldProfessor Park Kyo-soon of Fatima Jinnah Women University in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, said: “Korea’s underlying heritage comes from Buddhism, which comes from Gandhara. In today’s localized world, Gandhara can be a lynchpin for globalizing our culture and Buddhism.” Citing unmistakable resemblances in artifacts, dresses and folk melodies between Gandhara and Korea, Park stressed that the region could serve as an alternative channel for understanding Korea’s far-flung origins. Pakistani Ambassador Zahid Nasrullah Khan said: “We want to build cultural bridges with the Korean people. We want to inform our Korean friends that we have similar cultures, and also thrive on our diversities.”He added, “Seeing is believing. You must visit Pakistan to experience our warmth, friendliness and hospitality.” Aside from the religious treasures, the region boasts a wealth of ecotourism assets, including countless mountain peaks over 7,000 meters, glaciers, valleys, lakes, deserts, rivers and beaches. Some 100 Korean climbers visit the rocky mountains of northern Pakistan annually, and more than 500 Korean businesspeople work in the country.

That statement, at least in terms of finding employment and the lengths the young people go to find “respectable” jobs, may be true. For some time now, internships have been a “standard” part of a job seeker’s resume, along with a good alma mater, high GPA, unnecessarily high English language scores, and a whole list of other qualifications.  (Bloomberg)And interns are everywhere. From newspapers and television stations to state-run companies and financial institutions, organizations in almost every field hire students and graduates as interns for varying lengths of time. For the employers, interns present a well-educated and eager workforce at low cost -- although they lack professional training. Large companies have also taken to hiring foreign interns, those who study here as well as from abroad, in an attempt to attract a wider range of potential new employees. For many Koreans college students, an internship is the only way to experience the “real world” before they become job seekers upon graduation. Internships also help students who are less clear about the career path they want to take. However, what began as an opportunity to learn, is taking strange turns on the part of all those involved; the interns, employers, and even the student interns’ universities. In a society that values education above almost everything else, many qualifications and certifications have lost much of their capacity as standards for discerning the able from the less able. As such, internships have become a new tool used by students and job seekers to distinguish themselves from the competition. Many undertake several internships before graduation, while most have one or two internship experiences under their belts on graduation. Even universities, which are meant to be bastions of knowledge, appear to have jumped on the bandwagon, rather than encouraging students to strive for knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Some universities not only encourage students to take time off for internships, but have made it a requirement for graduation. Despite criticism that universities are becoming vocational schools whose sole purpose is to aid the student in finding employment, such policies are welcomed by others. While many universities operate internship programs on reasonable terms, some require students to pay tuition if they want academic credit for the time they spend as interns. Even if a student takes a full semester off to undertake an internship. “It felt like they are selling credits. I interned last year, and although I worked the regular hours at the office and didn’t go to a single lecture during the semester I still had to get a student loan,” a student studying in Seoul said declining to be named. For graduates hoping to turn an internship into full time employment, the realities of being an intern are often laced with desperation and worry. Those interning at companies that use internship programs as recruiting tools are put through grueling schedules and intense competition. At the end of it all, only a lucky few gain the coveted prize -- employment. A significant chunk of companies that took on interns this year did not even specify whether the program offered a chance of being hired at the end. According to data released by the presidential committee on youths, about a third of intern recruiting ads did not provide any related details. “I thought I was going to be hired, but after eight months I was told that I had to take the entrance tests just like everyone else,” a 28-year old surnamed Choi said.

It seized $726,000 in proceeds from the sale of their residence in California and $500,000 in investment bonds.The move came after the prosecution launched a special investigation team in 2013 into the former military leader’s hidden money in a bid to reclaim illegally accumulated assets. In 1997, Chun, who rose to power in a military coup in 1979, was convicted on a number of charges, including bribery, and was ordered to return to the state 220 billion won ($190 million) he earned through kickbacks during his presidency from 1981 to 1988.The prosecutors confiscated half of the original amount over the past decade as the National Assembly passed a bill extending the statute of limitations on seizing assets from government officials who had failed to pay fines. The statute of limitations on Chun’s case was extended to 2020. The law also allowed the prosecution to collect the fine from his family members instead of Chun himself if the asset was proven to be originated from his illegally earned funds. The former dictator, who resides in western Seoul, drew the public ire as he refused to pay the money, claiming he was broke, despite the news reports on his family leading a life of luxury here and in the U.S. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","tuesday that the government finalized ,million he earned through kickbacks ,former south korean president chun ,1988 the prosecutors confiscated half ,south korean president chun doo","['the Justice Ministry', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'South Korea', 'the U.S. Justice Department', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'U.S.', 'Loretta Lynch', 'the U.S. \xa0 Justice Department', 'Washington', 'the U.S. Justice Department', 'California', 'Chun', 'the National Assembly', 'Chun', 'Chun', 'Seoul', 'U.S.']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.24102847  0.38309196

This installment looks into China’s threat perceptions and its military strategy and modernization. -- Ed.China’s “strategic culture” is a complex mixture of Confucianism, the revolutionary aspect and the West’s realist streak, raising uncertainties over its possible responses to security threats including one related to the ongoing South China Sea disputes, according to China expert Park Chang-hee.Professor Park Chang-heeStrategic culture refers to the orientation of a country’s perceptions and preferences regarding the use of force and its overall security stance.China’s historical experiences including its communist revolution and wars with Western forces have made its strategic culture “unstable and unpredictable,” the military strategy professor at Korea National Defense University said during a recent interview with The Korea Herald.“It is difficult to simply define China’s strategic culture in which these three elements clash together. The problem is the unpredictability of the strategic culture. Even Chinese cannot fully grasp their own strategic culture,” he said.“China could be confused about whether it should take a more generous approach in line with the Confucian strategic culture, or a tough stance in line with the revolutionary strategic culture.”Touching on the heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, the scholar did not rule out the possibility of a direct military clash between the major powers.“Should this war of nerves between the two persist, we cannot rule out the possibility of a military conflict. We witnessed a clash in April 2001 when the U.S. surveillance aircraft collided with China’s fighter jet off Hainan Island, causing the death of a Chinese pilot.”The following is the interview with professor Park.Korea Herald: What are your views on China’s perception of military threats?Park Chang-hee: China issued a 2014 defense white paper, entitled “China’s Military Strategy” in May this year. The document adopts a new expression -- “military strategic guideline of active defense in the new situation” -- in place of the previous term -- “military strategic guideline of active defense for the new era.” This change reflects a shift in China’s perception of the security landscape. The “new era” in the previous term refers to China’s pursuit of the operations of its forces under high-tech conditions. But the “new situation” refers to neo-hegemonism, power politics and neo-interventionism (which the white paper singled out as new threats). Here, neo-hegemonism means the strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance, while power politics refers to the U.S.’ military rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific region and neo-interventionism to the U.S.’ intervention in maritime disputes involving the East and South China Seas. China appears to be concentrating on these issues as focal points for its construction of military power.KH: Since 1985, China has pushed for its military modernization. What have been the key points of the modernization scheme?Park: In 1985 when Deng Xiaoping presided over a session of the Communist Party’s Central Military Commission, there was a shift in China’s perception of warfare. Before then, China’s military prepared for a possible all-out, impending nuclear war. But at the CMC session, Deng and senior party members shared the recognition that the possibility of such an all-out nuclear war was little. Thus, they began pursuing the doctrine of “local wars” whereby China sought to secure its interests along its peripheral regions. A local war is of short duration that is a geographically limited yet of high-intensity. To pursue the doctrine of local wars, China should have elite forces equipped with high-tech weapons. But for the doctrine, China just reduced its troops by some 1 million and sought to enhance jointness among the armed services. But the Gulf War (in 1991) -- which some called the first space war -- came as a shock, underscoring the yawning technological gap between the U.S. and China. Since then, China started pursuing the technology-focused construction of military power in a departure from the manpower-centric strategy. Accordingly, the military doctrine of “local wars under high-tech conditions” emerged in 1993. As the world has moved into the era of informationization in the 21st century from the industrialization era, China has been transitioning to informationized warfare from mechanized warfare. In 2004, China’s defense white paper set its military objective as winning “local wars under informationized conditions.” Local wars under high-tech conditions means mechanized warfare in the industrialization era, while local wars under informationized conditions is informationized warfare.Under the military strategic guideline of active defense in the new situation, China will be preparing for local wars under informationized conditions until the mid-21st century, namely 2050. This objective was presented in the 2006 defense white paper. What this means is that China is pushing to secure military capabilities equivalent to those of the U.S.KH: A series of the military events have driven China’s projects to alter or improve its military strategy, doctrine, force structure, training and so forth. Those events include the Gulf War in 1991 and the Taiwan Straits Crisis in 1995-96 to name a few.Park: Yes, the Gulf War made China cognizant of the importance of the high-tech weaponry. But in the early 1990s, China focused on preparing for contingencies along its periphery rather than for an emergency involving the U.S. But after the Taiwan Straits Crisis, China pursued a shift in its military strategy, and the management and acquisition of weapons. During the crisis, the U.S. sent two aircraft carriers, which was quite a shock to China. Since then, it started to prepare for military operations with the potential clash with the U.S. in mind. China’s military preparations proceeded in two ways. Firstly, China has pursued the doctrine of local wars under informationized conditions to catch up with the U.S. based on the recognition that an emergency on its periphery could involve not only neighboring states but also the U.S. Secondly, China has sought to develop the “A2/AD” (anti-access/area-denial) strategy, which is an asymmetric military strategy. China would not pursue the A2/AD strategy for good. It is pushing for the A2/AD strategy as it is lagging behind the U.S. military power. Thus, its pursuit of the strategy is an inevitable choice. KH: China appears to be employing an offensive maritime strategy as it seeks to shift its focus to “offshore waters defense” to the combination of offshore waters defense and “open seas protection.” What would be the impact of this on the regional security?Park: China’s strategy can hardly be called offensive. It is almost impossible for China to execute an offensive strategy against its major competitors, the U.S. and Japan. If you call a strategy offensive, it should be aimed at extorting something from its competitors or anything to that effect. Thus, it is appropriate to call China’s strategy defensive. But it is not to say that there is no offensiveness at all in its strategy, or that it is not seeking to bolster its offensive capabilities. As China rises as a major power, it cannot help but strengthen its military power to protect growing national interests. In this respect, China has been trying to build its capabilities in the realms of sea, air and space. In the 2014 defense white paper, China used the expression, “open seas protection” that goes beyond the “offshore defense” that it has stuck to for two decades. This indicates that China would advance farther into the ocean in the future. The problem here is that even though it takes a defensive strategy, China would not make any concessions vis-a-vis core interests and could use force (to protect them). The core interests involve Senkaku Islands, Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, Taiwan and even North Korea.  KH: Tensions have spiked in the South China Sea with the U.S. conducting freedom-of-navigation operations. What would be the likelihood of a military clash between China and the U.S.?Park: China’s defense white paper said the seas and oceans bear on the enduring peace, lasting stability and sustainable development of China. It also made it clear that it would strengthen its maritime military readiness to secure its interests. In line with this, China has apparently been constructing artificial islands in the South China Sea and deployed military assets there. The U.S. has said in response that China’s moves ran counter to the international law and would not be helpful for the regional stability. Should this war of nerves between the two persist, we cannot rule out the possibility of a military conflict. We witnessed a clash in April 2001 when the U.S. surveillance aircraft collided with China’s fighter jet off Hainan Island, causing the death of a Chinese pilot. A clash may not escalate into a full-blown military conflict, but such a war of nerves would undercut mutual trust and dampen the mood for cooperation that was forged during their summit in September.KH: How would you describe China’s strategic culture? Park: China’s strategic culture is based on Confucianism. Under the Confucian strategic culture, war is a means that is to be abhorred and should be used in an inevitable situation as a last resort. When a war breaks out, the scale and duration should also be minimized. This traditional strategic culture is different from the modern West’s notion about warfare. The West regards war as a means to achieve political objectives and the execution of warfare as part of political activities. This means that war is not a subject to be abhorred, but a justifiable means to achieve political goals. This is what differentiates the West’s notion from that of Confucianism.But China experienced a communist revolution, which has implanted a very extreme realist strategic culture in China. Through the revolution, China has come to see warfare as a means to achieve political goals -- a just and rational means to root out feudalism and imperialism.The problem is that after China succeeded in its communist revolution and established the People’s Republic of China in 1949, another strategic culture emerged. That came as China engaged in the international war and accepted the West’s strategic culture. That means a modern-day limited warfare aimed at securing national interests.As a result, China’s strategic culture is now an intricate mixture of Confucianism, the aspect of the communist revolution and the West’s strategic culture. Thus, it is difficult to simply define China’s strategic culture in which these three elements clash together. The problem is the unpredictability of the strategic culture. Even Chinese cannot fully grasp their own strategic culture. It is hard to know which cultural aspect could figure prominently in what case. In case of the South China Sea disputes, China could be confused about whether it should take a more generous approach in line with the Confucian strategic culture, or a tough stance in line with the revolutionary strategic culture. China could be grappling with its identity of strategic culture. In this respect, China claims multiple identities. For example, at the U.N. Security Council, China acts as a major power, while at a climate change conference, China claims to be a developing country.KH: Chinese leader Xi Jinping has announced the plan for a reduction of 300,000 troops. What is your view on the troop drawdown?Park: Before China renounced its concept of the imminent, all-out, nuclear war in 1985, China maintained some 4 million troops. As it pursued the doctrine of local wars, China curtailed its troop level by 1 million from 1985-89, then 500,000 from 1997-2000 and then 200,000 from 2003-05. Now, the number of the troops stands at around 2.3 million. China’s military modernization is the biggest reason for the troop reduction. As the military is getting mechanized and informationized, what has become crucial is not the number of the troops but the quality of its forces. Secondly, it is about jointness among the armed services, which has created the synergic effect. Enhanced jointness has allowed the military to eliminate the overlapping functions. The military has also sought to remove its roles that caused inefficiencies such as the socialist military establishment’s traditional function of employment.KH: How do you think the Sino-U.S. military competition will unfold?Park: China’s military can’t be a match for the U.S. yet. It can’t be for some two to three decades. Thus, China can’t think of a scenario of its military clash with the U.S. for the time being. But this does not mean that China would bow to the U.S.’ military threats. Therefore, it is taking a strategic approach to deal with the U.S.China’s strategy is formulated based on its analysis of the U.S.’ vulnerabilities. First, it knows that it would take some period of time for the U.S. to prepare for a war. In the case of the Gulf War, it took some five months of preparation. Secondly, it would also take time for the U.S. to deploy its military assets to a battle zone. Of course, the aircraft would come soon, but the aircraft carrier group or warships can’t arrive right away. Thirdly, China is aware that the U.S.’ war is susceptible to domestic public opinion.Thus, China believes it would win in a conflict should it effectively block the U.S.’ military power. Based on this belief, China has been pursuing the A2/AD strategy, and focusing on developing weapons systems required for the strategy. The problem for the U.S. is that neighboring states can raise doubts over the U.S.’ security commitment to them as the A2/AD strategy poses a threat to the U.S. Thus, the U.S. is pushing for its military rebalancing to maintain its alliance system in the region.The Sino-U.S. competition will continue. But China would not engage in some infinite military competition with the U.S. in the way the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. Rather than trying to maximize the number of warheads, it would take a smart approach such as increasing its submarine-launched ballistic missiles and strategic nuclear-powered submarines.KH: There has been talk here of China’s possible intervention in case of a regime collapse in Pyongyang or any contingencies in the North. How do you think China would intervene?Park: North Korea has historically been of core geopolitical value for China. Thus, what’s in China’s interest is to maintain a pro-China regime in the North. The worst scenario for China would be that a pro-U.S. regime emerges on the peninsula after reunification, posing a security threat to China. Under this scenario, it could be seen as being geopolitically encircled by Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula, which could make it difficult for it to fulfil the task of unifying mainland China and Taiwan.China’s intervention during the Korea War was based on such geopolitical calculations. At the time, all countries including the U.S. thought China would not intervene due to domestic political and economic difficulties, and the fact that China was not prepared to participate in yet another war. But it did. Should a contingency occur in the North, China would intervene in any form. Its intervention could occur in various ways, depending on situations. China could send a delegation of political and military advisers to back the North Korean regime, or send military assistance to block internal resistance (to the regime favorable to China’s interests), or intervene militarily in a direct manner, in the worst case.Russia has recently begun its military intervention to protect the Assad regime in Syria. Likewise, China could offer military support in case of the collapse of the North Korean regime. Currently, the document stipulating the alliance relations between China and North Korea still remains undestroyed. It appears that the document has not been discarded yet for the two sides to prepare for the possibilities (mentioned above).By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)**Park Chang-heePark, professor in the department of military strategy at Korea National Defense University, is noted for his extensive research and expertise on Chinese military strategy, national security, geopolitics and war strategy.  He has authored a series of articles and books on the Chinese military and various security issues.

It employs 33 letters that are pronounced exactly the same as in writing, being a phonemic alphabet “literally.”The Tbilisi government listed it as a national cultural heritage in March, and nominated it for the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List, which will be determined next year. The Georgian Embassy held a reception at Lotte Hotel on Wednesday to promote the cause and raise awareness in Korea.Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald“The history of Georgia was one of survival,” Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava told The Korea Herald. “Being at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, with different conquerors and civilizations,” he added, “We have survived on the same land, as the same people, with the same language and culture, for over three millennia. We are proud of that.”Georgian historical records date the invention of the alphabet to the pre-Christian period, notably to the Iberian King Parnavaz of third century B.C. Another view points to a time after Georgia was Christianized in the fourth century A.D. No agreement to date has been reached on a common origin, but the writing was noteworthy from a research perspective, the ambassador explained, for being a relic of perished languages in forgotten histories. “With Georgia being the cradle of wine going back over 8,000 years, some scholars have suggested that our alphabet was closely tied to our viticulture, with the round characters resembling the wine trees,” he said.The alphabet, which predominantly uses the “Mkhedruli” version more than the sister variations of “Asomtavruli” and “Nuskhuri,” does not have capital letters, gender distinctions or articles. “It is the only language in the world where the word ‘mama’ actually means ‘father,’” Apkhazava highlighted, delighting the participants, comprised of diplomats and individuals close to Georgia. Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava (left) explains the Georgian alphabet to the Romanian Ambassador’s spouse Mihaela Fabianto (second from left), Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Ignacy Majka and his wife Zofia Majka. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldThe Georgian language belongs to the Iberian-Caucasian linguistic family, separate from the Indo-European languages. Centuries of interactions with the Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Russians, Turks and Azerbaijanis have ingrained and imprinted their traces on the vocabulary, but not the script itself, the envoy noted. According to the Georgian Ministry of Education and Science, a modern Georgian can understand both the ecclesiastical and secular literature in the Old Georgian (5-11th centuries A.D.) and Middle Georgian (12-18th centuries A.D.) languages. Like Korea’s “Hangul Day” on Oct. 9, Georgia celebrates the “Day of the Georgian Language” on April 14. Young Georgians have increasingly opened their eyes and ears to the outside world, and many are comfortable with English, Apkhazava said. The Tbilisi Free University has a Korean language department, where around 25 Georgian students study each year with the help of a Korean teacher.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the fourth installment. ― Ed.In April, Incheon Metropolitan Office of Education announced that eight school-age children from the refugee help center on Yeongjong Island would attend an alternative education institute for multicultural children. It was a bittersweet ending for the children dubbed by local media as “education refugees” after their attempt to enter local Youngjong Elementary School was thwarted by protests from parents. The parents of the school said they did not want their children to share the classroom with students of African and Middle Eastern decent. The IMOE decided it was unwise for the children to attend a 40-student school due to concerns over “cultural clashes.”In light of the increasing number of asylum seekers in South Korea, the country enacted the Refugee Act in 2013 to provide humanitarian protection for them. The law stipulates that foreigners who have applied for refugee status and their families are entitled to the same level of primary and secondary education as Korean citizens if they are underage.But even though the law seeks to provide the basic facilities for those forcibly displaced, the prevailing social prejudice and racism in the country remains a hindrance for the refugees as they try to settling down. Activists call for an end to racism during a rally in downtown Seoul on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on March 21. (Yonhap)This is not the first time the refugee help center made headlines in relation to the anti-refugee sentiment. Back in July 2013 when the facility was about to launch operations, local residents of Yeongjong Island held protests against the center.“Is Yeongjong Island a prison? What is the deal with the refugee center?” read one of the placards hoisted by civic groups, who vowed to “oppose the center to death.” It was a not-so-subtle indicator of the prejudice some Koreans have for refugees and foreigners in general.Korea’s hostility toward foreigners appears to have been fueled by reports that the number of crimes committed by foreigners has increased. Rep. You Dae-woon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy recently called for governmental countermeasures on the rising crime by foreigners, pointing out that criminal cases involving foreigners jumped from 22,543 in 2010 to 30,684 in 2014. The number of arrests per 100,000 also rose from 824 to 882 in the same period.But local experts say discrimination is one of the major reasons the foreigners commit crimes. Kim Jung-hyu, a professor of American Studies at Keimyung University, studied the cases of 800 immigrants in Korea and extrapolated that financial distortion, discrimination and mistreatment were the most important factors that lead to crimes by immigrants.“Immigrants feel greater pain from being victimized by crime than local residents, because social minorities suffer more from the same damage. ... This means victimized foreigners are likely to be angrier (than victimized Koreans),” he wrote in an article, “Foreign Migrants: symbolic violence and discrimination,” published in the journal Korean Criminological Review.Such discrimination has ailed Vincent ― not his real name ― who fled political oppression against minorities in his African home country in 2012. He is currently waiting for the Justice Ministry to approve of his application for refugee status. The ministry tallies the number of asylum seekers from 2010-2014 at 9,155, but roughly 1 in 30 have been accepted as a refugee. Vincent and the remaining thousands live outside the protection of the social welfare system, receiving medical treatment, and on the insecure G-1 visa ― a temporary residential visa for asylum seekers, foreigners involved in lawsuits, and others allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds. Three years, the birth of a child, and many nights of struggle have passed since Vincent first handed in his paperwork.“I am here with my family. My kid was born in Korea, but she does not have a document because of my current status,” he said. The Youngjong Elementary case had a particular meaning to Vincent, who says he is concerned about the education of his 2-year-old daughter.“The law seems to be very tight for children. There should be a way to make children feel that they belong to the universe,” he said. “I worry everyday (about my daughter) because she has to go to school soon. I don’t know how to handle that.”Another hurdle standing in the way of the 36-year-old African is his G-1 visa.“My former boss used (my status) to his advantage. He made me and my wife work overtime without providing food or anything. He used to call us (expletive) every day,” said Vincent.“His problem was that we’re Africans, we are refugees; we don’t have a choice.”One day, things got heated between Vincent and the employer, who terminated the contract. When he went to the labor office, the officials did not overrule the termination and told him to pursue legal action.Vincent now runs a small business on a porter truck he bought. “Getting a job is not easy,” he said.He said that even many who do not know that he is an asylum seeker give him a hard time because of his ethnicity.“When you have black skin, it doesn’t work well for you (in Korea),” he said. During his time working at a factory, he recounted there was a “caste system” among workers, even immigrants. Chinese, whose appearance and culture are relatively similar to Koreans’, were at the top while Africans were at the very bottom.“You get into a bar and there is only one seat left. And there is a Korean sitting near. You go sit there, and he just leaves. Nobody’s going to sit beside you. Same in the subway,” he said. Vincent said his wife came home crying one day because, Korean women who worked with her gave her a hard time, saying “Namsae! Namsae! (smell!).”“I understand it’s a culture that is not very familiar with foreigners, especially Africans. It’s very common practice,” he said. “Believe me, I don’t feel comfortable with that. But I don’t have a choice.”Despite the rising number of multicultural families, Korea remains a largely homogeneous society in terms of ethnicity and culture. According to Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, there are some 820,000 members of multicultural families in 2015, roughly 1.6 percent of the country’s 51.5 million population.There is a widespread belief that Korea is a country of single ethnicity. Up until 2007, the country’s high school history textbook stated that Korea was “one of the rare countries in the world that retains a tradition of a single-ethnicity society.”The strong sense of nationality by Koreans is well demonstrated in their interest and pride toward prominent foreign individuals of Korean descent, such as World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim, or celebrities like golfer Michelle Wie or retired footballer Hines Ward, whose mother is Korean.Such sentiment of “one nation,” however, also makes it harder for Koreans to accept people of foreign descents. But Seol Dong-hoon, a professor of sociology at Chonbuk National University, warned against vilifying the anti-refugee movement as collective selfishness.“We need to pay attention to what the people are complaining about. Many problems can occur from the government driving all the refugees into one place,” he said, pointing out that many of the people seeking refugee status are at the bottom of the social ladder. “Putting all the (refugee) children at one school can be difficult for teachers who have to take care of them. Local residents are also concerned over the possibility that the concentrated refugee population will convert their town into a slum.”He said that the authorities must take measures, which can include distributing the refugee children to several adjacent schools. “We have to approach the issue from a systematic point of view. We can’t just say ‘Oh, these people are selfish,’ and be done with it.”Experts like Seol say Korea need to find ways to persuade people of Korea to amicably accept refugees as part of the society. Refugees say an open-minded attitude is a precondition for this to happen.“I think Korea will be even better if some people could have an open mind for foreigners. Give a little leeway for foreigners to express themselves, get to know them even better. Because you judge me when you don’t know me,” said Vincent.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","refugees in korea their hardships ,crying one day because korean ,light on refugees in korea ,asylum seekers from 2010 2014 ,during rally in downtown seoul","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Ed', 'Incheon Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Youngjong Elementary School', 'african', 'middle Eastern', 'IMOE', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'You Dae - woon', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Kim Jung - hyu', 'American Studies', 'Keimyung University', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Korean Criminological Review', 'Vincent ―', 'african', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Vincent', 'g-1', 'Vincent first', 'Korea', 'Vincent', 'African', 'g-1', 'Vincent', 'Africans', 'Vincent', 'Vincent', 'Korea', 'Chinese', 'Koreans', 'Africans', 'korean', 'Vincent', 'korean', 'Africans', 'Korea', 'Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'World Bank', 'Jim Yong Kim', 'Michelle Wie', 'Hines Ward', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Seol Dong - hoon', 'Chonbuk National University', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Vincent']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.2582058  -0.00999793

Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, speaks during a meeting with reporters in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)“Think of what has happened since the 1950s. You can think of big milestones of the history of your country,” Pierre Krahenbuhl, commissioner general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said in a meeting with Korean reporters in Seoul.“What you have achieved is a very strong message. Things are possible when the political environment, economic environment and human environment improve, and things change fundamentally,” he added, noting the abject situations of Palestinians suffering from “exclusions, humiliation and lack of the freedom of movement.” Following his visit to Tokyo, Krahenbuhl came here to meet with senior Seoul officials including Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Korean International Cooperation Agency president Kim Young-mok to further strengthen the partnership between Seoul authorities and the agency.This year, Seoul, which has engaged in the support for innovation in the information and technology area in the conflict-laden region, has donated some $1.8 million to UNRWA activities. The organization spends between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion a year. The U.S. is the single largest financial donor with a yearly contribution of around $380 million, followed by the EU and Saudi Arabia with around $100 million each.Established in December 1949 after the end of World War II in 1945, the 30,000-staff UNRWA is currently providing support for some 5 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The agency offers assistance in the fields of education, health care, social services and relief assistance in the war-devastated zones. Above all, the most crucial area that UNRWA has engaged in is education, the commission general said, calling it the “only factor of hope” for the refugees. The organization currently runs 700 schools in the Middle East to provide nine years of education to some 500,000 Palestinian refugees ages 6-16.“In a situation where the Middle East is filled with conflicts, risks of further radicalization, problems of opportunities and threats, and risks of displacement, education is, in a way, the only factor of hope in the lives of hundreds of thousands of young Palestinians for a better future,” he said.While talking of the importance of education, Krahenbuhl introduced a poem about hope, which was in a notebook found in a Gaza-based war-torn UNRWA school last year. The poem was handwritten by Rua Kheidh, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl who survived the armed conflict.The poem reads, “Hope is a friend that never betrays you. It may leave you for a while, but always comes back. One should not look for happiness in the neighbor’s garden. One should always look for happiness in one’s own garden.”After reading it out to reporters, the UNRWA chief said, “I promised that her notebook would travel around the world to convey her message. So we are very much looking forward to strengthening our relationship with Korea further in order to allow young girls like Rua to continue to study.”Asked to offer his views on the North Korean refugee crisis, he said that what he can relate to is the experience of refugees, though his agency’s mandate is clearly focused on the refugee issues in the Middle East.“I think if you think of what it means to be a refugee, it means to have fled your home, have abandoned most things that are important to you in your life. It means to have made a split set of decisions about where to go and where to stay,” he said.“I think what people have to understand is you cannot neglect such a community.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","reporters in seoul on thursday ,in seoul on thursday yonhap ,seoul on thursday yonhap think ,korean refugee crisis ,seoul on thursday yonhap","['Korea ’s', 'palestinian', 'U.N.', 'Seoul', 'Pierre Krahenbuhl', 'the U.N.

The state set legal limits on the use of packing materials and disposable products; imposed waste fees on manufacturers that make unrecyclable products; and provided support for the recycling industry. The regulation also included introducing a deposit refund system, which returns a deposit to the waste-generating companies once they collect back their waste. The rule targeted six types of industries -- food, detergents, batteries, tires, electronics and lubricants. A waste truck dumps unrecycled trash at a landfill in Incheon. (Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation)Along with the recycling promotion law, the government initiated a volume-based disposal system in 1995 to encourage waste sorting and to cut down on garbage by charging citizens based on the amount of waste they throw out. All trash must be disposed in state-authorized plastic bags that are available at local stores. The price differs according to municipality and district, with Seoul City levying 413 won per 20 liters of trash on average. Busan imposes the highest rate, at 813 won per 20 kilograms as of now. The system sharply reduced household waste, as the daily trash amount dropped by about 10,000 tons to some 49,000 tons on average in 2013, compared to 1994, according to the Environment Ministry. This is equivalent to one person generating 0.94 kilograms of trash per day on average in 2013, which is down 360 grams from 1994, the ministry said. Starting from last year, the government also initiated a volume-rate disposal system for food waste. Each citizen pays according to the volume of their food waste measured by three types -- plastic bags, RFID reader or electronic chips. Collecting food waste was discretionally run by municipal offices for years until 2013. Most of the food waste is recycled as animal feed.In a bid to expand the product-makers’ recycling participation, the state revised the deposit refund system to the “Extended Producer Responsibility” system in 2003. The new scheme aimed to induce manufacturers to pursue greener choices during the entire production process from designing to disposing the product.Under the system, the Environment Ministry allocates a certain recycling quota to each industry every year based on the production level and waste management. If one fails to achieve the recycling goal, the company is fined. The push for the EPR system had a drastic impact as the recycling rate among the industries under the regulation surged by 64 percent to 1.54 million tons in 2013 from 2002. Thanks to such recycling measures, over 83 percent of the overall generated waste is being recycled as of now, with the rest either getting buried in the landfill site or incinerated, the ministry said. To further raise the recycling rate, the government expanded the recycling drive to the vehicle and metal industries in 2008 with a new rule that encourages them to reuse old cars, and replace natural metals with recycled ones for raw materials. In addition, the government has been moving to boost the trade of recyclable resources by connecting waste suppliers with recycling companies through an online market or mobile application starting last year. Individuals can take part in the market as both buyers and sellers. As of December last year, over 100,000 subscribed to the market service, making about 750,000 deals, the ministry’s data showed.The ministry is now seeking to use the waste as an energy source, with a particular focus on converting the combustible waste into solid recovered fuel. While only 1.5 percent or 58,000 tons are currently utilized as an energy source due to the lack of facilities and technology, the government is aiming to use 90 percent of the combustible waste as an energy source by 2020, which is equivalent to 3.4 million tons a year. Although the government is stepping up these green initiatives, the country also faces persistent conflicts over managing waste that is not recycled, especially over using the limited landfill space. Earlier this year, Seoul City, Incheon and Gyeonggi province were embroiled in a controversy over extending the use of a landfill site in Incheon. While the site was originally expected to become full and set to close by the end of next year, Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province asked Incheon to extend the period as the site was only half-full. About 48 percent of trash dumped daily at the Incheon landfill is from Seoul, while another 34 percent comes from Gyeonggi Province and the remainder from Incheon. Incheon at first rejected the demand, citing residents’ complaints, but later agreed to extend it by 10 years in return for the handover of the land ownership worth 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) and the right to collect waste commission fees worth 120 billion won a year.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","korea has proactively implemented recycling ,government expanded the recycling drive ,recycling rate the government expanded ,seoul city levying 413 won ,decades korea has proactively implemented","['Korea', 'Incheon', 'Sudokwon Landfill Site Management', 'Seoul City', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the Environment Ministry', 'EPR', 'Seoul City', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi province', 'Incheon', 'Seoul City', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Incheon', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Incheon', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",0,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.65409023  0.35525748

The sex ratio indicates the number of boys born for every 100 girls. The team chose the period of the early and mid-1990s for their work as the technology for defining the sex of the fetus became available in the country around that time.A regression analysis found that an increase in the boys-to-girls ratio from 105 to 115 would be associated with an increase in women’s time spent on housework by 34 minutes per day during the period. For example, in 1990, the wives married into families from North Gyeongsang Province spent 65 minutes more per day on housework, compared to women married to men from Incheon, the research showed. The two regions showed a stark contrast in preference for boys, with the average sex ratio of North Gyeongsang Province being 131 compared to Incheon’s 112.Out of 16 provinces cited in the study, the highest sex ratio at birth was recorded in Daegu followed by North Gyeongsang Province, Ulsan, South Gyeongsang Province and Busan. “The research implies that the household gender disparity can only be tackled when husbands change their attitudes towards gender roles as socio-economic conditions for women continues to improve,” the professor said. He expected, however, that the gender imbalance in household could have narrowed at a faster pace in the 2000s as the preference for sons in the country has been constantly abating. The sex ratio in South Korea reached 116.5 in 1990, but the figure fell to 105.3 in 2014, the lowest ever. The average global sex ratio is between 104 to 106 boys per 100 girls, according to the United Nations Population Fund. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean women married to men ,korean parents preference for son ,study showed friday korean men ,among korean parents preference for ,korean women married","['south korean', 'korean', 'Gyeongsang Province', 'Lee Chul - hee', 'Seoul National University', 'korean', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Incheon', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Incheon ’s', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Ulsan', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Busan', 'South Korea', 'the United Nations Population Fund']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61487454  0.68442422

The report was written after analyzing government data on medical records of some 1 million Koreans aged 30 or older, from 2002-2010.The report found that underweight Koreans, defined as those with a body mass index of 18.5 or below, had a 2.2 times higher hazard ratio for death than those overweight -- who have BMI of 23-24.9. The hazard ratio for death in underweight Koreans was in fact higher than for obese Koreans (BMI of 25 or above) as well. Among Koreans aged 50 or older, this pattern was even more prevalent. The hazard ratio for death in underweight Koreans in the specific age group was three times higher than those overweight.  (123RF)“It is true that an obese person is at a higher risk of developing chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease,” said Dr. Kim Shin-kon, who participated in the research. “But our research findings may suggest that those who are overweight actually are more cautious about their health, as they know what their risks are and what to watch out for. They also tend to get medical check-ups more frequently.”Dr. Kim also said malnutrition and being underweight can be a serious health threat to those aged 50 or older, as the conditions can critically affect their immune system. Those with a weakened immune system are much more vulnerable to diseases such as pneumonia and Herpes Zoster, he said. “It is important for the elderly to remain in healthy weight ranges while trying to increase bone and muscle mass,” he said, recommending all senior citizens to invest 10 to 15 minutes daily in exercising.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","underweight koreans had higher chance ,for death in underweight koreans ,university found that underweight koreans ,underweight recent south korean study ,death in underweight koreans","['south korean', 'Korea University', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Kim Shin - kon', 'Kim', 'Herpes Zoster', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58807027  0.58142507

Considering Boko Haram is based in the North, there is little possibility of being persecuted if he lives in Lagos,” the court said in its ruling. The militant group Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates to “Western education is a sin” in the Hausa language, has caused havoc in Nigeria and its neighboring countries through bombings, assassinations and abductions. It is fighting to overthrow the government and create an Islamic state. The court questioned his “sincerity” in the refugee application, noting that he expressed his intention to return home after earning money here earlier in 2007 when he claimed asylum in Korea for the first time.The Nigerian applied for refugee status in 2007 during his short trip to Korea on a tourist visa. Claiming to be the son of the chief of a tribe based in Bama, he argued that Boko Haram had attacked him and his family after he granted his tribe members the freedom of religion. But the immigration office did not accept his application at the time.The ruling reverses the lower court’s earlier decision that required the immigration office to revoke the deportation order. The court had seen a clear disadvantage for him if he is forcibly sent back home, saying that the Nigerian would likely get refugee status here if his claims were found to be true. The deportation order will be suspended while the application process is underway, which normally takes two to three years. He will be housed in the detention center for foreigners until a decision is taken. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","he claimed asylum in korea ,overturned its initial ruling thursday ,neighboring countries through bombings assassinations ,korea on tourist visa claiming ,lawsuit to cancel the deportation","['nigerian', 'South Korea', 'islamist', 'Boko Haram', 'Nigerian', 'Nigeria', 'Nigerian', 'Bama', 'Lagos', 'Boko Haram', 'Lagos', 'Boko Haram', 'Nigeria', 'islamic', 'Korea', 'Nigerian', 'Korea', 'Bama', 'Boko Haram', 'Nigerian']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37778792  0.32824397

The Park Geun-hye administration has been boasting that its bilateral relations with the U.S. and China are at their “best-ever.” After appearing alongside Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a massive military parade in Beijing last month, she took the podium with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House over the weekend, showing off their rapport and voicing in unison against Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions.  President Park Geun-hye (left) speaks as her U.S. counterpart Barack Obama looks on at a news conference at the White House in Washington on Friday. (Bloomberg-Yonhap)Yet, fueled in part by Japan’s extensive lobbying, concerns have risen since her swearing-in in February 2013 in the government and academic circles in Washington that South Korea was “leaning” toward China, while toughening its line against Japan, due to historical and territorial tensions, shunning the trilateral security cooperation sought by the U.S. Park’s address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Thursday demonstrated Seoul’s efforts to tackle the view. Unveiling its plan for a three-way summit with Beijing and Tokyo, she displayed her willingness to meet one-on-one for the first time with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to provide a chance for the two countries to “clear away obstacles hindering closer bilateral ties.” While some observers said her trip to the U.S. helped offset what critics have called “history fatigue,” the deepening quandary was laid bare once again at her joint news conference with Obama the following day as he urged Park to “speak out” if China fails to abide by international norms and rules. “Just as we do, because we think that both of our countries have benefited from the international norms and rules that have been in place since the end of World War II,” Obama said. “And we don’t want to see those rules of the road weakening, or some countries taking advantage because they’re larger. That’s not good for anybody ― including South Korea.” Though his remarks were accompanied by his support for a strong relationship between Seoul and Beijing, as well as the emerging power’s peaceful rise, they also indicated the potential of future friction between the longtime allies when the Sino-U.S. rivalry escalates, such as over trade, currency or maritime security. First and foremost at stake are conflicts in the South China Sea. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel has also called for Seoul to voice out against Beijing’s ongoing construction of artificial islands and other provocative acts near the islands claimed by some Southeast Asian countries. After making the call at another CSIS forum last June, Russel once again said during a news conference one day before the Park-Obama summit: “It is a good thing for the leaders of China to hear directly from another democratically ― from a democratically elected president in a neighboring country” about its behavior regarding freedom of navigation and commerce. “As the U.S. presidential election draws near and contenders engage in ‘China bashing’ next year, Seoul may come under pressure to make a tricky choice over delicate issues such as a possible stationing of advanced U.S. missile defense assets here, as it did when joining a China-led development bank early this year,” a diplomatic source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. For the Park government to better position itself between the two world powers, it should craft a long-term strategy and practice policy in a manner that is consistent and serves national interests, a foreign policy expert said.“I think the persistent criticism of her foreign policy stems from the lack of a grand vision and concrete action plans to realize it. Though it’s wise to sustain good relationships both with the U.S. and China, its policy should be consistent and persuadable to other countries,” he said, wishing to remain anonymous.

I can finally meet my husband,"" said Lee Soon-kyu, 84.Since parting with Oh In-se, 83, during the war 65 years ago, Lee has performed a memorial rite for her husband over the past 37 years, believing that he might have died.Lee's 65-year-old son, Oh Jang-kyun, said, ""If I meet my father, I'd like to tightly hug my parents at the same time."" There are more than 66,000 South Korean family members separated by the Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving South and North Korea technically at war.The issue of the separated families is one of the most pressing humanitarian matters as most of the surviving family members are in their 80s and older. About half of the estimated 129,700 applicants for the family reunions have died.As more separated family members have passed away, finding parent-child relations and husband-wife ones has become rarer. For the upcoming event, most of the separated families are looking to meet their siblings or close relatives.The feasibility of the reunions remained in doubt until the last minute due to the possibility of North Korea launching a long-range rocket.The North has a track record of unilaterally delaying scheduled reunion events, including in September 2013.But North Korea forwent such provocative acts on the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers' Party, which fell on Oct. 10.The North also has remained silent about the recent summit between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and U.S. President Barack Obama, during which they jointly called on North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs.Since the first inter-Korean summit in 2000, the two Koreas have held 19 rounds of face-to-face family reunion events. Seven rounds of video-based reunions also have been held.Only some 18,800 family members from both sides have been allowed to have face-to-face reunions so far.

The Korean History Research Association, the country's largest group of historians with nearly 800 members, has declared it won't participate in the writing process. Kang Sun-a, a spokeswoman of the opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, said that the directive to revert to state-issued history textbooks has ``instantly taken the country back to the Cold War period.''In announcing the controversial plans on Monday, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea argued that the current history textbooks are too left-leaning and encourage views sympathetic to North Korea and urged for the need of school books that were ``objective'' and ``balanced.'' Park, the president, is the daughter of slain military dictator Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea in the 1960s and 70s, and whose legacy as a successful economic strategist is marred by brutal records of civilian oppression.Before leaving for her current trip to the United States, Park defended the move toward state-issued textbooks by saying history classes must inspire ``pride'' in students for being South Korean citizens.  (AP)","history textbooks are too left ,of south korea brutal dictatorships ,controversial plans on monday education ,by conservative leaders in seoul ,history textbooks out of concern","['south korean', 'Park Geun', ""South Korea 's"", 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'south korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'the korean History Research Association', 'Kang Sun - a', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Education', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'North Korea', 'Park Chung - hee', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Park', 'south korean', 'AP']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.40872061  0.43236503

(Yonhap)Lunney was part of the crew of the S.S. Meredith Victory that brought North Korean refugees from the northeastern port of Heungnam to the South during the war.The mission of the U.S. vessel was to deliver war supplies. But the ship’s captain ordered the crew to dump all weapons overboard so that they could evacuate more Koreans at the crossroads of life and death. They were in great haste as the villages were being bombarded by the Chinese troops. The ship was the last ticket to freedom, Lunney recalled.“One word I always remember during the boarding is ‘palli, palli’ -- faster, faster. In that way, we got many people on board, who crowded our ships, on the floor, on the decks.“We took 14,000.” The December 1950 operation, known as the “Heungnam evacuation,” took place as the U.S.-backed South Korean forces began retreating from North Korea after China sent a massive number of troops to fight alongside the communist neighbor.The nearly forgotten operation recently came to the spotlight in the mega-hit film “Ode to My Father.” Lunney was one of 600 guests invited to the Korea-U.S. Friendship Night hosted by South Korean President Park Geun-hye to celebrate the countries’ bilateral ties on Wednesday evening.Earlier in the day, Park thanked Lunney during her visit to a monument honoring U.S. soldiers who served the war, calling him a hero.“You are the true hero.

Kumgang in July 2008. Speaking at a forum in Seoul, Hwang cited the Aug. 25 inter-Korean deal as a turning point. The two Koreas managed to end a military crisis with the agreement reached at rare high-level talks.  The North initially wanted to talk selectively about issues of its own concern but ""currently, the field (of exchanges) has expanded to religion, sports, and culture,"" according to the number two official in the ministry handling daily inter-Korean affairs.  ""Several (South Korean) teams are now visiting North Korea in connection with inter-Korean exchange,"" said Hwang. ""I think North Korea is making the right choice in a sense.""  The North has not fired a long-range rocket as it had previously threatened. Its leader Kim Jong-un placed an emphasis on the livelihood of the people in his speech on the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the country's communist party, Hwang noted.  The North's negative view of the South's humanitarian aid has subsided to some extent, he added.  The two sides are also scheduled to resume a family reunion event next week at Mount Kumgang along the North's east coast. Hundreds of Koreans will meet their long-lost family members who live on opposite sides of the tightly-controlled border.  ""According to the analysis of North Korean media's reports, Kim made a lot of public activities related to the military at an early stage.

It also admitted that more than 10 million cars sold globally might be equipped with the ""defeat device.""  The German carmaker officially apologized to its South Korean customers for the scandal on Thursday in major newspapers, vowing to take every possible measure, including a recall, to regain customers' trust.  In a similar newspaper ad, Audi Korea said that it is making ""thorough preparations"" for a recall and other possible measures necessary to resolve any problem linked to the software in question.  Earlier this month, the Environment Ministry said that it has launched its own investigation into suspected Volkswagen and Audi models over the potential emissions results manipulation.   Market experts presume that about 120,000 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles might have been manipulated in South Korea by the same software found by the U.S. environment regulators and be subject to a recall.  The next lawsuit will be filed on Oct. 20.

The missile was first revealed during a parade to mark the centennial birthday of the North’s late founder Kim Il-sung in April 2012. Then, it was tipped with a pointy warhead. But the warhead looked round this time, indicating that some improvements or modifications have been made to it.While broadcasting the parade at Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang, the North’s Korean Central Television reported that the strategic rockets were equipped with “diversified, miniaturized” nuclear warheads that have “super-precision” strike capabilities.The KN-08, which measures 2 meters in diameter and 18 meters in length, is to be fired from a 16-wheeled road-mobile platform, called the TEL (transporter-erector-launcher). The North has yet to publicly test it, leaving its real capabilities still shrouded in secrecy.Seoul officials showed a cautious stance about the North’s ability to mount a warhead on the KN-08.“Whether the KN-08, presented at the parade, is a real one or not has yet to be verified. Thus, it is premature to judge whether the missile can carry a nuclear warhead,” a Seoul official told reporters, requesting anonymity.“And the round shape of the warhead could increase air resistance, thereby reducing the speed of the missile.”At the parade, the North also revealed its 300 mm-caliber multiple rocket launcher, called the KN-09, for the first time. The new system is regarded as a formidable one for wartime use, given that there are virtually no means for the South Korea-U.S. alliance to counter it.Seoul officials believe that the North made the rocket system based on a Chinese one, and that it has almost developed it. They believe its maximum range is around 140 km and thus, unable to reach the headquarters of South Korea’s Army, Navy and Air Force in the Gyeryongdae military compound in South Chungcheong Province.The South Korean military authorities first recognized the North’s push to develop the KN-09, as the reclusive regime was seen test firing the KN-09 system in May 2013.The new artillery system calls for Seoul to pay more policy attention to countering it. But its attention has been focused largely on developing counters to Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear arsenal, such as the Korea Air and Missile Defense program, and the Kill Chain preemptive strike system. Many ideas have been put forward to deal with the North’s artillery threats, though budgetary issues have always come in the way. Among them was purchasing a weapons system called, “counter-rocket artillery mortar,” or C-RAM.Despite the speculation that the North would use the parade to show off its submarine-launched ballistic missile, it did not unveil the SLBM, which analysts say would pose a formidable nuclear threat to the South and the U.S., should it be fully developed. Last May, Pyongyang claimed that it successfully conducted an ejection test of the SLBM from its new 2,000 ton Sinpo-class submarine. Seoul officials forecast it would take four to five years for the North to fully develop and deploy the SLBM. They also think that the North will be able to build a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine capable of carrying the SLBM in two to three years. Meanwhile, U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris said Saturday that North Korea and its leader are his command’s greatest worries, and that his military is “ready to deal with” the unpredictable regime. “The greatest threat that I face on a day-to-day basis is the threat from North Korea, because you have an unpredictable leader who is in complete command of his country and his military,” Harris said during a meeting with reporters.“At some point in the future, as he develops his capability, North Korea will present a very real threat to Hawaii and the rest of the United States. Now, I have to be ready from a position of strength to deal with North Korea.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","largest military parade to mark ,carry nuclear warhead seoul official ,may 2013 the new artillery ,the missile at the parade ,during its largest military parade","['North Korea', 'Workers ’ Party', 'ICBM', 'U.S.', 'North ’s', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Pyongyang', 'KN-08', 'TEL', 'Seoul', 'North ’s', 'kn-08', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'South Korea ’s', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Air Force', 'Gyeryongdae', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the Korea Air', 'Missile Defense', 'North ’s', 'SLBM', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'SLBM', 'sinpo', 'Seoul', 'SLBM', 'SLBM', 'U.S. Pacific Command', 'Harry Harris', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Harris', 'North Korea', 'Hawaii', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'Song Sang - ho']",0,"[ 0.          5.          0.         ... -0.25628492  0.16100124

The participants were asked to answer 20 questions designed to see if they had the Korean language skills required for higher education.On a 100-point scale, female students scored 60.27 while their male counterparts averaged 58.72. The results were consistent with that of most major exams in Korea, where girls have generally done better than boys. In last year’s annual college entrance exam, female students got 5.4 more points in standard scores on the Korean section. Foreign students take part in a Korean speech contest at  Ewha Womans University in Seoul on Tuesday ahead of Oct. 9 Hangeul Day. (YonhapIn the study, those who scored below 50 were considered to have only elementary language skills, the 50-74 group were seen as possessing basic skills and anyone getting 75 or more was regarded as being fluent in expressing their opinions while able to fluently come up with ideas for writing.For six of the 20 questions, less than half of the respondents got the correct answer. Humanities majors did marginally better than those studying sociology and natural sciences with a score of 61.85 compared to 60.52 and 58.04, respectively.The results indicate that many Korean college students lack sufficient Korean skills for higher education, Song said.“Generally, writing lessons in most high schools focus on preparing the students solely for college admissions rather than practical writing. As a result, many students enter college without procuring sufficient Korean skills needed in higher education,” she said.Most of the Korean language lessons in the country train students for exams that have them answer multiple-choice and short-answer questions after reading short excerpts from a literary piece. Students say that because of this, they are able to understand individual sentences, but have trouble grasping the topic of the whole text.Koreans have among the highest ratio of getting higher education in the world, with 70.9 percent of high school graduates entering college as of 2014. But data shows that even well-educated people lack adequate skills to use their native language.According to the Korean Educational Development Institute’s education and human resources index, the country had the lowest average document literacy for people with college diplomas out of all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Some colleges take the matter into their own hands to improve the less-than-satisfactory Korean skills of their students. Hankuk University of Foreign Studies has mandated a writing class for all students, starting with the freshman class of 2007.“Practical writing is very important, especially in college education,” Song said. “The curriculum should also be based more on the text, so that the student can comprehend the entire context rather than simply understanding the meaning of individual sentences.The study was published recently in the journal “The Education of Korean Language” by Korean Language Education Research Institute at Seoul National University.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","college students lack sufficient korean ,exams in korea where girls ,many korean college students lack ,korean college students lack sufficient ,female students scored 60 27","['south korean', 'Song Hyun - jung', 'korean', 'Jeju National University', 'korean', 'Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'korean', 'Song', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'the Korean Educational Development Institute ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'korean', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Song', 'Korean Language Education Research Institute', 'Seoul National University']",12,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51957953  0.57501632

Once qualified, the job seeker would be able to receive the allowance for 120 to 270 days, whereas the payments are currently only doled out for 90 to 240 days.However low a job seeker’s previous income was, she or he will be guaranteed to receive a minimum daily allowance of 40,176 won ($34.38), according to the Labor Ministry. Korean job seekers look at job postings. (Yonhap)In spite of increased benefits, fewer job seekers will be qualified to earn the allowance if the bill is passed by the National Assembly.The stricter eligibility criteria for the out-of-work benefit is to prevent possible abuses of the welfare system, such as switching jobs too often, the Labor Ministry said.  Currently, one must have worked a minimum of 180 days in the course of 18 months before losing the job in order to claim the unemployment allowance. Once the revised bill takes effect, a job seeker will only be qualified to earn the benefits if he or she worked for a minimum of 270 days in the course of two years before becoming unemployed. Those who receive the allowance more than three times in five years, or those who stay unemployed -- either voluntarily or involuntarily -- for more than 90 days after receiving the benefits will be specially monitored by the authorities. While being monitored, they will be asked to actively engage in job searching at least once a week, while those who aren’t monitored are only required to do so once in two weeks.Currently, those who fail to show up at mandatory job training sessions can lose up to one month’s worth of their unemployment allowance payments. The revised bill stipulates that those who don’t attend required training will lose a maximum of two months’ worth of their allowance payments. Job seekers who have received the allowance more than once and missed more than two training sessions can lose up to 30 percent of their payments, according to the report. Meanwhile, elderly individuals who have lost a job in which they were initially employed at age 65 or older will be eligible to apply for out-of-work benefits should the bill take effect. Currently, the elderly in the specific circumstances are not qualified to earn the benefits. The Labor Ministry predicts that some 13,000 elderly workers, especially janitors and cleaners, will benefit from the revised bill when their work contract ends and they are looking to be employed elsewhere.According to a study by the Labor Ministry, the vast majority of Korean job seekers do not apply for out-of-work benefits. The study, which looked at some 1,000 unemployed Koreans, showed that 88.7 percent did not claim the allowance. The largest portion of them, 48.7 percent, said it was because they found another job right away, while 26 percent said it was because they voluntarily left their jobs.In Korea, jobseekers are eligible to apply for unemployment allowance only if they were forced to leave by their employers. According to Kim Seong-eun from the Labor Ministry, some exceptions apply to those who voluntarily quit their jobs. “For example, if one quit his job because his office moved to another region and required him to commute for six hours a day, we’d consider him as someone who is qualified for the allowance,” he said.Even if the new bill does take effect, those who voluntarily left work will have to file an additional application should they want to apply for the allowance, Kim said. Only those who had to quit their jobs because of unfortunate circumstances will be given the benefits, he said.However, only 2 percent of all recipients of unemployment benefits were those who voluntarily left work but who were recognized by the government as deserving the allowance, as of 2012. Almost 50 percent of them were female workers who left work after becoming pregnant.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","higher unemployment benefits for longer ,at some 000 unemployed koreans ,korean job seekers will receive ,seekers will receive higher unemployment ,increased benefits fewer job seekers","['south korean', 'the National Assembly', 'the Labor Ministry ’s', 'the Labor Ministry', 'korean', 'Yonhap)In', 'the National Assembly', 'the Labor Ministry', 'the Labor Ministry', 'the Labor Ministry', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Kim Seong - eun', 'the Labor Ministry', 'Kim', 'Claire Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42815065 -0.12077386

The program is likely to consist of 10 minutes of news, 9 minutes of English education and 10 minutes of features on business, technology, culture, sports and other subjects.The Korean language team is expected to have seven people ― six of them in London and one somewhere else. “They will be using BBC materials as the basis for the international news, but they will also find the news in the region and from the Korean Peninsula,” he said.The program, when fully operational, could lead to some change in the tightly-controlled North Korean society, observers noted. Yet, Damon said that the program was not about “regime change” that may result in chaos, albeit temporary, as witnessed in the collapse of the communist bloc decades ago.“We are not about regime change. We are simply about the truth,” said Damon, a veteran journalist who covered the collapse of the communist bloc involving the former Soviet Union, East Germany and others, and conflicts including those in Croatia and Bosnia“Getting people to hear the truth. That is what we are about.”Damon’s interest in North grew after he found that the Western media coverage did not seem to capture the whole picture of the communist regime.“I realized our reporting, Western reporting of North Korea is very bad,” he said. “It is either jokey about haircuts or only focused on one thing, about the nuclear issue. North Korea is a much richer place than that in terms of its culture and variety.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","is pushing to open korean ,bbc journalist told the korea ,year to help north koreans ,help north koreans hear the ,would mainly target north koreans","['BBC', 'korean', 'North Koreans', 'BBC', 'the Korea Herald', 'Daniel John Damon', 'North Koreans', 'BBC', 'North Koreans', 'World Update', 'the BBC World Service', 'the Korea Herald', 'Daniel John Damon', 'Song Sang - ho', 'Korea', 'british', 'korean', 'London', 'BBC', 'north korean', 'Damon', 'Damon', 'Soviet Union', 'East Germany', 'Croatia', 'western', 'western', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54969287  0.63186979

For women in all age groups, it was the third most common cancer, following breast and thyroid cancer. According to National Cancer Center of Korea, the number of female colorectal cancer patients has been on the rise from 1999-2012, with an average annual increase rate of 4.3 percent. Colorectal cancer was the most common cancer among Korean women aged 65 or older this year. (Yonhap)In Korea, the particular cancer has been generally regarded as a disease that is more common in men. Korea in fact had the third highest rate of colorectal cancer in men -- 58.7 men per 100,000 -- in the world back in 2012. In the same year, Korea had the fifth highest rate of colorectal cancer in women -- 33.3 women per 100,000 -- in the world, following Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. “What many are not aware is that aging women are more vulnerable to this particular type of cancer,” said Dr. Kim Kwang-ho from the hospital. “One of the reasons why so many elderly women develop the disease is because not a lot of them get screened regularly for colorectal cancer thinking it’s more prone in men. But this has to change now.”From 1993-2012, the five-year relative survival rate for Korean women colorectal cancer patients (65.9 percent), was significantly lower than their male counterparts (70.5 percent). While colorectal cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women aged 65 or older, it is the third highest cancer among Korean men in the same age group.According to Dr. Kim, women in and post-menopause are more vulnerable to the cancer because estrogen is what protects women from gaining excess belly weight which is significantly linked to colorectal cancer. Most women gain excess belly weight, especially inside the belly, as they go through menopause, as their estrogen levels drop. When women’s menstrual cycle ends, body fat is often redistributed from the hips, buttocks and thighs to the abdomen. And those with excessive amounts of visceral fat have a higher chance of developing colorectal cancer.According to the hospital, 44.5 percent of Korean women who went through menopause develop abdomen-obesity, while only 32.1 percent of who are in their pre-menopause phase experience the same. “One’s risk of developing colorectal cancer increases with increasing waist circumference,” said the report. “A woman’s chance of developing the disease increases by 16 percent per 10 centimeter increase in her waistline.”To prevent the disease, Dr. Kim recommended that those aged 50 or older get regular screening, such as colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, every five to 10 years. People with a family history of colorectal cancer should begin testing at younger ages, he said. According to Kim, one can reduce their chance of developing the disease by 90 percent just by getting screened regularly. The doctor also recommended women aged 50 or older to be physically active, get enough calcium and avoid smoking. There is a good evidence that getting enough calcium helps protect against colorectal cancer. The doctor also stressed the importance of not smoking. “Women who smoke have a 20 percent higher chance of developing colorectal cancer than those who don’t,” he said.

The women’s duty time recorded eight hours and three minutes last year.Men, however, spent less than 10 percent of their duty time on household affairs. The overall daily duty time of men was seven hours and 51 minutes. Men tended to spend half of their duty time on their career, while women spent only about 20 percent of their duty time on jobs. The perception toward traditional gender roles also differed by gender. More than 40 percent of men approved of traditional gender roles, while only about 28 percent of women did so. The rest of the women opposed the increasingly old-fashioned perception of gender roles. Husbands, however, interestingly, spent more time cooking than ever before.The surveyed men said that they spent about eight minutes a day on average cooking last year, three minutes longer than 2013.

The group is a collaboration of 54 education-related bodies, parents’ groups and advocates of Hangeul, the Korean writing system.Members of civic groups opposing the use of Chinese characters in elementary school textbooks hold up placards during the Education Ministry’s public hearing held at Korea National University of Education in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, on Aug. 24. (Yonhap)Over 400 education professors across the country also released a statement on Sept. 9 to bash the government’s move, while a survey conducted by the Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union showed that 78 percent of elementary school students opposed it.The ministry’s policy is centered on using both Hangeul and Hanja for elementary school textbooks, which goes hand-in-hand with teaching the Chinese characters for elementary school students. In Korea, Hanja teaching has been restricted as an optional course for middle and high school students since the 1970s. But the ministry announced last year that it is mulling use of Hanja in elementary schools, a year after President Park Geun-hye’s public address stressing the need to enhance Hanja education. Key issues surrounding the policy are if learning Hanja can actually help students and whether or not implementing Hanja education will add to students’ academic stress. Park Yong-gyu, the head of the executive committee at the HMAHES, said reinstating Hanja use is an “outdated” concept. He raised concerns that the additional learning could make life painful for elementary school students, who already face a heavy academic burden.“The government implemented English classes at elementary schools a few years back, and now students are suffering the consequences,” he said. Korea introduced English classes for elementary school students in the mid-1990s. Two decades later, the Park administration has rolled out policies to reign in what the president has described as “excessive English education.”Park of HMAHES pointed out that effects of the Hanja use will have rippling effects. “Imagine what would happen if they started using Hanja around third grade? It won’t affect just older students; first, second graders, even kindergarten students will be learning Hanja as part of ‘advanced learning,’” he said. “Advanced learning” refers to students studying material for older students. Although Korea recently passed a bill banning it, it does not apply to private education institutes.But proponents of Hanja use say that concerns about a surge in private education is exaggerated. “A ‘moderate’ use of Hanja will not add significant stress to students. Let’s say students in grades 4-6 would learn about a couple of characters a week, and they are not tested on their learning. Would that be burdensome?” said Kim Dong-seok, the spokesman for the Korea Federation of Teachers’ Association.Kim added that there are already significant demands among Koreans for Hanja education. “Our statistics show that over half of those taking Hanja certification tests are elementary school students. This means there is a demand for Hanja education among parents,” said Kim. Jin Tae-ha, the chairman of the board at the Korean Association of Hanja Education Promotion, wrote in his recent column that use of Hanja is deeply rooted in Korean language.“Over 90 percent of academic books in colleges across the country use both Korean and Chinese characters. Over 70 percent of Korean words use Hanja. Exclusive use of Hangeul for nearly half a century has sparked many problems, which can be addressed with the ministry’s policy,” he wrote.While both sides agree that words composed of Hanja account for a large portion of Korean vocabulary, opponents point out that the majority of these words are spelled out in Hangeul in everyday use.“Take for example the word ‘sa-gi (fraud)’ in Korea. Everyone knows what that means. They don’t have to know how to write it in Chinese characters,” Park of HMAHES said. “If it’s not broken, why fix it?”Park added that the only ones gaining from the new policy would be organizations that run Hanja certification tests. He pointed out that the privately run Korean Association of Hanja Education Promotion ― one of the most outspoken proponents of the policy ― is one of the cosponsors of the annual Hanja tests, raising suspicion over the motive behind the organization’s consistent calls for Hanja education.The group said the sponsorship had nothing to do with financial gains, and that it was purely for the promotion of Hanja education.Taking notice of the fierce controversy, the Education Ministry recently postponed the decision on Hanja use for primary education and vowed to conduct further research on the policy. The ministry was originally to announce its decision on the implementation Wednesday, as part of this year’s sweeping revision of the education curriculum. By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korea recently passed bill banning ,annual hanja tests raising suspicion ,the education ministry recently postponed ,opponents demand the ministry abandon ,students academic stress park yong","['the south Korean Education Ministry ’s', 'chinese', 'Headquarters for Movement Against Hanja in', 'Jongno', 'Seoul', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Hangeul', 'korean', 'chinese', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Korea National University of Education', 'Cheongju', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Workers ’ Union', 'Hangeul', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Park Yong - gyu', 'HMAHES', 'Korea', 'Park', 'english', 'HMAHES', 'Korea', 'Kim Dong - seok', 'the Korea Federation of Teachers ’ Association', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Kim', 'Jin Tae - ha', 'the Korean Association of Hanja Education Promotion', 'Hanja', 'korean', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Hangeul', 'korean', 'Hangeul', 'Korea', 'chinese', 'HMAHES', 'Korean Association of', 'Hanja Education Promotion', 'the Education Ministry', 'Yoon Min - sik']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41528353  0.36411181

On average, the wages for local workers across the OECD bloc was 15 percent higher than their foreign counterparts.In the report, the OECD underscored the role of “skills” in narrowing the wage inequality, noting that a difference in skills accounted for over 70 percent of the wage gap between native and foreign-born workers.It is particularly “important” to invest in teaching skills for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to reduce the gap, it said. In fact, Korea’s wage gap between locals and foreigners would lower from 55 percent to 36 percent if foreign workers were equipped with the same skills, the report added. The difference would further narrow to 21 percent if foreign laborers were paid the same as locals for retaining the same skills. But South Korea’s inequality in wages between locals and foreigners would still remain the highest among OECD countries even if foreign laborers had the same skills, according to the report. Kim Jong-jin, a researcher for Korea Labor & Society Institute, pointed out that the wage gap shed light on the deeply rooted discrimination against foreign workers and the lack of a legal system to protect their rights. “It is a trend that migrant workers in advanced countries do dangerous, dirty jobs left vacant by native laborers,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “Whether a country has institutions and laws to protect migrant workers makes a difference in pay gaps across the OECD bloc.”“Korea still doesn’t have a law stipulating migrant workers’ rights and institutions allowing them to stand up against employers to resolve the pay difference,” Kim added.“The wage gap is only likely to grow as there seems to be no social discourse over the migrant workers’ rights.”In Korea, some 825,000 migrant workers are legally working in the country, a large portion of whom are doing unskilled jobs typically in labor-intensive sectors such as construction, manufacturing and agriculture. According to government data released last year, 45 percent of the foreign workers here are employed at factories, with 31 percent working at construction sites and 12 percent hired in the service industry. Only 12 percent are white-collar workers, according to the statistics.The data also showed that more than 60 percent of the foreign laborers in Korea had received less than 2 million won ($1,700) in monthly wages, while half of them worked more than 50 hours a week.But the wage gap between locals and foreigners in Korea is merely the result of the unique structure of the Korean labor market, another expert said. “Unlike other OECD countries, a large portion of the foreign workers in Korea (represented in the statistics) are those working low-skilled jobs, which consequently come with lower salaries,” Lee Kyu-yong, a senior researcher at the Korea Labor Institute, told The Korea Herald.“Thus, the wage gap is inevitable and it shouldn’t be seen as discrimination against migrant workers.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","55 percent higher wages than ,received 55 percent higher wages ,korea has the biggest wage ,south korea inequality in wages ,55 percent higher wages","['South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the Employment Outlook 2015', 'Paris', 'OECD', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Korea', 'Slovakia', 'Canada', 'the Czech Republic', 'Australia', 'Poland', 'Japan', 'OECD', 'OECD', 'Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'OECD', 'Kim Jong - jin', 'Korea Labor & Society Institute', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'OECD', 'Korea', 'Lee Kyu - yong', 'the Korea Labor Institute', 'the Korea Herald', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.74103725  0.42978713

KFS, the state agency for afforestation and forest resources, has been seeking ways to secure more green spaces around the living spaces in urban areas, which fall far below the global standards. Korea’s minimum area of urban living forest per capita turned out to be approximately 8.5 square meters, lower than the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum of 9 square meters. Yeouido Park in Seoul, an urban forest in Korea (KFS)By cities, the area of urban living forest per capita stood at only 4.35 square meters for Seoul, 5.29 square meters for Gyeonggi Province and 5.95 square meters for Incheon. This is far lower than London’s 27 square meters, New York’s 23 square meters and Paris’ 13 square meters. “With the rising interest in well-being and healthy leisure, the nationwide demand for sustainable green services has been on the increase,” a KFS official said. According to the KFS data, about 85.8 percent of Korean citizens and 95.5 percent of experts expected the demand for urban green areas to continue to increase. However, the dwindling government budget for urban green projects has fanned concerns that the state funding will fail to meet the ever-rising demand for environmental rights. The KFS’ urban forestation operation takes full account of the Park Geun-hye administration’s “Government 3.0” slogan, which calls for enhanced communication through the spreading of information to the public.As part of the ways to undo the informational divide between the government and the people in the afforestation sector, the KFS has broadened the communication channels to heed the people’s voice about green city policies. This includes strengthened cooperation with the civil organizations and the business enterprises that actively support corporate social responsibilities. The KFS has encouraged many socially aware businesses to participate in the urban city-making operations. The state forest agency incentivizes corporate contributors by offering promotional opportunities, such as displaying corporate names and trademarks or setting up commemorative indicators in the contributed green zones. Another big step was the addition of urban forests and street trees to the government’s list of carbon-reducing businesses.The KFS’ cooperation with civil organizations and citizen participants has also seized the eyes of urban administration experts. The KFS now has 20 operations of urban forest trusts that collect and manage voluntary donations for urban forestation. The KFS has also organized many urban forest events to encourage urbanites in Korea to enjoy a green environment amid the busy bustle of their city lives. Earlier in June 2014, “Bio Blitz,” an event for children and adults, successfully attracted about 4,000 visitors from across the country. The “Saving the Bees Together” event of May 2013 also attracted 15 environmentally friendly operations, in which participants were encouraged to share their experiences and knowledge of living creatures through social network services. Internet-based environmental operations have been gaining support from a wide range of participants, the KFS said. Thanks to the shared passion for a healthier living environment, the urban forestation operations saved some 16.2 billion won ($13.7 million) of government funds. The urban forestation budget for 2014 was 65.5 billion won. With people’s passion and participation in the urban forestation operation, the nation’s area of urban living forest per capita has steadily increased to 8.32 square meters as of 2013, up from 7.76 square meters in 2009 and 7.95 square meters in 2011. “We are confident that larger green space in the urban areas will contribute to enhancing people’s healthy lifestyles,” an KFS official said. Lee Yong-seok, a director at the KFS, said that the “in-city forest” project is an exemplary case in forestry policies to show the government’s effort for openness, sharing and cooperation, and aims to expand green spaces in our residential areas.

The findings would help maximize the effectiveness of Korea’s knowledge aid for these countries,” officials from KDI School said.The respondent group -- consisting of civil servants, scholars and experts in development policies from international organizations -- were asked: “If you were the policymaker of your country, which of Korea’s development policy would you like to learn the most?” The participants were asked to pick out of eight sections related to the country’s development: macroeconomics policy, trade, finance, industry and technology, territorial development-national land development plan, environment, social development, government and law. These were then divided into 45 subcategories. Participants were allowed to pick more than one category.Of the subcategories, education from the social development section was found to be the most popular subject as it was selected by 11 percent of the respondents. It was particularly popular among respondents from Asia-Pacific, Africa, Middle East and Europe. Those from the Americas were most interested in social infrastructure section, encompassing education, welfare and health. Social infrastructure from national land development plan section was the second most popular category with 10 percent of respondents picking it, followed by international trade from the trade section at 9 percent.Internal conflict from the government and law sections were the least popular of all subcategories.In general, government officials showed interest in policies related to the economy. African civil servants were most interested in macroeconomic policy, while officials from the Americas picked international trade. Officials from Asia-Pacific and Middle East respectively found economic development and economic planning most appealing.But green growth was the No. 1 category among European officials.Researchers, on the other hand, were more interested in the environment section. Those from Africa put energy on the top of their list, while researchers from the Americas showed high interest in green growth.The survey was conducted to update the content for K-Developedia(www.kdevelopedia.org), an online database on information related to Korea's development developed by the KDI School of Public Policy and Management in 2012. “It is a global development experience-sharing platform that systematically organized material on knowledge resources regarding Korea's seven decades of development experience,” according to KDI School officials.K-Developedia provides more than 30,000 resources on Korean development experience with data published by organizations such as the KDI, World Bank and the OECD, and has users from 155 countries around the world.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korea most appealing development policy ,south korea most appealing development ,education as south korea most ,korea most appealing development ,south korea most appealing","['South Korea ’s', 'KDI School of Public Policy and Management', 'the KDI School', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'KDI School', 'Korea', 'african', 'european', 'K - Developedia(www.kdevelopedia.org', 'Korea', 'the KDI School of Public Policy and Management', 'Korea', 'KDI School', 'K - Developedia', 'korean', 'KDI', 'World Bank', 'OECD']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6016494   0.47776556

Han Sun-kyo of the Saenuri Party, the number of Chinese nationals obtaining Korean driver’s licenses surged to about 4,700 last year, jumping by 30-fold in two years. The rate of car accidents involving foreigners also rose by 2.6 times to nearly 2,000, the report said.  A driver’s license test agency is crowded with driving test applicants in Gangnam, Seoul, on Aug. 17. (Yonhap)The surge was especially noticeable on Jejudo Island, where over 1,100 Chinese obtained driver’s licenses in the first half of this year. In 2012, only two Chinese nationals acquired a license there.In the meantime, car accidents involving foreigners also increased in Jeju from six to 40 cases between 2012 and last year. “Over 40 percent of last year’s accidents involved Chinese visitors,” Jeju police agency said.The quick and simple process of obtaining a driver’s license in Korea contributed to the surge in numbers, officials said. As the Korean driver’s license rules were eased in 2011, would-be drivers are able to obtain the license in 4-5 days by taking 10 hours of classes and passing a set of driving tests. The cost is also relatively cheap at around 500,000 won ($420). The Korean driver’s license is as valid as Chinese ones as long as the drivers pass a simple written test back in China.In China, on the other hand, getting a driver’s license takes at least several months, with the cost ranging from 5,000 yuan ($790) to 10,000 yuan. Han pointed out that the lax regulations on driver’s licenses should be strengthened in order to prevent misuse and tighten road security.The visa-free entry policy for Chinese sightseers to Jejudo Island from 2008 has likely affected the number increase as well, the authorities said. Acknowledging the easy access of Korean driver’s licenses, some Korean driving academies have offered driving lessons and courses in Chinese for the tourists. Some have even hired Chinese interpreters to better draw Chinese customers. As more Chinese nationals opted to acquire Korean licenses, Beijing has also taken issue, citing safety concerns.The Chinese government asked Seoul late last year to impose restrictions on Chinese visitors seeking driver’s licenses. The Korean police, however, reportedly replied that there was no legal basis to do so. In June, Shanghai discretionally suspended accepting Korean driver’s licenses for short-stay visitors.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","obtaining korean driver licenses surged ,korean driver licenses surged ,chinese nationals obtaining korean driver ,korean driver licenses surged to ,100 chinese obtained driver licenses","['korean', 'chinese', 'Han Sun - kyo', 'the Saenuri Party', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Jejudo Island', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Jeju', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'chinese', 'China', 'China', 'Han', 'chinese', 'korean', 'korean', 'Chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Shanghai', 'korean', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",12,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.39487568  0.55888891

Each drum can hold 200 liters of waste material, while the heavily reinforced silo is built 130 meters underground and is connected to the surface by a 1,415-meter service tunnel. The six silos are expected to be filled in 10 years.According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the key facilities are all earthquake-proof, with the shutter doors of the service tunnel even being designed to withstand a tsunami. The repository is located close to the East Sea so nuclear waste can be brought in by ship from other parts of the country.Over the past year, the Korea Radioactive Waste Agency, the repository's operator, has secured various permits and conducted numerous tests and trial runs to make certain it is safe to move and store nuclear waste on the 2.14-million-square-meter site. The repository started to temporarily house nuclear waste in 2010.Highlighting the importance of safety, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said at the dedication ceremony that the utmost attention will be paid to safety.""There will be no compromises when it comes to safety issues,"" he said, expressing gratitude to Gyeongju citizens for agreeing to host the repository. The project had been held up repeatedly due to opposition from residents who did not want a radioactive waste site near their homes.Gyeongju, a historic city 371 kilometers southeast of Seoul, has been promised over 3.22 trillion won in compensation from 2007 to 2035 for hosting the repository, with 1.71 trillion won having been provided as of 2014.Work on the repository began in July 2007, with major construction being completed in June last year.After the opening of the first part of the repository, the government will now seek permission to start the second phase, which can accommodate another 125,000 drums of nuclear waste, the ministry said.These facilities are to be built on the surface and should be completed by December 2019, although it could be delayed.South Korea, which relies heavily on nuclear power, has been hard pressed to find storage space for its nuclear waste. The nation now operates 24 nuclear reactors, which generate about a third of the electricity for Asia's fourth-largest economy.The country has yet to resolve what it will do with its high level radioactive waste coming from nuclear power plants. At present, such wastes are held in temporary holding areas at nuclear power plants, but such facilities are nearing full capacity.

(Yonhap)The latest talks, however, indicated a notable change in the North’s attitude: Pyongyang, despite its incorrigible denial of provocations during and after the rare talks, consistently displayed its will to settle the issues, according to Seoul officials.The change, indeed, boded well for the future of inter-Korean relations, which have been deteriorating with the North sticking to its nuclear program and setting off military provocations that, in turn, triggered stern reactions from the South, analysts said.“The change in the attitude stemmed from Pyongyang’s desire for a turnaround in the current situation, in which sanctions persist while Seoul and Washington have raised pressure on it to give up its nuclear program,” said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University. “The North appears to have judged that should it fail to make any turning point this time amid the escalating military standoff, it would not be able to disentangle inter-Korean ties and its relations with the international community in the coming years.”After the four-day talks that ended Tuesday morning with a rare expression of regret from Pyongyang over the Aug. 4 land mine attack, a mood emerged for bilateral cooperation in the civil and public sectors, which would, in the long run, help Pyongyang shore up its economy.During the protracted talks, the two sides agreed to hold further government talks on a regular basis to discuss pending issues that are expected to range from the long-stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan to the lifting of Seoul’s economic sanctions against Pyongyang.Although the two sides remain measures apart over how to settle those issues, their commitment to dialogue as a key means to tackle them marks a meaningful change for the better, observers noted.While the outcome of the talks is being trumpeted here as a feat of Seoul’s “principled” approach toward the recalcitrant regime, Pyongyang was seen trying to downplay what could be seen as losses in the latest negotiations, apparently for internal propaganda purposes.Holding a press conference after the talks, Hwang Pyong-so, director of the North Korean military’s General Political Bureau, who attended the talks, repeated the North’s denial of the mine provocation, saying the incident was fabricated by the South. The conference itself drew attention in the South as it has been rare for the North Korean leadership to try to explain their position to the general public. While outcomes of talks with the South have often been announced via state-controlled media, it is unprecedented in the North for its chief negotiator to directly explain the process on television, observers noted.After the message that was seemingly intended for a domestic audience, Hwang also said that it was a relief to see the two Koreas’ joint efforts having created fresh grounds to improve the relations.South Korea, for its part, began preparation for the envisioned inter-Korean talks as agreed upon at the border talks. Seoul’s Unification Ministry also said that the May 24 sanctions, imposed after the North’s sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010, could also be discussed at the talks. As for the sanctions, the ministry reiterated that the North should take “responsible measures” to address the issue of the deadly sinking, should it want them to be lifted.Meanwhile, the latest confrontation with the North allowed a broader peak into the regime under the leadership of Kim Jong-un.Above all, Pyongyang revealed the set of initial military steps it would take in case of an armed conflict with its southern neighbor backed by the U.S.After declaring what it calls a “quasi-state of warfare,” the North got its aerial defense radar up and running, and forward-deployed its artillery forces that put Seoul and its surrounding area within striking range.The North was also spotted preparing for the launch of short- and mid-range missiles and transporting its special commandos toward the frontline regions. Its navy deployed some 70 percent of its submarines from their bases, while it also put into combat position a number of hovercrafts to be used to infiltrate South Korea’s border islands.All these movements indicated that the North might try to launch surprise attacks to secure a victory in a rapid and decisive manner, should a contingency occur.South Korean and U.S. military authorities are reportedly considering reflecting on their observations of the North’s military movements as they seek to reorganize their wartime operations procedures in line with shifts in the security environment.Observers say Pyongyang’s latest employment of the brinkmanship tactic also yielded an unwanted phenomenon in the South: strengthening the unity among South Koreans, who have often been deeply divided over North Korea issues, and as a result pushing up public support for President Park Geun-hye. The brinkmanship has also strained Pyongyang’s ties with Beijing, analysts say, given that the spike in cross-border tensions could have dampened the festive mood in China ahead of its ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.

""For the second-half of this year, China's foreign trade situation will face more severity than we expected,"" China's commerce ministry spokesman Shen Danyang told reporters during a regular press briefing. Shen said the Chinese economy is also facing ""a lot of uncertainty,"" but did not elaborate further. The Chinese central bank devalued its tightly-controlled yuan currency last week, letting the yuan fall by the most in nearly two decades. Following disappointing economic data, the surprise move triggered fears of a currency war because a weak yuan helps boost Chinese exports overseas, while deepening worries over the health of the world's second-largest economy. Before last week's major devaluation, the yuan's value against the U.S. dollar had been barely changed, but the yuan lost about 3 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

It showed that 17.8 percent of Korean teens whose parents both smoke were smoking as of last year. Meanwhile, only 4.3 percent of teenagers with nonsmoking parents were smoking.The study also found that Korean teen smokers are more influenced by their mothers than fathers. A total of 13.6 percent of teenagers with smoking mothers but without smoking fathers were smoking last year, while only 6.4 percent of those with smoking fathers but without smoking mothers were doing the same.Korean teens who smoke were also significantly influenced by their friends and siblings. While only 0.8 percent of Korean teens whose close friends don’t smoke were smoking last year, 13.5 percent of those whose friends smoke picked up the habit. Also, 15.8 percent of teens whose siblings smoke followed suit, compared to 4.27 percent of those without smoking siblings.  A South Korean teenager whose parents are both smokers is more than four times as likely to smoke as a teenager with nonsmoking parents, a government report showed. (123RF)The report also showed that the smoking rate of teenagers who attend schools that focus on job training was significantly higher than those who attend schools that concentrate on academics. The smoking rate for students who attend vocational schools was 25.6 percent, while that of students at academic schools was 10.9 percent.Other correlations were found in socioeconomic status of the parents and academic performance. While 11.8 percent of teens who declared a low household income level were smoking, 7.2 percent of those in high-income homes were doing the same. Also, the proportion of smoking teens who said their school performance was low (15.2 percent) was four times higher than those who said they are doing well in school (3.8 percent).Teen smoking was also associated with mental health and teen drinking. The number of teenagers who both drink and smoke was 6.4 times higher than those who drink but don’t smoke. Smoking teenagers were also 1.9 times more likely to be depressed and 1.4 times more likely to skip their breakfasts than nonsmoking teens. According to the U.S.’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, teen smokers are more likely to use illegal drugs, and about one-third of them will continue to smoke and die later in life from a smoking-related illness.South Korea is home to almost 10 million smokers, and an estimated 57,000 die each year due to smoking-related diseases including lung cancer. Last year, it had one of the highest smoking rates for adult males among the nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at 43.7 percent, surpassing the OECD average of 26 percent. The parliament last year approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking.

The country’s series of transformations throughout its history are mirrored in changes witnessed in the education system. In the midst of the country’s rapid development, Koreans sought education as the way to dig their way out of poverty.South Korea is now famous for having one of the fiercest education fevers in the world. About 67.1 percent of those aged 25-34 have received tertiary education as of this year, the highest rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.A competitive social atmosphere and overzealous parents with the conviction that a good college diploma is a prerequisite to a good life has led to the mushrooming private tutoring culture here that threatens the integrity of public education.But in 1948, three years removed from the country’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule, the fledgling South Korean government’s priority in education was to get rid of Japanese influence. Under Japan’s rule, students were prohibited from learning Korean language and history, and instead were taught about values and knowledge promoted by the Japanese government, according to “A Study on 100 Years of Korea’s Modern Education” by the Korean Educational Development Institute.Korea’s own modern education system was finalized on March 20, 1951, consisting of six years of elementary school, three years each of middle school and high school, and four years of higher education.In the early stages, the focus was to provide as many educational opportunities as possible. In 1945, there were some 1.67 million students in South Korea, which marked over a 60 percent increase from the year before.A compulsory education plan, which at the time targeted children aged 6-12, was suggested in 1946 and implemented by 1954. The rapid increase in students resulted in packed classrooms, forcing schools to conduct their classes in double shifts. The issue of overpopulated classrooms lingered on, and only in 1995 did the average number of elementary school students per class drop below 40 to 36.4. The higher education sector also grew. The number of colleges more than doubled from 19 in 1956 to 42 three years later, and rose to 86 by 1961.  Students participate in an abacus class in this 1950s file photo (Photo courtesy of Gyeongsangbuk-do Education Research Institute)Then-President Park Chung-hee, who rose to power after a 1961 military coup, retained firm control over the education system during his 16-year rule, particularly over higher education. Pedagogy that was not in keeping with the administration’s views was quickly banned and their practitioners were reprimanded by the officials, according to Chun Sung-eun, a veteran educator and former principal at Geochang High School and Geochang, South Gyeongsang Province.Nationalism and patriotism were emphasized, and in 1968, the Education Ministry mandated anticommunist lessons to be conducted for all students for an hour each week. Such emphasis was intended to ensure the stability of the Park’s rule, the KEDI report said. The policies conducted during the 1960s and 1970s had also fixated on the system based on control, supervision and the top-down ordering of the authorities, the report added.But these were also the times when the government set out to abolish the school pecking order. From 1969 to 1971, the government abolished the middle school entrance exam, and banned high schools from conducting their own entrance exams in 1994. The 1980s and 1990s paved the way for a movement that is still ongoing today ― provincial autonomy of education.While Park’s assassination in the 1979 was only followed by iron-fisted leader Chun Doo-hwan, the democratization movement that raged on throughout the decade had eventually forced Chun to reinstate direct presidential elections.Teachers, for their part, also set out to claim their rights. In 1986, the Secondary School Teachers’ Conference of the YMCAs of Korea demanded that teachers should be free from political pressure while education bodies should be given autonomy from the government. In 1991, legislators passed a law that allowed education autonomy for local education offices. There are currently 17 education offices in major cities and provinces in Korea that act as the highest education authority in their respective regions, although they are still under the authority of the Education Ministry.Former President Kim Young-sam initiated the “5.31 Education Reform” in 1995, which stressed education to be more “consumer-based,” and emphasized competition and autonomy.“The basic idea behind the reform was to induce competition among each schools to produce a quality education service, based on the autonomy,” Ahn Byung-young, who was an education minister for two years during the Kim administration, wrote in his 2015 book. But he added that the reform had inherent limitations as the push toward autonomy was ironically carried out in an authoritarian, top-down method. The policies were fragmented and not coherent enough to fulfill the general purpose of the reform, and the government failed to provide sufficient incentives for teachers and public officials in the ministry, who were to be the main drivers of the reform.Among the notable education policies by the following Kim Dae-jung administration was its attempt to overhaul the college admissions process by banning three of its major elements in 1999: ranking high schools, admissions based on financial donations, and schools conducting their own admissions tests for major subjects. It was introduced in pursuit of equality for students, but was criticized for hampering higher education institutes’ autonomy.In 2008, the “admissions officer program” was introduced, which encouraged universities to evaluate students on not just exam scores but various other qualities including extracurricular activities.But with each administration coming up with new plans to revamp the higher education system, new policies only piled more academic pressure onto the students. In addition to the tests and interviews, students were now forced to prepare for other activities as well.Chun Sung-eun, who headed the presidential committee under former President Roh Moo-hyun that devised the admissions officer program, said this was because the policy was hurriedly pursued. The committee had suggested at least eight years to prepare and implement the system, but the idea was realized almost right away by Roh’s successor Lee Myung-bak.Throughout history, authorities’ attempts to bring equality and diversity in education have often ended up having the opposite effect.Foreign language high schools began to pop up in the 1980s as the government pushed to foster students excelling in foreign languages.In 1992, the government designated them and science high schools the status of “special-purpose high schools,” subsequently granting them the right to hold their own admissions processes. By handpicking their own students, these schools gradually rose to the top of the academic pecking order.Autonomous private high schools, introduced in 2010 in pursuit of educational diversity, used the relative freedom to increase the percentage of subjects directly related to college admissions in their curriculum.Since taking the helm last year, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea under the Park Geun-hye administration has emphasized integration as the next frontier for Korean education. “Integration (between fields) is the reality for many of today’s jobs, but the schools teach only individual subjects. The goal right now is to establish a curriculum that will connect all technologies to humanities,” he said in a recent interview with local media.As part of the integrated course, all high school freshmen will have to study science and social studies with a new integrated textbook.But civic groups like World Without Worries About Private Education said the combined textbook is more difficult than the previous ones, fueling concern that the new policy will put more academic pressure on students. While experts agree that further change is needed, they say the government needs to sufficiently prepare policies before implementing them.“The Education Ministry’s plans for improving the high school education are more than sufficient in blind passion, but lack long-term vision,” said Hong Hoo-jo, an education professor at Korea University. He pointed out that the reason the government’s school reform policies failed was because it lacked clear direction, and that reforms in the future would need to pursue diversity in education without discrimination.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","the fiercest education fevers in ,fourth largest economy in asia ,million students in south korea ,the fiercest education fevers ,of the fiercest education fevers","['South Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Modern Education', 'the Korean Educational Development Institute', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'Gyeongsangbuk - do', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Chun Sung - eun', 'Geochang High School', 'the Education Ministry', 'kedi', 'Chun Doo - hwan', 'Chun', 'the Secondary School Teachers ’ Conference of the ymca of Korea', 'Korea', 'the Education Ministry', 'Kim Young - sam', 'Ahn Byung - young', 'Kim', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Chun Sung - eun', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'korean', '“the Education Ministry ’s', 'Hong Hoo - jo', 'Korea University']",13,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.67149746  0.50447071

The disease chiefly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, and is known to be associated with a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine.Among the surveyed caregivers, 20 percent said they were forced to quit their jobs to care for the patients, while almost 70 percent of them said they were under financial distress because of the cost of medical treatment, which mainly provides relief from the symptoms.  Parkinson’s disease chiefly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, and is known to be associated with a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. (Yonhap)Almost 60 percent of them said they found caring for the patient stressful, and 42.6 percent said they were emotionally exhausted. Also, 18.2 percent of them were clinically depressed. According to government data, the number of Korean Parkinson’s disease patients aged 60 or older increased from 14,636 to 26,344 from 2010-2014. The total cost to treat the patients rose dramatically from 91.6 billion won ($77.7 million) to 233.9 billion won in the same time period. “It can be despairing for both the patient and his or her caregiver, because you know that no matter what you do, you cannot cure the disease and it will only worsen as the condition progresses over time,” said Lee Hyun-joong, a caregiver for his wife, who has had Parkinson’s disease for 20 years. The numbers are expected to soar as the nation’s baby boomers ― those born 1955-1963 ― enter their 60s this year, and the current elderly demographic is predicted to double to more than 7.2 million in the next five years.Among the surveyed caregivers, 66 percent were spouses of the patients, while 10.7 percent were the patients’ children. Fourteen percent were other relatives of the patients, while 9.1 percent chose not to reveal their relationship with the patients.Symptoms during the early stages of the disease, such as tremors of the hands and stiffness, can be easily managed with prescribed medications. But patients may not be able to perform any physical movements in the final stage of illness and therefore must live with a caregiver or in a facility that can provide one-on-one care. On top of advanced motor symptoms, patients at this stage may experience hallucinations and greater speaking and memory issues, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia. In Korea, family member caregivers experience greater financial and emotional stress after 10 years, the study showed.Sixty percent of the caregivers who have provided care for more than a decade said they have fewer life options because of their family member’s illness. Also, 75.4 percent said they were struggling financially, while 64.3 percent of those who were caring for patients with mild symptoms said the same. More than 60 percent of them said they were worried about household debt. The study also showed that caregivers feel that there was not enough support available. Almost 40 percent of them said they could not access any information necessary for caring for Parkinson’s disease patients, while 52.1 percent said medical experts were “not helpful at all” with their questions and requests. “Patients with Parkinson’s disease are required to take medicine for the rest of their lives,” said Choi Jin-kyung, the head of the Korean Movement Disorders Society. “There should be more educational and therapy programs for caregivers and more research is needed on why the number of patients of the disease is rising in Korea.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean parkinson disease patients aged ,parkinson disease patients while 52 ,korean parkinson disease patients ,121 korean caregivers whose family ,of korean parkinson disease patients","['south korean', 'the Korean Movement Disorders Society', 'korean', 'Korean', 'Lee Hyun - joong', 'Korea', 'Choi Jin - kyung', 'the Korean Movement Disorders Society', 'Korea', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52014571  0.35053957

The countries who rated lower than Korea on the index included Slovenia (18 percent), Greece (19 percent) and Poland (25 percent). South Korean President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)“Trust in government represents the confidence of citizens and businesses in the actions of governments to do what is right and perceived as fair,” the report said. “Changes in trust levels could be affected by many factors, including the economic outlook, political changes (e.g. elections), or other major events such as disasters or major scandals (e.g. corruption cases).”Although Korea’s latest confidence rate was low, it marked an increase by 10 percentage points since 2007. Meanwhile, the average confidence level in governments across OECD countries dropped by 3.3 percentage points in that period, from 45.2 percent to 41.8 percent from 2007-2014. The steepest declines took place in Slovenia (down 30 percentage points), Finland (29 points) and Spain (27 points).“Restoring trust in governments is essential to reinforce and consolidate the foundations of modern states,” the report said. “It is also a necessary condition for governments to successfully carry out public sector reforms.”The report also showed that only 29 percent of Koreans were confident in their judicial system as of 2013, much lower than the OECD average of 54 percent. Korea’s rate in fact dropped by two percentage points since 2007. According to the OECD, one’s confidence in his or her country’s judicial system is both “an outcome and a key governance dimension, most closely related to integrity.” Absence of a strong rule of law -- the idea that no one, including the government, is above the law and justice is accessible to all -- makes it difficult for states to cultivate peaceful and inclusive societies, the report said. Countries with low confidence in judicial systems are also more likely to generate either speculative investment or low-capital investments, which can threaten national growth and development, it noted.The report also showed that 53 percent of Koreans are satisfied with the country’s education and school system, which is below the OECD average of 67 percent.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","percent of south koreans distrust ,only 29 percent of koreans ,34 percent of the koreans ,percent of koreans are satisfied ,53 percent of koreans are","['South Koreans', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Indonesia', 'Brazil', 'Korea', 'Slovenia', 'Greece', 'Poland', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Slovenia', 'Finland', 'Spain', 'Koreans', 'OECD', 'Korea ’s', 'OECD', 'Koreans', 'OECD', 'Claire Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43108571  0.749147

As twentysomethings have gained more spending power, some universities have rented space within their grounds for commercial establishments such as cafes and convenience stores. Such implementations have sparked debate over whether commercial facilities are there for the students, or to help the universities make more money. Yonsei UniversityThe biggest changes, however, may be those visible in the students. Once, university students were the driving force behind social change, and universities were the epicenter of democracy movements. It was not long ago that university campuses and surrounding areas were enshrouded in tear gas the police deployed to bring demonstrations under control. Chiefs of student bodies were often wanted by the authorities for actions against dictatorial governments; some spent months hiding at religious facilities. These days, students are more concerned about their so-called “specs” -- or specifications, like qualifications and certificates deemed desirable by potential employers -- than social issues. “Back in my day, we were almost required to take part in demonstrations. I think we cared about the country more than today’s kids,” said Park, who attended a university in Seoul in the mid-1980s and declined to be identified further. He added that although he was jailed for a number of months for organizing demonstrations, which led to certain disadvantages in life, he regrets nothing about his actions. “Today’s kids seem to care only about getting a job after graduation. We had the same worries, but still we did more than just look out for ourselves. Universities seem to have lost the romance, and turned into vocational schools.”Ewha Womans UniversityThose who studied even earlier seem to consider students of both today and of the ‘80s self-absorbed. “I considered student activists to be ‘talking on a full stomach,’” said retiree Lee Young-cho, who attended university in the early 1970s.The Korean expression “talking on a full stomach” implies a person’s opinion is formed without actual knowledge of hardship. “Ideals are good, but for people in our time, real-life concerns like graduating as soon as possible to help the family was the bigger concern. Today’s kids, though, seem to be thinking just about themselves.”While older generations may have varying degrees of disdain for university students now, “today’s kids” also have much to say.One recent graduate says there is no romance in university life, saying that she and all of her friends spent their vacations doing internships and getting certificates to prepare for the tough labor market. Still others say that the times dictate how students act. “For us, the future is uncertain, whereas older people knew that better things were in store for them,” a student of a Seoul-based university said, declining to be named. “So, although students focus (on academics and qualifications), if we are not fully engaged in each moment, there is little meaning to day-to-day life. That’s why (today’s students) try very hard to find small pleasures.” By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","country economy grew university education ,money yonsei universitythe biggest changes ,universities make more money yonsei ,korean war universities were home ,more money yonsei universitythe biggest","['Korea', 'Kyung Hee UniversityBut', 'Seoul', 'Womans UniversityThose', 'Lee Young - cho', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Choi He - suk']",2,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.98884666  0.74694842

The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases encouraged foreigners to receive five vaccines -- Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A, MMR, chicken pox and DTaP, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough. This is the first time Korean doctors have released a list of recommended vaccines for the growing number of expat residents here. As of this year, more than 32 million foreigners have either entered or left Korea while over 1.7 million are residing in the country.The move also came after the Middle East respiratory syndrome recently hit the country, infecting nearly 190 people and killing 35. Korea has had the second-largest number of MERS cases after Saudi Arabia, the originating country. On Thursday, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a nationwide Japanese encephalitis warning as over 500 mosquitoes carrying the Japanese encephalitis virus were found in Busan. The health agency issued the advisory once the Japanese encephalitis virus-borne mosquito was spotted. The alert level will be raised if over 500 mosquitoes are detected in 30 regions across the country or a case of infection is officially reported. This year, the advisory was raised in April. Since 2005, 114 Japanese encephalitis cases have been confirmed, with 26 reported last year. While 95 percent of the cases do not show disease symptoms, some can have fever, headache, diarrhea or even fall into a coma, the authorities said.Free Japanese encephalitis vaccines are available at public health offices for children aged 1 to 12.The number of hepatitis A cases has sharply decreased in the country since the 1970s, but started to rebound in the 2000s. MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella -- expanded to Korea after it became prevalent in some Southeast Asian countries. Korea was designated as measles-free in 2014 by the World Health Organization.  Whooping cough has also been on the rise with about 230 people infected in 2012, jumping fourfold in three years.

Kim Moo-sung, who said during his U.S. trip last week that his party would push for all schools to use government-published textbooks to address what they consider to be a “biased view” imposed by some private publishers’ progressive textbooks. “I think that left-wing flanks have a wrong sense of history and they are trying to instill their biased view in the young people who will lead our country,” Kim had said.Currently, eight private publishing companies print history textbooks for middle and high schools after getting approval from the government. The schools then can choose any of the eight publishers’ textbooks. Elementary schools have been using state-authorized history textbooks throughout.Hwang said the government could set up a body to publish Korean history textbooks, if necessary. And the body would select the writers of the history textbooks and a separate deliberation committee would review their contents to see if they are fit to print, according to the Education Ministry.At issue are certain omissions in some of the eight history textbooks on topics such as the 1950-53 Korean War, the ministry explained. Some of the history textbooks did not mention the killings of civilians by North Korean soldiers while stating similar killings by South Korean and U.S. troops, said Kim Yeon-seok, a ministry official handling the matter.The government plans to decide by September whether to set up the publication review body.The government was in charge of publishing history textbooks from 1973 to 2009. In 2010, it began allowing approved private publishing companies to print history textbooks.The rival parties, meanwhile, showed mixed reactions to the plan.“While in theory there are eight history textbooks available, in reality, from each student’s point of view, they are only learning from one textbook,” said Rep. Kang Eun-hee of the Saenuri Party.“When one specific textbook is chosen, it is still difficult to learn various views regardless of the textbook being biased or not,” she said, adding that in such a case, gathering diverse experts into creating one textbook with balanced contents may be more efficient.To concerns that state meddling could become more convenient, Kwon rebuked by saying that attention paid to one textbook instead of eight would disable full interference by a specific political party or ideology.Main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Youn Kwan-suk, on the other hand, criticized the move as a highly political tactic using the “remnant of the ’70s and the Yushin era,” referring to the dictatorial government.“The remarks (by Hwang and Kim) are aimed to instigate a battle of ideologies, not to deliver the history as it is,” Yoon said.Claiming that state-authorized textbooks at high schools rarely exist in developed countries, Youn said that while any biased contents should be fixed, it is wrong to overhaul the entire textbook system just for that reason.From news reports","korean history textbooks if necessary ,expanding state published history textbooks ,to publish korean history textbooks ,companies to print history textbooks ,publish korean history textbooks","['Hwang Woo - yea', 'korean', 'Hwang', 'Yonhap News', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'Hwang', 'korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Kim Yeon - seok', 'Kang Eun - hee', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Kwon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Youn Kwan - suk', 'Yushin', 'Hwang', 'Kim', 'Yoon', 'Youn']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26451448  0.7478357

It is part of the government’s plan to tackle the youth unemployment issue, which has become so severe that the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy leader Rep. Moon Jae-in called it a “national crisis.” As of June, the unemployment rate for those aged 15-29 was 10.2 percent. It marked a 10 percent increase from the year before.The plan’s focal point is the Program for Industry Needs-Matched Education, or PRIME. The program will provide about 5 billion won-20 billion won ($4.3 million-$17.3 million) to each university or college conducting a restructuring process. Each university is encouraged to freely upsize or downsize their departments and even swap department size quotas with other institutions. “How the reform will be carried out is basically up to each school. The ministry will provide the data on the number and type of jobs expected to be needed in the future, while colleges and universities will decide how to revamp their academic structure,” said a ministry official. But education circles are concerned that the reform will ultimately result in colleges downsizing their humanities departments, whose graduates have struggled to gain relevant employment.“The ministry appears to be saying that it will increase support for departments and universities that have high employment rates,” said a professor from a Seoul-based university, suspecting that the ministry has given in to demands of the industry.The ministry itself appears to be mindful of the criticism that the new program is overly focused on the corporate sector. It even tweaked its original name from “higher education program to meet industry’s needs” to avoid such suspicion.While the name change may have saved face, the essence of the program has virtually stayed the same since it was introduced in June. Boosting the function of colleges and universities to better aid students’ job-seeking efforts was a key point emphasized by Han Seok-su, head of the ministry’s university policy office, and it remains so in the finalized plan.  Students at a Seoul-based university are studying in the university library in this March 2 file photo. (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)Over the past few years, such emphasis on employment has led to the demise of the humanities department. One of the major criteria used by the Education Ministry’s college evaluation since 2011 is the employment rate of their graduates. The universities who finish poorly in the evaluation are restricted from participating in state-funded projects. Government subsidies such as the state scholarship program can also be reduced.Such focus on the employment rate has pushed local universities and colleges to trim their humanities departments, which have traditionally done poorly in the employment category. According to data from private education firm Haneul Education, the employment rate of humanities majors was 42.1 percent in 2015, lower than departments related to medicine, engineering, social studies, business, education, natural sciences and even arts. The employment rate for medicine-related and engineering majors were the highest of the lot at 66.8 percent and 66.7 percent, respectively.From 2003 to 2013, the number of departments rose from 9,542 to 11,126, according to Education Ministry data provided by Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. During the same time, the number of departments related to humanities decreased by 1.7 percent. In his recently released book, “Colleges That Became Monsters,” Pak No-ja, a Russian-born professor at the University of Oslo in Norway, criticized the rush to discard humanities departments. He said getting rid of a department just because not enough students applied is unprecedented anywhere else in the world.The Education Ministry claims it can address the expected side effects by introducing measures to promote humanities, which it will implement in the latter half of this year to carry out in a two-track approach along with PRIME. Humanities classes will be provided as general education courses to all students, while humanities students will get basic technology and science-related education. The officials said it will introduce humanities-related jobs that are expected to be prominent in the future. But academics point out the plan lacks any incentive for universities and colleges to keep open their humanities departments. If anything, it practically invites colleges to slash them by enabling, and even encouraging the restructuring process with cash incentives, they said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","south korean government new education ,korean government new education policy ,finalized plan students at seoul ,korean government new education ,plan students at seoul","['south korean', 'Education Ministry', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Program for Industry Needs - Matched Education', 'Seoul', 'Han Seok - su', 'Seoul', 'Kim Myung - sub', 'the Korea herald)over', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Haneul Education', 'Education Ministry', 'Kim Tae - nyeon', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Pak No - ja', 'Russian', 'the University of Oslo', 'Norway', 'the Education Ministry']",13,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.15531521  0.23818462

North Korea has already said it is not interested in Iran-style nuclear talks.

People drink water from the tap, swim in city harbors and ride bicycles everywhere. The world’s happiest nation is also one of the greenest, not accidentally, and aims to create a “fully green economy” by 2050. In a lecture on July 11, Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann said Denmark and Korea should invigorate their partnership for a shared sustainable future by turning the threat of climate change into resourceful opportunities. “Our experience shows that through persistent and active policies prioritizing renewable energy, it is possible to sustain high economic growth,” Lehmann told students of the Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership Foundation Korea at Kyung Hee University. “It is critical for the young generation to lead the future of green growth by setting the direction of development.”  Students of the Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership Foundation Korea listen to a lecture by Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann at Kyung Hee University on July 11. Joel Lee/The Korea HeraldGreen growth does not have to come at a cost to business, asserted Lehmann, adding that jobs could be created by promoting green technologies and protecting the environment. Since signing the “Energy 2020” agreement in 2012, which aims for a 100 percent green economy, 4,700 jobs were created in Denmark by the end of 2013. By 2020, the archipelago nation would produce half its electricity from renewable sources through additional 6,000 to 8,000 “green jobs.”“The transition required a broad consensus and political will,” the ambassador stressed. “Public opinion has been very important, with our nongovernmental organizations engaging in debates, setting agendas and shaping policies.”The role of cities has been equally essential. As more than 70 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions come from cities, Copenhagen has committed to be the world’s first CO2-neutral capital by 2025.The Kingdom of Denmark -- which consists of Denmark, The Faroe Islands and Greenland -- has a long tradition of investing in and developing resource-efficient solutions for energy, environment and climate. As a market leader in green technologies, Danish companies have exported their innovations worldwide, spearheading the global sustainable effort. Denmark aims for over $15 billion in exports of green technologies by 2020. The country’s transformation followed the 1973 global oil crisis, which doubled the price of oil and raised alarm bells about national energy security. The first national energy plan was formulated in 1976 with a focus on reducing energy consumption and oil dependence, and after the second oil crisis in 1979, an energy ministry was inaugurated. Denmark set a plan to “decouple” energy consumption and economic growth in 1981. Since then, the country’s economy has grown by 80 percent, while energy consumption has remained the same and carbon dioxide emissions have decreased. The Nordic nation now has one of the lowest levels of per capita energy consumption in the developed world, with the highest efficiency. Wind power produces 20 percent of total energy, and is expected to generate half of its electricity by 2020. “Where Denmark has been a ‘first mover’ in the green transition, Korea has proven to be a ‘fast mover,’” Lehmann noted, referring to the Korean-Danish Green Growth Alliance established in 2011 for increased cooperation in government, research and trade. “Our alliance shows that we can share our experiences and draw upon each other’s strengths.” On the “green transition index,” Denmark outperforms Korea in energy, environment, diplomacy, commercialization, investment, innovation, agriculture, tourism, biodiversity and climate adaptation; and Korea tops Denmark in fisheries, forestry, transport and construction. The fifth meeting of the KDGGA will be held this fall in Denmark, and the Global Green Growth Forum will host a summit in Copenhagen next year. Denmark has taken a nonnuclear path since the 1980s following a parliamentary decision. Sweden’s nuclear plant across the sea from Copenhagen triggered public debates about the safety and security of nuclear power.“Looking directly at a nuclear plant across the sea raised doubts about having the technology at home,” the ambassador explained, adding that civilian resistance had been forceful. “Nuclear energy will always pose challenges in safety and cost, as its wastes must be contained for over 100,000 years.”Lehmann claimed that the nuclear debate was related to the price of electricity, which he argued was a “political matter” as much as an “economic matter.”“The price of electricity was determined socially and politically in Denmark,” he emphasized. “This is where public debate can happen. Despite opposition, we set in motion priorities and incentives for change.”Raising the price of electricity would incentivize companies and people to save energy, the ambassador argued, while pointing out that electricity in Korea was cheaper than in many other countries. “The question is how cheap should it be? This is a political question for Korea,” he said. “In Denmark, there was much skepticism in the beginning, but people stuck to their visions and policies, because they believed it was the right thing to do.”The Scandinavian country is currently a global leader in the “circular economy,” which runs on recycled biological nutrients. The Kalundborg Symbiosis in Denmark trades residual industrial products -- steam, dust, gas, heat and slurry -- through public-private partnerships. Danish company Grundfos is a world-leading pump manufacturer in heating, air-conditioning and sewage. It provides circulator pumps to 90 percent of Korea’s skyscrapers. Wind power generator Vesta supplies over 48,000 turbines in more than 70 countries, covering 70 percent of plants in Korea. In the ocean industry, the Maersk Group, the world’s largest containership and supply vessel operator, has strong cooperation with Korean companies.

Project,” at Seoul Museum of Art in central Seoul next Tuesday. The exhibition, which runs until Sept. 29, features a wide variety of artwork including oil paintings, posters and stamps, which were made by North Koreans and collected by one South Korean and two Dutch collectors.The organizers also plan to use the piano for a musical performance with the National Chorus of Korea on Aug. 15, Korea’s Liberation Day. They are in talks with the chorus to determine how the piano will be used for the commemorative performance.GongMyoung, a renowned Korean performing arts group and producer of creative musical instruments, has undertaken what was initially seen as an impossible process -- building a piano made of rusty, pointy wires that were collected in cooperation with a frontline army unit.The group has built two pianos with the border wires . All of the wires used in the piano for display are from the border fence while some changes were made to one of the pianos to allow it a greater range and sound accuracy.“Though it was a challenging undertaking for us to create a piano with the barbed wire, it was a rewarding and very meaningful process given that we could create a musical harmony for unification through the barbed wire of the truce line, a symbol of the tragic war and longstanding cross-border standoff,” said Park Seung-won, the leader of GongMyoung.Established in 1997, GongMyoung has undertaken a series of challenging tasks to make unique instruments such as an electric “janggu” (an hourglass-shaped Korean drum). The projects were born out of their hopes to “internationalize” Korean music.However, the creation of a piano using barbed wire was a physical challenge, Park noted.“The tension of the border wire is very strong, not to mention the rough, sharp points of the barbed wire. Everybody who was involved in the making of the piano has suffered cuts on their fingers,” he said.“The toughest part was to get the piano to produce the exact sounds we needed. We initially aimed to give the piano a range of a little over one octave. But we have given it up to two octaves and produced a very unique sound,” he added.The project to make the piano was first proposed by Cheil Worldwide Inc. as part of the firm’s efforts to advance its cause of corporate social responsibility. The firm is to release its promotional materials about the piano later this week.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","the korea herald the piano ,seoul next tuesday the exhibition ,plan to unveil the piano ,korea herald the piano of ,korea herald the piano","['the Unification Ministry', 'Cheil Worldwide Inc.', 'Samsung Group', 'inter - korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Piano of Unification', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul Museum of Art', 'Seoul', 'North Koreans', 'south korean', 'dutch', 'the National Chorus of Korea', 'Korea ’s Liberation Day', 'korean', 'Park Seung - won', 'GongMyoung', 'GongMyoung', 'korean', 'korean', 'Park', 'Cheil Worldwide Inc.', 'Song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.41292557  0.09203396

It hopes to connect rail and road networks from South Korea's southern port city of Busan to west Europe.The upcoming Eurasia Express expedition is expected to help raise public awareness of South Korea's vision both at home and abroad, officials here said.Under the slogan, ""One Dream, One Eurasia,"" participants will gather at Seoul Station on Tuesday from various cities in South Korea by train.They include government officials, lawmakers, artists, academics and businessmen.Split into two groups, they will fly to Vladivostok and Beijing later in the day, respectively, with a cross-peninsula train tour blocked by the heavily-armed border between the two Koreas.With nearly 200 people on board, a train will run from Vladivostok to Berlin, Germany, passing through several other Russian cities and Warsaw, Poland.The other is scheduled to travel from Beijing to Irkutsk, Russia, then the passengers will transfer to the main train for the rest of the tour.The journey is to end in Berlin on Aug. 2, covering a total of 14,400 kilometers, or 8,948 miles, over six countries including Mongolia and Belarus. (Yonhap)""The Eurasia Express project is not a mere show. It is a program to reflect the strategic importance of a Eurasia railway,"" Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said in a written interview with Yonhap News Agency.His ministry is co-sponsoring the expedition together with Korea Railroad Corp.Yun plans to join the tour on the Warsaw-Berlin leg of the route.""South Korea hopes for the creation of an economic block for peaceful exchanges and co-prosperity through the Eurasia Initiative,"" he said. ""Taking advantage of its geographical location as the east gate of Eurasia, South Korea needs to play a catalyst role.""The minister said the train event will serve as an important chance to publicize Seoul's vision and effort for a new Eurasia era.Indeed, South Korea is seeking to join several related rail projects such as the Trans-Siberian Railway, Trans-China Railway and the Trans-Mongolian Railway.The biggest hurdle is military tension between South and North Korea. No train is allowed to run through the demilitarized zone bisecting the peninsula.Yun pointed out South Korea has been like an ""island"" for the past seven decades, a legacy of the Cold War.A railway between the two Koreas was briefly reconnected in 2007 for cargo services, riding on the mood of reconciliation at that time.It was severed again, however, in late 2008 after the launch of the conservative Lee Myung-bak government in the South and the North's provocations including a nuclear test and a long-range rocket launch.Experts agreed the Eurasia Initiative is a pipe dream without improvement in inter-Korean relations.""Pushing for such an initiative is good itself, but we have to see a bigger picture. In the end, South Korea should open the way to run through North Korea,"" Hong Hyun-ik, senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute said.Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University, said the Eurasia Express expedition is meaningful itself as an opportunity to demonstrate South Koreans' aspiration for rapprochement with North Korea and re-connection of the railway with Europe.It coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of Korea from Japan's 35-year colonial rule.South Korea also marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations with Russia and Mongolia.

Koryolink, North Korea’s tourist-only data service launched in 2013, the same year that the use of mobile phones by foreigners, was finally permitted within its borders. Internet access is not cheap: A prepaid 3G SIM card costs $80 and data costs extra, with some reports putting it at $200 for 2 gigabytes. Access to Instagram was briefly blocked last month in what North Korea watchers think was an attempt to cover up the fire at the Koryo Hotel in Pyongyang. The platform is now accessible again.  Locals dance in Moranbong Park in Pyongyang (Simon Cockerell)Not many people are active on Instagram while exploring North Korea. The few that have banded together to form the project @EverydayDPRK, a collective account where a number of verified Instagram users collate their photographs, which has attracted 56,800 followers. The collective was founded by David Guttenfelder, a National Geographic Society Fellow who helped open the Associated Press bureau in Pyongyang in 2011, and contributors include the operators of Koryo Tours and Uri Tours, as well as expats living and working in North Korea. Simon Cockerell, the general manager of Koryo Tours, is due to visit North Korea for the 144th time this month. His Instagram account, @simonkoryo, depicts his many encounters throughout his travels across the country, with pictures of streetscapes, public spaces like parks and squares, and locals going about their jobs. In addition to current images, the company has recently launched @koryotours to publish their archive of photographs taken since tours began in 1993. Each of Cockerell’s photographs is eagerly dissected by his followers, intrigued by the latest chance at sighting the commonplace in the DPRK. Many of the posts are also met with surprise, with people blanching at the portrayal of North Koreans going about everyday activities. “I think people simply don’t expect to see a picture of anything looking at all like ‘normality’ from North Korea,“ he said. “If they see anything a little more mundane, such as someone eating an ice cream, some children playing, someone riding a bike … while what we see is far from all there is that exists in the country, it is still a side of life being lived, and when we see it we realize that the many millions of people in the country do other things than march in uniform.” A North Korean soldier poses with a camera. Koryo ToursShin Choi has also faced these reactions. A Canadian lecturer who spent six months teaching English at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, Choi posted images of his experiences in the city on his account @shinchoi. “Some of the comments that I get are critical of my photographs … because of the hyper exposure of the same types of images we see in the mass media: poverty, or the regime, or the military. And when we don’t see that, we ask, why isn’t that there? Well it is powerful, it is there, but people still live day-to-day lives within that system, as anyone else would in the world.”Foreigners posting photos inside North Korea are by no means roaming freely. They are accompanied at all times by a guide, and only have access to certain areas of the country. While the photographs that people are able to capture are limited to what has been deemed appropriate for foreigners to see, the account holders maintain the value in sharing these rare images.Cockerell reflects that some access is far better than none. “We see one side of life and not the deepest, darkest parts of the country. But what we see is not a performance made for foreigners; we see real life and real people going about their real business. It’s a tiny glimpse, but it is a real glimpse.”By Louisa Studman, Intern reporter (louisastudman@heraldcorp.com)","instagram while exploring north korea ,app instagram has become valuable ,on instagram while exploring north ,gigabytes access to instagram ,for gigabytes access to instagram","['Instagram', 'North Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'SIM', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Moranbong Park', 'Pyongyang', 'Instagram', 'North Korea', 'David Guttenfelder', 'National Geographic Society Fellow', 'Associated Press', 'Pyongyang', 'Koryo Tours', 'Uri Tours', 'North Korea', 'Simon Cockerell', 'Koryo Tours', 'North Korea', 'Cockerell', 'North Koreans', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Koryo ToursShin Choi', 'canadian', 'Pyongyang University of Science and Technology', 'Choi', 'North Korea', 'Cockerell', 'Louisa Studman']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92258471  0.05297626

The results show that the high cost of education and poor work-life balance of young parents were among the reasons behind the nation’s low fertility rate, the researcher said. The study, organized by Kim Mee-sook at the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, analyzed how parents in nine different countries viewed parenthood in 2012.  Koreans feel burdened by the cost of child care, a study showed.(Yonhap)The 18,063 participants were asked to rate their agreement on a scale of 1 to 5 -- 1 being the least and 5 being the most -- on a total of six statements on parenthood, on top of a number of basic questions. The countries surveyed were Sweden, South Korea, the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, China, France, the U.K. and Germany.Among the countries, Korea had the lowest fertility rate in 2011 after Taiwan, marking 1.24 births per woman. Ironically, Koreans wanted the largest number of kids among the nine countries, claiming it would be ideal for a household to have an average of 2.72 children.Koreans also marked 4.26 out of 5 on a statement that said “watching children grow up is life’s greatest joy,” which was lower than the average of the nine countries, which was 4.34. Also, it was Koreans who most strongly felt being a parent required sacrificing one’s personal freedom, rating 3.3 out of 5. The average of the nine nations was 2.84.Korean parents also rated higher than the average on statements that said “children are a financial burden to their parents” and “having children restricts the employment and career chances of one or both parents.”Kim said the results showed that Koreans chose not to have children not because they don’t want them, but because they feel there isn’t enough support for child care. “There should be more welfare programs for child care,” she said. “Programs that ensure parents’ leisure time also seem to be necessary.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","2012 koreans feel burdened by ,korean parents also rated higher ,in 2012 koreans feel burdened ,2012 koreans feel burdened ,parent limits their career chances","['South Koreans', 'Kim Mee - sook', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Koreans', 'Sweden', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'France', 'U.K.', 'Germany', 'Korea', 'Taiwan', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Claire Lee']",2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.74429804  0.42863393

""Uncertainty surrounding the Greek debt talks has also increased.""The ministry said the slow pace of the global economic recovery and its effect on South Korean exports have hurt industrial output and business investment in May, dealing a blow to the automobile, semiconductor and machinery sectors. Exports fell 10.9 percent in May and were down 1.8 percent on-year in June.Investment in machinery, a key barometer of growth, contracted in May compared to the month before, although construction-related investment rebounded from minus territory.The ministry said that low international oil prices are contributing to low inflation numbers. The country's consumer prices grew less than 1 percent from January to June fueling deflation worries.On the plus side, the ministry said 379,000 jobs were created in May up from 216,000 the year before. Housing prices rose 0.4 percent on-month in June, along with modest gains in land prices.Despite a drop in exports, the country's trade surplus soared to US$36.5 billion in the first five months of this year, from $14.5 billion the year before.Retail sales for May stayed flat on-month after growing 1.4 percent in April, but gained 3.5 percent compared to the year prior. For the first quarter, private consumption rose 1.5 percent on-year and was up 0.6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014.For June, department store sales nosedived 10.7 percent on-year, with discount chain sales dropping 9.7 percent. The losses reflect the impact of MERS on consumption, the ministry said.Sales of domestically produced passenger vehicles, on the other hand, jumped 9.4 percent on-year in June, with sales of gasoline and diesel fuel, another barometer of spending, falling 2.9 percent, according to the report.

Instead of rice seedlings standing in flooded paddies, the baked earth is cracked. A big lake that used to supply surrounding farmland with water is almost completely dry. There has been almost no rain in this part of the country, an hour's drive from the capital Pyongyang and one of the country's main rice-growing regions, according to farmers and local officials interviewed by The Associated Press. While the situation in this area visited by the AP looks grim, it is unclear how severe the drought is in the rest of the country.   ""Because of the drought continuing from last year, lots of land has been damaged,'' said Sin Ung Hyon, chairman of the Unpha County Farm Management Committee. North Korea severely limits outside access, so state media's recent claim of the worse drought in a century has faced widespread skepticism. Pyongyang, eager for the possibility of outside assistance, has used similar phrasing to describe past droughts, and officials in rival South Korea have said there's no way to confirm exactly what's happening. North Korean authorities agreed to a request by the AP to revisit this area, which the government had highlighted previously as particularly hard-hit. An AP video journalist was accompanied by local officials.  Outsiders worry that that there could be trouble ahead for the country, which has a long history of poverty and mismanagement. Critics say the authoritarian government is more willing to spend huge sums of money on its missile and nuclear programs than on infrastructure and basic welfare. The United Nations has warned that the lack of rain this year could cause further hunger. Hong Yong-pyo, South Korea's minister of unification, told lawmakers this week that Seoul was willing to consider providing aid to North Korea to help with the drought, although Pyongyang has yet to make any official aid request.  Farmers interviewed in this part of North Korea said they are turning away from rice farming, and are planting corn and trying to tap underground water sources to keep what rice seedlings there are wet and healthy. But no rain would mean grim prospects even for the corn.  ""With the hardship this year, farmers have a lot of difficulties in trying to make the farm work, because we haven't had this kind of experience before,'' said Kim Gyong Nam, a work team leader at Unpha town farm. ""This year, because of the severe drought, we could not do rice farming, so we ploughed the land again and had to plant corn.''  Jane Howard, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program in Rome, said North Korea has faced water shortages since late last year because of low rain and snowfall. This could cause serious problems later this year because so much of the country's food production normally comes from crops planted from June to July. Seoul's Unification Ministry said that North Korea's rice and potato production could decline by as much as 20 percent compared to average years should the rain shortage continue. While North Korea's precipitation last year was its lowest since 2000, the country avoided a significant drop in food production because of its strong supply of irrigation water and the lack of floods in the summer, the ministry said.North Korea's food production is regularly affected by droughts or floods that expose the inefficiencies of its agricultural system, which is heavily reliant on foreign aid, artificial irrigation and terraced fields that are vulnerable to torrential rain.  A devastating North Korean famine during the mid-1990s is believed to have killed hundreds of thousands of people, though the exact number is disputed. The famine may have also loosened the state's strict control over the economy by damaging its public food distribution system and paving the way for private economic activity in unofficial markets.

(The Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Colonialism in Korea)At least 846 Koreans were forced by Japan to work in overseas locations including Sakhalin, the island off the far eastern end of Russia, during the 1910-45 colonial period, a government fact-finding panel said Friday.The Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilization under Japanese Colonialism in Korea under the Prime Minister’s Office said that it had put these Korean victims on its official “list of forcibly mobilized Koreans” for the first time.  Based on its analysis of some 135 historical documents from two state historical archives in Sakhalin, the commission discovered that at least 846 Koreans were forced to work for more than 10 Japanese companies in at least 18 locations including Sakhalin. Those victims were put on the wanted list of the then-Toyohara Police Station in southern Sakhalin from 1941-44 as they fled the sites of slave labor in the 18 locations including those in Japan, the committee said. “The victims that we discovered fled and were put on the wanted list afterwards. We secured a considerable amount of these wanted lists, and this would help prove the forced nature of Japan’s state entity (with regard to slave labor),” an official of the panel said, declining to be identified.  “This is the very case in which Korean victims actively opposed and resisted slave labor.”The committee’s list of these victims is expected to be used as crucial evidence in ongoing or future court procedures involving Korean victims and Japanese firms for which they worked.Last month, an appeals court in Gwangju, southwestern Korea, ruled in favor of five Korean victims of colonial-era forced labor, ordering Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to give a combined amount of 500 million won ($445,990) to the victims in compensation. The victims that the committee has confirmed were found to have worked in Sakhalin and 17 Japanese prefectures including Hokkaido, Yamanashi, Shizuoka, Hyogo, Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Fukushima, Kyoto and Kanagawa. The issue of forced labor recently returned to the public spotlight as Japan pushed to put 23 sites of its Meiji-era industrial revolution on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List without explaining that slave labor took place at seven of the sites.This weekend, the World Heritage Committee will make its decision over the fate of the sites during its session in Bonn, Germany.Seoul and Tokyo have engaged in negotiations over the issue, with Seoul demanding that if the sites are designated as World Heritage sites, Tokyo should clearly present the historical facts about the slave labor.The two sides are nearing an agreement to reveal the dark side of the sites’ history should the sites gain World Heritage status, Seoul officials have said.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","list of forcibly mobilized koreans ,five korean victims of colonial ,korean victims and japanese firms ,846 koreans were forced by ,forcibly mobilized koreans for the","['the Commission on Verification', 'Koreans', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'the Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilization', 'japanese Colonialism', 'Korea', 'Prime Minister ’s Office', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'korean', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Mitsubishi Heavy Industries', 'japanese', 'Hokkaido', 'Yamanashi', 'Shizuoka', 'Aomori', 'Akita', 'Fukushima', 'Kyoto', 'Kanagawa', 'Japan', 'the World Heritage Committee', 'Bonn', 'Germany', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Seoul', 'World Heritage', 'Tokyo', 'World Heritage', 'Seoul', 'Song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 5.          3.          0.         ... -0.26310423  0.17395659

(Yonhap)For example, if a certain university has higher competency in its engineering department than another university, the two can reach an agreement so that the former will be allocated with larger student quota for the said department. The latter, in exchange, would get an increased quota for another department. The exchange would only occur within universities that are near each other.The specifics for the plan, including the budget, will be announced sometime in July.Education authorities compared the scheme to the mergers and acquisitions process. “Each university can prioritize what they can do best and coordinate the number of students for each department accordingly,” said Lee Seung-bok, the director-general of the university support bureau at the ministry. This is part of the government’s Program for Industry Needs Matched Education (PRIME) project, which is to be implemented next year.About 70.9 percent of high school graduates go on to receive tertiary education, according to a 2014 report by Statistics Korea. But the number of college graduates who are unemployed has consistently climbed since 2012, surpassing 500,000 for the first time this year.According to the government, this is because higher education in Korea does not cater to what industry needs. “The country needs to accurately calibrate the needs of the society and provide plans on meeting such needs,” said Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea. “The main thing is how to reduce the gap between what industry needs and what the universities’ provide.”He said Korean education in the past has tried to “catch up” to developed countries, but now it needs to anticipate how the industry and the world will change in the decades to come.According to the Labor Ministry, there is a shortage of approximately 31,000 natural sciences majors. Han Seok-su, the head of the ministry’s university policy office, said natural sciences majors would be the focus of the student opening and department exchanges. He said the ministry was planning to provide subsidies ranging from 5 billion won ($4.5 million) to 20 billion won to each university participating in the PRIME project.The university reforms based on employment have often led to disadvantages for students not majoring in basic sciences, particularly humanities majors who have struggled in the labor market in the past few years. To prevent the number of humanities majors from plummeting, the ministry will encourage universities to provide additional scholarships for those who study humanities. The budget will come from 200 billion won in subsidies Hwang promised last month to provide financial support for humanities. “The essence of the university is academics, the fruits of which can be reaped as late as a few decades later. I believe the country should be in charge of making sure that this is not neglected,” the minister said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","universities to provide additional scholarships ,korean universities will be allowed ,subsidies hwang promised last month ,the ministry will encourage universities ,gyeongsang province thursday yonhap for","['south korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Korean Council for University Education', 'Gyeongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'the Korean Council for University Education', 'Gyeongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Lee Seung - bok', 'Program for Industry Needs Matched Education', 'Statistics Korea', 'Korea', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'korean', 'the Labor Ministry', 'Han Seok - su', 'Hwang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46702811  0.72798824

But some argue the armistice is already in tatters, as Pyongyang has violated it numerous times through provocations such as infiltrating into the South and launching limited attacks on South Korean forces. “Before talking about the peace regime, we should think about whether the armistice agreement has been well managed. It has been in tatters with the North setting off provocations frequently that sort of rubbed salt into the wounds of our people,” said Kim Yeoul-soo, security expert at Sungshin Women’s University.“However, South Korea should also make efforts and has a role to play. Within the comprehensive principle of engaging the North, the South should mix tactical approaches that are flexible enough to persuade the North to move in a direction of peninsular peace.”Above all, the most important task to entrench peace is to denuclearize North Korea. The task appears to be increasingly challenging as Pyongyang has defined itself as a nuclear power state in its constitution and adopted a “Byungjin” policy line of simultaneously developing nuclear arms and its economy.The multilateral denuclearization talks involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia have been dormant since late 2008. Amid the absence of dialogue, the North has been advancing its nuclear capabilities to the extent that it has already reached a technical level to “miniaturize and diversify nuclear bombs.”Park Myung-lim, a peace expert at Yonsei University, said that the current security status is comprised of two regimes -- the armistice regime and nuclear regime -- and that they should be replaced by a peace regime through the denuclearization of the North and the establishment of its diplomatic ties with the U.S. and Japan.“A peace regime can be established with the North giving up its nuclear program and with both Washington and Tokyo recognizing Pyongyang and normalizing their relations with it. This would lead to a de facto peace regime,” he said.On the part of Seoul, it should exert more diplomatic efforts to activate the six-party talks, he argued.“The U.S., China, Japan and Russia may seek to focus largely on nonproliferation when it comes to North Korea’s nuclear issue. But for South Korea, the focus is on complete denuclearization as it directly affects its own security,” he said.“Thus, Seoul should take small steps first, such as restoring the six-party dialogue channel and improving inter-Korean relations. And then, based on mutual trust, it should ease Pyongyang’s concerns about the reunification by absorption in the South and work up its leadership to bring the North out to the international community.”U.N. Commander Mark W. Clark, North Korea’s Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai, the commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteers, inked the armistice on July 27, 1953 after two years of grueling negotiations over the military demarcation line, prisoners of war and other truce-related issues.The armistice was a “temporary” cessation of hostilities. The three parties recommended a higher-level political meeting be held three months later to resolve Korea-related issues including the withdrawal of foreign troops from the peninsula.The political gathering took place from April through June in 1954 in Geneva, Switzerland, with the participation of foreign ministers from 19 countries. But it failed to permanently end the war amid disputes over the UNC role, its activities and other issues.On various occasions, Pyongyang has called for a peace treaty to replace the armistice. But Seoul and Washington suspect Pyongyang intends to pressure the U.S. to withdraw its forces from the peninsula, remove its promise of nuclear protection for the South and stop the allied military drills targeting the North.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","months later to resolve korea ,war the two koreas face ,replace the armistice but seoul ,two years of grueling negotiations ,both koreas to strive harder","['Koreas', 'Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification', 'the Military Armistice Commission', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Kim Yeoul - soo', 'Sungshin Women ’s University', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Koreas', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Yonsei University', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'Tokyo', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Mark W.

Aided by government-led promotion and online marketing, tourists from around the world are opening their eyes to the country’s treasure trove of attractions.Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Georgia has had cultural interactions with neighboring Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey for centuries. As a result, the tourism experience is multifaceted and multilayered, offering a mix of historic sightseeing, religious tours, cultural events, winemaking, spa-bathing and caving. Georgian Ambassador Nikoloz Apkhazava (center) poses with members of the embassy staff and the Georgian National Tourism Administration at the Korea Travel Fair 2015 at Coex in Seoul. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Georgia has an extremely diverse climate and terrain, from the Black Sea coast to the Caucasus Mountains, and from alpine meadows to semi-deserts, valleys and wetlands. Visitors can go skiing, paragliding, horseback riding, rafting, biking, hiking and ballooning.The capital, Tbilisi, in eastern Georgia, has a 1,500-year history manifested by medieval fortresses, narrow and winding alleys, timeless religious buildings, balconied wooden houses, saunas and spas. The Sulfur Baths in Old Tbilisi is a spa facility that uses naturally heated mineral spring water. “As Koreans love the spas called ‘jjimjilbang’ here, they picked spa-bathing as their most desired activity to do in Georgia on a survey,” Tamar Kazalikashvili, who worked at the Korea Travel Fair 2015 at Coex in Seoul, told The Korea Herald. “Koreans also loved Georgian food and wine for their delicious tastes at low prices.”Last year, 3,000 Korean tourists visited Georgia, a 22 percent increase from the previous year.  Batumi city on the Black Sea (Georgian National Tourism Administration)Places most frequented by Korean tourists are Tbilisi; Gori city where Joseph Stalin was born; Kazbegi village on the slopes of Mount Kazbegi; Batumi city on the Black Sea coast; the former capital, Mtskehta, with its many monasteries and churches; and Kakheti province, which is famous for wine. Kazalikashvili, who has lived in Korea for three years and now studies at Ewha Womans University, said the key cultural similarity between Georgians and Koreans is the “our thing” mentality.“As Georgia is a small nation of less than 4 million people, and has experienced many wars, our people have a strong pride in our nation, culture and religion,” Kazalikashvili explained. “Georgians are protective of their community, like Koreans, but we believe that ‘guests are a gift from God,’ and treat visitors very hospitably.” Georgians have strong religions, and churches, mosques, synagogues, chapels and memorials exist side by side in many cities. The Uplistsikhe cave town, which dates back to the early Iron Age, is located on a rocky escarpment near the Mtkvari River south of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. It has been called the “fortress of the lord” for its pagan and Christian mountaintop architecture. Batumi, the “Pearl of the Black Sea,” is a popular resort destination for international tourists. It has a beachside boulevard lined with palm trees, cafes, hotels and casinos, and features world-class cultural events all year round. National parks and protected areas cover more than 7 percent of Georgia’s territory, and 75 percent of the protected areas are forests. Many walking trails, where one can encounter a variety of fauna and flora and wildlife, have survived for centuries. Georgia has the longest unbroken winemaking tradition in the world stretching back 8,000 years. Earthenware vessels called the “Qvevri” are buried in the ground, sealed and left for months to let the grapes ferment. The warm climate and moist air from the Black Sea provide ideal conditions for wine production, leading to more than 500 indigenous grape varieties. The Rkatsiteli white wine has a fresh and sweet taste, while the Saperavi red wine has a nutty and plummy taste.

Seoul and Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces have been among the worst-hit regions, with about 51 percent of average annual rainfall.A man fishes in a reservoir that has been depleted by weeks of drought in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. (Yonhap)The drought comes after summers filled with extreme cycles involving devastating droughts and deadly floods during Korea’s increasingly hot summers. A combination of climate change and mixtures of high and low levels of air pressure are the likely causes, experts have said.But experts were puzzled as to the reasons for the extreme shifts in Korea’s recent summers. Some speculate that the recent droughts are part of a cycle that brings the worst droughts every 124 years, based on weather records dating back to the 12th century.“If you look at the records dating back to (the 12th century), there are five (meteorological cycles),” Byon Hi-ryong, professor of atmospheric sciences at Pukyong University in Busan, said.“This year is when two of those cycles meet. One is a 38-year cycle of dire droughts. The other is a 124-year cycle of extreme droughts,” he added.Officials, however, have been slow to create fundamental solutions to the ongoing weather problems. Critics say the government has been busy writing impromptu emergency plans to combat the drought’s effects. The government lacks a long-term plan, critics added.Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Lee Dong-phil vowed earlier Tuesday to muster 62.5 billion won ($56 million) to fight this year’s drought. The money will provide water to struggling farms. Over 16,000 soldiers, policemen, and officials will deliver the water, Lee said.The proposal comes after criticism from the main political parties that the Park Geun-hye administration had done too little too late.“The government has abandoned local governments to deal with the droughts themselves,” main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in said Monday.“The government must come up with an all-out plan to tackle this growing problem.”Land Ministry and K-Water officials have also been compelled to contain water reserves of the Hangang River, the main water source for the Seoul metropolitan area, despite the drought. Officials fear that the lack of rainwater could eventually deplete water reserves for Seoul.K-Water is a public company managing South Korea’s public water system.Signs showing the drought’s overwhelming effects on South Korea continued to increase public fear that the water deficit was worse than expected.Lettuce prices rose by 176 percent in the first half of June, the Korea Rural Economic Institute, a public think tank, said. Radish prices rose to 743 won per kilogram, higher than prices from last year that stood at about 500 won per kilogram.Increasing algal blooms in the downstream waters of the Nakdonggang River have also raised public fears that the drought is far from over.A struggling farmer surnamed Gweon expressed his frustration last Saturday.“I can’t remember when the last real rain fell here,” he said. “Do you think I should just give up?”By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","signs showing the drought overwhelming ,province tuesday yonhap the drought ,drought comes after summers filled ,depleted by weeks of drought ,brings the worst droughts every","['South Korea', 'the Korea Meteorological Association', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi', 'Gangwon', 'Pocheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Pukyong University', 'Busan', 'Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'Lee Dong - phil', 'Lee', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Moon Jae - in', 'K - Water', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'K - Water', 'South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Rural Economic Institute', 'radish', 'Gweon', 'Jeong Hunny']",0,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.45117685  0.57508785

Kim was featured on radio talk shows while her father contributed to the hype by conducting interviews with local news outlets.The reports on Kim’s achievement sparked envy among Koreans who have been living in a climate where admission into top universities is seen as key to elevating their social status. But about a week later, her whole story was unraveled, with both Harvard and Stanford universities denying the acceptance of the Korean student. The universities confirmed that there was no such joint program allowing a student to study at both schools, calling the acceptance letters provided by Kim forgeries. Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, walks out of Incheon International Airport under protection of an acquaintance on Friday. (Yonhap)Kim, who appears to have masterminded the whole furor herself, immediately went from being idolized to ridiculed, with her father apologizing last week for causing a stir and promising to take care of her mental health.Putting aside the reason behind her scam, the scandal appeared to leave a bitter aftertaste here, as it bluntly illustrated the country’s avid obsession with academic elitism and a competitive media industry prone to lapses of judgment.A 28-year-old student said he could sympathize with her as he understands what it feels like to fail to enter top-tier universities and to be treated like a “loser” in Korean society. “I have felt that entering a renowned university is a way to have my voice heard in Korean society,” Lee, who wanted to be identified only by his surname, told The Korea Herald. Lee is studying for a master’s at a Seoul-based university after receiving a diploma from a lesser-known college. “When I criticize the social structure, people think that I am complaining due to my poor educational background,” he said. “Then, I become a loser again.” In Korea, it has been considered a norm that one’s diploma defines the rest of his or her life, from career to even marriage prospects. Cliques are formed based on educational backgrounds, with graduates from the nation’s top universities taking up high positions on the social ladder and dominating academia, business and politics.The infamous Korean helicopter moms enroll their toddlers in English-language kindergartens, in desperate hopes that the child will not be left behind in the fierce competition to enter the country’s best universities, or if not, prestigious ones abroad.Kim is one of the kids who might have felt pressured to impress her parents, said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor from Chonbuk National University. “The whole hullaballoo could have only been a family issue, but Kim’s father made her lie public by showing off his daughter’s achievement through the media,” Seol said.Indeed, Kim’s case was only the latest in a long list of academic fabrication cases in Korea.One of the most high-profile scandals came in 2007 when Shin Jeong-ah, an art history professor at Dongguk University, faked her academic record. On the back of her distinguished degrees from Yale and University of Kansas, Shin rapidly shot to prominence in the local art world. She was appointed codirector of the Gwangju Biennale, one of the biggest art events in East Asia, at the age of 35. But Shin fell from grace when her academic accomplishments turned out to be forged. She resigned from all her posts and was eventually convicted of falsifying records and embezzlement. The Shin case triggered a wave of similar allegations and confessions across the nation involving a professor, movie director, renowned architect, leading actors and actresses and even a respected monk. Behind the academic fraud cases is Koreans’ belief that educational backgrounds indicate “status” in society, experts said. “Koreans have viewed an academic degree as a prerequisite to success and climbing up the social ladder, which has intensified competition for admission to prestigious universities,” Shin Kwang-yeong, a sociology professor from Chung-Ang University, told The Korea Herald. And the belief has more than 1,000 years of history to it. “Back in history, only aristocrats had a chance to take a state-administered exam to rise in social status,” Shin said, referring to the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1895) dynasties under which people took the Gwageo, the national civil service exam to advance into society. “But now, exams are standardized and institutionalized so that anyone in any class can take an exam, get respectable degrees and enter the upper tier of society,” he added. With the country’s leading businesses and key national exams still favoring those with prestigious diplomas, the obsession to embellish one’s academic record persists, experts said.A recent survey suggested that university degrees still have a huge impact on new graduates’ job prospects. According to a survey of 418 firms by recruitment site Saramin, 88.5 percent of the surveyed companies said that they have given an advantage to those holding a degree from renowned universities in the resume screening process. Asked about the reason behind the practice, the companies said that they saw prestigious degrees as a result of one’s efforts and a means of objectively measuring job seekers’ abilities. Other experts pointed out the Kim’s scandal was also a result of poor quality journalism. After it was found to be fabricated, a mainstream media outlet published a lengthy correction after having covered the teenage girl’s story.“Kim’s story had every element that can excite Koreans ― the success of a Korean abroad and acceptance into prestigious universities,” said Choi Jin-bong, who teaches mass communications at Sungkonghoe University.“That’s perhaps why Korean media hastily picked up the story.” With the news about Kim going viral in Korea after first being covered by a Korean newspaper in the U.S., the local media continued to reproduce the story until parents and students at Kim’s school raised questions about her credentials, which later prompted a local daily to check the supposed facts. “Amid fierce competition to attract readers and generate traffic online, local news outlets lack a system to check facts before reporting,” Choi said, pinpointing a structural problem of online journalism driven by “stimulating” stories. “Such diminishing media ethics can strike us all in the long run,” Choi added.Above all, the Kim case sounds the alarm to a society that has been pushing its youth to “risk their lives” to get into top-tier universities, said Kim Ji-ae, an activist campaigning to break academic cliques in society. “The 18-year-old girl is not the only one to blame. Korean society that has made a university degree a source of pride or inferiority should take the blame,” Kim said. “Kim’s behavior might be a self-portrait of us all.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korean math prodigy made headlines ,infamous korean helicopter moms enroll ,south korean math prodigy made ,korean helicopter moms enroll their ,ago south korean math prodigy","['south korean', 'american', 'Stanford', 'Harvard', 'Kim Jung - yoon', 'Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology', 'Virginia', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Harvard', 'Stanford', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Kim Jung - yoon', 'Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology', 'Virginia', 'Incheon International Airport', 'yonhap)kim', 'korean', 'korean', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Seol Dong - hoon', 'Chonbuk National University', 'Kim ’s', 'Seol', 'Kim ’s', 'Korea', 'Shin Jeong - ah', 'Dongguk University', 'Yale and University of Kansas', 'Shin', 'Shin', 'Shin', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Shin Kwang - yeong', 'Chung - Ang University', 'the Korea Herald', 'Shin', 'Joseon', 'Gwageo', 'Saramin', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Choi Jin - bong', 'Sungkonghoe University', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Korea', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Kim ’s', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Kim', 'Kim Ji - ae', 'korean', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",12,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.79735154  0.89612997

No military clash occurred during his defection. “We’ve secured his custody and handed him over to a related agency, which is now looking into his exact motive and method of escape,” a ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “Details are to be examined further, but the soldier mentioned habitual beating and his discontent over North Korea’s reality as the main reasons that had driven his defection.”  Inter-Korean Transit Office near the Demilitarized Zone on Paju in Gyeonggi-do Province (Yonhap)The man appears to be the first North Korean soldier to flee since another trooper crossed the border and knocked on the door of a barrack in Goseong, Gangwon Province, in October 2012. The incident had revealed South Korea’s lax border defense, prompting the sacking of Army commanders and senior officers in charge. The ministry has since installed a raft of bells, phone boxes and guidance signs within the DMZ to help ensure a safer route for defectors. Pyongyang, for its part, has reportedly been tightening border controls to contain the defector outflow since leader Kim Jong-un took power in December 2011. The North has been holding an increasing number of training exercises for surprise attacks and ambush infiltrations into the DMZ areas, while nearly 1,300 wood or concrete markers have been set up every 200 to 300 meters along the border.  More than 25,000 North Koreans resettled in the South between 2002 and 2014, according to the Unification Ministry. Albeit with slight fluctuations, the annual sums steadily rose from 1,384 in 2005 to 2,706 in 2011 but it plunged to around 1,500 in 2012 and 2013 and then 1,400 in 2014, reflecting reinforced border security.Inter-Korean tensions have been escalating in recent months as the communist regime tests a submarine-launched ballistic missile and claims to have mastered miniaturizing warheads to mount on delivery vehicles. On Sunday, it again fired three KN-01 short-range missiles into the East Sea.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korean soldier defected to south ,north korean soldier defected ,korean soldier to flee since ,soldier defected to south korea ,korean soldier defected","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'Seoul ’s Defense Ministry', 'Hwacheon', 'Gangwon Province', 'North Korea ’s', 'inter - korean Transit Office', 'the Demilitarized Zone on', 'north korean', 'Goseong , Gangwon Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'Army', 'DMZ', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim Jong - un', 'DMZ', 'North Koreans', 'the Unification Ministry', 'inter - korean', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66326362  0.27796459

The concept, already being conducted by Ecuador with Germany and Japan separately, is to share culture and language and form a long-term relationship between the countries. “In the past we had relationships with mostly the U.S. But we wish to diversify international relationships. We can have Korean teachers communicate Korean culture and language,” he said.The partnership, he said, will be based on more than just financial support. “It is really for knowledge transfer. We can learn the know-how of the Korean strategy, and establish certain joint research projects with Korean universities.”The partnership between the two countries is already set in motion. In 2013, the minister visited Korea to discuss cooperation in building the Yachay research park project in the Amazon region, dubbed “city of knowledge” which is both a science and technology cluster and an education complex. Institutions like the government-planned Yachay Tech University have already opened in 2014. Incheon Free Economic Zone and institutions like Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology are already working with Ecuador on the project. Espinosa said he was also open to ideas of foreign universities opening campuses in Ecuador. But hosting foreign schools is not the main idea, he stressed.“The main objective is that each country can learn each other’s culture. The idea of the binational school is not to adopt Korea’s education system, but to learn from the culture and exchange cultures,” he said.“Certainly I believe we can learn from the rapid economic growth from Korea that occurred in less than 50 years. The correlation between growth and the education system is valuable,” he said.Improving the quality of education is a key issue, Espinosa said. In the past five years, Ecuador has come from having one of the worst-evaluated education systems in Latin America to the middle of the pack. Determined to go further, Ecuador is currently pushing a strategy mandating teachers to obtain master’s degrees, while carrying out school reform. The country was able to cut 22,000 schools in 2006 to 14,500 in 2015. The goal is to reduce that number to 8,000 by 2017, and finally to 5,500.

Some people brought them in after rescuing them from an abusive environment, its director Kong Kyung-hee said, but others have been less kind, secretly dumping their pets at the shelter at night. In many cases, such abandoned pets are bitten to death by other dogs.Dogs wait in their enclosure at animal shelter Aerinwon in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)“Some cruel people throw their dogs out of car windows and run away. The dogs, who tend to return to their masters, chase after the cars and end up being run over,” said Kong, cuddling and patting the dozens of dogs that surrounded her. Kong began taking in unwanted dogs 32 years ago. Now, more than 3,000 dogs are housed outdoors in wire cages at the shelter, with the number increasing each year. “It is difficult to accommodate the rising number of dogs with limited resources, but I cannot let them die on the streets or be put to death by the government,” the 72-year-old woman said, who looks after abandoned pets with four staff while living in a small container house.“Puppies are, of course, adorable when they are young. People mindlessly make emotional purchases, and easily ditch them when they start to misbehave, bark, lose their hair and fall ill,” Kong said.According to government statistics, some 81,000 pets were abandoned in 2014, with the majority being dogs. Of these, only 31.4 percent were adopted and 13 percent were reclaimed by their owners, while 23 percent died in shelters and 22.7 percent were euthanized.The number of abandoned pets has dwindled from 101,000 in 2010 to 81,000 in 2014, but the decline hardly means that animal rights awareness has increased, activists here point out.“The culture of easily buying and giving up pets, the huge costs of medical treatment and food, conflicts with neighbors over dogs’ barking and the hectic pattern of life in modern society are to blame for the discharging of pets,” Song Joon-kyu, a researcher from think-tank The Seoul Institute, said at a forum on abandoned animals.It is the norm for Koreans to buy dogs from pet shops rather than adopt one from animal shelters as they tend to prefer dogs of “pure” breeds. In the pet shops, they can pick a dog of a certain breed, color and size for as little as 100,000 won ($90), like shopping for clothes. When shopping for dogs online, the prices are even lower. But it is not only about Koreans’ pet-purchasing culture. There is a more fundamental problem: the supply of dogs exceeds demand. Kong Kyung-hee, head of animal shelter Aerinwon, pets dogs around her inside the shelter, Wednesday. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)“The root cause of dogs being abandoned is an industrial structure that enables people to easily purchase dogs from pet shops and throw them away,” said Park Ana, an animal rights activist at Korea Animal Rights Advocates.“Thousands of unlicensed breeders are producing more pets than society can take in,” Park said, accusing the government of failing to track down and clamp down on the illegal businesses. While the government does not actually have statistics available, more than 3,000 dog farms are thought to be illegally operating across the country to cater to the demand for dog meat and special breeds of pets, pro-animal activists claimed. Many of the dogs in Kong’s Aerinwon were also brutally abused when they arrived. “I recently rescued a dog from a dog farm, where she was forced to give birth to nearly 50 puppies in total,” Kong said. “When she first arrived at our shelter a month ago, she could not even walk.” Such “puppy factories” are notorious for inducing female dogs into heat to keep them producing puppies while locked in a small cage. “The key to promoting animals’ rights lies in lowering the number of pets by regulating the illicit dog trading businesses,” Park said. Under the Animal Protection Law, homeless animals found on the streets are rescued and transferred to some 368 animal shelters, either sponsored by the government or run directly by municipalities. The facilities then put up advertisements on the government’s website for seven days to look for their owners. Unless they find their owners within 10 days of arrival, the shelters can put the dogs up for adoption. If not adopted, dogs are eventually put down, as the state-run shelters do not have enough money or space to keep the growing number of incoming animals. There are also hundreds of privately-run shelters like Kong’s Aerinwon set up to rescue animals in danger of being euthanized. Running on donations, some private facilities grapple with a lack of funding and come under fire for offering poor conditions for dogs, which raises their own questions over animals’ welfare. Thus, it is difficult to say whether euthanasia is good or bad from an animal-welfare perspective, said Cho Hee-kyung, head of the Korean Animal Welfare Association.“The question is whether dogs in such poor conditions (at some private facilities) can be happy just living,” Cho said. “Society needs to address abandoned animals’ rights, too.” As part of campaign to prevent pet abandonment, the government enacted a new system in July 2014, requiring all pet owners to register dogs aged over three months on a government system. Those who fail to do so can face a fine of up to 400,000 won. Since the rule took effect, less than 890,000 pets have been registered nationwide, approximately 55 percent of the total estimated by the central government. “The pet registration system should be reinforced and all the pets should be microchipped so that the authorities can trace pet owners who abandon their furry friends,” the activist Cho said. “The system is already in place, but is far from properly working.” The government is aware of the situation. “We will partner with veterinarians and animal rights organizations to promote the system and raise awareness of why pets should be registered,” said an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, who asked not to be named.“But some citizens say that the government should focus on expanding welfare for people, not animals,” he said. “There seems to be no broad consensus yet on animals’ rights in Korean society.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","abandoned pets with four staff ,such abandoned pets are bitten ,kind secretly dumping their pets ,illicit dog trading businesses park ,neighbors over dogs barking and","['Aerinwon', 'Pocheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Kong Kyung - hee', 'Pocheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Korea herald)“some', 'Kong', 'Kong', 'Kong', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Kong Kyung - hee', 'Aerinwon', 'Ock Hyun - ju', 'Park Ana', 'Korea Animal Rights Advocates', 'Park', 'Kong ’s', 'Kong', 'Park', 'Kong', 'Cho Hee - kyung', 'the Korean Animal Welfare Association', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'korean', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17472354  0.16335009

She later had to undergo uterine surgery twice.  In 1945, when the Japanese surrendered to the Allied Forces, she took the last boat back to Busan, where she stayed for two years because she was too sick to make her way back to Pohang.  She finally married at age 50, after years of poverty from selling just fish and vegetables. Her brothers all died in the 1950-53 Korean War.  Kim's death came less than 30 minutes after the passing of another former sex slave Thursday.  Kim Oi-hwan died of a chronic illness at a hospital in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, just southeast of Seoul, said the House of Sharing, a shelter for former sex slaves.

The ministry has been helping farmers since late May. Precipitation in the two provinces stands at about 57 percent of their annual average, the ministry said. The water level of Soyang River Dam in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, hovers around 153 meters, marking 25 percent of the total capacity and just about 2 meters away from the lowest ever since its 1975 launch. The facility’s operation is coming under threat as the figures are going down by some 3 centimeters every day, according to the state-run Korea Water Resources Corp. The drought has also caused damage to nearly 3,000 hectares of fields across Gangwon.  Fishing boats sit on a weed-covered bank in Soyang Lake in Inje, Gangwon Province. (Yonhap)“The military stationed in related areas is lending a helping hand on a division scale by mobilizing water wagons, trailers, fire reels, fumigator trucks and troops,” ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing on Thursday.“We have so far provided 140,000 liters of water, nine wagons and 100 servicemen to Donghae, Hwacheon, Cheolwon, Pyeongchang and other cities and counties in Gangwon Province.” Earlier in the day, Agriculture Minister Lee Dong-phil convened a video conference with senior officials from six city and provincial governments to examine their damage and the current situation for formulating countermeasures. The ministry has decided to constantly review and bolster water supply measures by municipalities and offer financial support if the dry spell drags out further. It also set aside 35.2 billion won ($31.7 million) to cope with the crisis. “We should inject as much workforce and equipment as possible and secure available water resources to minimize the farmers’ inconvenience and economic losses and facilitate their work,” Lee was quoted as saying at the meeting. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport also on Thursday began rallying hydroelectric dams along the Han River basin to beef up water supply chiefly sourced from multipurpose dams, while Minister Yoo Il-ho toured Paldang Dam in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, to inspect the ministry’s response. In March, the agency devised measures to save more water resources and has since secured an extra 135 million tons. The latest decision reflects persistent concerns over a protracted dry spell and delayed rains in the summer. Nonghyup, a state-funded agricultural bank, said it has offered relief supplies and financial assistance of 140 million won to 10 cities and counties, while running a situation room for drought management at its 16 regional headquarters and 1,137 branches around the country. The institution also plans to distribute water pumps, hoses, sprinklers and other gears and help repair related equipment in collaboration with the central and local governments.Members of the ruling Saenuri Party, for their part, visited a reservoir in Ganghwa County, Incheon, that has seen its reserve rates plunge for the last two years. They toured the area to look at the damage and discussed support steps after a briefing by county officials. The party delegation was led by Rep. Won Yoo-chul, chair of the policy committee, with officials from the agriculture and land ministries and state-run agricultural and water companies also taking part.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","thursday began rallying hydroelectric dams ,farmers since late may precipitation ,on thursday began rallying hydroelectric ,water resources corp the drought ,thursday began rallying hydroelectric","['Han Min - koo', 'Gyeonggi', 'Chuncheon', 'Gangwon Province', 'Korea Water Resources Corp.', 'Gangwon', 'Inje', 'Gangwon Province', 'Kim Min -', 'Pyeongchang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Lee Dong - phil', 'Lee', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Namyangju', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Saenuri Party', 'Ganghwa County', 'Incheon', 'Won Yoo', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58121759  0.13669319

""But North Korea is not expected to close down the zone just because of the wage issue.""  The joint industrial complex, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.  The operation of the complex has been highly affected by inter-Korean relations. The Seoul-Pyongyang ties have been strained since 2010 when the South imposed sanctions banning economic and cultural exchanges following the North's torpedoing of a South Korean warship and its shelling of a border island.  In April 2013, the North unilaterally shut down the industrial park for about four months, raising concerns about the viability of the factory zone. Four months later, the two Koreas decided to set up a joint committee in charge of running the industrial park.  Seoul has rejected Pyongyang's unilateral wage hike, saying it is in breach of a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations. The wage hike cap has been set at 5 percent per year.  Touching on the talks on a wage cap, Jeong claimed that the South needs to show ""flexibility"" over the issue although the matter should be resolved through consultations by the two sides.  When it comes to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Jeong said North Korea has ""grave"" concerns about the disease.  Concerns about the spread of the MERS virus are growing in the South as it has killed six South Koreans so far, while the number of those infected has increased to 87.  The communist country has been highly sensitive to the outbreak of contagious diseases due to its weak health care system. Last year, Pyongyang imposed an entry ban on foreign tourists for about five months due to concerns over the deadly Ebola virus.  ""It is certain that the North has grave fears about the newly-found infectious disease,"" Jeong said, adding that North Korea had requested the South Korean firms at the zone to unveil measures to counter the Ebola virus last year.  ""But there have been no requests from the North over MERS except for its recent demand for supply of thermal scanners and masks,"" he added.  At the request of the North, South Korea on Monday installed three thermal scanners for those who move in and out of the complex to prevent the spread of the virus in the reclusive country.

Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told the U.S. Congress earlier this week, ""Despite our differences over the South China Sea, the United States and China have worked hard to expand cooperation and develop effective channels of communication to manage differences."" However, Russel said, ""We also underscore that the United States will not hesitate to defend our national security interests and to honor our commitments to allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific."" North Korea is also expected to be one of the agenda items for Kerry's talks in Beijing, ahead of his trip to South Korea on Sunday. North Korea has claimed that it successfully test-launched a ballistic missile from a submarine. If confirmed, it would pose a significant security threat to South Korea. Also this week, South Korea's intelligence agency told lawmakers that the North's young leader, Kim Jong-un, ordered his defense chief executed for showing disloyalty. The moves by North Korea came as five nations involved in long-stalled talks, including the U.S. and China, on the North's nuclear weapons program, agreed on the need to hold ""exploratory talks"" with Pyongyang without any preconditions to test the reclusive nation's denuclearization commitment before resuming formal negotiations.The six-party talks aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear ambition, involving South Korea, North Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia, have been dormant since late 2008.Since then, North Korea has advanced its nuclear capabilities by conducting its second and third nuclear tests, in 2009 and 2013.Some experts now warn that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to 100 bombs by 2020.","neighbors nervous china ,beijing on saturday for talks ,beijing is in bitter dispute ,asian neighbors nervous china ,nervous china claims sovereignty over","['U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'China', 'asian', 'China', 'Philippines', 'Malaysia', 'Vietnam', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Daniel Russel', 'U.S.', 'the U.S.', 'Congress', 'the United States', 'China', 'Russel', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'Kerry', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'North Korea']",6,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.81286216  0.56859034

Before being appointed in February, Walsh was the director of East and North Asia relations in the Canadian government in Ottawa, and had been posted in Berlin, Bucharest and Geneva.As relations between Canada and Korea become increasingly intertwined through free trade, immigration and education, Walsh said he had reason to be optimistic about the future. “Things are going well between our two countries, and I want to keep up the flow of good news for our shared prosperity and security,” he told The Korea Herald last week. “My No. 1 goal is to get value out of the Canada-Korea free trade agreement, which came into force this year.” Canadian Ambassador Eric Walsh (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Last year bore fruitful results in bilateral relations, with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and President Park Geun-hye exchanging visits and establishing a strategic partnership, the envoy said. He plans to keep the momentum going by promoting corporate awareness of the free trade agreement; bolstering the annual strategic dialogue with concrete initiatives; and strengthening cooperation in science, technology and innovation. Walsh highlighted cooperation in science and engineering, which has secured a $1 million annual budget under the Canadian government’s Economic Action Plan. The two countries established diplomatic ties in 1963, and cooperate through the OECD, G20 and APEC. Koreans make up the third-largest group of international students in Canada after China and India. Canada’s priorities regarding Korea are somewhere between large countries like the U.S. and smaller countries like New Zealand, the ambassador explained. Most fundamentally, the two countries share a blood-sealed relationship from the Korean War (1950-53), to which Canada dispatched 26,000 troops as part of United Nations forces. Over 500 Canadians died. The 42-year-old envoy expressed pride in his job, following in the footsteps of celebrated Canadian ambassadors in Korea, including three who became deputy ministers in the Canadian government. “As a diplomat, I am steadfastly nonpartisan and feel more comfortable that way,” Walsh stressed. “The Canadian bureaucracy profusely provides nonpartisan advice to the government of the day, and loyally implements decisions by the government of the day.”Taking the helm at the embassy ― where some 15 Canadian and 40 Korean staff work ― keeps him fully occupied, he said. In high school, Walsh took an interest in foreign policy and wanted to represent his country in his career. He passed the Foreign Service exam while working on a master’s degree in Russian and European studies at the University of Toronto. “I sometimes feel undereducated with only a bachelor’s degree, but as people say, ‘A bird in hand is worth two in the bush’ ― I have never felt l’m stagnating in my job,” he said. “Over the last 20 years of my diplomatic career, I’ve come to appreciate engaging diverse tasks, peoples and cultures.” The ambassador shed light on Canada’s successful immigration and multiculturalism. At City Hall in Toronto, his hometown, over 100 languages are available, and children grow up in a multiethnic environment. “Our cultural mosaic has created a highly tolerant society and enriched the Canadian life,” he said. “Unlike some European countries, both liberals and conservatives across the political spectrum have favored immigration.” He underscored that creating a harmonious multicultural society in Korea would take time and generations. Regarding the inter-Korean relations, Walsh said he remains an “optimist at heart,” based on his expertise in Geneva and experience in former communist countries. He visited North Korea once prior to his posting.“I lived in Germany between 2010 and 2015, and witnessed the ongoing process of integration,” he said. “I also lived in Romania, where I learned about the 1989 Romanian Revolution. The popular revolt that started in a country town of Timisoara toppled the Ceausescu regime in merely two weeks.” Although contingencies and complications exist on the Korean Peninsula, Walsh was optimistic about the prospect of unification once the two sides built trust. Walsh’s family consists of his wife and two old cats ― Mado and Meze ― picked up on the streets of Ankara, Turkey, in 1999 during his posting there. The ambassador is a vegetarian, although not a vegan. “I like the vegetable-based Korean cuisine, especially temple dishes,” he said.He also likes traveling and plans to visit all corners of Korea. The embassy will host events near Canada Day on July 1, in addition to supporting Canadian films at the 20th Busan International Film Festival in October. The next Canada education fair will be held in November at Coex in Seoul, where over 60 universities, colleges, secondary and language schools from Canada will participate.

Hwang In-ja of the Saenuri Party. Senior citizens refer to those aged 65 or older.The figure means one in five senior citizens lives alone and comprises 20 percent of the entire elderly population, which reached nearly 6,429,000 as of 2015.By region, Gyeonggi Province topped the list, with about 203,000 senior citizens living alone, followed by Seoul with 181,000. Jeju Self-Governing Province had about 18,000 lone senior citizens ― the lowest on the list. Incheon recorded the biggest growth rate of senior citizens living alone at 24.3 percent, while South Jeolla Province had the biggest ratio at nearly 30 percent. According to the report from the Seoul City government, the number of senior citizens living alone will reach nearly 220,000 by 2030.Elderly citizens living alone cited “convenience” as the main reason for why they chose to live by themselves. More than 35 percent of those seniors said “it is comfortable,” while 34 percent said “I want to live independently.” Some 23 percent said “I don’t want to be a burden,” according to the survey from Statistics Korea. “The society as a whole should take the (elderly) issue seriously,” said Rep. Hwang In-ja. “Over the past five years, there is not a single region where the number of elderly living alone has decreased. “The elderly issue is not a matter of individuals and households. It needs the public’s attention,” said Hwang.

In what it called ""an emergency special warning,"" the communist country's Command in Southwestern Sector of Front claimed that South Korean Navy speedboats made a ""military provocation"" by deeply intruding into the North's territorial waters in the Yellow Sea two or three times a day between May 1 and 7.""From this moment, it will make a sighting strike without any prior warning at any warship of the South Korean Navy intruding into the extension of demarcation line in the hotspot (of the sea),"" said the statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.North Korea also threatened to successively deal stronger blows to the South's ships if South Korea makes counterattacks on the North, according to the KCNA. Pyongyang does not acknowledge the border, known as the Northern Limit Line, which was drawn unilaterally by the U.S.-led United Nations Command when the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a ceasefire. The North has long demanded that the line be drawn farther south. Flatly dismissing the North's claims, South Korea expressed ""serious regrets"" over the warning against ""our ships' normal operations.""""It is not our side but your side that brings up tension along the NLL. Your threatening words and deeds by distorting facts are stoking unnecessary military tension between the two Koreas,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said in a message to the North Korean command.""If you act provocatively while ignoring our warnings, we will sternly and strongly respond to them to the degree where you will bitterly repent,"" Kim said, calling for Pyongyang's full respect for the maritime border.  The latest incident came amid an increasing number of North Korean and Chinese fishing boats operating near the border.Every year, North Korea gets paid from the Chinese side in exchange for offering China the right to fish in its waters, according to officials here. Pyongyang has included part of the South Korean territorial waters near the western sea border when selling the rights to China, prompting the Seoul military to beef up surveillance, they said.""We've never violated the NLL, while the North has often done so,"" said a defense ministry official, requesting anonymity. In the latest case, a North Korean patrol boat crossed the border into the South due to engine failure. The South Korean military ""is analyzing what prompted the North to make such absurd remarks, while maintaining the strong posture against any possible scenarios,"" although there is no indication yet of unusual military movement from the North, he added.

According to a report released by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Thursday, the number of those aged 65 or older reached 1.24 million as of last month, about 5,000 more than the number of youth aged under 15. The aging index also hit a record high of 100.4 points, exceeding 100 points for the first time, the city said. The index indicates the level of an aging society. Over 100 points suggests the number of elderly citizens who are economically dependent is increasing faster than those who are economically active. The capital’s aging index has been on the rise since 1996. The indicator stood at 21.8 points in 1996, but surged to 90 points by 2013. Seoul, which has a population of 10.3 million, is not the only aging municipality in South Korea. The country’s average aging index was 92.2 points this year, more than double that of 2003. The sharp rise appears to be related to the fast growth of the elderly population and declining birthrate, the city noted. In the past four months, the number of senior citizens increased by about 21,000, while youth numbers dropped by 19,000, it added. As the aging continues, the average age of Seoul City’s population rose to 40.2 this year, passing 40 for the first time, authorities said. The average age of residents in one district in Jung-gu was 51 years old, marking the oldest figure in the capital, they added. “If the current trend continues, 14 percent of the city’s population will be elderly by 2028, leading to an aged society,” officials said. A city with over 14 percent of those aged 65 or older is considered an “aged society,” and over 20 percent a “post-aged society.” If the elderly population accounts for more than 7 percent, it is called an “aging society.”By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","citizens in seoul has surpassed ,aging index also hit record ,aging society over 100 points ,90 points by 2013 seoul ,this year more than double","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Seoul City ’s', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",2,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.76813763  0.5446524

It also raised suspicion that the Korean government was pressured to exclude information on sexual minorities by local religious groups. The lack of protection for teenage sexual minorities has been a hot-button issue recently in Korea. About 45.7 percent of sexual minorities aged 18 or younger said they had attempted suicide, while 53.8 percent had injured themselves, according to last year’s survey by the Korean Society of Law and Policy on Sexual Orientation and Gender Inequality.Moon Yong-rin, a conservative former education superintendent of Seoul, attempted to exclude a student rights ordinance in a clause that mandated the protection of students who are sexual minorities. His attempt was thwarted after he lost the position to liberal Cho Hi-yeon in last year’s election.Last month, conservative civic groups sabotaged Gangwon Provincial Office of Education’s public hearing on the student rights ordinance, claiming the ordinance “encourages sexual corruption such as homosexuality.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","discriminatory against lesbian gay bisexual ,sex education guidelines for schools ,conservative civic groups sabotaged gangwon ,against lesbian gay bisexual ,tuesday the education ministry sex","['South Korea', 'Human Rights Watch', 'the Education Ministry ’s', 'Graeme Reid', 'LGBT', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Korean Society of Law and Policy on Sexual Orientation', 'Moon Yong - rin', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'Gangwon Provincial Office of Education ’s', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.40888771  0.19025618

China’s political development is thought to have far-reaching consequences for Korea in diplomacy, trade and people exchanges, as bilateral relations are deepening. According to Wang Shaoguang, professor of government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, China pursues a different kind of democracy from the West, one he claims not only serves people’s needs better, but is capable of solving the evolving challenges of the globe. Wang has criticized for decades the “modernization theory” of Western scholarship, which assumes that economic development will spark democratic reforms. Criticizing the theory as culturally hegemonic, he instead argues that each nation pursue its own polity based on traditions. “Three decades earlier, in reference to communist repression, the late former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said there’s no other political alternative to Western democracy,” Wang said at a seminar, “China’s democracy under Xi Jinping,” at Sungkyunkwan University on Tuesday. “But the world has since witnessed a flourishing of different political structures at the blight of liberal democracy. Many studies have demonstrated unique aspects of East Asian politics within Confucian culture.”Wang is an internationally acclaimed scholar on Chinese politics, having received his bachelor’s law degree from Peking University and doctorate of political science from Cornell University. He has taught at Yale University, as well as Tsinghua University and Chongqing University in China. Professor Lee Hee-ok, who teaches Chinese politics at Sungkyunkwan University, and heads the “Good Democracy in Asia Project,” said that Wang’s perspective sheds light on China’s aspirations as well as the future of regional politics. The true meaning of democracy, according to Wang, is that people become owners of their destiny. As to what the ownership means and its method, nations and regions will have varying interpretations, he said. The adjective in front of the word democracy ― for example, liberal, social, parliamentary or participatory ― expresses each country’s unique circumstances; China’s political style is not unconventional, as there has been a wide variety of experimentations throughout history, he said.  (From left) Panelists Chun Sung-heung, Wang Shaoguang, Lee Hee-ok and Kang Miong-sei speak at the seminar, “China’s democracy under Xi Jinping,” at Sungkyunkwan University on Tuesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)In contrast to the West’s “representative” democracy, which focuses on the formal electoral process and entitles politicians as the guardian of popular interest, China has a “representational” democracy, which tries to substantiate needs by having an “able, accountable, accessible and autonomous” government. The CPC’s top leader ― president, general secretary and military chairman ― is selected through a rigorous process after proving competence in regional posts. “A good government is one that works, and can respond to the actual demands,” Wang said. In advising a more open-minded and open-ended understanding of democracy, he stressed that the more important question should be centered on the good governance.He added that even after people’s income rises significantly in China, the concept of good governance will not shift toward the Western model.The way the Chinese leadership addresses demands is through the “mass line” ― equivalent to the West’s “citizen participation” ― where party cadres live and work at selected units to cultivate people’s lifestyles and living conditions.The mass line has seen a revival under President Xi Jinping, Wang said, adding that members of the Politburo Standing Committee ― China’s de facto decision-making body ― conduct monthly field investigations outside of Beijing, while lower-ranking officials conduct them more frequently.Xi spent his teenage years in Shaanxi province during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), where millions of youths, called the Red Guards, were “sent down” from cities to the countryside to learn rural ways of life. In a fierce debate that followed, Korean scholars critiqued Wang’s view, echoing the Western scholarship perspective. “The core concern of today’s academia is upgrading the quality of democracy,” said Kang Miong-sei, director of think-tank Sejong Institute. “As China’s per capita income rises from the current $7,500 to over $15,000 mark, its democracy should move from being party-centered to people-centered, and supply-driven to demand-driven. The party should let people speak and decide.” Chun Sung-heung, professor of political science at Sogang University in Seoul, chimed in, saying that “Despite professor Wang’s assertion that China’s democracy is pragmatic and substantive, I do not believe China practices democracy.” He added, “Democracy is an institution that allows people to exercise their rights. What China seeks is a system that manages the stability and development of the state and society.” Wang, while referring to political philosophers Aristotle and Montesquieu, who warned the danger of elected officials becoming oligarchs, counterargued by criticizing the weakness of Western democracy.“Should democracy focus on the individual or the group? The democracies of Athens, the Roman Republic and the Italian city-states always existed in relation to the larger society and state.”The Community Party of China, which has ruled since 1949 in a one-party dictatorship, serves people’s needs in harmony with the society’s long-term goals, claimed Wang. He cited the high support for the government by the Chinese people ― validated empirically across age and time ― which runs counter to the notion that the government is authoritarian.The modern liberal democracy is in a quagmire, he emphasized, because citizens often do not vote rationally; the vested bipartisan structure is inapt at representing voters’ interests; and politicians are not held accountable to their pledges.

(AP)The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, tried to quiet the diplomats at the event that featured more than 20 defectors. She called North Korea's statements “totally self-discrediting.”The North Korean diplomats did not comment as they left the chamber after diplomat Ri Song-chol read out a statement in protest of the event, even as North Korean defectors stood and shouted in their faces.Nuclear-armed North Korea has been on the defensive ever since a groundbreaking U.N. commission of inquiry detailed vast rights abuses there. North Korea has repeatedly referred to defectors who cooperated in the inquiry “human scum.”Defectors stood up and shouted in Korean as Power and others called for calm and a U.N. security team assembled. An observer who speaks Korean said the shouts included “Shut up!” “Free North Korea!'' “Down with Kim Jong-un!'' and “Even animals know to wait their turn.”“There is no need for a microphone,” Power said as one North Korean diplomat persisted in reading out a statement that referred to “ungrounded allegations” and “hostile policy” toward his country. A microphone was briefly turned on for the diplomats.Power continued: “Please shut the mike down because this is not an authorized presentation. ... Please ensure that the microphone is not live. ... We are calling U.N. security.”As soon as the North Korean diplomat stopped talking and the next featured defector, Jay Jo, started speaking, the North Korean diplomats stood and walked out.“They're so rude,” Jo said later, adding that she wished that the diplomats had stayed so she could have spoken with them. The U.S. said North Korea had been informed before the event that it would have a chance to speak.The brief chaos came minutes after U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic told the audience that North Korea had shown “new signs of engagement” on human rights issues in recent months.","argue with north korean diplomats ,thursday as north korean diplomats ,north korean defectors left argue ,discrediting the north korean diplomats ,korean defectors stood and shouted","['UNITED NATIONS', 'AP', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'United Nations', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'U.N.', 'Samantha Power', ""North Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Ri Song -', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Korean', 'U.N.', 'Korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'U.N.', 'north korean', 'Jay Jo', 'north korean', 'Jo', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'U.N.', 'North Korea']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55934441  0.55888551

The shipment will be made between April 16 and May 9.  In November, the first shipment carrying 40,500 tons of Russian coal smoothly arrived in South Korea in its pilot operation of the Rajin-Khasan project.  The project came as a symbolic project of three-way cooperation at a time when inter-Korean exchanges have been almost suspended following the deadly sinking of a South Korean warship by the North in 2010.  ""Compared with in November, we think that the port's capacity to load or unload the shipment was improved,"" said an official at the Ministry of Unification, asking not to be named.  ""Nothing has been decided, but there may be a third pilot operation for the project,"" he said. ""We expect that talks over a formal contract could come.""  The project involves three South Korean firms -- top steelmaker POSCO, shipper Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. and state train operator Korail Corp. They will decide on whether to clinch a formal contract based on the outcome of the pilot operations.  This time the project also includes two power plant operators: Korea East-West Power Co. and Korea Midland Power Corp.  The coal shipment will arrive at three South Korean ports in early May, including the one in Pohang, 374 kilometers southeast of Seoul and a port in Dangjin, 123 kilometers south of the capital.  The Rajin-Khasan project is part of Seoul's move to realize President Park Geun-hye's vision for a united Eurasia.  In October 2013, Park unveiled her Eurasia initiative that calls for infrastructure development and freer trade among Eurasian nations by linking their railways.  South Korea imposed the May 24 punitive sanctions on North Korea in 2010 following Pyongyang's deadly sinking of the Cheonan warship in March of that year.  The move has suspended all trade and exchange programs with the North, apart from a joint factory park project in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. The three-way logistics project has been regarded as an exception.

A document, which was recently found in a Korean-American church in Manhattan, New York, revealed that Japanese police sexually tortured young Korean women after the March 1 independence movement in 1919.“Among the tortures and brutalities dwelt on by writers and especially emphasized by the American press were those dealing with young women and school girls who were stripped, examined, tortured and maltreated,” reads the document, entitled “The Korean Situation.” Copies of the document found in a U.S. church presumed to have been written in 1920. (Yonhap)The 27-page document explained the pan-peninsular independence campaign that was launched on March 1, 1919. Influenced by then-U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s 1918 speech that underscored the right of national self-determination, the campaign brought Koreans together in a struggle against Japanese imperialism.The document is thought to have been written in June 1920 by the Commission on Relations with the Orient under the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.The document depicted the Japanese police crackdown on Korean independent fighters in detail. Police, gendarmes and soldiers were mobilized to “prevent and suppress” demonstrations, and their crackdowns led to procedures and practices that were condemned “not only in other lands but by many enlightened Japanese,” the document reads.“No charge was made of rape under these conditions,” the document added. The document suggested this may have been due to women being unable to press for rape charges, despite it occurring.The document stated that U.S. missionaries made an inquiry to the Japanese police about how many were sexually tortured, and the reply was that “no statistics are available.”The revelation of the document is expected to add to the increasing pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to confront history and make a sincere apology for Japan’s past atrocities, including the sexual enslavement of Korean women at military brothels during World War II. Abe is slated to deliver a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. Observers expect the prime minister may express a sense of remorse over Japan’s past militarism, but fall short of making an unequivocal apology that Seoul, Beijing and other nations have long called for.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","police sexually tortured young korean ,japanese police sexually tortured young ,japanese police crackdown on korean ,sexually tortured young korean women ,that japanese police sexually tortured","['Japan', 'korean', 'Tokyo', 'korean', 'Manhattan', 'New York', 'japanese', 'korean', 'american', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Woodrow Wilson ’s', 'Koreans', 'japanese', 'the Commission on Relations', 'the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Japanese', 'U.S.', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Japan', 'korean', 'Abe', 'the U.S. Congress', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Song Sang - ho']",13,"[ 3.          1.          0.         ... -0.33392662  0.25953814

129,129,[Weekender] A rebellion against perfection,"In recent years, Korea, one of the most digitalized countries in the world, has seen an increasing number of people pursue “analog” ways of life, such as keeping a handwritten diary or reading a printed book.

All of this is being done in a search for self-expression ― and an element of imperfection.  A woman makes a black-and-white print in a dark room. (Mulnamoo Photo Studio)“Koreans are seeking analog as a rebellion against perfection and an escape from rationality that human beings have firmly believed in,” said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor at Chonbuk National University. In today’s digital age, technology and social media bring people closer, but Seol said this will also continue to make them feel more isolated “because a digitally dominated society lacks a human touch.”At a glance, there seems to be no room in Korean society for analog ― a term often used to describe anything old or reminiscent of bygone times. Yet there are signs of a growing trend of adopting old-school ideals in Korea, heralding a resurgence of analog habits.Yang Yoon, psychology professor at Ewha Womans University, says behind this revival of old-school products is Koreans’ thirst for self-reflection. “The digital era has brought changes too rapidly,” Yang said. “While living a life of convenience, they struggle to adapt to the changes, get lost and start questioning who they really are.” This is evident in an apparent addiction to digital perfection. With the introduction of digital cameras, Koreans began taking large numbers of photos, editing and deleting them until all-but perfect images were left. In a backlash against this apparent need for perfection, Kim Hyun-sik, a photographer and former journalist, opened a black-and-white photo studio, “Mulnamoo,” in Seoul in 2010. “A digital photo can be easily edited and manipulated to look perfect,” Kim said. “But that’s not real.”To take a picture with a film camera, there are numerous aspects to consider ― lighting, the temperature, and ambience, just to name a few. “That’s why analog pictures are more natural, though not perfect,” Kim said. “It makes every image count. And the image you capture at that very moment can never be the same as others.” His photo studio has been successful, with an increase customers in recent years, perhaps hinting at a sense of nostalgia that is beginning to appeal to many Koreans. While some tap into the old days of film photography, others, like Park Sung-jun, a university student, prefers to put pen to paper. “In modern society, everything happens so fast, so I grab a pen to slow down my life a bit,” said the 26-year-old, who still regularly scribbles on paper and keeps a handwritten diary. “Handwriting helps me better express myself and remember what happened.” Park, a so-called digital native ― people who have grown up in a technology-focused world ― still mostly uses a smartphone to take quick notes because it is “convenient and efficient,” but he sticks to handwriting when he writes in his journal. Unlike digital writing, which displays words in perfect order, handwriting better reflects his personality and emotions, he noted. “The type, thickness and color of a pen all matter in expressing how I feel,” he said.Park isn’t alone. Sales of paper diaries have grown over the past few years, with an 8 percent rise in 2014 from the previous year, according to Kyobo Book Center, one of the largest bookstores in Korea. The yearning for jotting down notes has also rekindled an interest in high-end fountain pens. Although they may be unfamiliar accessories to the younger generation, brands such as Montblanc and LAMY saw double-digit growth in sales last year. Park Jong-jin, head of the Fountain Pen Lab, credits the renaissance of pens to the generation that is familiar with a combination of analog and digital cultures. “They write something on paper with a fountain pen and take pictures of their handwriting to share it online,” he said.This fusion of both the digital and analog world seems set to continue. “As the world moves forward, digital and analog will continue to coexist, complementing one another,” the sociology professor Seol said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","largest bookstores in korea the ,digital cameras koreans began taking ,largest bookstores in korea ,the largest bookstores in korea ,bookstores in korea the yearning","['Korea', 'Mulnamoo Photo studio)“korean', 'Seol Dong - hoon', 'Chonbuk National University', 'Seol', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Yang Yoon', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Koreans', 'Yang', 'Koreans', 'Kim Hyun - sik', 'Mulnamoo', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Park Sung - jun', 'Kyobo Book Center', 'Korea', 'Montblanc and LAMY', 'Park Jong - jin', 'the Fountain Pen Lab', 'Seol', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.61479235  0.26888657

None of the 124 South Korean firms have paid March wages to North Korean workers.Seoul's unification ministry said that it will do its best to resolve the wage dispute, adding that the row may be prolonged if it passes the deadline.""As we cannot exclude the possibility that the wage dispute cannot be settled until April 20...the Seoul government will continue to make efforts to resolve the issue,"" Lim Byeong-cheol, spokesman at the unification ministry, said at a press briefing.""What's important is that the government has the will to tackle this row. We do not prejudge any situations without having a specific deadline in mind.""Seoul has not accepted the North's unilateral move, saying Pyongyang violated a 2004 agreement that calls for two quasi-government committees from each side to set the wages together. The wage cap has been set at 5 percent.Its efforts for the talks have gained urgency as North Korea will take days off on Wednesday and Thursday to mark the April 15 birth anniversary of its late founder, Kim Il-sung.The industrial complex opened in the early 2000s, the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped communist country.Lim also called on North Korea to stop threatening to retaliate against a move by Seoul activists to resume their campaign to send anti-Pyongyang leaflets and other materials via balloons across the inter-Korean border.""It is not desirable for North Korea to criticize Seoul activists' leaflet launch as it is a matter of freedom of speech,"" Lim said.

Artistic director and former actor Song Seung-whan, who produced the nonverbal musical hit “Nanta,” said Korea’s assimilation of U.S. popular culture gave it a global identity and marketability. “Through American movies, music and fashion, we were endowed, fortuitously, a universal appeal in our modern identity,” Song said in a lecture at the “Korea CQ” forum at the Turkish embassy residence in Seoul on Tuesday. “Hallyu has spruced up Western ideals with an Asian flavor, creating a cult following in Asia.”The hallyu boom was created when Korean music companies aggressively entered overseas markets after record sales in Korea plummeted in the late 1990s with the digital transition.  Participants pose after listening to renowned actor and artistic director Song Seung-whan (center, seated) speak on hallyu’s past, present and future at the “Korea CQ” forum at the Turkish embassy residence in Seoul last Tuesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“When hallyu fans watch Korean dramas and listen to K-pop, they also check out the celebrities’ clothes, cellphones and furniture. It is culture that drives the economy and elevates the Korea brand,” he explained. Song noted the stock value of AmorePacific cosmetics corporation, which recently surpassed Samsung Electronics.’ The formidable purchasing power of women ― at the heart of hallyu fandom ― is a force to be reckoned with, he said. The Korean government should spend more on culture and art initiatives -― currently at 0.6 percent of national expenditure -― to get closer to the OECD average of 3 percent, Song said.The director highlighted that as people’s income rises, happiness becomes one of experiencing life’s diversity, as opposed to obsessing over money. “When we were poor, our zeitgeist was ‘success.’ We thought that we would be happy after we became successful. But even with a $30,000 income, Koreans are some of the unhappiest people in the world,” Song said. “Our new motto should be ‘happiness.’ We are successful when we become happy.” A key to earning happiness is by engaging in a rich array of cultural activities, according to Song, who is also a professor at Sungshin Women’s University.When asked by Park Jae-woo, vice chairman of the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons, how Korea’s cultural industries can keep up their performance from fast-approaching Chinese competitors, Song said:“The Chinese companies are not as desperate or dependent on the global market due to the sheer size of the domestic economy. Furthermore, unlike ‘Westernized’ Korea, the Chinese culture maintains a strong national identity, molded by the enclosed imperialist and socialist years.”Song said it will take many years until Chinese pop culture reaches a worldwide audience. Until then, he added, Korea can go about its business as Asia’s forerunner in the creative industry. Korea should not regard China solely as a profitable market, Song warned, hinting at the possibility of a top-down boycott campaign. It is wise for both sides to develop a trust-based partnership by mixing Korea’s knowledge and China’s resources, he advised. Praising Korea’s rich art and music scene, Turkish Ambassador Arslan Hakan Okcal said he participated in a kimchi festival, royal procession and fashion show, where he “paraded the catwalk” in a glossy and colorful hanbok.Okcal wished more Koreans would open their eyes to Turkish soap operas, like the Turkish youngsters who love K-pop. “I get lots of emails from 17- and 18-year-olds asking me, ‘Ambassador, what are you doing in Korea, not bringing more K-pop to Turkey?’” he said. “Young Turks love Korean idols’ kinky outfits and hairstyles.”For hallyu’s sustainable development, “Korean pop-culture must dig deeper and be more original, like the timeless Beatles,” the ambassador said. The event was organized by the Corea Image Communication Institute, which promotes Korean culture around the world through membership activities.

The audience watches on in fascination, with both their eyes and cameras zooming in on the scene. The venue was both a fashion show and diplomatic reception marking the silver jubilee of ties between Mongolia and Korea.“I have never seen anything like this for the last two years as an ambassador. It was extraordinary,” Azerbaijani Ambassador Ramzi Teymurov said at the event at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Wednesday.Bulgarian Ambassador Petar Andonov said, “The show was amazing. I felt touched by the beauty of Mongolian culture, choreography and models.”Mongolia, wedged between China and Russia, entered the world economy in the early 1990s after four decades under socialism. It now has a fledgling democracy sitting on a treasure trove of gold, coal, copper and uranium, which feeds the country’s growth. The country of nomads has now well and truly jumped on the bandwagon of globalization. A new middle class with Western tastes is emerging and people are well-traveled and educated. World-famous luxury brands can also be found in its capital Ulan Bator.Models pose at a fashion show as part of the silver jubilee reception between Mongolia and Korea at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Wednesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)Mongolian Ambassador Baasanjav Ganbold told The Korea Herald about his country’s multifaceted culture, which combines nomadic and urban elements. “Our embassy wanted to showcase the beauty of our nomadic heritage in a contemporary tapestry. By weaving fashion, music and dance together, the show presented powerful snapshots of our past, present and future,” Ganbold said, while referring to the work of Mongolian designers Damdin Onobolar and Javhlangiin Tselmeg. Mongolia’s experience of socialism had more freedom than that of China or North Korea, as the nomadic life required free movement across the land. The socialist legacy, rather than being eradicated, has been combined with market elements to create new identities, he said. Korea is a gateway to the league of developed nations for Mongolia, Ganbold said. Bilateral trade volume has increased 140-fold since tying the diplomatic knot, making Korea Mongolia’s fourth-largest trading and investment partner.A total of 1 percent of the Mongolian population ― 25,000 people ― currently live in Korea and over 4,000 Mongolian students study here. “Modern Mongolian and Korean cultures are highly complementary, due to our intertwined history and heritage,” the ambassador noted. “With over 100,000 people exchanging visits every year, the growing social interaction is a firm pillar of our partnership.”Ganbold said Mongolia needs more students studying science, engineering, medicine, information technology and agriculture. While Mongolia has livestock-based agriculture, it wants to learn from Korea’s advanced agricultural science and business models to upgrade its industry, he said. “People have to do practical work to lift the economy to Korea’s level. The country needs more applied science majors than social science majors,” Ganbold said. The ambassador highlighted the two governments’ commitment to the Korean Peninsula Trust Process and Eurasia Initiative, in regards to Korea’s contribution to regional peace and stability,Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said in a speech that Mongolia and Korea closely cooperate on regional initiatives, such as the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative and the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on the Northeast Asian Security. The Mongolian government has initiated some 30 infrastructure and social development projects totaling nearly $100 billion through public-private partnership deals. Korean companies have an opportunity to contribute to Mongolia’s growth, such as in the Tavan Tolgoi coking coal mines project in southern Mongolia. Chinese and Japanese companies have been chosen to take part in the project through a public tender. But the opportunity for Korean comapnies lies in associated infrastructure work, according to the Mongolian embassy.

Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo pays his respects at the ceremony marking the brutal government suppression of the April 3 rebellion waged in 1948 In Jeju on Friday. YonhapThe Korean Peninsula was divided into the U.S. military-controlled South and the Soviet Union-backed communist North after its liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. ""Now, we should leave behind injuries from the past and run toward a new era of hope,"" Lee said in a ceremony in Jeju Island.""In the future (the government) will continue to make utmost efforts to commemorate the victims and to console their bereaved families."" The uprising lasted until 1954, one year after the Korean War ended with an uneasy truce.It took more than a half-century for South Korea to officially investigate the uprising and recognize victims from government suppression.In 2003, then-President Roh Moo-hyun became the first head of state to apologize to the victims for ""the wrongdoing of the past authoritarian government"" and promised to restore their honor.The incident is remembered as one of the most tragic chapters of South Korea's turbulent modern history.In recent years, Jeju Island has become one of the most popular holiday destinations for South Koreans and foreign tourists, mostly Chinese, for its exotic atmosphere.

The boy, named Adam Crapser, wasn't as fortunate: The parents he had were abusive, and never sought the green card or citizenship for him that they should have.Now, at 39, after a life struggling with joblessness because of his lack of immigration papers, homelessness and crime, Crapser, a married father of three, is facing deportation because he's not a citizen.""The state abandoned him when he was a child,'' his attorney, Lori Walls, said. ""Now the U.S. is throwing him out.''A deportation hearing is set for April 2.Federal immigration officials say they became aware of Crapser after he applied to renew his green card two years ago: his criminal convictions, ranging from burglary to assault, made him potentially deportable under immigration law.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wasn't aware of Crapser's childhood adoption history when it decided to pursue his deportation, agency spokesman Andrew Munoz said.Two U.S. senators, including Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, are proposing a stand-alone, automatic citizenship bill for adoptees like Crapser. ""It was not his responsibility to fill out that immigration paperwork,'' Merkley said. ""He knows no other country.''Advocates say thousands of adoptees don't know they aren't citizens until they, for example, try to get a job.The federal government does not track the citizenship status of international adoptees or how many have faced deportation. The State Department says it is aware of adult adoptees who are in immigration removal proceedings.Adoptees who didn't become citizens are lawful permanent residents - but they lack the documents to prove it. Their stories about deportation to countries as diverse as India, Russia or Brazil are detailed on advocacy websites.Many of them remained stuck in legal limbo. A provision that would make citizenship automatic for all international adoptees regardless of age was added to a Senate immigration bill several years ago. But when reform stalled, the provision did, too.Since the 1950s, American couples have adopted nearly half a million children from other countries; about 100,000 of those children came from South Korea. For years, it was the parents' responsibility to seek citizenship, but many did not.In 2000, lawmakers made citizenship automatic for international adoptees, but the law wasn't retroactive. It excluded adoptees 18 or older at the time. Crapser wouldn't have met the criteria.Seven years after Crapser and his sister were adopted, their parents abandoned them. The foster care system separated Crapser, 10 at the time, from his sister, whom he was dependent on, according to orphanage records.The boy bounced through several foster and group homes. When Crapser was 12, he moved in with Thomas and Dolly Crapser, their biological son, two other adoptees and several foster children.The next four years, Adam Crapser said, the couple choked, kicked and hit him and the other children every day, slammed them against walls, set dogs to attack them and burned them with hot objects.""Everything I did was wrong,'' he said. ""As far as humiliation goes, I have been there.''His father also used racial epithets to address him and forced him to forget Korea.""He always told me I'm American, and that I need to let go of my past,'' Adam Crapser said.In 1991, the couple was arrested on charges of physical child abuse, sexual abuse and rape. They denied the charges. Thomas Crapser's sentence included 90 days in jail, and his wife's three years of probation.Because students at his high school teased him about the abuse, Adam Crapser said he dropped out of 9th grade.He became homeless and slept in a shelter or the back of an old car while working several fast food jobs and finishing his high school equivalency diploma at night.The Crapsers had not obtained U.S. citizenship papers for him.Over the next few years, Adam Crapser struggled alone, and also got into trouble with the law.Once it was after he broke into his parents' home - it was, he said, to retrieve the Korean Bible and rubber shoes that came with him from the orphanage - and later it was for stealing cars and assaulting a roommate.Because he lacked a green card to prove he could work in the U.S., he opened a barber shop and an upholstery business - something he could do without immigration papers.He said his parents withheld his adoption record for years, so it wasn't until 2012 that Adam Crapser submitted a green card application - which set in motion his path to a deportation hearing.Adam Crapser said he takes full responsibility for his crimes, but he has ""done his time'' and changed his life.""America promised me a home,'' he wrote in his court declaration. ""I implore this country to keep its promise. If not for me then for my children, so they won't have to grow up without a dad.''

Korea’s total public and private fiscal liabilities could come to more than 2 quadrillion won ($1.8 trillion), government statistics show. The NPAD prioritizes expanding the public service pension to widen the social safety net. But its reform proposal has been criticized for lacking specific data. That makes calculating the plan’s effects on public debt and the service pension difficult, the ruling party said.The Saenuri Party stressed the need to put a cap on the growing government debt, which is estimated at more than 898 trillion won, according to the Finance Ministry. This does not count subsidies to the service pension provided by government coffers.The governing party proposes decreasing overall pension payments to retired civil servants. The plan would increase pension payments to lower-level and generally less-paid government retirees, while taking away funds for higher-level retirees.Public officials, the main beneficiaries of the pension, oppose both plans. Instead, they are pushing to maintain current pension levels, although they have expressed a willingness to contribute more to the fund from their monthly paychecks.Parties previously set May 6 as the deadline for finalizing a reform plan, but the NPAD has recently proposed annulling the date. Its lawmakers say setting a deadline for landmark reforms goes against the public interest. Any reform must be thoroughly discussed, they argue. But the Saenuri Party and the NPAD’s critics say the main opposition party is just buying time due to the upcoming elections.On April 29, four parliamentary voting districts will go to the polls. The NPAD is expected to remain lukewarm on the pension reforms until the polls as government workers are considered to be one of its largest political support groups.“I don’t know what the NPAD is thinking, but they’ve got it all wrong,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.“They seem to be playing a delaying tactic. But such a move is likely to backfire. Government workers are not going to be the largest voting group in the coming elections.“Besides, the April by-elections are not as important as the 2016 general elections and the 2017 presidential election ― two elections that will be influenced by the pension reforms,” Choi added.The pension reforms are not expected to have a large economic impact, according to an economist.“I agree that the issue is a sociopolitical one,” said Kim Wonshik, professor of economics at Konkuk University.Kim was invited by lawmakers to speak at the parliamentary debates among lawmakers and civil servants as a pension expert. “Public officials comprise about one to two million of the population (in a country of about 50 million),” Kim said.“That means decreased pensions are not going to have a denting effect on gross spending, although government spending will obviously decrease.” By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","address growing debt levels korea ,negotiations despite weeks of debate ,growing debt levels korea total ,pensioners raising fears that long ,professor of korean politics at","['South Korea ’s', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Korea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Finance Ministry', 'NPAD', 'the Saenuri Party', 'NPAD ’s', 'NPAD', 'Choi Young - jin', 'korean', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'Kim Wonshik', 'Konkuk University', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Jeong Hunny']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.17471005  0.80227894

It is also the end of months of preparations. However, for many Koreans the wedding is neither the beginning nor an end. While many aspects of Korean society has undergone rapid changes, and westernization since the Korean War, weddings and marriages continue to be influenced by traditional values and customs more than other areas of life. (123rf)For a wedding to occur, the would-be bride and groom must first arrange a formal meeting between their parents. If the potentially awkward meeting goes well, and both families approve of the match, they discuss the date.This, however, often requires the couple to have passed a superstitious hurdle. Many Koreans still place much value in “gunghap,” the evaluation of the couple’s compatibility based on the time and date of the couple’s dates of birth. Once the happy couple is over such hurdles, then comes the matter of picking the venue. Wedding venues range from religious facilities to hotels and wedding halls. Wedding halls, which mostly host “Western style” weddings, are reminiscent of an assembly line where weddings are held in rapid succession.The cost of holding a wedding ceremony is as varied as the type of venues, ranging from negligible to hundreds of millions of won.Once the date and venue are set, there comes the step of exchanging gifts between the families. Although it varies from family to family, the gifts demanded by the groom’s family can range from hefty to the ridiculous. And the scale of the dowry is proportional to the groom’s qualifications.While the dowry traditionally consists of gifts, it is not uncommon for the goods to be replaced with actual cash.For example, it is not unheard of for the family of a groom who is a judge to demand hundreds of millions of won, if not a billion. “(The groom’s family) demanded 1 billion won ($906,000) from my father,” said a 31-year old woman who recently broke off her wedding declining to be named. However, this process may be the “norm” but it is far from standard. The vast majority of people keep the gifts within ranges they can manage or cut it down to a symbolic gesture. But even after this, the expenditure involved in arranging a wedding, and a marriage, is not over. Traditionally, the groom is required to provide the housing – rented or purchased – while the bride’s family provides the appliances, furniture and other items that the couple will use. As with the dowry, the price of the housing and the amount of goods the bride brings can be a source of conflict, and in extreme cases, break-up. Such complicated, and some antiquated, processes are driving more and more couples to opt for small weddings witnessed only by a small number of close family and friends, with dowries and other material aspects often reduced to the minimum. Still others, who find the struggles involved in the process too much to bear, are opting to stay single. The difficulties in finding a job –- a prerequisite for marriage in Korea -- and finding a suitable partner and the burdens that come after marriage are forcing more people to take this route.So many young people are taking this path so that a new term, “sampo generation,” has been coined.The word “sampo” is a combination of the Korean words for “three” and “forfeit,” and refers to those who have given up dating, marrying and having a baby. However, this is not the norm. Nor is everyone deterred.“I married right after my husband was discharged from the Army, and while I had worked for a number of years, he had only just begun working and had very little savings,” Kim, a 38-year old office worker said. She married in 2003 and now has two children and one on the way.“Of course it would have been great if we had lots of money, but we are doing fine. Really, I don’t see why kids today say they are giving up marriage when they have not even tried it.” By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)","many koreans the wedding ,many koreans the wedding is ,for many koreans the wedding ,korean war weddings and marriages ,recently broke off her wedding","['Koreans', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Army', 'Kim', 'Choi']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59152156  0.36534423

What was once widely construed as the culmination of love and happiness, wedding ceremonies have become a commercialized extravaganza in Korea, often forcing couples to seek financial support from parents and take loans from banks. Down the long list of things to tick off for a wedding these days are dowry, a studio photoshoot, bridal gown rental, professional makeup and banquet hall reservation. This can all stack up to a sum that chokes up many eligible bachelors and bachelorettes. Not to mention the indistinguishable ceremonies being a let-down for those who beg to differ.Amid growing concerns over the overheating wedding industry, some couples delay marriage until they are financially ready, while some diverge from the norm and opt for nuptials that are more personalized and affordable. One of the latter, Kim Young-woo and Ha Mi-hyo, decided to avoid the standardized package wedding and take matters into their own hands ― without the help of hotel caterers and Vera Wang dresses. Self-pronounced travel addicts, Kim and Ha met each other for the first time in India in 2001. They dated for 11 years before finally deciding to tie the knot in December 2013. What set them apart from other couples was that instead of making a reservation for a cookie-cutter wedding hall, they booked flights for a 40 day-long trip to Latin America. Their self-wedding portraits taken against the arresting backdrops of Bolivia and Peru quickly drew the attention of other Korean couples. In an interview with The Korea Herald, Kim and Ha likened conventional weddings to carnival cutouts, referencing the large stand-up paintings in amusement parks where people can stick their head out of the hole to get a body of a gorilla or Marilyn Monroe. “We went to several weddings together where the bride and the groom didn’t appear to be enjoying their own ceremony. They were only putting up with the show because it was something everyone else was doing,” Kim said. For Kim and Ha, newlywed couples faded into a pretty blur at identical wedding services. Seeing the picture-perfect weddings degraded into a cliche, the well-traveled couple mapped out their own wedding plan.“We married to come up with an excuse to go to South America,” Ha said with a laugh. “We reserved a room at a Japanese restaurant for our family, who were our only guests, and gave a presentation of photos from our dating years. My brother-in-law sang for us and our parents read us letters. Then we took off on a plane.”The pared-down wedding was intimate and meaningful. Furthermore, it only cost what a regular meal for that number of people would.But not everyone was supportive of their decision to forego the standard wedding. Ha’s two elder sisters, both married and one with children, were fretful. “In the beginning they worried for us, saying that a bigger wedding has to take place to proclaim our lawful bondage. But we assured them that what other people thought of us didn’t matter with our happiness,” Kim said. “Since we didn’t have an overblown nuptial to declare our marriage, we had to at least have good photos to commemorate our union.”Ha purchased a white minidress and veil, which cost her a moderate 100,000 won ($90), and wore it throughout the trip in front of monumental sites. In some locations, people handed her flowers to go with her bridal outfit. The outcome was breathtaking photos of the couple at Bolivia’s Uyuni salt lake desert and Peru’s Machu Picchu, and snapshots around Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina. The couple said traveling together also led to unexpected situations, which enabled them to see each other in a new light, jointly tackle problems and build shared memories.“After seeing our photos a friend of mine told me that he envied my wedding,” Kim said. “He too had wanted a smaller ceremony and an adventurous honeymoon, but he couldn’t convince his parents, nor his future wife.” Kim said it requires a certain kind of courage to take a road less traveled, but blindly following someone else’s footsteps in the hopes of finding happiness is something to be wary of. “I’m not saying our way of a wedding is better. All I’m saying is that it’s important to live your life your way without being scared of what others will say,” he said. The couple’s next joint dream is also directed toward a road less traveled: embarking on a trip around the world.By Lim Jeong-yeo and Hong Hye-jin(kaylalim@heraldcorp.com) (honghyejin@heraldcorp.com)","in korea often forcing couples ,overheating wedding industry some couples ,korea often forcing couples to ,korea often forcing couples ,concerns over the overheating wedding","['thou', 'Shakespeare', 'Korea', 'Kim Young - woo', 'Ha Mi - hyo', 'Kim', 'India', 'Bolivia', 'Peru', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim', 'Marilyn Monroe', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'japanese', 'Kim', 'Peru', 'Machu Picchu', 'Colombia', 'Cuba', 'Ecuador', 'Chile', 'Argentina', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lim Jeong - yeo', 'Hong Hye-jin(kaylalim@heraldcorp.com']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8850041  -0.18234836

""The U.S. puts significance on its alliance with Seoul in terms of strategic values ... So I'd like to say that we deserve to have more confidence.""The Seoul-Tokyo ties have plunged to their lowest level in recent years as Japan is reluctant to apologize for its sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.Historians estimate the number of sex slaves at 200,000 with only 53 South Korean victims still alive.The U.S. seeks to strengthen trilateral security cooperation between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo in an apparent bid to keep a rising China in check. But experts said the long-stained Seoul-Tokyo ties may hamper Washington's efforts.Recently, controversy flared up in Seoul as U.S. Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman last month made remarks seen as taking sides with Japan in a sensitive historical row.Seemingly targeted at Seoul and Beijing, she said political leaders should not try to exploit nationalist feelings and ""earn cheap applause by vilifying a former enemy."" Later, the U.S. sought to calm an upset South Korea, saying that Tokyo's wartime sexual enslavement of women was a terrible violation of human rights.Ahn rejected such speculation over Washington's exhaustion over the matter, taking U.S. President Barack Obama's remarks about the sex slavery as an example.During his visit to Seoul in April 2014, Obama called Japan's use of sex slavery a ""terrible and egregious violation of human rights.""""If we have too much interest, our excessive anxiety or unduly worries over the history issue could even bring about fatigue that does not exist in the U.S.,"" Ahn said.Japan has intensified its moves to whitewash its wartime atrocities since Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in late 2012.In June, Japan reviewed its previous apology over the sex slaves, known as the Kono Statement, saying that the outcome was a political compromise between the two countries.A group of Japanese historians demanded U.S. publisher McGraw-Hill revise the description of Japan's sexual enslavement of women during World War II in a textbook, claiming there are grave errors in the textbook.In early February, a group of American history scholars expressed strong protest against Japan's attempts, saying that no government should have the right to ""censor history.""

The advertisement comes a month before Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to deliver a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Congress during his visit to the U.S. slated for April 26 to May 2. YTN, a local cable news channel, reports on Tokyo’s two-minute advertisement in which the country highlights the positive aspects of Japan’s post-war role in Asia.Analysts say the video clip appears to be intended to highlight the positive aspects of Japan’s postwar role in Asia to counter growing opposition from Korean- and Chinese-Americans to Abe’s planned speech, which they assume will not carry any expressions of atonement for Japan’s wartime atrocities.The clip was produced by Japan’s Foreign Ministry and claims that Tokyo helped lay the foundation for the economic development of South Korea, China, India, Sri Lanka and other Asian countries, without mentioning any of the damage Japan inflicted on them at the height of its militarism.“With the 1951 San Francisco Peace treaty, Japan returned to the international community and in 1954, started providing economic assistance to Asian countries,” the clip said, referring to the treaty of Japan’s postwar settlements with allied powers. “It encouraged the steady flow of private investments, including those of Japanese firms, bringing sustainable growth to the region.”Japan pointed to specific cases where it assisted in Korea’s infrastructure development, including Subway Line 1 in Seoul, a steel plant in the southeastern port city of Pohang and the Soyang River Dam in Gangwon Province. It also touched on the construction of hydropower plants in Myanmar and Indonesia; harbors in China and Sri Lanka; and a water supply system in Cambodia.Calling the clip a distortion of history, critics in Korea argued that Japan’s description of its support for infrastructure played down the grueling industrialization efforts each Asian country made to become economically advanced. They also said Tokyo misrepresented its postwar compensation as voluntary financial assistance to Asian countries.The content of the advertisement gives a glimpse into what Abe might say in his speech slated for April 29 at the U.S. Congress. Observers say he may not focus on Japan’s wartime wrongdoings or any efforts to address the still-strong memories of Japan’s past militarism.Deteriorating public sentiment against Tokyo in Korea is expected to pose a headache for Washington as Abe’s visit to the United States is largely meant to reaffirm the robust U.S.-Japan alliance and stress Japan’s greater security role in the face of regional and global security challenges.In Korea, there have been concerns the U.S. has been lukewarm toward Tokyo’s apparently revisionist views of history, particularly after a senior U.S. official made remarks that indicated that Seoul and Beijing were also to blame for strained ties with Tokyo in regards to the past.During his visit to the U.S., Abe and U.S. President Barack Obama are expected to highlight the evolvement of their alliance over the past 70 years. They are also expected to sign a revision of its 1997 bilateral defense cooperation guidelines. The revision is expected to contain a set of joint measures to cope with Chinese threats and other emerging scenarios. First adopted in 1978 to counter Soviet threats, the guidelines were last amended in 1997 to reflect post-Cold War security threats.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","two minute ad on cnn ,japan wartime atrocities the clip ,on tokyo two minute advertisement ,news channel reports on tokyo ,reports on tokyo two minute","['Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'asian', 'CNN', 'YouTube', 'korean', 'French', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'the U.S. Congress', 'U.S.', 'YTN', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Chinese - Americans', 'Abe ’s', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Tokyo', 'South Korea', 'China', 'India', 'Sri Lanka', 'asian', 'Japan', 'San Francisco', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pohang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Myanmar', 'Indonesia', 'China', 'Sri Lanka', 'Cambodia', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Tokyo', 'asian', 'Abe', 'the U.S. Congress', 'Japan', 'Japan ’s', 'Tokyo', 'Korea', 'Washington', 'Abe ’s', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Tokyo', 'U.S.', 'Abe', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'chinese', 'soviet', 'Song Sang - ho']",19,"[10.          2.          0.         ... -0.55403817  0.2687048

(Yonhap)On Wednesday, the Navy decided to refer a vice admiral and rear admiral to its disciplinary board on allegations that they pressured caddies to sing and dance multiple times at a golf course inside a naval unit in Jinhae, South Gyeongsang Province, since last November.The two would face punishment for using their senior positions to make “inappropriate demands,” the Navy said. Another rear admiral in charge of management of the golf course will also be referred to the board for failing to report the case to the higher authorities.The referral to the disciplinary panel came the day after a pan-governmental anticorruption panel indicted a retired rear admiral and a retired commander on charges of manipulating documents regarding the evaluation of a substandard part of a naval salvage ship, named Tongyeong, to help a foreign defense firm win a procurement deal. The indictment of the two retirees was just the latest in a recent series of cases involving former admirals.Former Chief of Naval Operations Hwang Ki-chul was arrested last Sunday on charges of peddling influence to allow the foreign firm to win a deal to supply a part of the salvage ship Tongyeong. Hwang served from 2013-2015 as CNO.The corruption scandals surrounding the Tongyeong acquisition have drawn the ire of the public as its delivery to the Navy has been delayed due to some of its underperforming parts. Due to the delay, the advanced ship failed to be deployed to help support the rescue operations of the sunken Sewol ferry last April.Hwang’s arrest came after another corruption scandal involving a former Navy chief sent shockwaves across the nation.Chung Ok-geun, who led the Navy from 2008-2010, was arrested in January on charges of receiving hundreds of millions of won from a local firm after he helped it win a deal to participate in the Navy’s acquisition of next-generation warships.The sexual and corruption scandals occurred as the North continues to pose a serious naval threat to the South by frequently violating the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean sea border, and carrying out maritime drills that are designed to infiltrate into South Korea’s border islands.Critics called for a sweeping reform in the Navy to restore public trust and troop morale. During his inauguration ceremony a month ago, new Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jung Ho-sub vowed to stamp out corruption and sexual misconduct, saying that the Navy should be reborn to win back public sentiment.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","corruption scandal involving former navy ,ferry last april hwang arrest ,scandals have overshadowed the navy ,after another corruption scandal ,scandal involving former navy chief","['the south korean Navy', 'North Korea ’s', 'Navy', 'North ’s', 'Tongyeong', 'Navy', 'Jinhae , South Gyeongsang Province', 'Navy', 'Tongyeong', 'Tongyeong', 'Hwang', 'Tongyeong', 'Navy', 'Sewol', 'Hwang', 'Navy', 'Chung ok - geun', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'the Northern Limit Line', 'inter - korean', 'South Korea ’s', 'Navy', 'Jung Ho - sub', 'Navy', 'Song Sang - ho']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27352053  0.17374614

(Yonhap)One of the officials who asked for anonymity said the fire appeared to have begun at a farm near a North Korean billet. It wasn't immediately clear whether the farm was located inside or outside the DMZ. Authorities said the fire appeared unintentional, as the North Korean military was also trying to quench it.By 3:45 p.m., the fire was within the proximity of the Dora Observatory in Paju, north of Seoul, a popular tourist destination.There has been no report of injuries or damage so far, officials said, as the observatory was closed to visitors this day.Access to the customs office leading to the South Korea-run industrial complex in the North's border town of Kaesong has been restricted since around 2:30 p.m.More than 50 South Korean firefighters were putting out the fire, Paju city and military officials said, adding three helicopters were aiding the process under the approval of the United Nations Command.Firefighters said they were experiencing difficulty extinguishing the fire due to strong winds and their inability to enter the northern side of the border. The two Koreas are technically at war since no peace treaty has been signed to end the 1950-53 Korean War.It was not immediately clear what caused the fire, a South Korean military official said.The Korean DMZ, the world's most heavily-armed border, runs the width of the Korean Peninsula roughly along the 38th parallel. It is guarded by more than 2 million troops on both sides.Drought in the central part of the Korean Peninsula has caused several fires recently. As of Monday, the entire northern part of the Gyeonggi Province surrounding Seoul has been under a drought warning.

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has recently gained traction as major Western economies, including Britain, Germany and France, decided to join the Chinese-led bank. Close U.S. allies in Asia -- South Korea, Australia and Japan -- have yet to make their decisions. The end of March is the deadline set by China for all interested parties to join the new bank, which many experts see as a counterbalance to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, which have been dominated by the United States and other Western economies.South Korean Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan has said Seoul will make a decision by the deadline, while Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said earlier in the day that Tokyo could consider joining the AIIB if conditions are met. Asked about the stances by South Korea and Japan, China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei replied, ""With regard to our neighbors in Asia such as South Korea and Japan as well as an important Asia-Pacific country Australia, these countries also expressed that they will make a positive consideration about this issue."" ""We are open to their decisions,"" Hong said.The United States has been negative about the Chinese push that is seen widely as an attempt to bolster its economic clout in Asia.The U.S. has called for transparency and high standards of governance as key requirements for such an institution.China has offered $50 billion with a reported stake of up to 50 percent in the AIIB, which South Korea viewed negatively because China could make a unilateral decision in the bank.""The establishment of the AIIB is to promote economic development and infrastructure building in Asia,"" Hong said.

Entertainment expenses have been on the rise since 2000, with the only exception being in 2005.   Banks and insurance firms were the biggest spenders. Tax office data said 18,518 firms in this category spent an estimated 750 billion won on entertainment expenses in 2013. This breaks down to more than 40 million won per company.  Manufacturers spent 27.39 million won on average, the second highest, with health and medical related business spending 26.66 million won on average during the one-year period.  Business insiders say the data do not show the entire picture, with the actual amount probably topping 9 trillion won by a considerable margin.  Under the local tax rules, the basic annual deduction per company for entertainment spending is set at 12 million won, with the maximum deduction reaching between 0.03 percent and 0.2 percent of sales, depending on the size of the business.  The general estimate is that small and medium enterprises exceed the maximum limit by upwards of 50 percent, while corresponding numbers for conglomerates reach around 30 percent.  South Korea's parliament on March 3 passed the anti-graft ""Kim Young-ran Law"" that severely restricts exchanges of money and gifts to wipe out corruption. The law also sets limits on the price of meals that a person can be treated to between people whose interests are at stake.  The law, named after the former head of the country's Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, aims to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules that are unable to punish public officials for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is clear sign of reciprocity. The strengthened law subjects public officials, journalists and private school faculty to a maximum penalty of three years in prison or a fine of five times the amount they accept in money or valuables, regardless of whether it is in exchange for favors or related to their work.   ""It may be a good idea to reduce tax deductions and even get rid of the entertainment expenses category from local accounting books altogether,"" said Lee Jong-soo, a government administration professor at Hansung University.  A business insider noted how entertainment costs actually hurt ordinary people.   ""Such practices add extra cost to companies that will eventually pass on the burden to consumers, translating into higher service charges and finished product prices,"" he said.  ""Entertainment spending is understandable to some extent, yet if it becomes excessive, it can be detrimental for the business environment as a whole,"" said Sohn Won-ik, a senior official at Deloitte Korea said.   In the United States' case, there are some tax benefits for meals and entertainment outlays used by companies, while Britain includes entertainment spending as part of corporate employees' wages. Germany accepts up to 70 percent of all such spending as legitimate expenses entitled to tax breaks.  ""Entertainment expenses usually lack transparency,"" argued Ahn Chang-nam, a tax expert at Kangnam University.  He said that worries expressed by business and government circles that withdrawing tax deductions will adversely affect consumer spending are exaggerated.  The finance ministry, on the other hand, argued that the total sum that is eligible for deductions is not really high, and that some advanced economies do offer some kind of tax break. It said for the moment the government is not looking at adjusting the current system.

At a time when Korea’s IT industry profits are dwindling amid a sagging economy, Bulgaria offers a blue ocean of well-educated workers and a business-friendly environment, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, Andonov said. “Korea’s strength in developing computer hardware and Bulgaria’s strength in software can be harmonized as part of President Park Geun-hye’s ‘creative economy’ road map,” he said. “Despite Bulgarian workers’ high education credentials, operational and labor costs remain one of the lowest in Europe.”Bulgaria has a myriad of small and medium-sized companies doing contract programming for multinational firms, including BMW, SAP, HP, IBM, Boeing, Nortel, Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle.  Bulgarian Ambassador to Korea Petar Andonov (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The country has a strong tradition in informatics education from the communist era, as it was the largest manufacturer of personal computers within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance alliance.To this day, an “unusually high number of students” major in electronics, engineering and computer sciences in university, giving Bulgaria its reputation as the Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe, he said.The ICT sector in Bulgaria has taken up a growing share of the national economy through exports: Bulgarian ICT companies work as subcontractors in foreign projects or specialize in importing, assembling and selling hardware and software. Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007 ― matters of “civilizational choice,” according to Andonov. The country is currently positioning itself as a regional transport and logistics hub at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, he added. “We are trying to diversify our energy sources as part of European Union’s Juncker Plan and Energy Union (a massive 315 billion euro scheme to boost investment and create jobs),” the ambassador explained, stressing that energy security has been a vital national concern in light of the country’s total dependence on Russia for natural gas import.The ambassador noted that Samsung C&T;, Hyundai Heavy Industries and Korea South-East Power Corporation have invested in Bulgaria’s solar energy sectors. “More Korean companies can participate in various energy infrastructure projects, including hydropower generation facility construction along the Danube,” he added. Investing in Bulgaria gives companies wider access to markets in Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Southeastern European countries not yet part of the EU ― Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania. Bulgaria’s currency board arrangement has kept the foreign exchange rate fixed at 1.95 lev per euro, preventing currency fluctuation and ensuring predictability for investors. Both corporate and personal income taxes are 10 percent. After the EU-Korea free trade agreement came into force in July 2011, trade between Bulgaria and Korea increased 35 percent annually, reaching the highest volume at $273 million. Cumulative Korean investment in Bulgaria is around $254 million. In 2013, Bulgaria exported $175 million worth of precious metals, electronic microchips, agri-food and seafood to Korea; Korea exported $126 million euros worth of cars, tires, electronic goods, home appliances and semiconductors to Bulgaria. “I wish to export more of our rose oil, organic food, pharmaceutical products, meat products and wine to Korea,” Andonov said. Bulgaria and Korea established a diplomatic relationship in 1990 and strategic partnership in 2010. The approaching 25th anniversary of ties on March 23 will set a benchmark for further cooperation in all fields, he said. “The last 25 years of our relationship was spearheaded by the market opening, but the next 25 years and beyond will certainly depend on our younger generation,” Andonov said. “People-to-people exchanges through traditional and popular culture can do what governments and businesses cannot.” The Sofia University in Bulgaria has a Korean language and culture center and Hanguk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul has a Bulgarian language department. Andonov was a foreign policy and economy analyst at TV Europe (2006-09) and U.S. Radio Free Europe (2003-06), Bulgarian ambassador to Japan and the Philippines (1998-2003), economic adviser to the prime minister (1991-92) and president of Bulgaria (1997-98).By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","companies bulgarian ambassador to korea ,tapped by korean companies bulgarian ,university in bulgaria has korean ,korean companies bulgarian ambassador to ,energy sectors more korean companies","['Bulgaria', 'ict', 'korean', 'bulgarian', 'Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Bulgaria', 'Andonov', 'Korea', 'Bulgaria', 'Park Geun - hye', 'bulgarian', 'BMW', 'SAP', 'HP', 'IBM', 'Boeing', 'Nortel', 'Microsoft', 'Cisco', 'Oracle', 'bulgarian', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee', 'the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance', 'Bulgaria', 'ICT', 'Bulgaria', 'bulgarian', 'Bulgaria', 'NATO', 'EU', 'Andonov', 'European Union ’s Juncker Plan and Energy Union', 'Russia', 'Samsung C&T', 'Hyundai Heavy Industries', 'Korea South - East Power Corporation', 'Bulgaria', 'korean', 'Danube', 'Bulgaria', 'the Commonwealth of Independent States', 'southeastern european', 'EU', 'Bosnia', 'Herzegovina', 'Serbia', 'Macedonia', 'Montenegro', 'Kosovo', 'Albania', 'Bulgaria', 'EU', 'Korea', 'Bulgaria', 'Korea', 'cumulative korean', 'Bulgaria', 'Bulgaria', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Bulgaria', 'Korea', 'Andonov', 'Bulgaria', 'Korea', 'Andonov', 'the Sofia University', 'Bulgaria', 'korean', 'Hanguk University of Foreign Studies', 'Seoul', 'bulgarian', 'andonov', 'U.S. Radio Free Europe', 'bulgarian', 'Japan', 'Philippines', 'Bulgaria', 'Joel Lee']",4,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.51625055  0.80839759

The plant will be constructed in the Korean pharmaceutical industry complex, which is also to be established in the city. The opening date of both the complex and plant has not yet been decided, the ministry said. Korea’s Yonsei University Severance Hospital has agreed to be in charge of treatment at a medical center specializing in women’s cancers that is scheduled to open in Riyadh in 2016. The hospital, which will house about 150 patients, is being constructed by Saudi health care firm Integrated Business Ventures and a number of U.S. firms. Korea’s Green Cross Laboratories, on the other hand, has signed to establish a clinical laboratory in Saudi Arabia to research specimens collected from patients at the medical center in Riyadh.All the deals between the firms of the two countries were signed a deal during Park’s ongoing trip to the Middle East, which also includes visits to Kuwait, Qatar and UAE. “We hope health and medical businesses can generate the second ‘Middle Eastern boom’ following the early bilateral ties between Korea and the Middle East in the ’70s, which were limited to energy and construction,” said Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, who is currently accompanying Park.At the government level, Moon and his Saudi counterpart Al Khateeb agreed to launch joint research and development projects on health care. South Korea will share information on its national health insurance system, as well as its Hospital Information System ― known as HIS ― where all of the medical charts are digitized, along with the personal data of the patients, among others.South Korea is one of the most popular medical tourism destinations for affluent citizens in the Middle East. Some 2,500 people from the four Middle East countries visited Seoul in 2013 for medical treatment. Among them, those from the UAE spent the most ― an average of 17.7 million won, which is almost 9.5 times higher than the average spending of 1.8 million won per foreign patient the same year.

Six votes were needed to overturn the law.Under the law, adultery was a crime punishable by up to two years behind bars. Any third person involved in a love affair could also face criminal charges. The regulation was only applicable when a spouse filed a lawsuit. Nine judges deliver a decision at the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)“The public perception toward the anticheating law does not reach consensus anymore. Whether to sustain a marriage should depend on people’s free will and choices,” the majority of the judges said.“Considering the level of social criticism (of the adultery law), it has become difficult to bring about the intended precautionary effects. In fact, it has rather been used as a means of divorce for those who committed more faults (than their partners) yet wished to break up, and a means of blackmailing erratic housewives.”The two dissenting judges viewed the matter differently.“Adultery is an act that damages the marriage-based social system and has a destructive impact on families. Therefore, it is not included in the realm of the individual’s sexual rights,” the minority said, including a left-leaning female judge. “The abolishment of the adultery law can lower the level of sexual morality (in society), and thereby accelerate the dissolution of the family system,” they added.In the past, the court had turned down petitions to repeal the law four times from 1990 to 2008. In its 2008 ruling, the majority of the judges supported personal freedom but were one vote shy of ordering a change.Since the enactment of the adultery law in 1953, there has been a national debate over its legality. While some claimed that the law was necessary to protect family values and to keep the legacy of traditionally long-revered Confucian values, others argued that it breached privacy rights. Public requests to abolish the law have mounted as the law was sometimes used to exact personal revenge or secure more alimony. It also tended to put women at an unfair disadvantage due to social prejudice. The court’s landmark ruling is expected to affect thousands of people who have been punished so far. While about 100,000 people were punished by the controversial law since 1953, the severity of the punishments have gradually declined. Among those, only some 5,400 people ― those who were indicted on charges of violating the adultery law since Oct. 31, 2008 ― are expected to be allowed a retrial. The judiciary authorities allow a retrial request from only those who faced charges a day after the last constitutional ruling on the same topic was announced. The last ruling in favor of the adultery law was upheld on Oct. 30, 2008. The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy hailed the court’s decision, saying that it reflected social changes. The ruling Saenuri Party stressed that the marriage and family system should still be respected.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","korea controversial adultery law ending ,controversial adultery law ending decadeslong ,adultery law ending decadeslong debate ,controversial adultery law ending ,south korea controversial adultery law","['the Constitutional Court', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'confucian', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54088712  0.31349245

""Not only is the anti-adultery law gradually losing its place in the world, it no longer reflects our people's way of thinking.""  Two other justices supported this view, saying family issues should not be criminal, or even if so, the weight of the penalty should vary according to the intricacy of the matter.  The remaining two justices voiced opposition, saying the law was necessary to protect sexual ethics and the institution of marriage.Under the landmark ruling, some 5,400 people indicted or convicted of adultery after Oct. 30, 2008, when the law was last upheld, may ask for a suspension of indictment or a retrial.  South Korea had been one of the few remaining countries in Asia that prohibits infidelity, next to North Korea and Taiwan. Extramarital affairs here had been banned under the criminal law since 1953, and before that, only women were held accountable for some fooling around.  Sentences have been relatively heavy, with jail time ranging up to two years being the only fate a cheater and his affair partner could face. In Taiwan, the sentences range up to just one year in prison.  Previously, the court had turned down petitions to repeal the law four times from 1990 to 2008. In 2008, however, the judges supporting personal freedom became a majority, but were only one vote shy of realizing a change. Some 100,000 South Koreans have been convicted of adultery since 1953. But the conviction rate dwindled from two-thirds between 1985 and now, to below 1 percent between late 2008 and early this year.  Many experts and activists welcomed the ruling, saying it demonstrated progress in women's rights.  ""The anti-cheating law has been traditionally aimed at punishing women, but those days are long gone now,"" Song Jae-ryong, a sociology professor at Kyung Hee University, said.  Others said the law was practically non-existent, as it had lost its effectiveness in preventing infidelity.  ""The anti-adultery law is no longer achieving its purpose,"" Kim Jeong-beom, a law professor at Hangyang University, said. ""Penalties have become extremely light and don't have the preventative effect they're supposed to have.""  The state shouldn't interfere in personal matters, which should be settled in a civil manner, another expert said.  Public reaction, however, was mixed, with some voicing concerns that the ruling may encourage promiscuity.  ""I'm worried that the decision would make people less responsible to their spouses,"" said Lee Gyu-yeong, a teacher.  But others supported it, saying it enhanced personal freedom.  ""It's not appropriate for the criminal code to intervene in people's love life,"" Kim Min-soo, an office worker, said. ""And it's not like the ruling would make people feel freer to cheat than before.""

The report, obtained by The Associated Press, makes clear the challenge of keeping banned arms and luxury goods from a nuclear-armed country with a history of using front companies to duck detection. The U.N. Security Council holds consultations Thursday on the report, which also says North Korea's government persists with its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of council resolutions. The council last year imposed sanctions on OMM after Panama in 2013 seized a ship it operated that carried undeclared military equipment from Cuba. Panamanian authorities found two Cuban fighter jets, missiles and live munitions beneath the Chong Chon Gang's cargo of sugar. The council's sanctions committee said that violated a U.N. arms embargo imposed in response to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said that imposing a global asset freeze on OMM meant that the company would no longer be able to operate internationally. But the new report says that in the months after the sanctions were imposed, 13 of the 14 ships controlled by OMM changed their owners and managers, ""effectively erasing"" the company from a database kept by the International Maritime Organization. Twelve of the ships ""reportedly stayed, visited or were sighted near ports in foreign countries,"" and none were frozen by member states as the panel of experts recommends. The new report explores the shipping company's global reach, using people and entities operating in at least 10 countries: Brazil, China, Egypt, Greece, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Russia, Singapore and Thailand. The report recommends updating the sanctions list with 34 OMM entities and says all 14 vessels should be subject to sanctions.  No interdictions of the kind that Panama made in 2013 were reported in the period between Feb. 8 of last year and Feb. 5 of this year. But the new report warns that the panel of experts sees no evidence that North Korea ""intends to cease prohibited activities."" The report also says diplomats, officials and trade representatives of North Korea continue to ""play key roles in facilitating the trade of prohibited items, including arms and related materiel and ballistic missile-related items."" The panel of experts warns that some U.N. member states still are not implementing the council resolutions that are meant to keep North Korea from further violations. North Korea also faces an embargo on luxury goods, but the report found that it managed to bring in luxury goods from multiple countries, including with the help of its diplomatic missions. Some items were for the country's Masik Pass luxury ski report, which opened in 2013. China told the panel of experts that the ski lift equipment it provided was acceptable because ""skiing is a popular sport for people"" and that ski items are not specifically prohibited. In another case, a yacht seen alongside leader Kim Jong Un in 2013 was sourced by the panel of experts to a British manufacturer, Princess Yachts International, which the panel said did not reply to a request for more information. The panel also said it has opened its first investigation into a case involving North Korean drones after the wreckage of three drones was found in South Korea in late 2013 and 2014. The report says the drones had been used for reconnaissance over South Korean military facilities and that the drones contained components ""sourced from at least six foreign countries."" North Korea protests that the U.N. sanctions are harmful to its citizens, but the report says it has found no incidents where they ""directly resulted in shortages of ... humanitarian aid."" It does recommend that the sanctions committee propose exemptions for purely food, medical or other humanitarian needs.

It was a sharp fall from the average of 51.9 in 1994.  The data came as South Korea's fertility rate has been stalling between 1.2 to 1.3 children per woman in recent years.

Moscow has been reaching out to Pyongyang in recent months in an apparent effort to increase its influence in inter-Korean affairs and secure investment from the South in major trilateral economic projects, such as a joint industrial district, railway, gas pipeline and power grid. With the country celebrating the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he had received “positive” signs that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would join a ceremony on May 8 in Moscow, which would be Kim’s first overseas trip since taking power in December 2012. Yet the outreach poses a dilemma for South Korea. Vladimir Putin. (EPA-Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye is also invited, so the event may set the stage for an unprecedented meeting with Kim and thus open a chance to break the prolonged stalemate in cross-border ties. It would also likely serve as a much-needed catalyst for her drive for greater Eurasian cooperation, the centerpiece of her third-year diplomatic agenda. Her participation, in contrast, could hit a raw nerve in Washington at a time when the crisis in Ukraine is reigniting Western tension with Moscow. In the wake of the annexation of Crimea, stifling sanctions imposed by the West have prompted Russia to turn to the East, bolstering ties with China, India, South Korea and Central Asia. Confirming that President Barack Obama will be absent, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser at the White House, recently hinted that the U.S. hoped Park would not travel to Russia, stressing the need for “one voice” among allies. “In terms of our allies around the world, I think the key point we’ve made is that it’s important for the world to speak with one voice on behalf of the principle of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and the notion that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones, to redraw maps,” he said at a news conference in Washington last week. Shepherd Iverson, a professor of the Center for Korean Studies at Inha University in Incheon, said the U.S. was still vital for South Korean interests. “The penultimate economic and military power in the world is the U.S., and will remain so for some time. The Chinese and South Korean economies are intricately intertwined and depend on Western markets for their success. South Korea ultimately depends on the U.S. for its survival,” he said.“North Korea is the Ukraine of East Asia.”Japan, too, has sought to enhance relations with Russia with attempts to resolve a territorial dispute, boost energy imports and invest in the Far East and Siberia development. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has held five summits with President Vladimir Putin since his swearing-in in December 2012. Yet the efforts came to naught when Tokyo joined the anti-Russia sanctions ― under pressure from Washington, its top ally and security provider, and as a member of the Group of 7 major economies. Abe has yet to decide whether he will take part in the celebration.A growing number of Seoul officials are inclined to decline the invitation, though they say for the time being that no decision has been made and all related factors will be taken into account. Park’s attendance, they say, would only grant Kim a diplomatic coup and increase Moscow’s leverage in the face of icy relations between Pyongyang and Beijing. In addition, a summit held on the margins of a multilateral conference would be less likely to produce substantive results. “She should not be there, all the more so if Kim Jong-un is coming ― he will be a scene-stealer, attracting all the international media attention,” a senior official said, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “But we need to continue efforts to better Russian ties such as through the Rajin-Khasan project,” he added, referring to the fledgling initiative to refurbish a port city and railroad near the North Korea-Russia border.Another official said, “There would be few incentives that we could gain from her trip. … And Moscow doesn’t seem to be the best place for the leaders of the two Koreas to meet for the first time.” Some experts argue that Park should go, not just for talks with the young leader, but to prevent the current situation from shaping up like the timeworn contest between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan and North Korea, China and Russia. Given Beijing’s aloofness toward Pyongyang, Moscow’s efforts could expedite not only her “Eurasia Initiative” but also inter-Korean rapprochement and possibly the resumption of the six-nation denuclearization talks, they note. “I think it is humiliating (for South Korea) to follow orders from across the ocean and to not pursue its own interests ― relations with the North ― and lose a chance for an inter-Korean summit on a neutral soil,” Georgy Toloraya, director of Korean programs at the Institute of Economy at the Russian Academy of Science, said in an email interview with The Korea Herald. “I think what Russia is doing is aimed at helping South Korea to improve relations with North Korea and get back to reconciliation process.” North Korea, for its part, is realigning its old relationships with China and Russia, after years of oscillating between the two patrons according to its interests following the Cold War era. Many experts assess that Pyongyang’s ties with Beijing are at a post-Cold War low, chiefly driven by the Kim regime’s tests of a long-range missile and then a nuclear device just a few months ahead of President Xi Jinping’s inauguration. Then the young ruler executed Jang Song-thaek, his uncle and the country’s second-most influential man, who had built up political and business ties with China. Xi was the first Chinese leader to visit Seoul before Pyongyang. “While trying to work out its own salvation given frosty ties with China, North Korea is leaning toward Russia,” Ko Jae-nam, a professor of European and African studies at the state-run Korea National Diplomatic Academy, wrote in a paper released Thursday. “Russia is also seeking to expand its influence over the peninsula by enhancing North Korea relations, which in fact has paid off to a considerable extent. If Kim Jong-un indeed accepts the invitation and attends the May ceremony, which I believe he quite likely will, it will trigger repercussions in relations between the two Koreas and their respective ties with Russia.” Iverson said “win-win plans” for three-party rail or pipeline projects would have a positive impact. But their success would require strenuous behind-the-scenes negotiations, and Seoul would need to step up diplomacy efforts given the current tension between the U.S. and Russia. “Washington knows that South Korea has been trying for years to get a pipeline and a railroad thorough North Korea connecting itself with Russia. In traveling to Moscow, President Park and her delegation may refer to economic self-interest. This is no surprise to the U.S.,” he said. “It is obviously not an opportune time to symbolically support Russia or to emphasize a growing friendship. Putin has never been politically weaker domestically.”By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","north korea russia is adding ,chinese leader to visit seoul ,thursday russia is also seeking ,timeworn contest between south korea ,korea vladimir putin epa yonhap","['North Korea', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Nazi Germany', 'russian', 'Sergey Lavrov', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Moscow', 'Kim ’s', 'South Korea', 'Vladimir Putin', 'EPA', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim', 'Washington', 'Ukraine', 'Moscow', 'Crimea', 'Russia', 'China', 'India', 'South Korea', 'Barack Obama', 'Ben Rhodes', 'U.S.', 'Park', 'Russia', 'Washington', 'Shepherd Iverson', 'Inha University', 'Incheon', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Tokyo', 'Washington', 'the Group of 7', 'Abe', 'Seoul', 'Park ’s', 'Kim', 'Moscow', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Kim Jong - un', 'russian', 'Khasan', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Koreas', 'Park', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'Moscow', 'inter - korean', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Georgy Toloraya', 'korean', 'the Institute of Economy at', 'the Russian Academy of Science', 'the Korea Herald', 'Russia', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'Kim', 'Xi Jinping ’s', 'Jang Song - thaek', 'China', 'Xi', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Ko Jae - nam', 'european', 'african', 'Korea National Diplomatic Academy', 'Russia', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Koreas', 'Russia', 'Iverson', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'Washington', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'Putin', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 1.          4.          0.         ... -0.6892156   0.72681409

According to the nation’s Health Ministry, more than 95 percent of measles patients in Korea last year were infected during an overseas trips, or by those who had traveled abroad.The number of measles patients in Korea quadrupled from 107 in 2013 to 442 last year. Many were infected in China or the Philippines. According to last year’s WHO data, Asia has the most suspected measles cases, with China on top, followed by the Philippines and Vietnam. Over 100,000 measles cases were reported in China and the Philippines alone last year, with the latter’s immunization program interrupted by Typhoon Haiyan. The spread of the virus has accelerated due to mass migration in the island country, with almost 4 million people displaced by the natural disaster.Measles outbreaks have been recently reported in North America this year after people were infected at Disneyland in California.“Measles cases are still being reported occasionally in China and the Philippines, and those who are unvaccinated have a 90 percent chance of catching the disease once exposed to the virus,” the Health Ministry said in a statement. “We encourage everyone who plans to go abroad to get their vaccinations before leaving the country.”Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads through the air by sneezing or coughing. Symptoms include runny nose, coughing, red eyes and fever along with a rash of red dots that can cover one’s entire body.In 2013, more than 145,000 died from measles worldwide. According to the WHO, more than 95 percent of measles deaths occur in nations with low per capita incomes and poor health care systems.Those who have had measles in the past, as well as those who received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine are considered to be immune to the disease. Those who have never had measles and never received a vaccine are encouraged to get vaccinated, said South Korea’s Health Ministry.

In contrast, market share by foreign brands reached 56.8 percent.The local producer lost its share as the government marked up prices of a pack of cigarettes by 80 percent, or by 2,000 won ($1.82), this year. Officials said they were aiming to encourage people to quit smoking.KT&G; remained the best-selling brand, but Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco Inc. made headway in the first month of the year, the convenience store operator said.Philip Morris accounted for 24.4 percent of all sales followed closely by 23.4 percent for BAT and 9 percent for JTI.In terms of quantity, KT&G;'s market share stood at 38.3 percent, while corresponding numbers for foreign rivals stood at 61.7 percent.Philip Morris' share stood at 21.1 percent, with 29.8 percent being tallied for BAT and 10.8 percent for JTI.Such numbers were broadly repeated for the other convenience store chain that said KT&G;'s sales share dropped to 46.2 percent in the first month of 2015, while in terms of quantity, numbers stood at 40.5 percent.The chain said KT&G; still was ahead of its rivals, but its lead has been eroded drastically compared to last year, while BAT's market presence moved up sharply thanks to the popularity of such products as Vogue.Market watchers said price cuts by foreign brands helped win over consumers.BAT's Vogue sold for 3,500 won per pack, cheaper than the prices for most South Korean cigarettes that sold for 4,500 won.This strategy was emulated by Philip Morris, which adjusted prices of its Marlboro and Parliament brands by 200 won each. These two cigarettes sold for 4,500 won a pack, the same as local brands.KT&G; projected that despite the company losing market share last month, such developments will not last for long.""KT&G; has maintained a market share in the low 50 percent range for quite some time, and this is not likely to be affected in the future,"" a company official said.

As per data released by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, and Statistics Korea, the number of licensed international marriage agencies dropped by one-third from 1370 firms in 2012. (Yonhap)Behind the drop lies the government’s decision to control the number of marriage brokers to prevent marriage fraud. The Justice Ministry enacted a restrictive rule for issuing a license to marriage brokers in Korea in 2013. However, the measure did not work out. According to figures from Statistics Korea, the number of international marriage frauds has been increasing since 2013. “The increase stems from the government’s misguided policy,” said Lim Dong-won, an associate attorney from Wonjin, Korea-based law firm. “The government’s strict rule pushed out the legitimate agency. Rather, it drew in fraudulent brokers who diversified their tactics to continue their business without holding a license.”One of their common tactics is to give false hope. According to a study of marriage frauds, brokers took advantage of unmarried Korean men by giving them false hopes of a perfect marriage. In fact, the brokers only cared about making money out of arranging a marriage. They never verified whether the bride wanted to marry him in the first place “My wife never wanted to marry me right from the beginning. She only cared about money. She thought of me as someone who should bring money to her and her family members.” an anonymous victim of marriage fraud said in an interview with Munhwa IlboAfter his marriage in December 2013, the couple started slowly drifting apart, so he took her to a local multicultural center for marriage counseling. He bought her a brand new smartphone, and even went so far as to wire 500,000 won to her parents’ account. But she continued to demand more money from him. After five years, she finally left him. Another tactic is to extort money. The brokers did not allow a meeting between the couple until a broker commission was paid. The commission went by different names such as tuition for learning Hangul and cost to settle down in Korea. They even urged clients to pay 500,000 won extra per month as “wife’s rent,” according to the study. “Even though you have completed a contract with a marriage broker, you are most likely to find yourself paying unexpected money for tuition or food,” said Ahn Jae-Sung, a representative to the center for international marriage victims, in an interview with Munhwa Ilbo. “You need to pick up her language and definitely see her in person. I believe it will help you avoid marriage fraud.” By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","south korea causing unlicensed brokers ,international marriage agencies have lost ,marriage brokers to prevent marriage ,licensed international marriage agencies dropped ,number of international marriage frauds","['the Ministry of Justice', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'Statistics Korea', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Korea', 'Statistics Korea', 'Lim Dong - won', 'Wonjin', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Munhwa', 'Hangul', 'Korea', 'Ahn Jae - Sung', 'Munhwa Ilbo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83773208  0.45537654

The majority of such domestic workers were ethnic Koreans from China ― many of whom speak fluent Korean ― according to the report. The research suggested that foreign-born nannies and housekeepers are more satisfied with their jobs than the Korean parents who hire them, and the government should organize training and certification programs for foreigners who wish to work as domestic helpers here. The research institute surveyed a total of 259 Korean parents who have hired a foreign-born babysitter, as well as 256 ethnic Koreans who have worked as babysitters in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province for the report. An ethnic Korean from China earned an average of 1.62 million won ($1,467) a month last year, as a live-in nanny who works five days a week, according to the report. While 1.62 million won is much more than the cost of the government’s all-day child care service ― a maximum of 1.1 million won a month ― it is still cheaper than the cost of hiring a Korean live-in nanny from private agencies, which can cost more than 2 million won a month. While 92 percent of the surveyed ethnic Koreans from China said they were satisfied with their jobs as nannies, only 55 percent of the Korean parents said they were happy with their their babysitters and housekeepers from China.

The measure was put into effect on New Year’s Day, and its impact was immediate and resounding.As of Sunday, corner stores across Korea have started selling individual cigarettes, a trend that all but died out over the past few decades. Since cigarettes cost 300 won a piece and a pack of 20 costs 4,500 won, it is naturally cheaper to buy a packet. But local store owners said more customers were reluctant to buy a whole packet, as they are trying to cut back in the face of the tobacco price hike.A corner store in Sillim-dong, Seoul, is seen Sunday selling individual cigarettes. (Yonhap)Industry sources said that tobacco sales on Jan. 1 nearly halved compared to the same day last year, with local retail giant Lotte Mart reportedly seeing a 49 percent drop in sales. Observers are saying the drastic drop in sales was partly due to hoarding that was rampant ahead of the price hike, but the government projects the drop in sales is likely to continue throughout the year.The Finance Ministry said Koreans are expected to consume 2.8 billion packs of cigarettes for this year, which is 34 percent less than 4.3 billion last year. The government had claimed that raising cigarette prices was part of its effort to lower the country’s smoking rate. Following the parliamentary agreement on tobacco prices, the Health Ministry said last month it was pushing to expand smoke-free zones and anyone caught smoking inside a restaurant would be slapped with a 100,000 won fine. The string of government measures seem to have made it tougher to be a smoker in Korea, claimed government officials. According to the Korea Health Promotion Foundation, the number of people who registered themselves at state-run anti-smoking clinics from September to November was 46 percent higher than during the same period in 2013. Officials there said this was the direct influence of the government’s price hike.According to the Health Ministry, the smoking rate for male adults dropped from 47.1 percent in 2004 to 43.9 percent in 2005 after the government raised the cigarette prices from 2,000 won a pack to 2,500 won. The officials aim to ultimately drop the adult male smoking rate ― which stands at 42.5 percent as of 2013 ― to 29 percent by 2020.To counter this, some smokers are turning to electronic cigarettes, despite the high price and questions over health risks. Online shopping mall G-market said their e-cigarette sales jumped exponentially since the government raised cigarette prices; especially from Dec. 1 to Dec. 22 when sales soared sixteenfold.
