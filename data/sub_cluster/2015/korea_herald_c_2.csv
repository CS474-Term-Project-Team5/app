One of the nation’s leading medical institutes said that the specialized center in southwestern Seoul was part of the EUMC’s efforts to sharpen its competitiveness in organ transplants -- one of its key fields of expertise -- before unveiling its second hospital in Seoul in 2018.Headed by director and surgeon Jung Gu-yong, the Organ Transplantation Center has expanded medical staff specializing in carrying out heart and lung transplants.Jung stressed the need for a “comprehensive” system to manage various organ transplants to accumulate expertise and know-how in the transplant sector. “We plan to focus on expanding our medical services into heart (and) lung transplants based on our know-how in kidney and liver transplants,” Jung said. “It is important to successfully conduct an organ transplant surgery through intensive care. But it is also important to make the surgery successful in the long term by closely checking on the state of patients’ health through immune system modulation and nutritive controls,” he said. “We will make the utmost efforts to provide top quality medical services for patients waiting for organ transplants.”Founded in 1887 by an American missionary as the nation’s first women-only hospital, it has run several specialized centers, including the Cancer Center for Women, known for its contribution to treating breast, ovarian and other cancers affecting women.By Ock Hyun-ju(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","hospital in seoul in 2018 ,organ transplant surgery through intensive ,before unveiling its second hospital ,its second hospital in seoul ,waiting for organ transplants founded","['Ewha Womans University Medical Center', 'the Organ Transplantation Center', 'Seoul', 'the EUMC ’s', 'Seoul', 'Jung Gu - yong', 'the Organ Transplantation Center', 'Jung', 'Jung', 'american', 'the Cancer Center for Women']",6,"[ 1.          2.          2.         ... -0.02476823  0.45037445

Its embassy in Nepal was damaged in the same month following a massive earthquake in the Himalayan country.The ministry said there is a need to increase security as the threat of ISIL and other terrorist organizations is on the rise, requiring additional precautions to be taken.The extra money will go to the hiring of more security guards, armored vehicles for embassy staff and the relocation of the South Korean Embassy in Iraq to the so-called safe Green Zone within Baghdad.  In addition, more money will allow the hiring of 22 new assistants to support counselor services for Korean nationals abroad.The ministry said that 1.3 billion won has been reserved to charter passenger jets in the event that people have to be evacuated from trouble spots quickly, with a further 150 million won to be used to get security-related consulting.

The ministry allocated a total of 532.2 billion won for all of its research and development projects, including research for cancer, chronic diseases and infectious diseases. Next year’s budget for the specific cause is 7.6 billion won more than the budget this year.Among all projects, research for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and chronic diseases will receive 131.1 billion won. Research projects that aim to come up with new medical technologies and businesses will be given 172.3 billion won. For research projects for infectious diseases such as MERS, the ministry set aside 52.5 billion won. The government is also to invest 85.4 billion won in building research-focused hospitals.The Health Ministry and its affiliate the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have received much public criticism this year for their handling of a number of public health disasters, including the MERS outbreak, which had 186 confirmed cases and claimed 38 lives here.The outbreak dramatically affected everyday lives of Koreans and the economy, while the country’s overall health care system and hospital culture were questioned. In October, a total of 55 graduate students at Konkuk University collectively developed pneumonia after working at three laboratories in the College of Animal Bioscience and Technology building. It was later revealed the infected students had been exposed to Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, a bacteria that causes hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an inflammation of the alveoli within the lung triggered by inhaled dust.In September, it was revealed that some 120 infants were exposed to tuberculosis while staying at a postpartum center in Seoul from June 4 to Aug. 18, after one of the nurses had been diagnosed with the disease, but came to work regardless. To better handle infectious diseases in the future, the Health Ministry earlier this year announced that all general hospitals with 300 or more patient beds in Korea would be required to establish negative air pressure rooms to prevent cross-contamination. It also announced plans to hire epidemiologists, who will be the first responders to public health emergencies by investigating disease outbreaks and detecting new microbes.However, the ministry recently revealed that the number of medical professionals who applied for the positions fell short of the number of people needed. The ministry was planning on hiring seven professionals with at least six years of experience as certified physicians as epidemiologists, but less than seven doctors applied for the positions, the ministry said.Critics have pointed out that the particular positions should be regular full-time positions, instead of the current two-year contract posts. And without job security, not many medical professionals would be interested in the positions.Meanwhile, former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo, who was replaced by President Park Geun-hye for his inept handling of the MERS outbreak, has been controversially nominated to be the head of the state-run National Pension Service. Moon, a former economist whose expertise was in pension reform, has been openly against the main opposition party New Politics Alliance for Democracy’s plan to increase the retirement income replacement rate to 50 percent from the previous 40 percent. Public Pension for All, a nongovernmental organization, held a rally in front of the National Pension Service building in Seoul, protesting against the Health Ministry’s decision to nominate Moon as the head of the state-run agency on Monday.

The difference widened slightly from the 20.8 times more tallied in 2013.  In addition, South Korea's economy advanced 3.3 percent in 2014, compared to 1 percent for North Korea.   On other fronts, as of the end of 2014, South Korea had a total population of 50.42 million compared to the North's 24.66 million, according to the data.  South Korea also continued to greatly outperform the communist North in trade.  In 2014, South Korea's overall trade volume came to a little under $1.1 trillion, 144 times larger than North Korea's $7.6 billion.   South Korea's overall energy output capacity reached 93.21 million kilowatts, 13 times larger than the North's 7.25 million kilowatts, while in the area of rice production the South had a two-to-one advantage.

The budget for publishing state-authored textbooks and subsidies for the panel to investigate the 2014 Sewol sinking remained unchanged from the government’s original plan.Jung Eui-hwa (center), chairman of the National Assembly, Saenuri Party floor leader Won Yu-chul (left), and New Politics Alliance for Democracy floor leader Lee Jong-kul partake in a meeting before the regular parliamentary session at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy had wrangled over the government’s budget for state-led child care programs until the later hours in the evening.The rival parties reportedly agreed to earmark some 300 billion won from reserved funds for the child care program known as “Nuri Process” that President Park Geun-hye had promised during her 2012 presidential campaign. The program is estimated to cost over 2 trillion won in total next year to provide free child care service for all children aged 3 to 5.While the NPAD urged the central government to take more, or all, of the financial burdens for the program, Saenuri contended that the provincial education offices should fund the program out of their own pockets, citing the revised relevant laws that place the burden on the respective municipalities.The use of reserved funds instead of directly appropriating a Nuri Process budget is expected to be further opposed by municipalities, which will have to make up for the shortage. The same occurred last year with the government “indirectly” subsidizing the project with some 506.4 billion won from reserved funds. The negotiation of the budget was further complicated by a deal made between the floor leaders of the rival parties late Tuesday night. NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul and his Saenuri counterpart Rep. Won Yu-chul had agreed to vote on five business-related bills along with the budget in return for a compromise on next year’s financial plan.The five legislative acts include bills that would relax regulations on medical and tourism businesses to boost the economy. The medical-related bills aim to give financial support to South Korea’s medical industry, which is looking to enter markets overseas. The NPAD had criticized the bills as an attempt to privatize the medical industry. The tourism bills allow companies to build hotels near elementary, middle and high schools. The opposition party had also criticized the measure, saying it would only benefit giant hotel chains owned by Korea’s family-owned conglomerates. The overnight arrangement, however, was opposed fervently by NPAD Rep. Lee Sang-min, who heads the Assembly’s Legislative and Judiciary Committee. The committee is the last stop before a bill is presented to be voted on at a plenary session.Lee had said the deal overlooked the legal process, as the bills were not yet handed over to his committee for review. The committee typically has up to five days to review each bill.As Lee continued in his opposition, other relevant standing committees were delayed. The NPAD held a general assembly to discuss the plan as Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa prepared to execute his authority and bypass the legislative committee to present them for plenary votes.The floor leaders, meanwhile, agreed to hold extra sessions to discuss other contentious bills, including counterterrorism bills, North Korea’s human rights bill and labor reform bills. They agreed they will complete their negotiations and vote on them by no later than Dec. 9, when the regular parliamentary session ends.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","won 342 billion after days ,wednesday passed next year budget ,trillion won 342 billion after ,386 trillion won 342 billion ,the rival parties late tuesday","['the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Jung Eui - hwa', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Won Yu - chul', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'the National Assembly', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri Party', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri', 'Nuri Process', 'NPAD', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yu - chul', 'South Korea ’s', 'NPAD', 'Korea', 'NPAD', 'Lee Sang - min', 'the Assembly ’s Legislative and Judiciary Committee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'North Korea ’s', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.63343769  0.75100452

The country's annual electricity generation output stood at 517 terawatts placing it 11th, while it ranked 10th in terms of consumption at 482TW. The numbers represent power generated by thermal and nuclear power plants, hydro-electric dams and renewable energy sources.The European Union's combined installed power capacity stood at 9,071GW, with China and the United States ranking second and third with capacitites of 1,505GW and 1,063GW each.South Korea's power capacity and consumption of electricity is roughly on par with its global GDP ranking that stood at 13th last year. On the other hand, the country's reliance on atomic power to meet its energy requirements was high.The country receives 26.8 percent of all power from nuclear reactors, placing it behind France, Armenia and Belgium. France received 48.8 percent of its power from reactors with numbers for Armenia and Belgium standing at 34.3 percent and 30.4 percent, respectively.Other countries like Sweden, Ukraine, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic made the top 10 list.Among the world's top 10 producers of electricity, South Korea's reliance on nuclear power is the highest with the exception of France.In contrast to the country's reliance on nuclear power, it gets only 1.9 percent of its power from renewable sources such as solar, wind and hydro power. This placed it 82nd among the 138 countries checked by the report, and way below 43.1 percent for Denmark, the global leader, and even trailed Japan.

The Seminar on Business Opportunities in Malaysia, held on Nov. 23 to beckon Korean investment, brought high-level government officials and businesspeople from the Southeast Asian country who provided up-to-date information on the country’s economic development and investment opportunities. It was followed by one-on-one meetings for the companies. (From left) Kiswire Limited executive vice president Lee Chang-woo, MIDA CEO Azman Mahmud, Regulatory Reform Committee chairman Ahn Choong-yong, MATRADE CEO Dato Dzulkifli Mahmud and Malaysian Ambassador Rohana Ramli speak at the Seminar on Business Opportunities in Malaysia at Lotte Hotel in Seoul on Nov. 23. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldAccording to the Central Bank of Malaysia, the country’s economy experienced 4.7 percent growth in the third quarter of this year, and is on track to maintain steady expansion on the back of national stability, investment-friendly policies and a zealous workforce. The country has modernized the bulk of its infrastructure, much of it with the capital and know-how of Korean firms, in its bid to enhance physical, institutional and social connectivity with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. With the Association of Southeast Asian Nations set to launch its Economic Community at the end of this year, Malaysia aims to be a gateway to the integrated 600-million-strong consumer market with a $2.4 trillion combined gross domestic product.“Malaysia welcomes investment in export-oriented, high-income industries, such as advanced new technologies, value-added services and knowledge-based, capital-intensive productions, particularly from the small and medium-sized enterprises,” Mahmud said.According to a World Bank report this year, Malaysia was ranked 18th in the world in economic competitiveness and 10th in ease of doing business. Bloomberg rated Malaysia the world’s fifth-most promising emerging market, marking it as the only ASEAN economy included in its top 10 list. The Malaysian government has initiated structural reforms ― its Government Transformation Program and Economic Transformation Program ― to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of its bureaucracy and economy. The Eleventh Malaysia Plan 2016-2020 targets six strategic development goals: building an inclusive and equitable society, improving people’s welfare, enhancing human capital, pursuing sustainable development, constructing nationwide infrastructure and reengineering growth models for wider prosperity. “Malaysia’s multicultural and multilingual population ― with Malays, Chinese, Indians and others ― speaks English well and is friendly toward foreigners,” said Lee Chang-woo, executive vice president of Kiswire Limited, which operates in Johor state, southern Malaysia, next to Singapore.Korea has invested $179 million in Malaysia, largely covering processed and basic metals, lumber and wooden goods, transportation equipment and chemical products. Since establishing diplomatic ties in February 1960, the trade between Malaysia and Korea reached $18.2 billion last year, and it is expected to grow with the ASEAN-Korea free trade agreement going into effect in September 2009 and the AEC soon to be launched. Korea is Malaysia’s seventh-largest trade partner, and Malaysia is Korea’s third-largest investment partner from ASEAN. Continuing the success of Malaysia’s “Look East Policy” ― launched in 1982 to emulate the nation-building experiences of Japan and Korea ― the government of Prime Minister Najib Razak launched the “second wave” of the policy last year to bolster trade and industrial collaboration with Korea, targeting information and communications technology, green technology, health sciences, automotive technology and research and development.To date, major Korean manufacturing firms such as POSCO, Samsung SDI, Q Cells-Hanhwa, Xener Systems, Henikwon, Elpion, Kiswel and Kiswire have carried out 337 projects worth over $4.6 billion, creating more than 49,000 jobs. Major services providers such as Hyundai Engineering, Hanjin Shipping, Woori Bank, Seoul Garden and Hyosung Corporation also operate in Malaysia. The event was organized by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation in partnership with the Malaysian embassy in Korea, and sponsored by the Federation of Korean Industries, Korea International Trade Association, Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Small and Medium Business Corporation, Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency and Korea Federation of SMEs.

The study found that health expenditures kept increasing throughout the period, from an average annual cost of 1.05 million won ($915) in 2008 to 1.48 million won in 2013.  A patient is resting at a medical facility in South Korea. YonhapSuch medical costs accounted for 6.2 percent of annual household income in 2008, and 7.5 percent in 2012.Lee’s study found that the nation’s low-income earners spend more on health care than those with a high income. Those who belonged to the poorest 20 percent spent 1.86 million won for health care in 2012, while those belonged to the wealthiest 20 percent spent 1.28 million won. Medical expenditures accounted for 15.6 percent of the annual income of those who belonged to the poorest 20 percent, while it made up only 4.2 percent for those who belonged to the wealthiest 20 percent. In some severe cases, health care cost accounted for up to 80 percent of a low-income household’s annual income, especially among families whose member suffers from cancer or heart disease.Meanwhile, the proportion of Korean households who spend more than 10 percent of their annual income on health care has been steadily rising, from 13.4 percent in 2008 to 14.6 percent in 2012.Throughout the five years, 29.7 percent of all Korean households spent more than 10 percent of their income on health care at least once. As some 6.8 million Korean baby boomers (those born 1955 to 1963) are entering their 60s this year, the government predicts that medical costs for the elderly will continue to rise as the boomers’ population grows older, thereby doubling the current elderly demographic to more than 7.2 million. Last year, about one-third of total medical costs -- 19.4 trillion won -- was spent to treat the elderly, who already account for 11.9 percent of the total Korean population. The cost increased by 10.4 percent from the year before, mostly due to the increased number of those aged 75 or older who sought medical help for dementia and cerebrovascular diseases, according to government statistics. “Those with chronic conditions and low income are the most vulnerable to limited health care access,” Lee said. According to another study by Yonsei University published last year, Korea’s public expenditure rate for health care steadily dropped from 2009 to 2011, from 56.7 percent to 55.3 percent. The study also pointed out that although almost 97 percent of the Korean population is covered by the National Health Insurance, medical expenditures accounted for 35.2 percent of all household income here in 2011, which was much higher than the OECD average of 19.6 percent in the same year.“High medical expenditure results in not only reduced ability to pay for basic needs, such as food, but also limits a child’s access to education,” the report said. “Furthermore, many households fall into poverty owing to the high medical costs. In a polarizing social structure, the loss of one’s health signifies much more than a simple temporal loss to those whose labor power relies heavily on good health. Illness represents loss of working ability and, at least in a capitalist society, can mean job loss and lead directly to social poverty.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","south korean households increased significantly ,million won in 2013 patient ,spent 28 million won medical ,all korean households spent more ,korean population the cost increased","['south korean', 'Lee Tae - jin', 'Seoul National University', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Yonsei University', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the National Health Insurance', 'OECD', 'Claire Lee']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59359545  0.3373673

Similar reports in South Korea showed that the number of people going abroad to study outpaced those arriving in the country by a factor of 2.5 to 1.   The IMD's 2015 report, on the other hand, showed South Korea's overall ability to train and attract talent standing at 31st place this year, up nine notches compared with 2014.  Among the three main factors checked, the country placed 32nd in both investment-development and appeal, while coming in at 31st place in terms of readiness to attract talent.  Going into details, the IMD gave South Korea relatively high marks in such areas as skilled labor, public spending on education and health-related infrastructure. The country did well in the area of the effective personal income tax rate, which is the percentage of income equal to GDP per capita.  On the down side, South Korea ranked low in such sectors as the cost-of-living index, worker motivation and utilization of the female labor force.  The IMD report, meanwhile, placed Switzerland at the top of the list, unchanged from last year, with Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands making the top five.  The United States came in at 14th, down two from 2014, with Japan's ranking moving up two notches to 26. China ranked 40th, a gain of three vis-a-vis the year before.

Kia Motors has not had such a model for the previous seven years.   In the past, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors mostly saw their compact and smaller models reach that sales mark in Europe, but the latest data indicate that SUV models are taking the baton thanks to the growing popularity of outdoor activity-oriented vehicles.   Sales are expected to accelerate further down the road as Hyundai Motor started to sell the third-generation of the Tucson in Europe last June, while Kia Motors plans to launch the sale of its latest Sportage there early next year, market experts said.

Park holds flowers presented upon her arrival in Manila on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Park’s mention of the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes as her government is testing the waters before deciding to join the Washington-led trade deal. She has already expressed Korea’s interest in joining the TPP during her trip to Washington last month amid widespread criticism of the country’s hesitance to participate in the U.S.-led trade bloc.Park also stressed the importance of sharing the benefits of free trade, urging developing countries and small and medium enterprises to join global value chains -- where the different stages of production are located across numerous countries.“It is important to establish partnerships on technological transfers between advanced and developing countries as well as large and medium-sized companies,” she said.“South Korea has also been supporting developing countries in establishing technological standards and verification processes.”The South Korean leader also urged advanced countries to be cautious in adjusting their monetary policies.“The normalization of monetary policies of advanced countries should be adjusted in a careful and gradual manner by taking into account their impact on the world economy,” Park said.The remarks came amid lingering worries over a potential U.S. Fed rate hike. But her top aide for economic affairs, An Chong-bum, said the issue was not on her mind when she delivered the speech.Park also proposed to build a global financial safety net to stabilize the market during times of difficulties. She asked China to come up with an action plan on her vision by the time the country hosts the annual meeting next year.Before wrapping up the two-day meeting, Park and other world leaders agreed to tackle issues regarding base erosion and profit shifting -- international tax avoidance techniques of high-profile multinationals that weaken a country’s tax base. The move is expected to ensure that the so-called Google tax will be levied against multinationals that try to avoid paying their dues in countries where they make profits.Park also held a separate meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two leaders praised the efforts made for increasing the number of South Korean carriers connecting cities of India and Seoul. Modi has asked South Korean companies to take a larger role in India’s state-led campaign to revitalize its manufacturing industry, Cheong Wa Dae said.Park arrived Tuesday in the Philippines, where she is set to meet leaders of the Asia-Pacific region on Wednesday for a two-day annual forum.Leaders are expected to exchange their views on building inclusive and sustainable economies for the prosperity of the region. But with the forum taking place amid growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing, the central issue of discussions is widely expected to be the territorial disputes over the South China Sea.By Cho Chung-un and news reports (christory@heraldcorp.com)","economy recommend the g20 countries ,expand free trade to fight ,the speech park also proposed ,liberalize multilateral trade through bilateral ,to revitalize the sluggish economy","['Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'G20', 'TPP', 'Korea', 'G20', 'Turkey', 'Manila', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'TPP', 'Washington', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Park', 'U.S. Fed', 'an Chong - bum', 'China', 'indian', 'Narendra Modi', 'south korean', 'India', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'India', 'Park', 'Philippines', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'Cho Chung - un']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.62567341  0.52351415

Overall labor cash earnings, which include overtime and special payments, increased by 0.6 percent and wages adjusted for inflation advanced 0.5 percent.The central bank needs to see higher earnings so Japanese consumers can buy more to help sustain price gains in a nation that has been dogged by two decades of stagnation. Abe is depending on businesses to pour more of their profits into capital spending and salaries as he tries to expand by one-fifth an economy that has recently struggled to grow at all.The government pressure on businesses to raise wages remains strong, contributing to the gains,said Yoshitaka Suda, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. Wages will probably continue to rise as corporate profits are improving and supply- demand conditions in the labor market are tight.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last week that reducing the tax burden for high-earning companies would boost investment and wages. Some members of Japan Council on Fiscal and Economic Policy propose rewarding companies that raise wages or capital expenditure by giving them a tax break, Reuters has reported.One difficulty in all this is that the idea of businesses paying higher wages clashes with another of Abe goals: for companies to deliver better returns on equity.Bank of Japan board member Yutaka Harada has said that 3 percent wage growth is needed for the BOJ to achieve its 2 percent inflation target.The continued gains in the regular wages are good,?said Atsushi Takeda, an economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo. But the growth in wages is low and insufficient to boost consumer spending.Household spending has fallen in seven of the nine months through September this year. The economy contracted by an annualized 1.2 percent in April-June from the first quarter of the year, and economists forecast a drop of 0.3 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30.  --With assistance from Isaac Aquino and Tomoko Sato in Tokyo.

In the 11th Green Climate Fund meeting held in Zambia from Nov. 2 to 5, the climate fund board decided to adopt the Korean proposal on the integrated supply and storage system for renewable energy.Korea’s renewable energy model, with a duration of five years, aims at replacing unsustainable energy with renewable energy in the Peruvian wetlands. The Peruvian energy project, which adopts the Korean energy model, requires an estimated input of about $9.11 million. The GCF will contribute $6.24 million, the Korea International Cooperation Agency $1.8 million and Peru‘s environmental trust fund Profonanpe $1.07 million, the ministry added. The residents of the northwestern Amazon basin region have been generating power with nonrenewable fossil fuels, such as diesel, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Frequent lumbering for obtaining fruits has also caused damages to the forest, ultimately contributing to the climate change. “Korea’s participation in the GCF’s operations is expected to create synergy effects on Korea’s own climate change activities under the creative economy, as well as on the growing renewable energy industries in the developing economies,” a ministry official said. The renewable energy storage system was one of the four GCF energy models proposed at the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit in December of last year, along with the eco-friendly energy town, electric car and smart farm. In the Zambia board meeting, the GCF board chose eight proposals, with funding estimated at about $168 million. Around two-thirds of the money was intended to fund operations to adapt to climate change impacts, and some three-quarters had been requested in the form of grants.The GCF, headquartered in Songdo, Incheon, aims at routing international funds to developing countries to counter climate change.

Line No. 2, which is a loop going around major districts in the city, annually recorded financial gains, as an average of 1.55 million passengers took the subway every day last year. Seoul City said that the free travel for the elderly appears to have contributed to the deficit, as it would have brought in about 288 billion won had the passengers paid, equal to about 68 percent of last year’s 425 billion won deficit. Those aged 65 or older are entitled to take the subway for free. The city forecast the loss in revenue from fare exemptions will exceed 300 billion won this year, with 259 million free rides, about 14 percent of the total, the city said. From January to July, the city has already seen a deficit of over 160 billion won, it added.The increasing elderly population has become one of the major societal tasks faced by the country with mushrooming welfare costs as well as calls to enhance their life quality. The government’s move to raise the legal age of “senior citizens” from the current 65 to 70 has also become a topic of heated debate in connection to various welfare benefits and labor regulations.The share of Korea’s total population who are senior citizens rose to 13.1 percent this year, jumping by 6 percentage points from 2001. The proportion is anticipated to reach nearly 21 percent by 2026, according to the state-run agency Statistics Korea. In order to close the subway deficit, Seoul City has asked the central government financially support half of the expected deficit -- 168 billon won -- this year, citing that the free travel is a national welfare measures pushed by the government. The Transport Ministry, however, reportedly turned down the request, claiming there was no legal framework that mandates the state compensate for losses from city subway operations. In the case of Korea Railroad, the national train service provider, the state supports around 60 percent of the cost of free travel under the railroad industry law. Last year, the government provided 125 billion won, which made up 62 percent of the deficit caused by discount packages for the elderly and other benefit receivers. Fare dodgers have also been adding to the subway’s financial woes.According to Rep. Noh Woong-rae of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, over 190,000 illegal free riders were caught in the past five years, resulting in about 6.5 billion won in penalty fees. If caught, a violator must pay a penalty that is 30 times the regular subway fare.

Once individuals separate the garbage by type -- ranging from paper, plastic and glass to batteries – the recyclable waste is either reborn as raw materials or turned into other resources. To encourage the sorting of waste, the government has run a volume-rate disposable system that adopted the “pay as you go” system for disposing both general garbage and food waste. The Environment Ministry has particularly paid attention to urging industries to shoulder their share of the responsibility by allocating certain recycling quotas to each field. As a result, Seoul has seen a sharp fall in garbage in the last two decades as the household trash per day dropped by 10,000 tons to around 49,000 tons in 2013 compared to 1994, with the majority of it being recycled in some way. To further boost the resource recycling in an aim to become a zero-waste country, Korea is now turning its eyes to the global trend of “upcycling” -- transforming by-products and waste materials into new products.The upcycling trend has been on the rise in recent years in developed countries such as the U.S. and Germany, especially in the fashion sector. The Korean government joined the upcycling move by changing the main principle of its waste policy from recycling to upcycling in its long-term environment plan released in 2011. The new plan was mapped out based on the idea that waste is a useful resource that can be entirely “circulated.” Municipal offices have also been active in supporting the upcycling industry with diverse measures such as by making it easier to collect resources. The upcycling boom can be spotted in the private sector as conglomerates and start-ups consider it a promising business.Fashion conglomerate Kolon Industries launched an upcycling fashion brand Re;Code in 2012, pioneering the upcycling fashion industry in the country. Cheil Industries also opened a fashion store called Heartist House, where upcycled products are made by rising designers are available. Over 60 small social enterprises and start-ups are currently jumping on the upcycling bandwagon, although many still face business challenges due to the low public awareness and the incipient stage of support from the government. The waste is not only a chance for companies to make profits in a green way, but also provide a breakthrough opportunity for artists. Although the upcycled art is not yet considered an official genre, it is increasingly making inroads into the traditional art industry and thereby contributing to improving public awareness.

The Korea Herald brought together four officials from around the world to explore ways to better implement the Sustainable Development Goals set forward early this year by 193 countries at the U.N. They are Erik Solheim, chair of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee; Hideaki Domichi, senior vice president at the Japan International Cooperation Agency; Jeroen Verheul, ambassador-at-large for development cooperation at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Kim Young-mok, president of the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The roundtable took place on the sidelines of the ninth Seoul ODA International Conference hosted by the state aid agency and the Foreign Ministry for a two-day run. Some 600 policymakers, diplomats and experts took part in the event, themed “Inclusive Partnership in the post-2015 Framework.”In line with the theme of the forum, the participants unanimously voiced the significance of collaboration. Without bringing onboard businesses and civil society, the international community would not be able to cater to enormous demands for infrastructure development, realize the 17 goals and 169 targets and thus plug the gap between the rich and developing worlds, they said. The SDGs are a set of targets on international development agreed upon among the governments for international development. The final document was adopted in September and includes goals to end poverty and hunger and improve health and education, all while fighting climate change and making cities more sustainable.While lauding Korea’s stellar ascent from an aid recipient to a rising donor, they also called on the country to step up its contributions both financially and institutionally, such as by linking assistance, private investment and taxes. The following is an excerpt of the discussion. Participants join a roundtable on the margins of an international development aid conference in Seoul on Tuesday. From left: Hideaki Domichi, senior vice president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency; Erik Solheim, chair of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee; Kim Young-mok, president of the Korea International Cooperation Agency; and Jeroen Verheul, ambassador at large for development cooperation at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)The Korea Herald: In shaping the post-2015 development agenda, the role of non-DAC donors was more significant than ever. What is your blueprint for the partnership with these actors?Erik Solheim: When you speak about inclusive partnership, I think there are two dimensions. One is that no nation can do anything on its own. Even the most influential actor, the U.S., cannot solve problems on its own ― we should solve the problems together. Secondly, governments cannot solve the problems on their own. You need to bring in businesses, civil society and the society on the whole so that it is inclusive, with everyone on board, globally. Let me give you one example of a successful partnership where I was personally involved. It was a very successful partnership to conserve rainforests. It was a partnership between the governments of Brazil and Indonesia, which are key rainforest nations, and key global businesses like Unilever and local pharma companies of Indonesia, and big civil society associations like Greenpeace. The companies representing 90 percent of deforestation in Indonesia came together and made a pledge that they would stop their existing practices and make profits from sustainable use of resources of Indonesia. When everyone comes together, you can achieve success. Hideaki Domichi: We expect to see the future where more developing countries will emerge as main players and contribute to world growth. Thereby all the countries will learn from each other the best practices and think together to develop new models of development. But at the same time, we should recognize that we have a huge international gap. Most of the multilateral development banks issued a statement jointly in Addis Ababa that now we should talk about the trillions of dollars of proposals ― public and private, domestic and international, capital and capacity-building. What does this mean? The ODA itself will not be able to cope with all the challenges at least to make it a success. So the key issue here is how to make the ODA sources a catalyst to encourage the participation of the private sector and other stakeholders. KH: In a few generations, Korea has made a remarkable transformation from an ODA recipient to a donor, and now it’s a member of the DAC. What does Korea have to offer to the international development community? Kim Young-mok: Many friends are telling everybody that Korea has already made a kind of miracle, and if it can make a miracle, why not others?So this is one thing we can offer. We do our best in IT sharing, rural development on the Saemaeul model, health care with a universal health system and education among others. Korea’s commitment is a little bit controversial in terms of volume of financial contribution. But in terms of human engagement and people-to-people exchange and working together from the ground up, I think it is a good model because we have quality volunteers and experts who are being welcomed in many countries, along with some interesting Korean cultural wave. Solheim: My encouragement to Korea will be to do more to step up on aid. You’re doing very well on aid, it’s fantastic, but you can do more. You need to provide more money to do more what you are good at. If you go around the world, people know about Korea. Samsung now sells phones around the world. In every European country, you can see people driving Hyundai cars on the street. So you have very strong chain markets and global companies; to link up between aid and these companies is my encouragement for the future. KH: Japan has a long experience as Asia’s traditional donor. Given the role of Korea and China as emerging donors, what do you think the three East Asian countries can do together on development cooperation? Domichi: As Kim said, Korea has something to offer. And we have something to offer. How to combine our resources including knowledge and experiences, this is something we want to push forward. Now the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is in the spotlight today. We also believe that the AIIB has been established to make some contribution to fill the big international gap. We are very much interested in how this organization will work and have global standards. KH: Water management is one of the key areas that the Dutch government is focusing on. What is the Netherlands doing to better manage water and accomplish SDGs in general, and do you have partnership programs with other countries or organizations? Jeroen Verheul: Indeed, access to water and managing water properly is one of the key themes of our policy. It has been for many years, because you have to develop yourself to share with others, and as Eric said, together is a key word. Of course, the Netherlands is a country with a large area below sea level, so climate change is a threat to the Netherlands as a nation. I’m pleased to tell you that we are working together with KOICA to help Indonesia to further develop their strategy to protect Jakarta against water. If nothing happens, in 2020, they will be largely threatened by water, and that is something we want to help them avoid. Kim: As he said, the Netherlands is good at water management, and Korea is a newcomer. … We decided to make a job division and share our experience and technical edge, so that our works do not overlap and can be complimentary. If our job comes off successfully and something can be done to prevent the sinking of land by managing water and preventing the rise of the sea level, it will be very historic and a benchmark in terms of international cooperation. At some point, we would welcome Japan, Britain, Australia and other countries to join and make this project a really good example of international cooperation. Verheul: I think that this kind of cooperation shows that the dividing line between countries and organizations is fading. We talked about traditional donors, emerging, new donors, recipients, etc. But in fact the world economy is moving so fast that you cannot put a black or white label on a country or organization. KH: At the Addis Ababa conference last July, the OECD introduced the concept of total official support for sustainable development to emphasize the partnership between various sources of finance. What’s the significance of TOSSD, and the partnership? Solheim: The main outcome of all this was that we have completely changed the conversation about development finance. We’re working on three legs at the same time ― aid, private investment and tax. There’s no competition between the three, you can use aid to better tax or private investment. The new system is broader than ODA but never to replace ODA. But the main step forward now is to say that if other governments, say Ethiopia or Kenya, need aid in education, for example, you need investment and domestic tax revenues for sure to pay for everything. Domichi: The role of the private sector is key. The real question is how to defuse risks for the private sector. This is crucially important. Now the multilateral development banks including the IMF are addressing the issue. JICA also established a private-sector investment fund. But honestly, we’re still at the stage of proving under what circumstances the public-private partnership will work best. Verheul: He made a valid point in terms of bringing down the risks for the private sector to invest in developing countries. Another part of the story is the business models that the private sector uses. Can those business models be adapted to promote development in countries where they’re working? That’s certainly possible. KH: The refugee crisis that’s unfolding in Europe is posing a great global challenge. What do you think that the DAC and overall international community can do, if anything, to help tackle the situation? Do you see the need for a special fund specifically designed for refugee or similar humanitarian crises around the world? Solheim: The main issue, which is to promote peace in Syria, is beyond what the OECD can do. What we can do is to help develop assistance to be more relevant in the refugee crisis, and support Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which are the three neighboring countries receiving a huge amount of refugees. They deserve assistance. The European Union has already established a special fund for Syrian refugees and discussed how to do this with Turkish leaders, so that’s moving. What we can do is to mobilize more money for this, but we also need to protect development aid because of the strong calls for European governments to use development aid to refugees at home, which they are allowed to do according to rules but will not be beneficial.I’ll also give advice to Korea to look into this because you are very far from Syria but very close to North Korea. When the time of Korean reunification comes, Korea will need enormous help from outside. The amount is so huge that it cannot be funded by Korea alone ― you need China, the U.S. and the entire world when the time comes. Verheul: We all face the dilemma. As Eric points out, the major victim may be development assistance because of its pressure on one hand, the pain for migrant children and refugees who come to those countries which are eligible for the ODA. It’s also strengthening the expenditure for refugees in the region ― the millions of refugees who are kept in the camps there ― the enormous costs that also come from the ODA, and the support for countries like Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, it’s also eligible for the ODA. It’s the diversion of the ODA to crisis and if the ODA remains constant, it has to come from somewhere.

Diplomats, potential investors and policy experts pose at the ASEAN-Korea Partnership for ASEAN Economic Community Building forum at KFI Tower on Thursday. ASEAN-Korea CenterThe ASEAN-Korea Center, in collaboration with the Federation of Korean Industries, held its third annual forum, titled the ASEAN-Korea Partnership for ASEAN Economic Community Building, at KFI Tower on Thursday.Diplomats, potential investors, policy experts and journalists participated in the daylong event, which had presentations on the current situations and challenges in the master plan, financial solutions and individual country projects, followed by one-on-one business meetings. “Connectivity has become a buzzword around the world,” Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said in a speech. “In virtually all regional and interregional forums, such as APEC and ASEM, the debate is on enhancing connectivity.” Physical, financial and informational linkages have accelerated the integration of the 10 member states of ASEAN ― Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam ― whose economies and development levels vary sizably, the vice minister noted.  Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul. ASEAN-Korea CenterPointing to a symposium held in Kuala Lumpur earlier in October, the ASEAN-Korea Center Secretary-General Kim Young-sun underscored that mobilizing the necessary resources and finding commercially viable projects were critical to achieving the intraregional and interregional connectivity. “ASEAN is committed to the goal of an Economic Community this year, and enhanced connectivity is essential for freer movement of people, goods and services,” said Hasnudin Hamzah, the chair of ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee. “Korea is one of our key partners in construction and infrastructure development related to the connectivity. You have been in our region for a long time, and we hope that your interest and involvement would be revitalized and deeper in the new era after the launch of the economic community,” he added.Hamzah pointed to several projects underway and completed, including the ASEAN Highway Network, Kunming-Singapore Rail Link, Neak Loeung Bridge, ASEAN Roll-on/Roll-off Shipping Network, the West Kalimantan-Sarawak Power Interconnection Project, the ASEAN Power Grid and the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipelines. The various projects welcome the participation of Korean construction companies, engineering consultancies, technology advisory groups, suppliers, infrastructure builders, financial institutions and insurance firms, he said. “To make the projects bankable, we are investing in due diligence, feasibility studies, political support and predictable regulatory environment.” Hasnudin Hamzah, the chair of ASEAN Connectivity Coordinating Committee. ASEAN-Korea CenterThe Asia Development Bank estimates that Asia needs $8 trillion until 2020 to fund the infrastructure construction, for which countries would need to spend 5 to 6 percent of their GDPs. The new houses, roads, airports, ports and public transportation planned to be added or repaired are estimated to take up 60 percent of global infrastructure spending by 2025, according to the ADB. Since it was launched in 1967, ASEAN has steadily improved its physical, institutional and social linkages, striving to become a rivaling economic powerhouse to those of China, Japan and Korea. Under the banner “unity in diversity,” people-to-people contacts through tourism, education and cultural exchanges have witnessed large expansions within and across the region, abetted by the globalization of Asian culture and commodity. “ASEAN’s connectivity and launch of its community could greatly enhance connections between Southeast and Northeast Asia,” the vice minister said.“Taking a few steps further, we could even imagine far-reaching connectivity across markets in Europe and Asia through the Eurasia Initiative vigorously pursued by the Korean government.”Cho highlighted that once ASEAN and Korea became part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it would further strengthen economic integration across the Pacific.

ASEAN-Korea CenterSince establishing a dialogue partnership with Korea in 1989, ASEAN has become Korea’s second-largest trade partner, investment destination and construction market, with the bilateral trade reaching $132 billion last year, second only to China.The Korean government, through its official development assistance using the Korea-ASEAN Cooperation Fund and the Korea-Mekong Cooperation Fund, has assisted in various projects aimed at narrowing gaps between the ASEAN states. The Korea International Cooperation Agency has provided support in education, health, institutional governance, rural development, science and technology, and transport and infrastructure. In line with the United Nations’ post 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, the KOICA is developing new strategies to work with ASEAN in these comprehensive areas.Korea has also lent its institutional expertise in rural development through a model of the Saemaul Undong, or New Village Movement, which was presented at the U.N.

It will simplify the procedures for such students to be granted visas to study, get a job and settle down here more easily. Stressing the need to tackle the shortage of labor force, especially in the research and development sectors lacking qualified researchers, the government plans to increase the number of foreign students on the scholarship program from 21,535 in 2014 to 32,646 by 2020. But the government pledged to toughen rules on unskilled workers, selectively allowing them to reside here and inducing them to work here only for a short term. While more than 1.8 million foreign workers live in Korea, most of them are low-skilled workers, with the population continuing to grow, the government pointed out.According to government data released last year, some 825,000 migrant workers are legally working in the country, 71 percent of whom are doing unskilled jobs typically in labor-intensive sectors such as construction, manufacturing and agriculture. Some 208,778 are thought to be residing in the country illegally.Approximately 45 percent of the foreign workers are employed at factories, with 31 percent working at construction sites and 12 percent hired in the service industry under the Employment Permit System. Only 12 percent are white-collar workers.Under the EPS, authorities have allowed unskilled migrants from 15 nations in Central and Southeast Asia to work in Korea for a maximum four years and 11 months.The government plan largely includes measures to avoid granting residency to those “unlikely to integrate into society” and unable to live independently. It will allow only those earning more than a certain amount to live here and demand domestic companies make more efforts to hire local workers before turning to the foreign workforce.The “foreigner management system,” which will be devised by the Justice Ministry by 2017, will set priorities in accepting foreign workers and the number of migrant workers the authorities will accept based on the nation’s birthrate, economic conditions and economically active population. It will take effect in Korea from 2018-2022. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","plan to loosen immigration controls ,pursuing higher education in korea ,government pledged to toughen rules ,term plan to loosen immigration ,loosen immigration controls on highly","['korean', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Employment Permit System', 'EPS', 'Central', 'Korea', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Korea']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.02815989  0.60411632

The company already operates Air Busan based out of Gimhae International Airport in the southeastern part of the country, which serves South Korea's second largest city and South Gyeongsang Province.Asiana set up a formal task force in March after it decided to launch a second affiliate airline and settled on Air Seoul as the name in the following month.Industry sources said Asiana had originally wanted to request a license in May, but this was delayed due to an Asiana plane skidding off the runway in Hiroshima on April 14, and the sharp drop in passenger traffic after the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in late May.Insiders said that opposition from other budget carriers also contributed to the request being forwarded now. The new low-cost carrier is expected to compete fiercely with other no-frills airlines for the popular Japan and Southeast Asia routes.""Details regarding flight schedules will be set up in line with permission given by the transport ministry,"" a company source said.The ministry said business permits are usually given within 25 days of a request being received, while an air operation certificate for domestic routes is released in less than 90 days. ""Once it gets the domestic AOC, Air Busan will have to seek similar permits abroad,"" an official said. ""The local permission will be given, based on the ability of the LCC to operate properly, follow safety rules and improve the convenience of users.""Air Seoul is expected to get its first plane airborne in mid-2016, with its pilots to be borrowed from Asiana initially, before it gradually training its own flight crews.

(Yonhap)In a separate speech later in the afternoon, Park touched on the TPP again, saying South Korea welcomed the landmark deal and praising the trade bloc for potentially stimulating trade liberalization and economic prosperity. “Having already signed trade agreements with 10 of the 12 TPP-member countries, I believe that Korea is a natural partner for the TPP,” Park said in a speech at the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.Her repeated remarks seemed to be sending signals to the U.S. to dispel concerns that Seoul is tilting toward Beijing both economically and politically.Local reports added fuel to criticism against the Korean government, alleging that Washington was disappointed with Seoul for not joining the deal but participating in a Beijing-led regional bank earlier this year.South Korean officials have been trying to curb such concern, pledging that they would strive to join the TPP in any form, after analyzing its impact on the national economy.Earlier this month, trade ministers of the U.S., Japan and 10 other nations reached a landmark deal to form the TPP, after more than seven years of negotiations. The trade deal, if endorsed by the legislature, will break down trade barriers of nations that account for about 40 percent of global gross domestic product.Aside from the TPP, Park also vowed to create a fairer and more transparent market environment to promote U.S. investment to Korea. Listing her efforts in overhauling the nation’s four sectors on the public services, labor, financial and education, Park said Asia’s fourth-largest economy is on the course of massive reform to eradicate abnormal market regulations and practices. She also urged the expansion of the bilateral partnership on creative economy, her vision of integrating technology with creative ideas, stressing that the two countries have sufficient capacity to lead the global economy if they work together.Since arriving Tuesday for a four-day visit, Park has been expressing hopes to expand cooperation with the U.S. in the space industry, particularly on Seoul’s plan to develop a homegrown space rocket by 2020. She also called for close cooperation in research and development and engineering, stressing that Seoul is seeking innovation in manufacturing.By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent (christory@heraldcorp.com)","competitiveness of korean exports president ,washington for luncheon on thursday ,korea welcomed the landmark deal ,of korean exports president park ,korean exports president park","['WASHINGTON', 'Park Geun', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'the Trans - Pacific Partnership', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'EU', 'China', 'TPP', 'the U.S. Chamber of Commerce', 'Washington', 'TPP', 'south korean', 'korean', 'Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'Joe Biden', 'Washington', 'Yonhap)In', 'Park', 'TPP', 'South Korea', 'TPP', 'Korea', 'TPP', 'Park', 'Washington', 'Center for Strategic and', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'korean', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'south korean', 'TPP', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'TPP', 'TPP', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Korea', 'Park', 'Park', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Cho Chung - un', 'Korea Herald']",6,"[ 0.          0.          5.         ... -0.37237969  0.62101716

(Yonhap)The centerpiece of his foreign policy, the rebalance or ""pivot"" to Asia popularized by Hillary Clinton when she served as secretary of state, is intended to devote more diplomatic, security and economic resources and attention to the continent after a decade monopolized by Middle East crises and costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Monday's agreement ""strengthens our strategic relationships with our partners and allies in a region that will be vital to the 21st century,"" Obama said.China notably is not party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which brings together 12 countries representing some 40 percent of the global economy.When he arrived in the White House nearly seven years ago, Obama showed his intent to chart a new course.""As America's first Pacific president, I promise you that this Pacific nation will strengthen and sustain our leadership in this vitally important part of the world,"" Obama said in Tokyo in November 2009 as he kicked off his first tour to Asia.""The future of the United States and Asia is inextricably linked,"" he insisted at the time, as he announced Washington's intent to ""strengthen old alliances and build new partnerships"" in the region.For Douglas Paal, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the trade pact sealed in Atlanta, Georgia provides ""real new energy"" to the rebalancing and boosts ""the narrative for US engagement"" in Asia.In previous decades one could argue that Washington was merely ""continuing its post-World War II military engagement"" in the region, whereas now the United States is strengthening its diplomatic efforts to reach the high water mark of the 1990s, said Paal, a former diplomat.Beijing doesn't make the rules Ten days after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Washington, where tense undercurrents marked his trip, Obama was careful to emphasize the need Monday for a regional counterweight against Beijing.""When more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can't let countries like China write the rules of the global economy,"" Obama stressed.The remark has obvious domestic political reach. The president knows that getting Congress -- controlled by Republicans who are loathe to hand Obama a clear victory -- to back him on the trade deal will not be easy, and he intends to capitalize on the strong anti-Beijing suspicion that prevails on Capitol Hill in order to sway opponents.The Democratic president faces stiff resistance within his own camp from some lawmakers who fear the accord could lead to US job losses. Republicans are traditionally more supportive of free trade, but this year there is disunity on the issue within their caucus.According to a law passed in June, Congress will have the ability to vote up or down on the accord, but not the chance to amend it.The process will take months, and the White House has refused to provide a timeline.For Paal, if TPP is indeed ""a message to Beijing"" that the United States intends to solidify its influential role in Asia, it should not be interpreted as one of exclusion.""If China is successful in bringing its economic reforms to completion -- that's a big hypothetical -- in two, three or maybe five years, they themselves will want to be part of TPP,"" Paal said, adding that China could view it as a powerful growth engine at a time the Asian giant's economy is flagging.The 12 nations that have reached agreement on the TPP after seven years of negotiations are: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.

Launched amid a reconciliatory mood between the rival Koreas, the joint factory park posted $14.9 million in production in its first year of operations in 2005 and its annual output grew to more than $100 million in 2007. The yearly production volume has steadily increased every year to amount to $470 million in 2014, except for 2013 when the two Koreas suspended operations due to inter-Korean tensions.The speedy production growth helped the Kaesong Industrial Complex surpass the $1 billion mark in accumulated output in 2010 and the $2 billion level in 2013.  The production volume for the first half of this year stood at $278 million, and if this pace continues, the joint park could post annual production of more than $500 million for all of 2015 for the first time in its 11-year history.

(Yonhap)The ranking was determined based on the Corporate Travel Index, an annual report released by Business Travel News in the U.S. The average daily travel cost of 100 major cities in the world was $351, down by $17. Seoul’s cost, however, rose by $12. Seoul’s ranking has sharply climbed over the past few years. In 2011, Korea stood at 58th with $332, jumping to 25th with $426 by last year. Of the 100 cities, Caracas in Venezuela topped the ranking with $1,325 this year, followed by London with $576 and Hong Kong with $529. While the rising travel cost drew concerns, Korea has seen a sharp drop in the number of tourists since the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak hit the country in late May. The number of visitors declined by 40 percent in July, and the booking rate for tours also plummeted by over 80 percent in the summer, according to tourism officials. As part of the efforts to draw more tourists, Seoul Metropolitan Government vowed Tuesday to hold a welcome week for foreign visitors in early October, particularly targeting Chinese tourists during China’s National Day holiday. From Oct. 1-10, the city will run various welcoming events in tourist spots such as Myeong-dong, Itaewon and Gangnam. It will open nine temporary tourist information booths in the city to better support the visitors, officials said. The municipality also vowed to compensate tourists on-site if any overcharging cases are confirmed. Over 210,000 Chinese visitors are expected to arrive in Seoul on holiday in October, up about 30 percent year-on, they said. Under the slogan of “The Time is Now,” Seoul City has implemented a wide range of tourism promotion measures over the summer. While injecting 23 billion won ($19.2 million) to the MERS-hit tourism industry, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon flew to China for a “tourism sales trip.”As of August, the number of tourists recovered to about 74 percent compared to the last year, the city said. During Chuseok, a large number of Chinese visitors also traveled to Jejudo Island, one of the most popular sightseeing regions.From Friday to Monday, about 40,000 foreign tourists visited the island, which is nearly equivalent to half the number of total foreign visitors to the island in July, the Jejudo Island tourism authorities said.

In 1960, when related data started to be compiled, the ratio stood at just 2.9 percent.   The agency expects the percentage to further increase to 15.7 percent in 2020, rise to 24.3 percent in 2030, when the country's population is expected to peak, and soar to 40.1 percent in 2060.  There have been growing fears that South Korea is fast becoming an ""aged society,"" in which more than 14 percent of the population is 65 or older. Asia's fourth-largest economy became an ""aging society"" in 2000, when the ratio topped 7 percent, and is likely to be classified as an aged society in 2017 or 2018 at the latest.  Experts worry that the aging population, coupled with the low birthrate, poses a serious threat to the nation's economy as it could lead to fewer working people and increased spending on health and welfare. The country has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states.  According to the data, 5.6 working-age people are supporting the livelihood of one senior citizen this year, down from 5.8 to 1 last year. If the current low birthrate continues, the ratio is expected to fall to 4.5 in 2020, plunge to 2.6 in 2030 and 1.2 in 2060.   The decrease in numbers translates into younger people paying more taxes and other outlays to support senior citizens.   Slightly over 31 percent of the seniors were employed in 2014, with 41.9 percent of the men having jobs. This is a slight gain from 30.9 percent reported in 2013. There are no numbers for this year.  As of this year, 61 percent of people between the ages of 55 and 79 wanted to work, the data showed.  ""A majority of them wanted to work because they needed to supplement their retirement benefits, while quite a few said they sought employment because they liked working,"" the statistical office said.   When picking jobs, senior citizens placed the greatest priority on working hours, followed by wage levels and future job security.  The data also showed that 30.6 percent of the country's basic livelihood security benefit recipients were seniors, with 39.6 percent of them getting some sort of state pension.   The average pension received by people aged between 55 and 79 stood at 490,000 won ($411.8), although about half of all senior pensioners got 100,000-250,000 won per month.

YonhapThe report, in particular, revealed that 69 percent of the expatriates earned less than 2 million won a month, while those who were paid less than 1 million won a month reached 16 percent.Rep. Lee said that the NTS started conducting surveys on foreign workers’ employment type and wage status in 2012 on some 10,000 foreign workers. The analysis of their taxation began last year.“Therefore, the data gathered by the NTS are mostly of those whose employers have made due tax procedures by deducting withholding taxes. It means that the wage level of all foreign workers when including those working illegally would be far lower,” Lee said.Meanwhile, the wage disparity among the foreign workers was large, with the top 1 percentile’s average yearly salary being 475 million won, higher than their Korean counterparts at 261 million won. They accounted for 16.1 percent of all foreign workers’ income, with most of the wage earners being executives at foreign or Korean corporations, the report said.Compared to the lowest 1 percentile of foreign workers, whose average yearly wage was 8.91 million won, the salary gap was 53-fold, the report said.“Considering that foreign workers have acted as a major driving force behind the economic development here, their average wage level is deemed inadequate. ...

In August, the jobless rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 hit 8 percent, much higher than the headline rate of 3.4 percent.  Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the government will make full use of its budget and taxation policies to help create employment opportunities.      ""Creating good, regular jobs for young people is a core policy goal of the government,"" the minister said in a welcoming speech at a youth job fair in Daegu, 302 kilometers southeast of Seoul.  Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic policies, said the society as a whole must do its part to improve employment for young people.   The minister praised a recent landmark deal on the country's labor reform, expressing hope that it could contribute to creating more jobs down the road.  ""More regular jobs can be created only by fundamentally revamping the labor market, setting up a wage peak system and giving more freedom related to the hiring and firing of workers,"" he said.  Last week, labor, management and government representatives reached the agreement that would make it easier to lay off underperforming workers and give companies greater leeway to change the rules of employment.   At present, the country's labor laws effectively restrict the firing of workers unless the company is facing extreme difficulties.   The wage peak system advocated by the government calls for people nearing retirement age to accept lower wages with the money saved by this arrangement to be used to hire new employees.  Choi said the government will do its part to strengthen the social security net so that people who are laid off from work can find employment in other jobs.  The minister, meanwhile, said nowhere is unemployment among young people a key concern more than in Daegu, which does not have head offices of conglomerates or make big-name manufactured goods like autos and ships.  Since 1995, about 20,000 people have been leaving the city every year to find employment elsewhere, he said, stressing that the city and its inhabitants must join forces to create work for young people to tackle the issue.

Given that Park’s annual remuneration stood at 192 million won last year, her monthly contribution could reach about 3.2 million won.Hwang and other members of the Cabinet and public organizations will follow suit and make donations, Hwang said.The move came a day after Park proposed to establish the fund to help create employment opportunities for the young, as she welcomed the landmark labor reform deal reached by the labor, businesses and government.The decision was seen to sooth the opponents who have criticized the government-initiated measures as favoring the businesses in the name of creating job opportunities for the younger population by loosening employment security of the older demographics.“We held a meeting of Cabinet members to discuss ways to create the fund and how to use it as directly proposed by President Park as noblesse oblige,” Hwang said.Members of the ruling Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council including chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung have also decided to join the move that will be further expanded for voluntary participation of all sectors of society.With the collected funds, a foundation will be established within this year to use the money to support job seekers and create jobs in relation to creative economy, he added. The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 8 percent in August, down from 9.4 percent a month earlier and the lowest level since October last year. The slight improvement came as students took part-time jobs during the summer break.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said during a separate event that creating full-time jobs for young people is the main goal of an ongoing push to reform South Korea’s labor market.“What has to be done in the future is more important,” Choi said in a speech at a job fair in the port city of Busan. “The ultimate goal of change is to make it possible for companies to hire young people without worrying about more personnel outlays.”The labor reform agreement could make it easier for companies to dismiss underperforming workers and alter the rules of employment. It also outlines measures to tackle the nonregular workers issue and bolster unemployment benefits and the country’s social security net.According to the government and management, greater labor market flexibility can create more openings for young people, who have been hurt by a drop in the number of regular jobs. The deal, which needs to be approved by lawmakers, also aims to promote the government-initiated wage peak system, which calls for workers nearing retirement age to accept salary cuts with the money saved by this arrangement to be used to hire new employees.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, said the National Assembly should support the agreement by passing related laws, with management and labor taking steps to expand employment and labor market flexibility. For its part, the government will invest resources to strengthen the country’s social security net, he said.The finance minister further said that the government is committed to supporting programs that link school studies with practical skills that can help young people secure jobs.From news reports","donate 20 million won 17 ,to donate 20 million won ,decided to donate 20 million ,donate 20 million won ,park will also give 20","['Park Geun', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Hwang', 'Saenuri Party ’s Supreme Council', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'South Korea ’s', 'Choi', 'Busan', 'Choi', 'the National Assembly']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34058258  0.40229154

Households that belonged to the poorest 20 percent, on the other hand, spent 236,025 won a month.  The Korea Herald file photoThroughout 1998 to 2014, food was the biggest expense for low-earning households in Korea, followed by housing, children’s education and dining or traveling. While they always spent the biggest portion of their income on food during this period, the group has been spending more on housing and less on education since 2010. The lowest-income group of households spent 13.3 percent of their income to educate their children in 2010, but only 11.7 percent last year. The proportion of their income spent on housing, on the other hand, increased from 15.8 percent to 17.1 percent in the same period. Throughout the years, their lowest expenditure went to traveling and dining out. Households in the wealthiest 20 percent, on the other hand, always spent the largest share of their income on their children’s education from 1998 to 2014, followed by dining or traveling, food and housing. The order did not change throughout the years. Last year, they spent the least on housing -- 8.8 percent of their total income -- while spending the largest amount, 15.1 percent, on their children’s education.Education has been regarded as the key to social mobility in Korea, where 80 percent of high school students are estimated to have enrolled in college since 2000. The country is also notorious for its competitive education system. The average Korean high school student studies up to 13 hours a day and sleeps only 5.5 hours a night. Also, the country has the highest reliance on the private education market among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. While 37.2 percent of the funding for educational institutes came from the private sector in Korea last year, 97 percent of education costs in Sweden and Denmark were paid by government.Researcher Park Jong-seo, who wrote the study, said Korean families, especially the low-earning ones, are burdened by the education cost for their children. “I think this is one of the reasons why the fertility rate is low in the country,” he said. “Most Koreans think it’s the parent’s responsibility to make sure his or her child gets the best education possible, which leads to better life and employment opportunities. Now, people feel burdened by this responsibility and choose not to have children at all.”While most Korean children have access to public education regardless of their socioeconomic status, not every child has access to pricy private education that often leads to better grades and other opportunities, he said. This eventually leads to an increasing economic inequality and decreasing social mobility, he said. “We need two things,” Park said. “One is to reform the current education system, which relies too much on the private education sector. The other is to increase welfare benefits to low-earning households so they have better access to more cultural and social resources for their children.”By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","average korean high school student ,private sector in korea last ,the poorest 20 percent on ,korea last year 97 percent ,country he said most koreans","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'korean', 'household', 'Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Korea', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Park', 'Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.793863    1.00848591

The agreement was reached after months of tense negotiations.On Monday, a major umbrella labor group approved the deal. ""Though the deal was reached after many challenges, it falls far short of a reform that can tackle youth jobless problems and create a fair and flexible labor market,"" the lobby groups said in a joint statement. The lobbies, including the Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, singled out a term in the deal where they agreed to clarify necessary procedures ""based on current law and legal precedents"" when revising or terminating employment contracts with workers.Currently, companies can terminate employees' contracts only when they are either involved in a corruption or an embezzlement case. Firms are also permitted to lay off a number of workers should they face serious financial difficulties.""We cannot but express our concerns as (this) will solidify existing inflexibly rather than enhancing the overall flexibility in the labor market,"" they said.""At a time when it turns out that a genuine labor reform has become impossible through the tripartite committee agreement, we will make the last attempt for labor reforms in the areas deemed to be insufficient through a petition with the National Assembly to enact a law,"" they added.

When Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan announced the government’s plan to legislate labor reforms on Friday, the parliamentary audit session for the Labor Ministry was put on hold due to resistance from opposition lawmakers. “The government’s announcement to unilaterally push for legislating the market reforms is an action that ignores the National Assembly,” said Rep.

Kim Dae-hwan, the chairman of the trilateral committee, also offered a mediation draft at Saturday’s meeting to draw a compromise, but the top negotiators from each side failed to bridge their differences. The labor circle allegedly suggested that the trilateral committee discuss agreeable items first, leaving the disputed agendas to be negotiated in a separate forum later. But the government maintained that it should map out “clear” administrative guidelines that stipulate the deregulation of dismissals for underperforming workers and companies’ discretion to change company rules without union approval. The issues have remained focal points in the three-way negotiations, prompting the nation’s largest umbrella union group, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, to walk out of the talks in protest in April.Under the current labor laws, companies cannot fire employees without giving a justifiable reason, allowing them to terminate a contract with employees only when they are involved in either corruption or embezzlement. But such a regulation is too “strict,” which needs to be eased to sharpen companies’ competitiveness and reduce their burden for soaring costs in the face of slowing economy, the government said. Employers also said that the practice of “overly protecting” workers’ employment in the market leads them to avoid recruiting new employees and instead rely on nonregular workers to maintain their competitiveness. The laborers, however, argued that the easing of restrictions would only result in undermining their job security, giving businesses a legal basis to fire workers more easily.  Also high on the agenda has been whether to make it easier for businesses to change employment rules without union content. Currently, employers need a trade union’s agreement when changing company rules. The plan would lay a groundwork for employers to push for changing the employment contracts or salary system even without union approval, which will give a boost to expanding the government-backed peak wage system in the private sector.Under the peak wage system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers reach a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending the retirement age by a few years. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has claimed that the revamp in the overall wage system is vital to generating jobs for the young. But the labor bloc has fiercely opposed the plan, viewing it as a scheme to slash their wages for employers to save on labor costs.  The talks among management, labor and government came in line with President Park Geun-hye’s campaign for labor market reforms, a top priority on her policy agendas in the second half of this year. The government has vowed to implement the reforms within this year, even without laborers’ approval, to inject flexibility in what it has called “rigid” labor market. The increased flexibility in the market is key to spurring the nation’s faltering economy and tackling youth unemployment, the government claimed. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","mediation draft at saturday meeting ,market reforms starting next week ,saturday meeting to draw compromise ,labor market reforms remained grim ,de facto ultimatum last week","['Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'the Labor Ministry', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Young - joo', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Assembly', 'Kim Dae - hwan', 'the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'Park Geun']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50163704  0.10886957

The German term “Energiewende” -- meaning energy transition -- sums up the Teutonic solutions causing tectonic shifts in the direction of sustainable development: dismantling of nuclear power, switching to renewable alternatives and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As proof, Germany on July 25 set a national record of meeting 78 percent of daily electricity demand through renewables, surpassing the previous record of 74 percent in May last year. A combination of political will, strategic policies, free market competition and grassroots activism foster a fertile ground for a green economy, simultaneously strengthening environmentalism and entrepreneurship.Germany embassy’s deputy head of mission Dr. Rolf Schuster (German embassy)“The idea that a switch to renewable energies would raise Germany’s electricity import and bring about ‘blackouts’ has proved to be wrong,” the German embassy’s deputy head of mission Dr. Rolf Schuster told The Korea Herald in early September. “Germany became a net exporter of electricity and the price has continued to fall. Renewable energy also has a strategic aspect of bolstering energy supply security, crucial particularly for countries reliant on import.”According to the diplomat, the decentralized format of renewable energies also ignites free market competition between companies. Germany’s transition has spurred innovation and research leading to significant productivity gains, he noted. Renewable energies of wind, solar, hydro and biomass power generate on average 28 percent of daily electricity in Germany. In the first half of this year, the country exported 25 terawatt-hours, equivalent to around 8 percent of all electricity generated domestically. The renewables last year collectively produced 403 terawatt-hours with a surplus of 34 terawatt-hours in the trade balance with neighboring countries -- the Netherlands, Austria and Poland -- which have then passed on remaining portions to Belgium, the U.K., Switzerland and the Czech Republic. As Germany aims to shut down all of its nuclear power stations by 2022 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, more than 1.5 million renewable power plants have been installed over the last 20 years, and their share in the energy mix is set to double by 2035. In Germany, wind turbines are installed across the gusty northern fields, both offshore and onshore, and solar panels cover the sunny southern regions’ rooftops. Thanks to technological breakthroughs, windmills have become 40 times more powerful over the last 20 years, and coal and gas usage has shrunk by a large margin. “The profit from solar and wind powers, unlike nuclear, gas and coal, is not determined by variable costs, as wind and sun are available free of charge,” Schuster explained. “As technology develops, the cost of investing in these devices will decrease further, as will the average price of electricity.”The wholesale electricity price at base load in Germany has come down to roughly 3 euro cents (3.4 cents) per kilowatt-hour, and is on course to fall continuously, he added. The industry average price per kilowatt-hour is around 8 euro cents, and the household price is around 30 euro cents, comparatively high due to taxes and levies.As households use 25 percent of overall electricity, its relatively high price incentivizes saving energy: Families resort to energy-efficient light bulbs, induction cooking and insulation, and seek renewable solutions such as solar panels on their rooftops.Germany’s renewable transition has also spurred research innovation and industry collaboration benefitting conglomerates as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. As wind and solar powers generate a fluctuating amount of energy depending on weather, smart grids, storage facilities and efficient solutions are constantly improved. Smart grid technology enables transferring electricity produced at the wrong time, place or amount to different locations after it is stored in facilities, thereby balancing demand and supply around the clock. A myriad of software is developed to pinpoint solar and wind forecasting and integrate them into the energy infrastructure. Information and communications technology solutions identify and remove bottlenecks without delay. “Korean companies, which are very strong in all relevant technologies, have vital roles to play by partnering with German firms,” he said. “The technology is there. It’s a matter of implementing and refining.”Samsung SDI, with its innovative energy storage systems, has provided batteries to German renewable power utility companies; Korea’s Hanwha Group bought German photovoltaic solar cell manufacturer Q Cells in 2012, growing it into Europe’s largest solar panel company -- Hanhwa Q Cells.Germany’s “Energiewende” started in the 1970s based on the previous decade’s economic foundations. The German economy that took off in the early 1960s satisfied citizens’ basic needs, allowing them to care about “other dimensions” of the environment, health and well-being, according to Schuster.Germany’s sustainable transition is also tied to European regulations enacted and enforced by the EU commission in Brussels, which are commonly applied across the European market. The 1973 oil crisis, Three Miles Island nuclear meltdown in Pennsylvania in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 have sharpened awareness of the dangers of relying on fossil fuel and nuclear power, leading to the formation of renewable energy institutes and the Green Party throughout the 1970s and ’80s. “The Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan has served as a crude wakeup call to phase out nuclear power,” Schuster said. “Shortly after the disaster in 2011, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government made a clear decision to break with nuclear power.”For the first time in German history, a prime minister from the Green Party -- Winfried Kretschmann -- was elected in an economic power state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Kretschmann visited Korea in May 2013.Since Germany has committed to reduce CO2 emissions, increasing the use of fossil fuels as a substitute of nuclear power was not an option, he stressed, citing safety concerns and high long-term costs. “The only way to phase out nuclear power without substituting the energy need with coal or gas was renewable energy.”As nuclear waste emits toxic radiation for hundreds of thousands of years, storing it completely sealed from leakage into the soil, including the ground water, is critical, the diplomat emphasized. The “considerable cost” of decommissioning nuclear plants and storing wastes must also be taken into account when comparing the cost of different energy sources, he added.

Baek Kun-ki of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the incumbent administration is expected to spend some 13.6 trillion won for defense by the time its term ends in late 2017, whereas the next government would bear more than 24.8 trillion won by 2020.For instance, for a project to adopt four units of Airbus’ in-flight refueling tankers by 2019, the Park government is supposed to fund almost 360 billion won and its successor around 1.8 trillion won, the report claimed. The National Defense Acquisition Program Committee announced the result of the bid in late June, and the France-headquartered company is slated to deliver two planes in 2018 and another two the following year.In another case, the government is set to pay the 376.9 billion won balance by 2018 for Surion initiative ― the country’s first indigenously developed military helicopter built by the Korea Aerospace Industries ― though the delivery will be completed in 2017, the retired four-star Army general said. The mismatch appears to reflect Seoul’s struggle to balance its efforts to modernize weapons systems and boost defense capabilities, and needs to plug budget shortfalls and ensure fiscal soundness. While the Defense Ministry has been pressing ahead with ambitious purchase programs, the average defense budget growth rate stands at just about 3.9 percent under Park. “The next administration will face critical problems maintaining a defense posture unless the incumbent allocates a realistic budget starting next year,” Baek said in a statement, calling for a comprehensive overhaul of the midterm defense plan.

Most of the patients were infected at the hospital’s emergency room, where the 14th confirmed patient, who was considered a “super-spreader,” stayed from May 27-30.In its effort to avoid repeating the same error, the hospital plans to renovate and expand the size of its emergency room by March of next year.  Song Jae-hoon (second from right) speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. (Samsung Medical Center)“Once completed, the facility will be 1.6 times bigger and will have six separate units including ones for cancer patients and those with contagious diseases,” said Song Jae-hoon, director of the hospital. Song also said the hospital will house more than 20 negative air pressure rooms that prevent cross-contamination by next year. Of them, 11 rooms will be installed inside the emergency room, the SMC added.The rooms require using a special ventilation system that produces negative pressure to make sure air flows into the isolation room for infected patients, but does not escape from the room. While the system is normally used to quarantine patients with airborne contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, the hospital did not have any such rooms installed prior to the MERS outbreak.The hospital, which is run by the Samsung Group, also announced its plans to donate 41 billion won to the International Vaccine Institute, an initiative of the U.N. Development Program based in Seoul, to help find a vaccine and cure for the MERS virus over the next five years. The SMC also announced that all patients who arrive at the emergency unit will be treated by specialists, instead of resident doctors or interns. In order to prevent the emergency room from getting overcrowded, the hospital is coming up with a new system where each and every patient can receive their emergency treatment in the first 30 minutes upon their arrival, and either get hospitalized for further treatment or released from the facility within six hours.Korea’s current hospital system, in which family members provide basic care normally carried out by nursing staff in other developed nations, has been largely blamed for the MERS spread, which has claimed 36 lives since May. Many Koreans contracted the disease while caring for or visiting their family members at MERS-affected hospitals including the SMC.To tackle the issue, the hospital announced that every inpatient will now only be allowed to be cared for by a single family member during the hospital stay, and all caretakers must be registered before they arrive at the facilities. Non-registered members will be banned from entering the property, the hospital added.The Health Ministry had refused to share the list of MERS-affected hospitals, including the SMC, for more than two weeks after the index case was confirmed in May. The government had been accused of protecting commercial interests of the hospitals by not sharing the information, rather than keeping the general public safe from the possible infection. After public criticism mounted on the SMC, the heir of the Samsung Group, Lee Jae-yong, made a bow of apology on national television on June 23.

""Recently, Korea, the U.S.and Russia cooperated in a search and rescue operation in extreme conditions for a Korean vessel near the Arctic Ocean. Such cooperation for crisis management will continue to grow in importance.""Outlining South Korea's Arctic policy, Yun said he believes it is possible to seize new opportunities emerging from the Arctic while at the same time coping with the challenges of global warming. Yun emphasized that South Korea is firmly committed to tackling climate change.He also said this week's conference will provide momentum for December's U.N. climate change conference in Paris, and urged leading industrialized nations to put forward their commitments to reducing green house gas emissions.In late June, South Korea offered to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent by 2030 from 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, an amount Seoul says it would reach if it let business run as usual. The ambitious pledge underscores the country's commitment to play a leading role in the fight against climate change.In 2013, South Korea gained permanent observer status at the Arctic Council, a key decision-making group of countries with territory in the resources-rich region, paving the way for the country to have a greater say in how one of the world's last untapped regions should be developed.""Korea is committed to working closely with the Arctic Council in preserving the Arctic's pristine environment and securing its sustainable development,"" Yun said, adding that South Korea is preparing a national report for submission to the council.

Overlooking this problem is no longer an option,” said Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-choon.The criteria for the assessment included academic achievements of students, curriculum, specialization of its majors, student support, employment rate of graduates, and long-term development plans. A total of 32 four-year colleges and universities along with 34 two-year colleges were included in the lower D and E groups, which will be prevented from participating in state-funded research, scholarship and student loan programs. But universities in group D+ ― which scored between 80 and 89 out of 100 ― that are already participating in state-funded program will be able to continue, although they will be banned from applying for additional programs.The ministry’s original plan was to forcibly cut the number of openings for all but group A, and shut down the universities in the lowest group. But as the law that would have given them the legal grounds to pursue such action is still pending at the National Assembly, the ministry said it had no choice but to induce voluntary reform at each university. Six four-year colleges and universities along with seven two-year colleges ended up in the lowest group, E, including Daegu University of Foreign Studies, Luther University, Seonam University, Hanzhong University, Gangwon Provincial College, Gwang Yang Health College, and Daegu Future College.

A 5 percent hike is the same level at which the wage has been increased every year so far.""The most pressing issue of the wage cap has been resolved though there is still a long way to go,"" the official said, asking not to be named. ""But the move is expected to support the stable supply of labor and improve business conditions.""The move is expected to raise the total monthly wage by far more than 5 percent when other compensation is included, according to an official at the group of 124 South Korean firms that are running factories in the park. (Yonhap)The agreement came even as military tension has heightened on the divided peninsula following a land mine explosion blamed on the North in the heavily fortified demilitarized zone.The North has denied any role in the blasts, rejecting Seoul's call for apologizing for the incident that seriously wounded two South Korean soldiers.The joint factory park, opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It has served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean laborers.Seoul has rejected Pyongyang's unilateral move to hike the wage, saying that it breaches a 2004 agreement that calls for the two sides to set wages through consultations.In July, the two sides held talks of the joint committee that operates the complex, the first since June last year, but they failed to reach an agreement.The ministry said that the two Koreas plan to hold a meeting of the committee to discuss how to revise labor guidelines.The government official said that the two sides have agreed to continue to set the wage cap through consultations.""By taking into account the grave situation facing inter-Korean ties, the government plans to take measures to develop the complex,"" the official said.The operation of the complex has been highly swayed by the level of tension on the peninsula.

The gradual opening of the legal sector has come since Korea signed a free trade agreement with the EU in July 2011 and with the U.S. in March 2012.  (The Korea Herald file photo)Foreign law firms were allowed to set up representative offices in Korea immediately after the trade pact took effect, but their roles were limited to providing consulting services on international law as the first step.The second stage, which began two years after the agreements, permitted foreign law firms to split fees with Korean partners.Currently, 25 law firms from the U.S. and the U.K. operate in Korea, with most of them focused on offering consulting services for mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property fair trade, initial public offerings and cross-border litigation for mostly Korean and multinational corporate clients. But the government’s deregulation plan still restricts the foreign law offices from representing clients in Korean courtrooms and handling domestic cases related to inheritance, government affairs and intellectual property, among other fields.On top of that, the foreign law firms that wish to establish a joint operation with Korean counterparts are required to retain at least five lawyers with more than five years of experience and have done business for more than three years. The government has also added a clause banning foreign law firms from owning more than a 49 percent stake in the joint venture “to protect the Korean legal market” from being taken over by foreign legal giants. The Korean Bar Association voiced its concerns over the opening of the legal market, but welcomed the measure to prevent foreign firms from taking control of the joint ventures. “The opening of the market is nothing new anyway,” its spokesperson said. The Korean legal circle remains divided over the impact of the market liberalization, with some expressing concerns over the ever-intensifying competition in the market and others hailing it as a chance to sharpen Korean law firms’ competitiveness.“The entry of foreign firms into the local market will lead to economies of scale, which means it will not be as much a threat to large local firms as expected but will take a toll on small ones,” Kim Sang-kyum, a law professor at Dongguk University, told The Korea Herald. “Big-scale joint ventures between foreign firms and local counterparts will end up monopolizing the best-quality domestic lawyers and big corporate clients in the local market, reducing the room for small and medium-sized local firms to grow.” According to sources in the legal community, South Korea’s legal market is estimated to be worth around 3 trillion won ($2.5 billion), though the official figure is not available. But others in the legal industry said that the opening of the market could be an opportunity for Korea’s small and medium-sized law firms to gain a competitive edge to confront the escalating market competition. “The small and medium-sized law firms have long lagged behind large firms in terms of their consulting skills and influence,” an official from a law firm told The Korea Herald, wishing to remain anonymous. “If the small firms enter a joint venture with foreign giants, they could complement their lack of networks, clout and consulting skills.” He also played down the likelihood of foreign firms dominating the Korean legal market. “The final stage of opening the market will still not allow foreign law firms to fully take domestic cases, meaning that the opening will not drastically change the legal landscape,” he said. But he said the competition would inevitably heat up when more foreign firms make headway into the nation on the back of the eased regulations. Foreign law firms have already solidified their position in offering legal advice to big corporate clients since the trade agreement came into force, occupying an estimated half of the legal consulting market. For large local firms, the years-long gradual opening of the market has prepared them to improve their competitiveness by scaling up their size, hiring more English-speaking lawyers and breaking into the foreign market to forge global networks, according to the legal community. “Big Korean law firms now have the capability to survive independently amid the fierce competition,” said the source, who said that his company had no plans to form a joint operation with foreign firms for the very reason.Lee Won-il, a head lawyer at Barun, one of the nation’s big law firms, also believes that the market liberalization will be a chance to upgrade his company and the local legal market as a whole.“It is premature to expect any outcome for now, but the opening will be a stepping stone for us to face off against global law firms to broaden our clout in the local market,” Lee told The Korea Herald. The foreign firms’ entry into the Korean market also seems to heighten expectations for young local lawyers equipped with overseas experience and English fluency. “The Korean law firms seem saturated, creating fewer jobs for young lawyers,” said Choi Jung-min, who newly became a lawyer earlier this year. ”I expect that more jobs will be generated as foreign firms take root here.”Defying concerns over the impact of the foreign law firms’ entry in the local market, however, the U.S. and British law firms here seemed to remain lukewarm on entering into joint ventures with Korean counterparts. “We don’t have a plan to set up a joint venture in Korea or recruit local lawyers for the time being,” a spokesperson for U.S. law firm Ropes & Gray told The Korea Herald. “We are focusing on consulting clients on the U.S., British and Hong Kong law.”As of last December, eight out of 21 foreign law firms confirmed that they were not considering forming a joint practice with Korean partners, according to a survey. Instead, foreign law firms said they would continue to specialize in their role providing consulting services on foreign laws here, downplaying the idea of being heavily engaged with domestic legal cases.  But behind their hesitancy are “tough restrictions” imposed by the government on scope of their work in the domestic market, local sources said. “When the discussion began over the opening of the Korean legal market years ago, foreign firms had expected that they could hire Korean lawyers as well as represent Korean clients in Korean courtrooms,” a source said. Such expectations were quelled when the government presented a revised bill to impose some limits on their business rights. “The restriction might deter foreign firms from advancing into the market due to low profitability as their activities in Korea will be largely limited,” he speculated. The United States Trade Representatives residing in Korea officially raised a complaint about the restrictions mapped out by the government, saying such heavy restrictions are in violation of the free trade pact. The American Chamber of commerce in Korea also expressed disappointment about what it called “excessive” regulations. The Korean government, however, made it clear that the upcoming plan for the opening of the sector is only “partial,” not completely “final,” hinting at additional measures for further opening in tandem with “changes in the legal market.” The law professor Kim said the partial opening would ultimately lead the market to be completely open for foreign firms in phases, whether local players like it or not. “The size of the Korean legal market itself is small and demand for legal services is limited, so Korean law firms, whether big or small, should more actively eye global expansion and strengthen their competitiveness,” Kim noted.

""Compared to the year before, when trade fell 4.8 percent, this year's drop is more pronounced.""  The think tank based its assessment on data provided by the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the Korea International Trade Association. North Korea's exports of coal to China declined 1.6 percent in dollar terms, with the number for iron ore nosediving 70.3 percent.   Falling exports and a subsequent drop in earnings were probably felt by Pyongyang, which will have to consider other means of generating hard currency.   Compared to 2013, when the North's exports of coal reached its peak, this year's numbers represent a 24.6 percent drop.  ""The contraction is noteworthy because the North actually diversified the places it shipped coal to in China,"" the KDI said.  In regards to iron ore, exports declined, both in terms of volume and prices, with the weakening of China's steel industry directly impacting trade. Exports stood at 600,000 tons, down from 1.11 million tons, with the value standing at $22.96 million.  The KDI said Pyongyang's No. 1 import item from its neighbor was filament yarn, followed by cargo trucks and petroleum products.

""It is designed to help boost the local tourism industry.""South Korea's tourism industry has been hit hard by the MERS outbreak that has made foreign tourists shun South Korea. The disease has claimed 36 lives and sickened 186 people, the largest outbreak outside Saudi Arabia.In 2014, a record 14.2 million foreigners visited South Korea, up from just under 12.2 million a year earlier, but the number has nosedived since the first MERS case was confirmed on May 20. The new tax code, scheduled to be sent to the National Assembly for approval next month, also calls for allowing foreign shoppers to get more duty-free benefits up front when they purchase products instead of getting a refund as they leave the country.""This change aims to reduce the hassle of lining up to get refunds at airports that can enhance the overall shopping experience and attract more visitors,"" Moon said.In line with the government's all-out efforts to create more jobs for young people, more tax benefits will be given to domestic and foreign companies that increase employment, especially among youths.South Korea has been plagued by high youth joblessness as local companies remain reluctant to hire new workers amid a prolonged economic slump.The country's jobless rate for those aged between 15 and 29 reached 10.2 percent at the end of June, up 0.9 percentage point from the previous month, while its overall unemployment rate inched up from 3.8 percent to 3.9 percent.In addition, the revised tax code calls for adopting an individual savings account for all wage earners to support the accumulation of wealth and give more tax breaks to consumers in a bid to spur private consumption.Persistently weak consumer spending has been a major drag on Asia's fourth-largest economy already struggling with slumping exports mainly because of a slowdown in China and other economies.South Korea's exports, one of its major growth engines, came to $46.61 billion in July, down 3.3 percent from a year earlier and marking the seventh consecutive month of decline.Hit by anemic consumption and sagging exports, the South Korean economy grew 0.3 percent in the April-June period from three months earlier, expanding below 1 percent for five quarters running.Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the country may enter a period of low growth unless it acts quickly to revitalize the local economy.""Our economy is currently in a difficult situation due to shocks from the MERS outbreak amid a slump in exports,"" he said in a Seoul meeting of a tax review committee.The minister, who doubles as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, also noted the young people were expected to go through an especially difficult time finding jobs from next year when the maximum retirement age of government and private workers is set to be extended by two years to 60.""The proposed tax code revision seeks to revitalize the local economy while giving hope to our future generation by creating new jobs for the youth,"" he said. ""It also seeks to improve conditions for consumer spending while also providing housing stability to low-income families.""The tax code changes, meanwhile, are expected to allow the government to bring in 1.09 trillion won in more tax revenues annually in the coming years.Under the plan, the government will cut tax breaks for vehicles operated by companies, exclude deductions for credit card purchases made by the rich and streamline the country's value-added tax system.The tax code calls for measures to encourage voluntary corporate restructuring by not slapping capital gains and securities transaction taxes on stocks that are swapped in the reorganization process.

The South Korean firm aims to win approval for its merger plan with Cheil Industries Co., the de facto holding firm of Samsung Group, at the shareholders' meeting slated for July 17.The proposed merger must win approval from shareholders with two-thirds of the voting rights and a third of outstanding shares.The construction and trade arm has secured friendly forces with a combined 19.95 percent stake, including the 5.76 percent interest owned by KCC Corp., which it acquired by purchasing treasury shares from Samsung C&T.;But Samsung C&T; must secure 47 percent support to have the plan pass at the meeting, given that the attendance rate will likely stand at 70 percent for the upcoming meeting, according to market watchers.The plan, however, has been challenged by several investors represented by Elliott Associates, which claims that the merger ratio -- 0.35 Cheil share for 1 C&T; share -- is disadvantageous for Samsung C&T; shareholders. Elliott, led by activist billionaire Paul Singer, has a 7.12 percent stake.The plan can be scrapped if the opposition group obtains more than 23 percent of friendly shares. Ilsung Pharmaceutical, a local drugmaker with a 2.11 percent stake, earlier signaled it will vote against the plan.Market analysts are also on Elliott's side. Corporate advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co., Institutional Shareholder Services, and South Korea's Korea Corporate Governance Service also said in respective reports that the merger undermines the interest of Samsung C&T; shareholders.But a local court said in two separate rulings that the proposed merger is reasonable and legitimate, lending voice to Samsung Group, the leading family-controlled conglomerate of South Korea. Elliott is seeking to appeal the two suits, which ask the court to stop the merger and the KCC from exercising its voting rights in the shareholders' meeting.South Korea's National Pension Service, which holds an 11.21 percent stake in Samsung C&T;, has not yet expressed its stance.

(Yonhap)Under the peak wage system, companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers “peak” at a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending their retirement age by a few years. The peak wage system is in place at 55 percent of the top 15 conglomerates, including Samsung Group, Hyundai Motors, SK Group, LG Group, POSCO, Lotte Group and GS Group, whereas 25 percent of those ranked from No. 16 to No. 30 had adopted the system. Among the companies implementing the system, 37.5 percent of their employees started to receive slashed salaries at age 56, followed by those aged 58 at 29.2 percent, 57 at 16.7 percent and 59 at 12.5 percent. With the system in effect, those who started to receive reduced pay at age 56 saw a 10 percent decrease in their salaries, while those receiving the cut from age 60 saw their salary drop by 40 percent.With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has pushed for expanding the system into the private sector to curb joblessness for the young despite labor unions’ opposition to the scheme. While the unions claimed that the system will only benefit employers by reducing their labor costs, the government decided it will adopt the peak wage system for 316 state-run organizations starting next year. The peak wage system is a part of the government’s extensive campaign for labor market reforms to overhaul what it called the “rigid” labor market to generate more jobs for the young. “There has been progress in companies adopting the peak wage system, but they should pour more efforts into settling it to tackle youth unemployment,” said an official from the ministry. The authorities set out a first batch of reform plans on June 17, which include the expansion of the peak wage system into the private sector by offering subsidies and consulting to firms willing to adopt the system. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","top 15 conglomerates including samsung ,salary drop by 40 percent ,top 30 conglomerates by total ,half of south korea major ,the nation top 30 conglomerates","['South Korea ’s', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'Samsung Group', 'Hyundai Motors', 'SK Group', 'LG Group', 'POSCO', 'Lotte Group', 'GS Group']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61448038  0.55444294

It proposed to invest about 5 trillion won in constructing its new headquarters and other buildings over the next four years. Earlier this month, the auto-making giant proposed building a 115-story headquarters and a 62-story hotel and convention center with the aim of “strengthening the city competitiveness by creating an international exchange complex.” This proposal is in line with the city’s plan to turn the neighborhood into a hub of international “meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions,” or MICE. The company stressed that the new construction would bring a production inducement effect of 262.6 trillion won and create over 1.3 million jobs over the next two decades. It also offered to pay 1.7 trillion won as a public contribution fee if the city changes the legal use of the land site. This accounts for 36.75 percent of the estimated value of the land. In order to carry out the submitted proposal, the official use of the land site needs to be changed from “general residential” to “general commercial.” The Seoul Metropolitan Government and the company will finalize the ratio of the public contribution fee by the end of this year. The carmaker will likely break ground no later than 2017, after all the administrative process is completed, sources said. The construction plan, however, faces hurdles from Gangnam-gu residents. The city government has planned to spend the public contribution fee on developing the neighboring region into the MICE zone. This region includes areas of KEPCO land and Jamsil Sports Complex,The Gangnam-gu Office, however, opposed the city’s move, claiming that the public contribution fee should be used only on the Gangnam-gu district, as it was earned from the KEPCO land.The KEPCO land site is under the Gangnam-gu Office’s authority while Jamsil Sports Complex is under the Songpa-gu Office’s control. Last month, Gangnam-gu Mayor Shin Yeon-hee threatened to file a lawsuit against Seoul City for ignoring the public opinion of the Gangnam residents, if it continued to go ahead with the original plan. Seoul City, however, flatly denied Gangnam-gu’s argument, saying that it will strictly carry out the plan in accordance with the law.

Amid union objections, Ministry of Employment and Labor announced the first set of measures to overhaul what it called the “rigid” labor market to make it more flexible but stable enough to create “good” jobs for young people and curb employment uncertainty among irregular workers.“As the soaring youth unemployment rate and growing wage gap pose a threat to the resilience of the Korean economy, we have all agreed that labor market reform is necessary,” Minister of Employment and Labor Lee Ki-kwon said at the ministerial meeting.The government has pushed for labor market reforms as part of President Park Geun-hye administrations’ campaign, which she called “a survival strategy,” not a “choice.”The devised reform plans include expansion of the controversial peak wage system into the private sector, the adoption of ability-based salary systems and incentives to encourage large companies to improve working conditions for their subcontractors, which are often small and medium-sized enterprises. The focal point has been the peak wage system, under which companies pay senior employees reduced salaries after the workers reach a certain age, generally between 55 and 60, in return for extending their retirement age by a few years. With the official retirement age set to rise by two years to 60 next year, the government has claimed that the revamp in the overall wage system is key to generating jobs for the young people here. Labor unions, however, saw the plan as a scheme that only benefits employers by reducing their costs. The government has already decided to implement the peak wage system for 316 state-run organizations starting next year, with its plans to set specific goals by August. Under the government’s new plan, the authorities will offer subsidies and consulting to some 30 private companies and 550 factories in six key industries including shipping, finance, medicine, and automobiles when they adopt the peak wage system and abolish seniority-based salary systems. On top of that, the government will encourage conglomerates to boost “coexistence” with their sub-contractors by providing them with tax benefits and subsidies when they try to improve working conditions for their suppliers. In Korea, many of conglomerates have been accused of exploiting their suppliers by forcing them to slash production costs and bring forward delivery dates, which often leads to poor working conditions at the supplier firms. While the jobless rate among people between 15 and 29 stood at 9.3 percent as of May, the small and medium-sized companies have been suffering from a lack of staff mainly due to their worsening working conditions. The government’s plan also includes a measure to change irregular workers’ status into permanent positions, starting from the public sector. The Korea Employer’s Federation welcomed the government’s decision, but expressed concerns over some rules that might result in stiffening the labor market. “We are glad that the government is taking the lead in adopting the peak wage system and expanding the ability-based salary system,” the employers’ organization said in a press release shortly after the government’s announcement. “But guidelines allowing companies to change employment regulations without unions’ approval need to be more specific,” it said. The government’s reform plan, however, sparked a protest from the nation’s two largest labor organizations ― the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. “It is nonsense (to say) that we have agreed to the government’s plan for labor market overhaul,” the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said in a press release. “The government is labeling the peak wage system as a key to enhancing a harmony between employees and employers, but it will only end up reducing our salaries,” accusing the government of exploiting inter-generational rivalry. The KCTU also pointed out the government’s approach to improving conditions for sub-contractors is wrong in the first place. “If the government wants to improve conditions for suppliers, it should include a scheme that grants workers at sub-contractors a right to negotiate with their contractors,” the KCTU said. “The government’s plan is no more than a framework to deprive workers of basic rights and help conglomerates at the cost of laborers.”On Wednesday afternoon, the labor union held a rally to protest against the government’s plan at Gwanghwamun Square, with some 1,000 unionized workers in attendance. It declared all-out war against the authorities to stop it from going ahead with the reform plan.Another trade union, the FKTU, also denounced the government for “excessively interfering in the matters that should be discussed between employers and employees.”“Without considering the reality in which workers are forced to retire in their early 50s, the government is pushing to revamp the wage system, which can lead to discrimination by age and forcible early retirement,” the FKTU said in a press release. “The government’s suggestion to ‘improve’ the labor market will only widen the gap between irregular and regular workers, contractors and sub-contractors,” it added. The FKTU also vowed an all-out strike in July and August in opposition to the government’s plan. The trade union opened a ballot on Monday to gauge the support of its members. The government said that it would announce more detailed measures for reform around August and September after discussing sticking points such as the minimum wage and working hours with laborers, management and lawmakers. Earlier in April, the trilateral negotiations to negotiate employment conditions among laborers, employers and lawmakers collapsed, indicating that the government faces a challenge in gaining labor circles’ support.

Among the subjects discussed in the forum was how best to reach the world’s 58 million out-of-school children. These are the children most in need: the poorest, the most vulnerable, the exploited and the abused.  Reaching these children – many of whom are currently beyond the reach of programs, research and budgets – is a challenge. And yet, meeting this challenge will be possible only if we approach the issue head-on. Understandably, financing is central to these discussions. Thankfully, Korean organizations are heeding the call to support education for the world’s most marginalized children. On the sidelines of the World Education Forum, the Korean International Cooperation Agency, the government-funded agency dedicated to granting aid to reduce poverty and improving the quality of life in developing countries, signed a three–year agreement with the Education Above All Foundation. Together, our two organizations have pledged to provide a total of $20,000,000 to support the implementation of education projects around the world, with the aim of accelerating the enrollment and retention of out-of-school children in quality primary education. The financial reasons for achieving universal primary education are clear: every dollar invested in primary education generates $10-$15 in economic returns and one-year increase in the average educational attainment of the population in a developing country can increase annual per capita gross domestic product growth from 2 to 2.5 percent. UNESCO estimates that each additional year of schooling raises a country’s GDP growth by 0.37 percent per annum. However, despite all the incontestable evidence, the funding gap to achieve basic education in low-income countries increased from $16 billion to $26 billion per annum in just three years, according to UNESCO. If we are to reverse this trend and lift a generation of children out of poverty, the global community must commit to accelerating funding to primary education. Appropriate funding and programming that address the barriers inhibiting the enrollment of out-of-school children are two of the key cornerstones to universal primary education which require special efforts. One-size-fit-all solutions as well as administrative overlaps of the way that funding for education is spent can be barriers to education provision. For these reasons it is especially important that innovative approaches are found, and non-governmental organizations such as EAA are at the forefront of testing new methods for funding and implementing education programs. If we are to achieve universal primary education, we must not only maximize our available resources in tailored programs, we must coordinate them in such a way that minimizes administrative and implementation overlap. Korea has demonstrated its leadership in promoting access to universal primary education, as demonstrated by hosting the latest World Education Forum. What is now needed is the participation of the private sector to join in this important effort to close the funding gap.  Children around the globe deserve our commitment and dedication to helping provide them with a better world in which to live.  If we can deliver on this commitment of universal primary education – we can get it right for delivering education to people of all ages.

A report containing the country's voluntary commitments will be submitted to the United Nations before the end of this month.  The government previously said the report will likely be submitted before the end of September as the ongoing U.N. efforts to set up a new international protocol on climate change, known as the Post 2020 Climate Change Mitigation Commitments, require member states to declare their commitments before the end of December.  ""The ongoing international efforts are asking countries to submit their intended nationally determined contributions as soon as possible,"" the ministry said in a press release.  ""Most of the advanced states, including the United States and the European Union, have already submitted their INDCs in March, and so the country decided to submit its own INDC before the end of June as part of efforts to contribute to the international efforts.""  As the level of the country's own mitigation efforts will be set through public debates, the government offered four options to choose from a range from the minimum 14.7 percent to the maximum 31.3 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the country's BAU level by 2030.  Without any measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions or let business run as usual, the country's overall emissions are expected to grow by an annual average of 1.3 percent over the next 15 years to reach 850.6 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (Co2-e) by 2030, according to a joint government report released by the ministry.  The least aggressive option will require the country to cut its overall emissions by 14.7 percent from its BAU level to 726 million tons of Co2-e by 2030. The figure will represent a 5.5 percent growth from its total emissions in 2012.  The most aggressive option of cutting emissions by 31.3 percent will result in the overall emission of 585 million tons of Co2-e by 2030, also marking a 15 percent cut from 2012.  The two other options call for reductions of 19.2 percent and 25.7 percent from the 2030 BAU level, which will translate into a 0-percent and 8.1 percent reduction from the 2012 level, respectively.  The country is allowed to set its own target, but its reduction target may be subject to verification once it is submitted to the United Nations.  It may also become legally binding once the United Nations successfully launches the envisioned international protocol on climate change.

May also marked the sixth consecutive month of increase below the 1 percent mark.  Several provincial government and municipalities said they plan to raise water and sewerage processing rates in the coming weeks and months.   Fares for public buses operated in Gyeonggi Province surrounding Seoul will go up 150 won later this month, with the port city of Incheon, west of Seoul, set to decide whether to mark up both bus and subway fares within the week.  Busan, the country's second-largest city, said it plans to raise fees for public funeral homes, crematoriums, exhibition halls and civic centers.  Besides public utility and transportation charges, there has been a gradual rise in fuel prices. The rise in gasoline and diesel fuel comes as prices for crude oil have started to move up after falling sharply last year.  Weak crude prices have been cited as the leading cause of low inflation in recent months.  According to state-run Korea National Oil Corp., the average price for gasoline has risen for six straight weeks and stood at 1,574.4 won per liter last week, up 66.6 won from the last week of April. Data by Statistics Korea also showed prices for farm and fisheries goods rose 2.7 percent on-year in May. Numbers showed rent-related prices rising a relatively high 2.4 percent vis-a-vis the year before last month.  Prices for medical services also increased last month with prices at neighborhood clinics and drug stores rising 3 percent.  ""With household earnings at a standstill, any rise in the prices of basic necessities can have an adverse effect on private consumption,"" a researcher at Hyundai Research Institute said.  The finance ministry, meanwhile, said that it is keeping close tabs on market prices and will take steps to correct any unnecessary or unfair adjustments that can hurt consumers.

Rosario, who chaired the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation senior officials’ meeting prior to coming to Korea, said she observed inquiry and interest from Korean conglomerates and medium-sized companies.  Philippine Ambassador Raul S. Hernandez (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“The relations between the Philippines and Korea have always been close, as we were brothers in arms against communism since the early 1950s. I grew up around Koreans at American military bases in the Philippines,” Rosario said in a speech. “The Jangchung Gymnasium in central Seoul, which was recently renovated, was built by Filipino workers until 1963. In a happy turnaround of events, many Korean construction companies are undertaking infrastructure projects in the Philippines.”The Philippine department of public works will allow Korean companies to register on equal terms as local companies, she noted, while pointing out to the soon-to-be-integrated ASEAN market by the end of this year. The deputy undersecretary also praised Korea’s cultural diplomacy in the Philippines, which has been so successful that her parliamentarian colleague is learning Korean language and history through soap operas. “The Filipinos are called the people of the diaspora, as we are scattered all over the world. Our families abroad have brought home elements of their local cultures, enriching our own,” she explained. “Multiracial marriages, including between Filipinos and Koreans, have strengthened our ties.”Korean company executives benefit from the country’s new legislation in July last year, which allows full entry of foreign banks into the country, Rosario underscored. Philippine Ambassador Raul S. Hernandez said that Korea is well placed to take advantage of the strategic location and burgeoning market of the Philippines, with 120 flights between the two countries every week. As more than 90 percent of Filipinos are Christian and English is an official language, Koreans easily adjust to life on the island, he said. The Philippine economy grew by 7.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, one of the fastest rates in Southeast Asia. It has registered positive growth for 65 consecutive quarters since 1999.The ambassador highlighted investment opportunities in Central Luzon, which is a “growth corridor” north of the capital Manila. “Manila is fast becoming a competitive mega-city due to its size, young population and productivity,” the ambassador said. “Our government has taken steps to root out corruption and establish good governance. Doing business in the Philippines has become easier, faster, more profitable and sustainable, with improved infrastructures.”Foreign investors can enter priority areas of manufacturing, airport and industrial park development, aviation, tourism, leisure, information communication technology, agricultural and agro-industrial sectors, he added. Kim Young-sun, the newly appointed secretary-general of the ASEAN-Korea Center and former Korean Ambassador to Indonesia, said Korean companies can reap benefits of the Southeast Asian market through local production.“The Philippines have emerged as an attractive destination with investment incentives and skilled labor,” he said, while highlighting the leadership of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III that has helped national stability and market dynamism.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","events many korean construction companies ,20 officials from the philippines ,than 90 percent of filipinos ,may 28 in seoul ,sized companies philippine ambassador","['Philippines', 'ASEAN', 'the Philippine Embassy', 'Seoul', 'ASEAN', 'Philippines', 'Laura del Rosario', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Importers ’ Association', 'korean', 'Rosario', 'the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Philippine', 'Raul S.

(Yonhap)Chung’s political prospects peaked in 2002 as head of the Korea Football Association, when the South Korean team had its dream run to the semifinals in the 2002 World Cup, its best result in the event’s history.Chung announced his bid for the South Korean presidency in September that year, before withdrawing it in favor of Roh Moo-hyun, who would go on to win the race in December 2002. His political name, however, remained valued among South Korean pollsters who consistently floated his name as a possible conservative candidate in the next presidential run.In 2014, Chung ran for Seoul mayor, a post often viewed as a stepping stone to the presidency here. But his defeat to Park, who took 56.1 percent of the votes, dealt a political blow that he has failed to recover from so far, analysts said.“Chung is different from other lawmakers. He’s not your typical politician,” said Yoon Sung-yi, professor at Kyung Hee University.“He’s at the level where he should be seeking maybe a presidential bid. But things aren’t looking hopeful right now. He’s not in the conservative party’s decision-making bodies. He’s not even in the legislature anymore.”Chung Jin-min, professor of politics at Myongji University, agreed.“I don’t think a person of Chung’s status will score high in any future presidential race as of now,” he said, referring to his family background. The billionaire is the son of Hyundai Motors founder Chung Ju-yung. He is also the de facto owner of major conglomerate Hyundai Heavy Industries Group.“The people here can’t relate to him. He comes from a wealthy background that not many know about.”“I’m sure Chung will be able to win if he runs in Ulsan as a lawmaker in the 2016 parliamentary elections,” he added. “But I don’t think too highly of his chances in a presidential race.”Chung, 63, is a respected figure among sports officials here. Chung served as the KFA’s chief from 1993 to 2009 and played a role in bringing the World Cup to South Korea in 2002.

We will take actions against companies that have not followed the government's guidance,"" the spokesman said at a press briefing.In what could be a temporary relief, North Korea accepted South Korea's tentative offer in late May to pay wages at the current level, allowing the two sides to buy time for talks.An official at the ministry said that the government plans to propose talks in the coming days, as the 10-day period of the wage payment for May will begin next Wednesday.The wage row came as inter-Korean relations have been long strained since the North's torpedo attack on a South Korean warship and the shelling of a border island off the west coast in 2010.The joint industrial park, which opened in 2004, is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation following a landmark inter-Korean summit in 2000. It has served as a revenue source for the communist country while South Korea has utilized cheap but skilled North Korean labor.Meanwhile, Lim said that North Korea has not beefed up its control over movements at the industrial park due to concerns over the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that has killed two South Koreans so far.On Wednesday, South Korea confirmed five additional cases of the respiratory disease, raising the total number of those infected with the virus to 30. Last year, the North imposed a travel ban on incoming foreign tourists for about five months due to concerns over the Ebola virus.

This is significantly higher than the 3.9 percent rate for the entire country.""To reduce any fallout, the government is striving to introduce wage peak systems and use the money saved to encourage businesses to hire new people,"" the finance minister said.

The Supreme Court, upholding two previous courts' decisions, ruled in 2012 that the tax agency's levying of the 100 billion transfer income tax is against local tax law and ordered the refund. Challenging the ruling, the tax authorities then levied nearly 100 billion in corporate tax, which again prompted Lone Star to file a lawsuit to cancel the tax.Lone Star claimed that it should be exempted from paying the tax because it was based in Belgium, with which South Korea has a double-taxation avoidance deal.

The program, launched in 2004, is available to people with a stable source of income and less than 1 billion won (US$917,000) in debt.Court data, however, showed that while there were less people applying for rehabilitation, the total number of people requesting help from the Credit Counseling and Recovery Service remained relatively unchanged.

Georg Kell, the founder and CEO of the world’s largest corporate sustainability organization, stressed that businesses are increasingly forced to demonstrate corporate social responsibility by embracing UNGC principles: human rights, labor, environment and opposition to corruption. Kell participated in the UNGC Korea Leaders Summit 2015 in Seoul on Tuesday, along with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs and former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, among others.  Georg Kell (left), the executive director of United Nations Global Compact, speaks to graduate students of Sogang Business School on Monday. Also shown are UNGC’s head of strategic planning Donna Chung (center) and Sogang University professor Kim Yang-min. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The UNGC is an international policy initiative to promote responsible commerce, finance and innovation. It has more than 12,000 corporate participants from over 145 countries. “There’s a silent revolution happening in the world. More and more business leaders realize that financial success depends on environmental stewardship and social responsibility,” Kell told graduate students of Sogang Business School, a UNGC participant since 2013.“Business is no longer a resource extractor, but a stakeholder in society. It wants to be part of the future growth and make long-term investment.” Kell said business nowadays has an incentive to invest in vocational training, fight corruption and improve the environment. In today’s transparent world, “it makes sense to disclose rather than hide.”One fundamental trend since the late 1990s has been the globalization of commerce and localization of government. With unregulated markets leading to environmental degradation and social deprivation, popular protests erupted globally to protect diminishing common goods. Foreign direct investment has also changed dramatically, from accessing cheap resources for reprocessing and remanufacturing, to supporting local development. “The ‘global compact’ was born out of these circumstances, as citizens understood power and responsibility cannot be separated,” said the executive director. “Increased transparency has put a premium on disclosure, because not doing so can increase the risk of a financial disaster.”Kell mentioned the German engineering company Siemens, which overhauled its corporate culture following a string of high-profile scandals in 2008 that cost $1.6 billion in legal settlements with U.S. and European authorities. The company now sees sustainability as its core growth strategy. The sweatshop campaign by American colleges in 2000 contributed to human rights and labor improvement, by protecting freedom of association and collective bargaining, while eliminating forced and child labor, he added. “A growing number of companies are realizing that their green portfolio is growing faster than their carbon-intense portfolio, and supporting carbon pricing,” Kell said. “Smart CEOs are stepping forward and saying, ‘We want to break with our old practice of blocking climate action, to tell governments to tax externalities on business.’”Companies that are willing to “internalize” the negative externalities created by their operation will become the industry leaders, claimed Kell. Many companies that were the target of sustainability have now become exemplary models.The finance industry, which tends to pursue short-term profits, is finally coming to grips with the global trend. Ban Ki-moon has promoted responsible investment since 2005, leading to 1,300 asset owners around the world to incorporate nonfinancial issues into investment decisions. “I am confident that commerce connects humanity. Commerce allows technology and solutions to travel fast and wide,” Kell said. “But to channel it in a sustainable way requires a fundamental rethink. We need to internalize spillovers, put a high price tag on carbon emissions, create a circular economy, and reconsider our values and lifestyles.” Kell stressed the importance of accountable leadership, saying, “Business leaders have to be statesmen. They need to understand the interconnection of politics, development and environment.”Answering Sogang University professor Kim Yang-min’s question on finding a job and building a career for the students, Kell gave advice based on his 30-year experience at the U.N. “The most difficult thing in life is finding out what exactly you want,” he pointed out. “Career success does not come from aiming for this organization or company over another, but finding out what exactly it is that you really want to do, then zooming in on it and giving all you got.” Noting that lifetime employment is diminishing in a post-industrial job market, Kell encouraged students to continually reinvent themselves and make learning their lifelong friend.

It plans to submit its greenhouse gas emission target to the United Nations soon ahead of the launch of a new climate regime after 2020.""Since the government's emission target is in effect impossible to achieve, it needs to be re-calculated,"" the Federation of Korean Industries said in a press release. The FKI, which represents the nation's family-controlled conglomerates, added that it could hurt Korea's trustworthiness in the world if it sets its reduction target for 2020 based on the short-term objective.According to the lobby group, South Korea emitted 14 million tons more than its annual prediction in 2010. In 2011 and 2012, the greenhouse gas emission surpassed annual forecasts by 31 million tons and 20 million tons, respectively.The FKI also pointed out the government move in January last year to lower the ratio of nuclear power plant facilities and the decision to delay a supply plan for renewable energy, saying that they would make it harder to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emission.Emphasizing that other major countries are pushing to ease their emission targets based on their own economic conditions, the FKI called on the Seoul government to propose a more attainable emission objective.""The reason why a debate is under way for a new climate regime after the Kyoto Protocol fell apart is because countries proposed hard-to-achieve reduction targets,"" an FKI official said.

The practice effectively blocked new agencies from being designated as aid donors.The new move will allow private groups with no history of assistance to the North to join the drive to help cope with North Korea's severe food shortage and other challenges.The government said it will continue to comprehensively take into account the qualifications of hopeful donors in a transparent manner.Inter-Korean relations have been strained as the North has not responded to Seoul's offer for dialogue, citing the ongoing joint military exercise between Seoul and Washington.Inter-Korean exchanges have also been suspended since 2010 when Seoul imposed the May 24 Measure that bans economic and cultural exchanges with North Korea as a punishment for the North's torpedoing of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010.New Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo told reporters Friday that Seoul will spur efforts to lead more private groups to provide humanitarian aid to North Korea.Meanwhile, Lim said that Seoul plans to provide necessary support to foreign activists who hope to walk across the heavily fortified inter-Korean border if North Korea approves their plan.About 30 female activists from around the world, including U.S. activist Gloria Steinem and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire from Ireland, plan to march from the North to the South across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that bisects the two Koreas to mark the May 24 International Women's Day for Peace and Disarmament. Crossing the inter-Korean border requires approval from the two Koreas and the United Nations Command.""If the North's nod is confirmed, the Seoul government will offer cooperation on the basis of the truce treaty and precedents,"" Lim said.They said the purpose of the DMZ crossing is to express hope that Korean families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War will be united someday and military tension between the two Koreas can be reduced. They also hope to ultimately end the division and replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement with a permanent peace treaty.Seoul has delivered a letter to an organizer reading that the South Korean government understands the activists' intent, but there should be sufficient considerations to check security, Lim added.

The measures also come as part of the country's efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from its business-as-usual level in 2020.The government plans to spend an additional 137 billion won this year to help create local niche markets for the clean energy industry while public firms and private companies are expected to invest some 1.26 trillion won for the purpose, the ministry said.The measures also call for efforts to increase the number of electric vehicles operated in the country from the current 3,000 to 47,000 by 2017. To this end, the government will build 575 new fast chargers for plug-in vehicles across the country over the next three years.It will also set up a 100 billion won fund to encourage private investment in the related fields by matching private investment.In addition, the government will work to increase the number of energy-sufficient islands to nine from the current one.

It also plans to deploy unmanned reconnaissance aircraft to division-level units and establish a command and control system, which will provide field units with more visual information to help them enhance situational awareness. The plans are part of the five-year mid-term defense plan that the ministry announced Monday.“The mid-term plan is designed to strengthen our key assets to deter an all-out war and limited attack from North Korea,” said a senior ministry official, declining to be named. “With the plan, we will also enhance our self-defense capabilities.”The ministry set aside 232.5 trillion won for building military capabilities for five years from 2016. Of the total, 115.4 trillion won will be spent on managing military forces, while 77.1 trillion won will be used for enhancing defense capabilities.To establish the Kill Chain preemptive strike system, the ministry earmarked 6 trillion won, an increase of 300 billion won from the previous mid-term plan for 2015-19. With the budget increase, the ministry seeks to build a strike system that can cover all of North Korean targets.For the Kill Chain system, the ministry plans to secure a multi-purpose satellite, high-altitude and mid-altitude reconnaissance drones, long-range air-to-surface guided bombs, mid-range air-to-surface precision bombs and other assets.For the establishment of the Korea Air and Missile Defense system, the ministry plans to spend 2.7 trillion won, an increase of 400 billion won from the previous mid-term plan. South Korea has been working on developing the KAMD, a low-tier multiple-interception system, rather than participating in the U.S.-led missile defense program, as China has accused the U.S. MD program of possibly targeting the country. The KAMD consists of Patriot Advanced Capabili-3, M-SAM interceptors and an early warning radar that work together to shoot down short-range North Korean missiles. For the construction of the Kill Chain and KAMD, the ministry increased the initial budget by 700 billion won, as it has determined that Pyongyang has secured considerable technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and put it on long-range ballistic missiles.To strengthen preparedness against North Korean provocations and border defense, the ministry plans to spend 1.8 trillion won. It will increase the number of unmanned aerial vehicles to corps-level units and deploy upgraded radars and fire control systems. The ministry also set aside 12.1 trillion won to secure aerial precision strike capabilities. Seoul plans to purchase F-35A fighter jets, aerial refueling tankers, precision-guided bombs and other assets that would ensure the country’s air capabilities.To strengthen warships’ ability to detect, strike and intercept enemy targets, the ministry plans to spend 11.1 trillion won.

Seoul's contribution will come from its Economic Development Cooperation Fund launched in 1987 and meant to provide low-interest loans to less-developed countries.The MOU reached during Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan's visit to Washington is expected to help the international development organization push forward projects in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.Choi, who doubles as deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs, is in the United States to take part in the G20 ministerial meeting as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings.The latest deal comes as South Korea marked its 60th year as a World Bank member, and can lay the foundation for closer ties down the road, the ministry said.Besides the MOU, Choi and World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim touched on ways to generate funding for the Green Climate Fund which aims to cope with global warming. The GCF is headquartered in Songdo, west of Seoul.Choi and Kim concurred on the need to strengthen cooperation between the World Bank and the United Nations climate fund.In talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, the South Korean policymaker agreed that closer cooperation between the two countries is needed in light of recent global economic developments and mounting uncertainties in the financial sector.""The two men concurred on the importance of the bilateral military alliance and reached an understanding on strengthening economic and financial cooperation,"" the ministry said.Choi also met with Inter-American Development Bank President Luis Alberto Moreno and stressed South Korea's desire to expand ties with Latin American economies.The deputy prime minister, who is IDB's rotating chairman this year, said Asia's fourth-largest economy wants to increase its stake in the newly created NewCo, which is being set up by merging various public corporations under the multinational development bank into a single entity. The corporation will manage development projects and other ventures.Since Seoul joined the IDB long after its creation, its stake in the lender and related organizations, which can determine its standing, has remained very small.The ministry said South Korea wants to use the NewCo as a platform to expand its economic cooperation with Latin America.

The two firms signed an agreement to jointly develop the helicopters last month, officials from the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said.“There have been differences between DAPA and KAI over a number issues including the percentage of indigenous components to produce the helicopters,” a DAPA official said, declining to be named. “But we reconciled them through 20 rounds of marathon talks from last August until last month.” Although DAPA and KAI have reached an agreement over the overall technological development, they have yet to conclude their negotiations over the development costs. Their talks over the costs will be finalized later this month, and the two sides are expected to sign a final agreement for the helicopter project in May, DAPA officials said.The project to develop the military helicopter is led by DAPA, while the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy is in charge of developing the civilian helicopter. The LAH project is estimated to cost 692.6 billion won, while the LCH project will cost around 950 billion won.KAI is to develop the LCH based on Airbus Helicopter’s EC-155B1 platform.

The February gain is the biggest for the month since the BOK started compiling the data in October 2003.  The on-month gain marks a sharp surge from the previous month when household loan growth increased by a relatively small 671 billion won due mainly to seasonal factors.  By sector, banks' household loans increased by 3.4 trillion won on-month to 523.4 trillion won while those by non-banking institutions rose 384.3 billion won to 226.8 trillion won.  Of the total, mortgage loans extended by all financial institutions went up 3.8 trillion won to 465.8 trillion won, its monthly gain nearly tripling from 1.4 trillion won in January.  Loans for other purposes, such as living expenses, stayed unchanged at 284.4 trillion won.  ""It seems that loans for other purposes stayed on par as borrowers tend to refrain from getting loans in the beginning of the year,"" said a BOK official.  Demand for household loans has been trending higher as home buyers cash in on low lending rates that have been sliding lower in tandem with the BOK's three rate cuts, in August, October and March, since the second half of last year.  In October, the amount jumped by a record 7.8 trillion won following the second in a series of three rate cuts that was aimed at bolstering growth.  The data comes two days ahead of the central bank's monthly rate-setting meeting. Nineteen out of the 20 analysts and economists surveyed by Yonhap Infomax, the financial news arm of Yonhap News Agency, projected the BOK to stand pat on the record-low 1.75 percent base rate following a surprise rate cut last month.  Some analysts said growing household debt may block the central bank from further cutting the key rate.  ""High household debt is a factor that will make the BOK wary of aggressive policy loosening,"" said Krystal Tan of Capital Economics, a London-based macroeconomic research firm.

Last year the budget deficit in this field reached 29.5 trillion won, up 8.4 trillion won from the year before.  The official said the country's public sector debt, which encompasses general government debt and the balance of non-financial public corporations, expanded by 93.3 trillion won to 1,211.2 trillion won last year, up from 1,117.9 trillion won in 2013.  Public sector debt is used as an indicator for the fiscal soundness of a country's public sector and can be used to assess fiscal risk management.  The settlement of accounts, to be submitted to the National Assembly in late May, also showed net national assets standing at 543.3 trillion won last year, down 5.1 trillion won from 548.4 trillion won.  Total assets reached 1,754.5 trillion won, with debt hitting 1,211.2 trillion won. This includes 643.6 trillion won in debts that the government must pay pensioners in the long run. Pension-related liabilities surged by 47.3 trillion won last year, while the issuance of Treasurys to make up for fiscal shortfalls stood at 38.4 trillion won.  On the country's fiscal soundness, the ministry said that general government debt and public sector debt were well below numbers for other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  ""Compared to 2007, the country's national debt increased 7 percentage points as of 2014, while the OECD average in the same period reached 25.2 percentage points,"" the official said.  South Korea's healthy fiscal health has been attributed to less money spent on welfare vis-a-vis other member economies, with such low numbers expected to go up down the road in the face of a rapidly aging society.

Foot injuries were the most common type of accident, according to the data.The number of accidents during outdoor excursions, on the other hand, reached 1,958, a 29.3 percent decrease from 2013, partly because schools scaled back field trips following the Sewol incident. “The number of accidents has increased despite the government’s measure to prevent safety accidents. Schools need to pay more systematic attention to address the issue,” Kang said.The rise may also be due to an increase in the number of reported cases to the School Safety and Insurance Foundation, ministry officials were quoted as saying.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","schools saw the most accidents ,sewol ferry sinking last april ,of education 116 527 accidents ,most accidents at 39 101 ,data also shows most accidents","['Korea', 'the Ministry of Education', 'Kang Eun - hee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kang', 'the School Safety and Insurance Foundation', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22546425  0.36796767

One in 7 cars sold in Korea last year were imported, with German brands making up three-quarters. “The Korean market has developed to a great success for German manufacturers. We are here to support our supplier companies by collaborating with Korean partners,” Klaus Braunig, managing director of VDA, told The Korea Herald last Thursday during the motor show, which was held at the Korea International Exhibition Center from April 3-12.“Collaboration between medium-sized firms helps not only the automotive sector, but the entire industry by spurring innovative partnerships.” The German Embassy’s Head of Mission Theodor Schuster (center) speaks beside German Association of Automotive Industry managing director Klaus Braunig (left) and head of press Eckehart Rotter at the Seoul Motor Show 2015 at KINTEX on Thursday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)A noticeable trend in Korea’s import car market is the dominance of premium vehicles, taking up over 70 percent of the market share. A total of 86 percent of all imported German cars to Korea belong in this category. Newly registered cars with diesel engines, known for power and fuel efficiency, also increased from 25 percent in 2012 to 33 percent in 2014. Two-thirds of German cars sold in Korea in 2012 had diesel engines, with the figure rising to 80 percent in 2014. German exports to Korea rose sharply after the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 2011. The growing popularity of premium cars, the preference for diesel engines, successful marketing, low interest rate and the favorable euro-won exchange rate contributed to the sales, explained Braunig. Theodor Schuster, head of mission at the German Embassy, said German manufacturers buy parts worth billions of dollars from Korean suppliers each year, which are not reflected in Korea’s deficit trade balance of 3.6 billion euros with the European Union. “It is important to take note of positive effects that German manufacturers bring to Korea, including creating high-quality jobs for the ‘creative economy.’”VDA head of press Eckehart Rotter said, “The old mentality of buying domestic brands as ‘patriotic consumers’ is waning. Greater opportunities offered by globalization are more and more appreciated by Korean consumers.”German representatives said the “elaborate” certification required on imported motor-vehicle parts, introduced after the conclusion of FTA, should be redressed as it complicates packaging process.

Currently, students are allowed to attend an eight-hour training session at a base near their school instead. Korean men who complete their mandatory military service must serve for an additional eight years as reservists. The mobilized training program includes shooting drills and combat exercises.The reserve forces were established in 1968, but the government has allowed college students to undergo shorter training periods since 1971 to give them more time to study. The move comes as an effort to ensure fair treatment between those who are subject to the training and those who are not. The ministry said it would also consider obligating public servants to join the annual drill.Nearly 700,000 men, including prosecutors, teachers, police officers, firefighters and senior government officials, were exempt from the training as of January, according to the ministry. “The government designated a group of people, like college students, who can enjoy a waiver for mobilized training if their jobs are considered as serving the national interest,” said Na Seng-Yong, an official from the ministry. “However, things have changed. We need to review the system to see whether it is being fairly operated or could maintain military readiness, given the declining number of reservists,” he said.The number of reservists across the country reached 4 million in the 1970s, but dropped to 2.9 million in recent years.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","military training for college students ,college students to undergo shorter ,an eight hour training session ,hour training session at base ,to join the annual drill","['Korea', '“the Defense Ministry', 'korean', 'Na Seng - Yong', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03172854 -0.00755672

On Tuesday, it selected Korea Aerospace Industries, the country's sole aircraft maker, as the preferred bidder.Codenamed KF-X (Korean Fighter Experimental), the project calls for Seoul to develop its own fighter jet of the F-16 class to replace the aging fleet of F-4s and F-5s.Some 120 jets are to be put into service starting around 2025, with the additional production cost estimated at 9.3 trillion won, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration.""It is highly necessary to set up an around 70-member task force involving officials from the DAPA and relevant ministries, air force officers, and experts from home and abroad,"" a senior DAPA official said, requesting anonymity, stressing the need for a massive budget and transfer of cutting-edge technology.

KAI joined the project in partnership with the U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin, as the DAPA required bidders to have foreign technical assistance.While the procurement agency is optimistic about securing ""most of the key technologies,"" concerns have grown over whether the U.S.will provide South Korea with sensitive and sophisticated technologies, partly because the aircraft will be developed jointly with Indonesia.In September last year, South Korea signed an agreement with the U.S. to receive key fighter technologies from 17 sectors in return for buying 40 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters.

The Fair Trade Commission said one conglomerate has been newly added to the watchlist, with three others being taken off.""Of the three companies that were removed, Incheon International Airport Corp. only had one affiliate making it ineligible for the business group designation, with Corning Precision Materials Korea and Korea District Heating Corp. being taken off because their corporate assets fell below the minimum mark,"" the FTC said.The minimum mark stands at 5 trillion won ($4.51 billion), with Corning and the KDHC standing at 4.1 trillion won and 4.8 trillion won, respectively.In contrast, Jungheung Construction Co. made the cut because its assets rose from 3.8 trillion won to 5.6 trillion won last year.The total number of privately owned groups on the list remained at 49, with public corporations dipping to 12 from 14.The antitrust watchdog then said under the updated list, the number of affiliates of the 61 groups subject to restrictions rose to 1,696, up 19 from a year ago.SK had the most affiliates, with 82 companies under its umbrella, followed by 80 for Lotte, 79 for GS, 73 for Daesung and 67 for Samsung, South Korea's largest family-run business group, known in South Korea as chaebol.The FTC said that while the number of affiliates did grow on-year, the total has been falling, as a whole, after peaking at 1,831 in 2012. ""The largest conglomerates have cut back on affiliate numbers with most of the gains in recent years coming from small to mid-size business groups,"" it said.The latest data then showed the aggregate value of the 61 groups stood at 2,258.4 trillion won, an increase of 52.6 trillion won from the previous year.Samsung accounted for 20.1 trillion won of the gains over the year, with Hyundai Motor Group increasing its assets by 13.2 trillion won.The average debt ratio of the business groups stood at 101.1 percent, down 2.6 percentage points from a year ago, with Hyundai Group's numbers falling the most.The FTC said that assets of big conglomerates have been increasing steadily while the debt ratio has been falling for the last five years.In term of sales, the combined numbers fell 30.5 trillion won over the last year to 1,505.1 trillion won, with net earnings also down 5.7 trillion won to 42.1 trillion won.The drops come after many South Korean companies struggled to generate sales and turn profits in 2014 and so far this year.""Sales have been rising steadily, but they did start contracting after 2013, while net earnings have been falling steadily after 2011,"" the FTC said.The regulator said that by updating the watch list every year, it can keep better tabs on large conglomerates that could distort the free market through internal financial arrangements and loan guarantees.

From groundwater purification to wastewater treatment and academic research to town renewals, water challenges are embodied in Danish life and business.Denmark’s water sector has 300 companies employing 17,000 people and generating $5.2 billion annually. Nonprofit organizations such as State of Green promote Danish green technologies internationally. “The point of departure came in 2011 when a sudden downpour caused damage to Copenhagen costing in the billions (of dollars),” said urban renewal project manager Rene Sommer Lindsay. “The event transformed the city’s political climate, ironically being ‘the best disaster ever’ in arousing consciousness about climate adaptation.”In Copenhagen’s neighborhood of Sankt Kjelds Kvarter, town renewal combines citizen participation and city government assistance. Creative design solutions ― rain gardens, green roofs, water towers, walkways and bike paths ― were incorporated into landscape architecture.Using detailed hydrological maps, 300 projects costing $1.5 billion were also launched, increasing roads, pipelines, retention areas and green spaces to deal with cloudbursts and floods. Wastewater is a valuable resource in Denmark, a country known for energy efficiency. Rather than relying on the city’s centralized system, wastewater is treated locally across rural villages and small-town production facilities. In Denmark’s second-largest city of Aarhus, a wastewater plant functions as a power plant.“The Marselisborg Wastewater Treatment Plant is Denmark’s leading bio-refinery generating excess electricity and heat,” operations manager Flemming Husum said while introducing the plant’s outdoor purification tanks.“We use the newest sludge tanks made by Danfoss Power Electronics for fine bubble aeration. It reduces energy consumption and creates a surplus 3,000 kilowatts of ‘green electricity’ per day.”Grundfos engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares (right) speaks to reporters at the Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen, where wastewater is treated directly on the hospital premises. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)The phosphorous in the wastewater is used as fertilizer, while the biogas is used to heat water that is pumped to municipal companies for a fee, along with 40 percent of the electricity generated.The Aarhus Water company covers all aspects of the city’s water services: supply, pipeline logistics, storm water management and wastewater treatment. After nitrogen, phosphorous and other organic matters are removed, the purified water is released into streams, he explained. In the small town of Kolt-Hasselager southwest of Aarhus, new residential and industrial buildings have sprouted up in recent years, increasing demand for water. Several new waterworks were built using cutting edge valves made by water equipment company AVK Group.“We remove iron, manganese, ammonium, nitrites and nitrates from water and use automatic sand filters to prevent bacterial growth,” operations manager Allan Jensen said. “Protecting waterworks from burglary and vandalism are our top priorities, and we use video surveillance, safety checks and alarms.”Currently, 15,000 townspeople drink water supplied by AVK, and about 100 attend annual meetings for budget and planning. Denmark has decided to stop hospitals releasing pharmaceutical waste into local watercourses. Recognizing conventional wastewater treatment cannot remove the materials, one company developed a decentralized solution. The Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen uses a $7 million Grundfos Biobooster, which treats wastewater directly on the premises with only five hours of weekly maintenance. Engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares said the Biobooster treated 90 percent of chemical components, filtering out 99 percent of each one. “Our practice will set a benchmark for European Union and other countries,” he added.At the end of the 15-day process, a charcoal-like waste is created and incinerated. The bacteria-free water is discharged into surrounding watercourses.At the Technical University of Denmark in the city of Kongens Lyngby, north of Copenhagen, researchers are investigating sustainable ways of managing urban water cycles. “We are not only ‘forecasting’ climate change, but ‘nowcasting’ its impact using real-time monitoring,” said professor Barth Smets, head of international research relations. “We combine education, innovation and consultancy in our research agenda to create value for society.” Hwang Yu-hoon, a postdoctoral fellow in DTU’s environmental engineering department, has researched purifying contaminated groundwater using nanoparticles. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. “The school enables total concentration on research with its horizontal atmosphere,” Hwang said. “Open discussions encourage students to lead initiatives.”Another asset is flexible and family-centered work hours allowing early departure for picking up children from child care centers and telecommuting. In contrast to American engineering schools, which focus on developing new technologies, DTU optimizes solutions for existing technologies, according to Hwang. “We provide solutions wanted by the industries and collaborate with them. Students gain valuable experience.”Studying in Denmark is convenient for Korean students, he said, as most Danes speak English. “But if you don’t speak Danish, making close friends with locals might be difficult.” By Joel Lee, Korea Herald correspondent (joel@heraldcorp.com)","copenhagen while fighting climate change ,generating billion annually nonprofit organizations ,denmark leading bio refinery generating ,fighting climate change is political ,copenhagen uses million grundfos biobooster","['America', 'Denmark', 'danish', 'Denmark', 'State', 'danish', 'Copenhagen', 'Rene Sommer', 'Lindsay', 'Copenhagen', 'Sankt Kjelds Kvarter', 'Denmark', 'Denmark', 'Aarhus', 'Denmark', 'Flemming Husum', 'Danfoss Power Electronics', 'Jose Antonio Gil linare', 'the Herlev Hospital', 'Copenhagen', 'Joel Lee', 'Aarhus Water', 'Kolt', 'Aarhus', 'AVK Group', 'Allan Jensen', 'AVK', 'Denmark', 'the Herlev Hospital', 'Copenhagen', 'Grundfos Biobooster', 'Engineer Jose', 'Antonio Gil linare', 'Biobooster', 'European Union', 'the Technical University of Denmark', 'Kongens Lyngby', 'Copenhagen', 'Barth Smets', 'Hwang Yu - hoon', 'DTU ’s', 'the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology', 'Hwang', 'american', 'DTU', 'Denmark', 'korean', 'Danes', 'Danish', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea Herald']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70537156  0.41866824

Minimum wage talks linked to labor market reforms need to be concluded in April.The heart of labor market reform is overhauling the so-called dual market, which refers to the gap between full-time regular employees, who enjoy job security, and non-regular workers, whose employment is tenuous and who are usually paid less.Despite the lack of time, the Economic and Social Development Commission in charge of drawing up the reform plans is deadlocked on many key issues. Both the government and management want to create a flexible labor market to make it easier to hire and fire people, while narrowing the difference among workers in job security, welfare benefits and wages. Observers say that even with an agreement by the tripartite government-labor-management committee, there is no guarantee that companies and workers will follow guidelines.Ryoo Jae-woo, an economics professor at Seoul's Kookmin University, said the ESDC may not represent all interested parties, making it hard for real consensus to be reached.But an agreement can clarify a lot of uncertainties in the labor market, he said.""A meaningful compromise could potentially help employment and investment,"" Ryoo said. But others, such as Park Su-keun, a labor law professor at Hanyang University, are skeptical about the way the government was approaching labor reforms.""The tripartite commission is doing its best, yet they have not really worked out the finer details,"" the scholar argued. He called for a slow and steady approach to build consensus, stressing that the deadline is not important.The government is reworking the government employee pension plan, which has taken flak for giving too much to civil servants at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. ""There has been some progress made between the ruling and opposition parties that may allow an agreement to be reached,"" said a finance ministry source, who declined to be identified.The government is also pushing companies to raise their minimum wages in 2016, hoping that more income would fuel consumption and help reduce debt burden.Employers say that raising their minimum wages will eat into their already thin profits.These three reform measures are important, policymakers say, because they can lay the foundation for changes in the financial and education sectors. The financial sector has taken criticism for being too slow to meet market demand and provide necessary funds, while South Korea's education system has been accused of churning out people that do not have the skills required by companies.Policymakers are also calling for the passage of laws by the parliament over the next couple of weeks to breathe new life into the service sector, tourism and corporate funding, and enable better oversight over financial institutions and subcontracting rules.Government officials fear that without timely action, South Korea's economy could fall into hard times.The Bank of Korea has hinted it may adjust down this year's growth target, which is set at 3.4 percent. The predictions made by the central bank and think tanks are lower than the 3.8 percent target set by the finance ministry, which in recent weeks has started to acknowledge that growth so far is not up to earlier expectations.Policymakers repeat that while the economy is recovering, the pace is slow and inconsistent, with industrial production, consumption, investment and exports all failing to meet prior projections.  There is wide consensus that first-quarter growth will be in the zero percent range, marking the sixth quarter in a row that numbers have stayed under 1 percent.Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan has said on numerous occasions that the next few weeks are absolutely critical, with headway needed to be made on reforms within the month, so tangible gains can be made afterward.He said he wants to create ""effective demand"" in the domestic market that can vitalize the economy, and the way to do this is by reaching consensus on the three reforms.

An agenda item for a shareholders meeting slated for Friday would raise the number of its directors' performance shares from 50,000 to 70,000, which would result in larger bonuses for its executives.Performance shares refer to a stock compensation system in which shares of company stock are given to managers or members of the board of directors if certain corporate performance targets, such as earnings, are met.Hana Financial's move came just a year after it had lowered the ceiling to 50,000 shares after critics pointed out that the salaries of the chief executives of financial institutions were out of line with their performance of their companies.Hana Financial Chairman Kim Jung-tai had received 2.64 billion won in salary in 2013, including an additional 39,580 performance shares worth 1.74 billion won. He returned 30 percent of his salary after fierce criticism and revised down the number of his performance shares.But the group is trying to have the figure return to the original level this year, as the financial sector seems to be outside of social monitoring amid a deepening economic slump.""We are preparing for an imminent merger between Hana Bank and the Foreign Exchange Bank,"" said a Hana Financial official, requesting anonymity.Hana Financial is pushing to integrate its two commercial bank affiliates, but its attempt has been stalled due to strong protests by the KEB's labor union.Market watchers said that financial companies are only focusing on lining the pockets of their managers although the banking industry has failed to improve its profitability in recent years.Local banks posted a combined 6.2 trillion won in net profit in 2014, compared with 15 trillion won in 2007, while insurance firms saw their profit jump to 5.6 trillion won from 3.8 trillion won over the cited period.The South Korean financial groups are highly dependent on their flagship banks in terms of net income and assets. For example, Shinhan Bank is responsible for 64 percent of its holding company's net profit, while Hana Bank accounts for 91 percent of the group's total income. Instead, they laid off hundreds of workers in a bid to reduce labor costs, with Shinhan Bank having 310 employees retire earlier this year.""Raising the salary ceiling is a wage hike,"" said Jeong Seon-seob from Chaebul.com, a Seoul-based market research firm.""They give a salary increase to managers despite a drop in profit and downsizing efforts.""

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“St. Patrick’s Day is a focal point for our government to reach out to the Irish diaspora across the globe,” Howlin told The Korea Herald at the Irish Embassy in Seoul on March 19. “The holiday has also become a platform to present Ireland as a robust trading partner to governments and companies worldwide.” Educational exchanges between Ireland and Korea remain robust, he said. Each year about 2,500 Koreans go to Ireland to learn English, and there are exchange programs and partnerships between Korea University and University College Dublin. Active collaboration across universities, research centers and companies in Ireland gives students employment opportunities and increases their international employability, he added. Howlin said that as a small island in Europe, Ireland has had to rely on the innovation and entrepreneurship of its people, much like Korea.“The so-called ‘Celtic Tiger’ economic model of Ireland has changed dramatically since 2010, from dire straits to the fastest growing economy in Europe,” he said. The unemployment rate in Ireland dropped from 15 to 10 percent between 2011 and this year, and is expected to go down to 5 percent by 2018, according to the minister. Howlin, who took office in March 2011, explained how his ministry branched off from the finance ministry with the aim of cutting spending and boosting efficiency.“Ireland experienced a significant economic shock in 2010 as a consequence of the 2008 global financial crisis,” Howlin said. “As the shock reverberated around the world, the exposure had a profound impact on our financial system, which depended heavily on construction loans and property values.”The financial turmoil led to the collapse of the government and a new coalition of the Fine Gael Party and Labor Party took over. After scrambling to find a way out of the crisis, the two parties agreed to implement major reforms across the public administration. “We realized we needed a reform minister who can control expenditure,” Howlin said. “So our government split the finance ministry into the department of macroeconomic planning and taxation, and the department of public expenditure and reform.” “In essence, we agreed to revamp our bureaucracy to rebuild people’s confidence in the capacity of the state, and serve their interests more effectively,” he added. The minister underlined two major “waves of reforms” initiated by his government ― reducing expenditure and improving service. “We trimmed down our public servants by 10 percent, and reduced pay and pension by 20 percent,” he said. “We also made people work longer by bringing in significant flexibilities, including shared services in payroll and procurement agencies.”The second wave of reforms targeted improving the quality of public service through online delivery and increased transparency. Particularly on the e-government side, Howlin said the Irish government is “catching up” with Korea, widely regarded as the most advanced in the world. The reforms were carried out without fierce opposition by the highly unionized civil servants, he said. “Like a good employer, I opened the book to the unions and explained to them exactly what the financial situation in Ireland was ― that we must cut down expenditure.” Howlin pointed out, “Since public servants themselves depended on education, health, law enforcement and so on, they agreed to the reform plan after six months of negotiation and voting.” The workers also accepted pay cuts, which was a “big request” to them, Howlin said. “It was quite amazing. Most people in Ireland and even in government were skeptical whether we could negotiate such an option, but we did in the end.” Alongside these structural reforms, his government also undertook legislative reforms targeting accountability and performance of officials, freedom of information, register of lobbying and protection of whistleblowers.Thanks to these efforts, trade and investment with Korea, which plunged during the crisis, have recovered to prerecession levels: bilateral trade is one-quarter of a billion euros a year and is balanced.The minister said information communication technology, financial technology, finance, pharmaceutical, medical and nanotechnology sectors have potential for joint venture and research.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","the irish economy remarkable recovery ,fastest growing economy in europe ,irish economy remarkable recovery ,reform visited korea last week ,irish economy remarkable recovery from","['irish', 'the European Union', 'Brendan Howlin', 'Irish', 'Korea', 'the St. Patrick ’s Day', 'irish', 'Korea University', 'Irish', 'Brendan Howlin', 'irish', 'Korea Aingeal', 'Seoul', 'Joel Lee', 'the Korea Herald)“St', 'Patrick ’s Day', 'irish', 'Howlin', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Irish Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Ireland', 'Ireland', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'Ireland', 'Korea University and University College Dublin', 'Ireland', 'Howlin', 'Ireland', 'Korea', 'Ireland', 'Ireland', 'Howlin', 'the Fine Gael Party', 'Labor Party', 'Howlin', 'Howlin', 'irish', 'Korea', 'Ireland', 'Howlin', 'Howlin', 'Ireland', 'Korea', 'Joel Lee']",17,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.64207608  0.57025754

The minor collision involved a Lamborghini Gallardo, which is priced at over 400 million won on the local market, and Renault Samsung’s large sedan SM7.In the accident, the SM7, driven by a welding technician at a local shipyard, rear-ended the parked Lamborghini. The resulting damage was estimated to cost 140 million won to repair.“The accounts of the drivers of the Lamborghini and the SM7 did not match, and when a former detective and insurance staff looked into the incident, it was revealed that the accident was staged,” an official with Dongbu Insurance Co., SM7 owner’s insurance provider, told the local media.The insurance official also said the two drivers have admitted to staging the accident, and that the company is considering filing charges against them.The police, however, can investigate insurance fraud cases without complaints being filed, and the Geoje police plans to launch an investigation.Despite the authorities’ efforts to clamp down on the related irregularities, insurance fraud has been on the rise in Korea, coming in at more than 500 billion won in 2013. The figure stood at 453.3 billion won in 2012 and at 423.6 billion won in 2011.

Some of the deals have been cited as bad decisions.According to Chaebul.com, a website that tracks activities of large conglomerates, POSCO spent over 7 trillion won in 11 cases of stake investments and M&As; during the five-year period. One of them is Daewoo International that cost the steelmaker 3.4 trillion won for a 60.3 percent stake. Market analysts say the price was about 1 trillion won higher than the stake's face value. Daewoo International has since been a headache for POSCO due to its relatively low profitability. Incumbent chairman Kwon Oh-joon reportedly considered selling the stakes, but the company's circumstances has recently rebounded on successful development of gas fields in Myanmar.Another company under scrutiny is POSCO M-Tech, an affiliate that deals in various metal products and materials development. The company suffered from what has been described as the failed takeover of firms ailing in profitability. The takeover took its toll on POSCO M-Tech, which has logged losses since 2013. During Chung's five-year term, POSCO's operating profit ratio plunged from 17 percent to 5 percent, while its debt ballooned from 9 trillion won to 14 trillion won. Some suspect that Chung's business decisions were motivated to pander to the government's push for the so-called energy diplomacy, a key policy agenda of the then-President Lee Myung-bak to secure natural resources from around the world.""Those M&As; seem to be in line with the stepped-up government-led energy diplomacy. Decisions have been made business-wise, but many of those takeovers appear to have been based on political considerations,"" Kim Yong-jin, an economics professor of Seogang University, told Yonhap.""POSCO should have focused more on its core business, which is steelmaking, not on such resources projects.""But there are reasons why POSCO heeds to politics.Previously state-owned, the steelmaker was privatized in 2000.Appointments of the conglomerate's chairmen are still understood as heavily influenced by the government. The change of management has more to do with the inauguration of new administrations than company business or the term of CEOs. Often, the heads of POSCO were jailed after stepping down on various corruption charges.Experts blame POSCO's business environment as having led to the current prosecution investigation, as well as the group's gloomy financial conditions.They said that the checkered company history will not be fundamentally resolved unless the environment changes.Chung took charge of POSCO with the support of close aides to the then-President Lee in 2009. Many assumed that he would not be free from government pressure in managing the conglomerate. His second-term was cut short after the current Park Geun-hye government was inaugurated in February 2013.On the bright side, the market does not see the ongoing investigation as seriously hurting POSCO's business plans for the future, although there would be some stains on the company's image. ""It could hurt its global image by giving an impression that the company has some kind of connections with politics. Some short-term investors might shun POSCO shares on worries that it could face penalties as a result of the investigation,"" said Jeon Seung-hun, an analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities Co.""But given that POSCO is not seeking to increase its business size but restructure itself, the investigation could rather serve as a impetus that could accelerate the pace of the reform drive.""Last month, POSCO told investors that it will reduce investment and seek to sell assets deemed unnecessary to its core business this year as part of restructuring efforts. POSCO Chairman Kwon Oh-joon said that the company will strengthen its financial soundness by securing some 1 trillion won this year through planned corporate restructuring, such as affiliate sales.

It rose 6.5 percent in the following year before stopping at a 0.6 percent increase in 2013.  For 2015, government officials expect the size of the industry will top 20 trillion won, mainly from a rise in demand for lotteries and casinos.  Sales of various lottery tickets and sports betting exceeded 3.28 trillion won each, up 1.4 percent and 6.5 percent, from the year before.  Revenue earned by Kangwon Land, the only local casino open to Korean nationals, jumped 10 percent on-year to 1.4 trillion won in 2014, while that at foreigners-only casinos increased 0.3 percent to 1.36 trillion won. The modest gain by foreigners' casinos comes after China started enforcing anti-corruption-related rules.   In contract, horse race betting contracted 0.7 percent to 7.64 trillion won, with sales for cycling and boat races all falling for the third straight year.

Beijing unveiled plans for the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank in October 2013, aiming to shore up the region’s development by financing projects in such sectors as energy, transportation, telecommunication and agriculture. Its establishment was officially announced last October with a 21-country membership and will likely wrap up by the end of this year. While acknowledging the need for more funding for revamping regional infrastructure, Seoul officials have been lukewarm on participation since China offered last year to bring the country on board as a founding member, due chiefly to the bank’s relatively obscure governance structure. Washington also opposes the program, which it sees as a challenge to the regional financial order. Adding to the quandary, the U.K. made a surprise announcement on Thursday to join the AIIB, inviting rare criticism from its longtime ally. It will be the first major Western economy to do so.“We believe any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards of the World Bank and the regional development banks,” said U.S. National Security Council spokesman Patrick Ventrell. “Based on many discussions, we have concerns about whether the AIIB will meet these high standards, particularly related to governance, and environmental and social safeguards.”Australia, which initially appeared skeptical about China’s proposal, also hinted at its possible participation following London. “Quite obviously China has improved the governance structure it is proposing for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,” Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey said in Sydney on Friday. New Zealand already applied for its own membership early this year. Other participants include India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Vietnam.South Korea will need to make a decision in the coming weeks as China has apparently set the deadline for the end of March. The issue is likely to be on the agenda for talks on Monday with Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Kyung-soo and Beijing’s visiting Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao. Washington is expected to convey its own transparency concerns regarding the AIIB during a planned visit to Seoul by Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel that begins Tuesday. Some experts have criticized Seoul’s approach, saying it should have more actively weighed the pros and cons in line with its national interests rather than waiting to see how the the U.S.-China rivalry would develop. In the wake of the U.K. decision, South Korea’s leverage would inevitably be undercut and China’s say would grow in future negotiations, they point out.“It is extraordinary that the U.K. would join the AIIB without preconditions at a time when Australia and South Korea are engaged in delicate diplomacy with Beijing on their engagement with the bank,” wrote Thomas Wright, director of the project on international order and strategy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “It puts Asian democracies on the back foot and helps Beijing in these negotiations. It sends a message that China can set the rules unilaterally and Britain will follow.” Yet he also blamed the U.S. for its “confused and contradictory” approach to the AIIB, calling Washington to move beyond obstructionism and figure out a better strategy for dealing with Beijing’s competitive economic diplomacy. “This includes working constructively to shape institutions of Chinese origin and figuring out which institutions really endanger a stable regional order in East Asia,” Wright added.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","during planned visit to seoul ,bank in october 2013 aiming ,opposition beijing unveiled plans for ,for revamping regional infrastructure seoul ,vietnam south korea will need","['South Korea ’s', 'China', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Beijing', 'the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Washington', 'U.K.', 'AIIB', 'western', 'the World Bank', 'U.S. National Security Council', 'Patrick Ventrell', 'AIIB', 'China', 'London', 'China', 'the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Treasurer Joe Hockey', 'Sydney', 'New Zealand', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'Singapore', 'Malaysia', 'Uzbekistan', 'Pakistan', 'Vietnam', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Lee Kyung - soo', 'Beijing', 'Liu Jianchao', 'Washington', 'Seoul', 'State', 'East Asian', 'Daniel Russel', 'Seoul', 'U.K.', 'South Korea ’s', 'China', 'U.K.', 'AIIB', 'Australia', 'South Korea', 'Beijing', 'Thomas Wright', 'the Brookings Institution', 'Washington', 'asian', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Britain', 'U.S.', 'AIIB', 'Washington', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Wright', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.78734601  0.36772186

According to the Korea Labor Institute, the net replacement rate of the Korean elderly reached 45.2 percent as of 2011, about 10 percent lower than the average rate of countries in the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development. The net replacement rate is to the level of the post-retirement pension income compared to personal income before retirement. A number of international labor-related organizations have recommended that countries keep the net replacement rate at around 70 to 80 percent to ensure elderly welfare. Among the 34 OECD countries, only four countries had lower rates than Korea: Japan, New Zealand, Ireland and the U.K. Elderly men sit on steps at Tapgol Park in Jongno district, Seoul. (Bloomberg)Korea had the highest elderly poverty rate in the OECD. The proportion of Korean over-65s in poverty was 48.6 percent, double the figure of Switzerland, which was second on the list. Israel and Chile followed next, with 20.6 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively. The report also estimated that 74 percent of elderly Koreans who were in poverty lived alone. As of 2014, Korea had some 6.4 million senior citizens, accounting for 15.1 percent of the population. This is 3.8 percent higher than that of 2012, the institute said.Of these, only about 31 percent or some 2 million were employed, the institute added. At the same time, the increasing growth rate of the elderly population was at the fastest pace with 4.1 percent, along with Germany and the U.S. Japan, Germany and Italy have older populations than Korea with over 20 percent over the age of 65, while Mexico, Turkey and Chile had less than 10 percent, the report added. “When the baby boomers retire soon, the elderly poverty problem will be much more noticeable amid the record-high elderly poverty rate with relatively low pension income,” said a KLI researcher. “A change in the Korean labor market is needed in order to accept those elderly employees.” By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","highest elderly poverty rate in ,korean over 65s in poverty ,poverty was 48 percent double ,the highest elderly poverty rate ,the highest elderly poverty","['South Korea', 'the Korea Labor Institute', 'korean', 'the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development', 'OECD', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'New Zealand', 'Ireland', 'the U.K.', 'Jongno district', 'Seoul', 'OECD', 'korean', 'Switzerland', 'Israel', 'Chile', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Germany', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Korea', 'Mexico', 'Turkey', 'Chile', 'KLI', 'korean', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",0,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.52648246  0.40388802

This accounts for 47.3 percent of the total direct investment in the capital. While direct investment from China remained about the same at $63 million as in 2013, detour investment via Singapore and Hong Kong played a major role in the surge, officials said. High anticipation over the free trade agreement between the two countries also contributed to the hike, they added.However, there was a decline in investment from other regions, partly due to overseas economic problems, the report said.Direct investment from European countries plummeted to 1.3 billion, down 53.7 percent from 2013. Investment from the U.S. also fell to 1.6 billion won, dropping 8.3 percent on-year. As a result, the overall foreign direct investment in the capital fell to about $5.5 billion, showing a 10.7 percent decrease, the report said.A total of 59 countries made investments in Seoul, with an average of $6.5 million, it said. Among them, the U.S. was the largest contributor with about $955 million, followed by Singapore and Japan, with $951 million and $714 million, respectively.By industry type, 84 percent of the foreign investors flocked to the service sector, which includes the finance, insurance and distribution markets. The rest invested in manufacturing, the city said. While the overall investment in the service sector declined by about 20 percent to $4.5 billion, the financial injection in the manufacturing business sharply grew by about 144 percent to $877 million, it added.

Such households have to rely on borrowing to make ends meet, which can lead to considerable social and financial risks down the line.  A drop in the number of such households would generally be viewed as positive, but watchers say if this is due to less spending, it would adversely affect economic growth. It also means a deterioration of living standards broadly reflects the aging of the country's population. An older population generally spends less and saves more than younger people.  Last year, South Korea's household disposable income rose 3.5 percent, exceeding the 2.8 percent growth in spending.  ""In effect, people spent less even though they made more money, which can be a sign that they have little confidence in the economy and want to save up to deal with uncertainties,"" a researcher at a local think tank said.  In particular, among the lowest 20 percent of income earners, the ratio of deficit households stood at 46.5 percent. This is still way above the average but represents a sharp 5.2 percentage point improvement from the year before.  Figures showed disposable income for such households rose 7.4 percent last year but spending was down 0.1 percent.  The deficit rate for the second-lowest income-earning households reached 26.1 percent for a 0.6 percentage point improvement. This too is the lowest deficit ratio for the income bracket.  For families in the second-highest income level, the deficit ratio edged down 0.5 percentage point to 12.6 percent, the lowest reached since 12.5 percent in 2005.  On the other hand, the ratio of deficit households for middle income families moved up 2.6 percentage points to 17.1 percent. For the top 20 percent income group, the ratio rose 1.1 percentage points to 7.6 percent.

The country's key policy rate currently stands at a record low of 2 percent.   The Korea Housing Finance Corp. will issue mortgage-backed securities to fund the new loans.  The size and soundness of household borrowing has come under serious question as the amount has ballooned while the country's economy has yet to show definitive signs of picking up. A fourth-quarter tally from the Bank of Korea released on Thursday said household credit, which includes credit purchases and loans from financial institutions, marked its sharpest quarterly gain since the central bank started keeping data in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Outstanding household loans reached 1,029.3 trillion won at the end of December, spiking 27.6 trillion won from the previous quarter and accounting for most of the quarterly increase in household credit. The figure passed the 1,000 trillion won mark for the first time in the third quarter last year.  Of total family loans extended by banks, mortgage-backed loans accounted for 70 percent as of end-December.    The pace of gains in household credit has sped up since August, when the government eased rules on mortgage loans to stimulate the sagging property market. The central bank chipped in by lowering its policy rate twice in the second half of the year.  The prevalent view of policymakers is that while the loans are high in numbers, they have not yet hit a dangerous level.  Experts, however, say they have and that stopgap measures would not solve the problem.  ""The authorities acknowledge that household debt is risky and is a time bomb for the South Korean economy,"" Park Chang-kyun, a professor at Chung-ang University, said. ""But it's just a political metaphor to say that household debt can be controlled.""  ""The government has lifted loan-related regulations and induced people to get more loans beyond their ability to repay. It should have taken actions first to prevent excessive credit,"" said Yeom Myung-bae, professor at Chungnam National University. ""It's more urgent to come up with effective measures to force borrowers to repay the debts.""     The FSC said that the new loan schemes are aimed at changing the structure of mortgage loans and placing the household debts under control.  ""We are supporting households to deal with a possible rate hike in the future at home and abroad, and build an environment for them to pay off debts in the end,"" the FSC said.  Most of the home-backed bank loans are non-amortized loans, requiring debtors to pay back the lump sum principal upon maturity. Such loans are heavily susceptible to changing interest rates.  Earlier, FSC Chairman Shin Je-yoon said restructuring of household debt is a top priority for financial stability in 2015, and he will do his best to improve the quality of household debts.

The figure marks a 52 percent plunge from the record high of 136.4 kg posted in 1970.  South Korea has also liberalized its rice market with tarrification at the beginning of the year, though imports under tarrification are currently subject to a tariff of 513 percent.  The 513 percent tariff rate still requires verification by the World Trade Organization while the country is required to import 408,700 tons of rice each year under a special arrangement with the WTO known as the minimum market access.  All 408,700 tons of imports under MMA are only subject to a tariff rate of 5 percent, keeping their prices significantly lower than those of locally produced crops.  ""Locally produced rice may appear to have little competitiveness in terms of price, especially in the global market, but its quality finds little competition anywhere in the world,"" said Kang Hye-young, head of the ministry's export promotion division.  In 2014, South Korea exported 1,992 tons of rice, worth $4.72 million, to 45 countries throughout the world. The amount marks a 13.6 percent on-year spike from 1,754 tons in 2013.  The country also shipped about $59.5 million worth of rice products, such as rice cake, last year, up 14 percent from a year earlier, according to the ministry.

Since the government began to implement the CO2 cap system in mid-January, 17 companies have filed administrative lawsuits against the Ministry of Environment, demanding to be relieved of their obligations.In addition, a group of firms from the petrochemicals industry reportedly plans to file a class action suit over the government policy. The ministry selected 525 firms as the initial target of the cap. Their aggregate quota is set at 1.598 billion tons over the next three years, and involves 84 firms in the petrochemicals sector.According to market insiders, the Korean Petrochemical Industry Association is fine-tuning the class action lawsuit with its members, including LG Chem, Lotte Chemical and Hanwha Chemical.The Environment Ministry, which has the dual task of placating local businesses and pushing for coordination with the international community, is set to take stern countermeasures against the industry backlash.Environment Minister Yoon Seong-kyu was quoted by a news provider as saying that “the business sector has no choice but to bolster its fundamentals if it seeks to put up with global pressure.”Yoon has made it clear that the government would not acknowledge the petitions as they “go against the global standards,” according to the media interview.Petrochemical companies are expressing discontent over the “buy and sell” scheme for CO2 emissions rights, which was set up at the main bourse Korea Exchange. “When any company purchases 1 ton of emission rights for 10,000 won on the trading market, it will have a burden of 260 billion won ($236 million) for three years,” said a business lobby executive.Since the market kicked off on Jan. 12, a business that emits less than the cap is entitled to sell the excess amount on the Korea Exchange, while a higher emitter is allowed to buy the rights.The trading performance has been sluggish so far.

SUV sales rose 12 percent to more than 5.5 million. That was double the pace of the industry as a whole.Strong demand is likely to continue this year, says Jesse Toprak, president of Toprak Consulting Group. SUV sales may not see double-digit growth, since overall sales are expected to slow as the U.S. market nears a peak of 17 million vehicles. But SUVs should still outpace sales of cars, Toprak says.Small SUVs like the Honda CR-V have been the fastest growing segment in the market for the last three years. They appeal to both young families and aging Baby Boomers. Low interest rates, easing credit standards and new versions of popular models like the Jeep Cherokee and Subaru Outback have also fueled demand.More recently, low gas prices helped boost sales of bigger SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Lincoln Navigator. Last June, when gas prices peaked at $3.76 per gallon, SUV sales made up 33 percent of new vehicle sales, while small cars made up 20 percent, according to Ward’s AutoInfoBank. By December, when gas prices had fallen to $2.63, SUV market share rose to 35 percent, while small cars fell to 16 percent.Here are some of the SUVs debuting at the Chicago show, which opened to the public Saturday.General Motors is unveiling a refreshed Chevrolet Equinox small SUV. It’s the first update to the Equinox since it went on sale in 2010, and it should help the popular SUV compete with newer rivals until it gets an expected redesign in late 2017. The 2016 Equinox will have a larger, handsomer, chrome-accented grille and upgraded projector-beam headlamps; on higher trim levels, the headlamps are LEDs. A rear-view camera will be standard on all models. Blind spot detection and cross-traffic alert are new options. Inside, there’s a new standard 7-inch screen and an updated instrument panel. The Equinox has been a consistently strong seller despite its advancing age. Last year, Equinox sales rose 2 percent to 242,242, making it the fourth-best seller in the crowded small SUV market behind the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4. The 2016 Equinox goes on sale this fall.The Kia Soul meets Jeep with the Trail’ster concept. Kia’s design team says this is a “near-future” look at an off-road version of its Soul wagon.

It, however, pointed out the productivity is only half as high, while working hours are among the longest in the 34-member group of developed market economies. ""Reforms are needed in part to boost the stocks of inward foreign direct investment, which is the second lowest in the OECD area,"" the report said.Improving the efficiency of the tax codes by relying more on indirect value-added tax (VAT) such as taxes levied for environmental protection and assets would benefit growth, while at the same time ease budgetary pressure associated with rapidly rising social spending, it said. South Korea has the second lowest VAT in the OECD.The organization also pressed for keeping earned income tax rates low and urged for the dismantling of barriers that impede competition.""Phase out entry barriers for large firms from business lines reserved for small and medium enterprises, which are primarily in the service sector,"" it said.The latest findings, based on reviews of reforms measures implemented by all member states from 2013 onwards, claimed the country needs to break down its labor market duality to boost productivity and encourage more female employment. Labor market duality refers to the difference in pay and job security between regular and non-regular workers in the country.Specifically, the OECD argued South Korea needs to lessen protection for regular workers while enhancing rights and benefits for non-regular workers. It said more can be done to improve employment training programs.On greater female economic participation, it suggested encouragement of parental leave and flexible working arrangements, including more part-time jobs.There should be more affordable, high-quality childcare, it said.The international agency also said South Korea should further reduce farm import barriers and scale back the high level of support for the sector.Besides South Korea, the OECD said reforms undertaken by eurozone countries were losing traction, while those outside Europe, North America and Japan, were accelerating to meet various developments of late.It said all countries need to place key importance on improving labor productivity and build up their skills and knowledge-based capital that can lead to greater competitiveness.

While carrying out fund-raising campaigns, his team here will increase efforts to engage with the Korean public, which Ashworth described as having a “very strong sense of social justice and empathy.” “Our concentration in the early years will be to be self-sustaining; engage with the public on our issues and on our humanitarian work, for example, and hoping that we are well supported with people’s generosity,” he said in an email interview with The Korea Herald. Ashworth, who was previously in charge of corporate partnerships at Oxfam, stressed the significance of cooperation with the private sector in promoting good practices and tackling common tasks, yet vowed to remain as a “critical friend.” “We would never exist to serve the interests of multinationals, but engage with the right ones at the right time; those who are open to progressive policies and practice,” he said. “So the future vision for me is one where we bring our experience to bear on relationships. Where we are a critical friend; prepared to represent vulnerable people first, appeal for changes to systems and structures that increase inequality but balance that with practical, innovative partnerships where we work with open-minded and progressive organizations and institutions on common challenges.”The U.K.-headquartered agency was born in 1942 and named after the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief formed by a group of Quaker intellectuals, social activists and University of Oxford academics to support refugees in Nazi-occupied Greece. Oxfam is seeking to play a vital role in the global decision-making system by helping create a level playing field and keeping vested interests in check, while supporting the underprivileged with fundamental needs. “On a day to day basis supporting poor communities with both their practical needs such as access to clean water and education and on a global stage with key institutions is where Oxfam adds most value ― combining two very different approaches of practical and systemic change into a cohesive vision,” Ashworth added. The group’s ties with Korea date back to the 1950-53 Korean War. It began its work in North Korea in 1997, providing food handouts on a yearly basis to poor rural communities and children in orphanages chiefly through its Hong Kong unit. It also supplied fertilizers, hand tractors and diesel fuel for agricultural rehabilitation in the impoverished country. “In 2012, Oxfam redesigned its program in North Korea, hoping to incorporate new elements beyond humanitarian response,” Ashworth said. “In the meantime, North Korean aid programs have recently been resumed by Oxfam Hong Kong.” At last month’s Davos forum in Switzerland, Oxfam drew the limelight by unveiling a report predicting that the richest 1 percent of the world’s population may own more than all the rest by 2016, if the trend goes unchecked. In Asia, longstanding discrimination against women and ethnic minorities has placed the region “at a crossroads,” Ashworth noted. Soaring inequality has also emerged as a hot potato in Korean society. Criticism is widespread over the lopsided relationship between family-owned conglomerates and their contractors. In December, a Korean Air executive, the daughter of the company’s chairman, enraged many Koreans for delaying a flight after being served nuts in a bag, not a bowl. “Asia’s phenomenal economic growth over the past two decades is a remarkable success story in the fight against poverty. However, this growth has also led to a sharp widening of the gap between rich and poor,” he said. “Limited economic opportunities and exclusion from political power can trap such groups at the bottom of the ladder. … I’m sure some of those messages resonate with Korea, to some extent domestically but more widely in the region.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","in seoul oxfam is ready ,new office in seoul oxfam ,fund raising campaigns his team ,with new office in seoul ,korea hoping to incorporate new","['Seoul', 'Oxfam', 'Chris Ashworth', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief', 'Quaker', 'University of Oxford', 'Nazi', 'Greece', 'Korea', 'North Korea', 'Hong Kong', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Oxfam Hong Kong', 'Switzerland', 'Oxfam', 'korean', 'Korean Air', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.85795832  0.34947681

It is provided to those who file applications with the Korea Environment Corp. after registering their vehicles.The Environment Ministry had been pressured to scale back its spending on subsidies for eco-friendly hybrid vehicles by about 25 percent from its earlier plan, which may lead to a backlash from consumers and automakers.Though the ministry had planned to provide 40,000 retail buyers of hybrid cars with subsidies totaling 40 billion won in 2015, the National Assembly urged it to cut the total provision by 10 billion won to 30 billion won.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","friendly cars at 30 billion ,million won 900 hybrid car ,policymakers forecast that yearly sales ,month despite low oil prices ,cars at 30 billion won","['the Ministry of Environment', 'Hyundai Motor ’s', 'Toyota Motor ’s Prius', 'Lexus CT200h', 'the Sonata 2.0GDI , Prius , Prius V', 'CT200h', 'Ford Motor ’s Fusion Hybrid', 'the Korea Environment Corp.', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Yon - se']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54492998  0.34853616

The government has opposed such moves because they could adversely affect the business community and nip economic growth in the long run.  ""The government is in the process of meeting pledges on welfare by cutting spending and digging up the underground market whose actors have dodged paying their due,"" the policymaker stated.  He said that while critics view the cutting of various tax credits and relief as raising taxes, the government did not share this perception.   On the drop in corporate tax earnings last year, Choi said big companies such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor Co. struggled at the time, which affected the amount collected.  The official, who doubles as deputy prime minister, defended the latest revision to the income tax rules that raised public furor as people filed year-end tax returns. The new scheme heavily cut tax refunds by eliminating some of the tax break categories. The government said it was designed to have people pay fewer taxes throughout the year and receive a smaller refund at the end of the year.  Choi said a special taskforce will look into all the problems that have cropped up and make any needed changes.   A complete assessment of different earnings brackets will be completed by March so that adjustments can be made, Choi said.  ""The plan is to reform the way withholding taxes are collected and to reduce complications involved in filing tax settlements in the future,"" the policymaker said.

G Market, another online retailer, saw an on-year increase of 56 percent over the last two weeks. Sales of CCTV cameras are surging amid a series of child abuse scandals. (Yonhap)The fad is likely to have been touched off by nationwide concerns about child safety, touched off by a recent incident a day care center in Songdo, Incheon, where a worker beat a 4-year-old for not finishing her food. “It is not uncommon for a social issue to affect sales, but this particular case has even larger ramifications given that it’s related to children’s safety. We are seeing sales increase to not only institutions, but individual customers as well,” said an Auction official.An increasing number of individual consumers purchased surveillance cameras that they could install in their homes and link to their smartphones, which allowed them to keep an eye on their children while at work. Auction said it had sold two to six times more of these “network” surveillance cameras in the past two weeks.According to the Justice Ministry, the number of child abuse cases in Korea has been on the rise. Monthly reported cases went from 1,038 in 2013 to 1,416 in 2014, an increase of over 30 percent.Policymakers held a ministerial-level meeting to discuss possible measures to reduce child abuse, such as toughening requirements for child care workers and ensuring stern punishment for abusers. The meeting was presided over by Hwang Woo-yea, the education minister and deputy prime minister for social affairs.“Child abuse is a serious crime that must be rooted out in our society. Authorities must sternly enforce punishment of perpetrators and the facilities they are affiliated with,” Hwang said at the meeting, also attended by the ministers of justice, welfare, gender equality and family, at the Korea Childcare Promotion Institute. National Police Agency Chief Kang Sin-myeong was also present, as was Yoo Jeong-bok, mayor of Incheon.After the Incheon incident, officials vowed series of measures against child abuse such as a “one strike” system, in which a day care center would be shut down after a single case of child abuse and the head of the facility would be permanently banned from holding similar jobs. The ministers attending Saturday’s meeting agreed on mandatory installation of closed circuit television cameras at all day care centers and pushing for tougher punishment of perpetrators. They also discussed the possibility of holding personality tests for all child care workers and implementing character education courses for future workers, as part of the effort to require higher qualifications for child care workers.Another issue discussed at Saturday’s meeting was the relatively poor working conditions of child care workers, which some experts have said to be an underlying cause of the abuse cases. The average monthly salary for day care center workers in Cheonju, North Chungcheong Province, ranged from 1.1 million won to 1.5 million won ($1,000-$1,400), according to the city government. The legal minimum monthly salary for 2014 was 1.09 million won, based on minimum wage and a 40-hour work week. Minister Hwang said the government must apply tougher job requirements for child care facilities, but at the same time needs to “improve the working conditions (of child care workers) so they can put all their efforts into taking care of children.“Some 20 issues were discussed at the meeting, which will be reviewed at respective ministries. We’ll hold another ministerial-level meeting in early February, where we will announce comprehensive countermeasures (for child abuse).” By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","weeks sales of cctv cameras ,shopping mall auction showed sunday ,two weeks sales of cctv ,cctv cameras have increased sharply ,mall auction showed sunday","['CCTV', 'Auction', 'CCTV', 'G Market', 'CCTV', 'Songdo', 'Auction', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Korea', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Hwang', 'the Korea Childcare Promotion Institute', 'National Police Agency', 'Kang sin - myeong', 'Yoo Jeong - bok', 'Incheon', 'Incheon', 'Cheonju', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Hwang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38528264  0.73493832

Park expected that the number would continuously increase over the next several years.Park, in particular, cited the rapidly growing number of tourists from China and Southeast Asian countries. Accordingly to her forecast, tourists would account for about 65 percent, or 15 million, of the expected 23 million visitors in 2020.The proportion of Asian tourists to South Korea increased by 6 percentage points over the past decade, from 50.5 percent in 2005 to 56.5 percent in 2014.Out the of the estimated 23 million visitors in 2020, the number of tourists from developed countries and other emerging nations is projected to reach 7 million and 1 million, respectively, Park added.The institute reiterated that it was necessary for the government to diversify tour products and raise the quality of products in order to increase the rate of return visits.According to a study by a public company, inbound foreign tourists on average spent a record $901 on shopping when visiting Korea last year.The Korea Culture and Tourism Institute has said that the findings are based on surveys of 9,062 visitors in the January-September period.The state-run institute added that cosmetics, clothing and food were the top three items purchased by tourists. Meanwhile, expenditure on accommodation and food dropped because visitors spent an average of 6.1 days in the country in 2014, down from 6.9 days in 2013.In terms of reasons for visiting, business trips fell to 19.6 percent from 23.3 percent, while leisure jumped to 57.9 percent from 47.7 percent.“The weak Japanese yen did not discourage foreigners from coming in droves last year,” said the institute.Around half of inbound tourists were from China, followed by visitors from Japan and the United States.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","64 percent surpassing 20 million ,korea increased by percentage points ,23 million visitors in 2020 ,tourists to south korea increased ,million visitors in 2020","['South Korea', 'the Hyundai Economic Research Institute', 'Park Da - mi', 'China', 'southeast asian', 'asian', 'South Korea', 'Park', 'Korea', 'the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute', 'japanese', 'China', 'Japan', 'the United States', 'Kim Yon - se']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67092562  0.7273227

Policymakers take credit for reducing debts by 24.4 trillion won ($22.7 billion) for state-managed corporations and agencies by having them boost efficiency, control spending and sell non-core assets. The reduced debt is 4.3 trillion won more than the initial target, according to the ministry.Cho Bong-hwan, director general of the ministry's public institutions innovation office, said the next phase of reform will go into effect in 2016 after the government sets detailed plans and specific targets by the end of this year.The government will inspect some 85 public corporations and institutions that have been cited for maintaining redundant operations, unduly competing with private businesses. Such institutions are in the social overhead capital, culture and arts, and agricultural and fisheries sectors, the ministry said.The government will also promote merit-based wages for most employees of public corporations, Cho said.""The goal is to introduce a 'two-strike regime' that will allow the CEO or top management to fire employees who have performed below standard for two consecutive evaluation sessions,"" said Cho. He claimed that by introducing such a system, the public sector can help push forward country-wide job market reforms.The government has been trying to make the local job market more flexible, making it easier to hire and fire workers.All public institutions will have a wage peak system in place by next year, the ministry said.In addition, the government will revise how bonuses are given to CEOs of public institutions. With the revisions, instead of giving bonuses only during the years in office, CEOs will be rewarded even after leaving the institution if it does well, the director general said. The intent is to reward CEOs for good results that may become apparent later. By the same token, CEOs will only receive 50 percent of the bonus in the first year in office because any good performance by the institution will be considered partly creditable to the previous CEO.Public companies will do more to meet their social responsibility by getting rid of discrimination in hiring based on educational background, the ministry said. State-run institutions will take the lead in giving high-performing temporary workers full-time positions and hiring more people from rural areas to contribute to balanced national growth.

Subsequently, a large number of additional faculty members and classrooms would be needed, the report claimed.A similar problem would occur when the students entered middle school in 2023, and high school in 2026. Overall, 301,722 new faculty members, 40,940 new classes and a total of 10.4 trillion won would be needed to implement the policy.The report said similar costs would be incurred if a batch of students had to wait six months before starting school.But officials from the Education Ministry said the changes were likely to cost less than the KEDI had projected, since the adjustments would be made gradually. The ministry will gather public feedback from 2016 to 2018 to decide whether and when to implement the new academic calendar.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","10 trillion won billion over ,middle school in 2023 ,new faculty members 40 940 ,middle school in 2023 and ,in march 2018 start school","['the Education Ministry', 'korean', 'the Korea Educational Development Institute', 'the Education Ministry', 'kedi', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.467114    0.36930504

(If we don’t proceed with the reform), the current system would require 10 trillion won in government subsidies over 10 years,” Park said, calling on the parties to draw up reform plans by April.“This would likely leave our next generation with 484 trillion won worth of debt, which means a single citizen would have to pay off 9.45 million won 10 years later.”According to the reform proposal submitted by the Ministry of Public Administration last year, all public employees will have to pay 43 percent more in premiums and receive 34 percent less in pension payouts, starting from 2016. The presidential office initially hoped to complete the passage of the reform bill by the end of last year.The Public Administration Ministry predicts some 4.2 trillion won would be saved by the end of the current administration’s term, and 22.1 trillion won would be saved by 2027 upon the implementation of the reform.The proposal triggered intense resistance from the nation’s unionized public workers, who argued that the ruling party’s plan would mainly benefit private insurance firms. According to the workers, the proposal was jointly created by the Saenuri Party and the Korean Pension Association ― a group of pension experts, many of whom are associated with private insurance companies, including Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance. The president also said the government’s plans to halve university tuition fees would be completed within this year.The plan to cut the cost of college tuition was one of Park’s key pledges for the 2012 presidential election. At the time, she pledged to provide students with financial aid according to their family’s income levels, by expanding state-backed scholarship programs. “I will make sure students don’t have to give up on university education because of a lack of financial means,” she said.

In a bid to cater to such needs, Hanyang University’s Graduate School of Technology and Innovation Management said it was seeking to foster talented individuals equipped with a capacity for technological innovation and design for the future.HYMOT claims that since it was founded in 2011, it has been enhancing competence in Korea by cultivating leaders in technology-oriented management who can spark technological innovation. A person uses “Imagine Lab,” a virtual reality simulation system developed by Hanyang University’s Graduate School of Technology and Innovation Management. (Hanyang University)Choi Gyung-hyun, the dean of HYMOT, said the technology created by the institute’s students would create new business opportunities through field such as product design.“Previously, industrial design mostly focused on the shapes and colors of the product but now other factors like functions also need to be considered,” said Choi. “Via interdisciplinary conversion, we will work to ensure that Korean-style technology management will be recognized as a global standard.”He said HYMOT was already cooperating closely with businesses: “As of now, 80 percent of our students in master’s and doctor’s programs have jobs.”The school has a three-tier program for each of its target groups ― there is a program for “chief technology officers” in local enterprises; another course targets those looking to start their own venture companies; and the last one is for “chief design officers,” who create designs combining various technologies so they can have positive effects on the market and people. Choi Gyung-hyun“Especially in the management sector, we need more education to foster entrepreneurship (for students),” Cho said.His determination to apply new technologies to create business opportunities appears timely, since President Park Geun-hye has vowed support for information and communications technology as one of the driving forces of her trademark creative economy initiative.Choi said the key abilities required of the students were creative entrepreneurship, the ability to manage emerging technology and futuristic problem-solving, and analytical capability.For this purpose, the school has set three strategic goals ― establishing a practical education course that caters to the demands of the business world, establishing the necessary educational infrastructure and acquiring faculty members with strong backgrounds in theory and real-life experience.The school appears to have made considerable progress, especially with the latter goal, according to Choi. It has been hiring field experts with abundant experience to work as adjunct professors, and inviting CEOs of business organizations to serve as mentors for its students.Students at HYMOT are also invited to find real-life cases that are relevant to their studies and analyze them.Students are also invited to take part in projects in cooperation with workers at companies to cope with actual problems that have occurred.One such project is the “Imagine Platform,” codeveloped with ParisTech in France. The platform was used to create a virtual reality system named “Imagine Lab” that allows users to explore and interact with objects within an immersive virtual reality environment. According to HYMOT, the school has developed educational content with the Arts et Metiers ParisTech in France. The content stimulates the senses of the user, allowing a virtual experience of Paris-based Musee Des Arts et Metiers.The technology can be used in a variety of other fields, Choi added.“As of now, we are mainly cooperating with the medical industry in developing technology that can help the physically challenged or the elderly ― exercise programs, for example,” Choi said. In addition, virtual reality can help physicians accurately measure patients’ cognitive abilities, rather than having to rely on surveys. Choi said he and his coworkers were planning to expand its application to other fields like law enforcement and national defense.“It can be used on 3-D modeling of a crime scene, a technique already adopted in some countries. This will enable virtual preservation of a crime scene, even if the actual scene is physically tarnished,” he said, adding that virtual reality could be used to create 3-D models of military operations. The researchers at the school are currently working on a mobile version of the Imagine Lab, which theoretically can open doors for virtual experiences in space or underwater.

Measures are aimed at preventing problems likely to occur around 2018, when the number of college openings is expected to surpass the number of high school graduates.The ministry will evaluate each school based on its efforts to improve its classes, faculty, grading system and scholarships, and the percentage of its graduate who find jobs. By August, colleges will be sorted into five categories. But only those in the top group will be exempted from having to cut the number of new students they can accept.Colleges have already embarked on reforms to help their chances in the government assessment, as a poor result could substantially reduce their profits from students’ tuition fees. Among such efforts have been a series of measures aimed at lowering the number of top grades handed out to students.Students at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies on Dec. 31 stage a protest on the Seoul campus against the school’s decision to expand the curved grading system. (Yonhap)Roughly 90 percent of students in 2013 graduated with an average grade of “B” or higher, according to data provided by Korea Council for University Education. Even top-tier schools like Seoul National University, widely considered the premier higher education institute in Korea, graduated 59.5 percent of its students with an “A” average.Hankuk University of Foreign Studies recently announced it would begin using a curved grading system for all classes, and will retroactively apply the new measure to grades from the second semester of 2014. “Grade inflation has become a social issue that is damaging the credibility of college credits,” HUFS wrote in an email sent to students.Students staged a fierce protest, saying the choice was made unilaterally. They also voiced concerns that the system change could hurt their prospects in the job market. Despite the university’s claims that it was a preset plan, students complained that the university was attempting to shift the burden of college reform to the students. On the evaluation scale, 4 out of 60 points are allocated to grade distribution, which means schools that give out too many top grades will be penalized. “To improve their scores in the government evaluation, the school violated the rights of the faculty as well as the students,” HUFS students said last week at a news conference on the Seoul campus. They also applied for an injunction to a local court, requesting a suspension of the school’s new policy.Other schools have also attempted to curb the number of students scoring top grades. In November, Kyung Hee University sent a notice to faculty members urging them to keep the overall average GPA for all students in their classes below 3.0 (“B”). Some schools are aiming to increase the employment rate for graduates, another major category in the state evaluation. Chung-Ang University has announced plans to close or merge departments, which observers say is an attempt to increase the overall employment rate for its graduates.Ewha Womans University is banning students from postponing graduation without signing up for new semesters, a move widely interpreted as a bid to decrease the number of enrolled students. The number of students per faculty member is also a factor that can affect colleges’ grades in the ministry’s evaluation.As in the case of HUFS, the slew of measures is sparking protests from students. Members of student councils at eight Seoul-based universities held a news conference in front of Korean Educational Development Institute on Monday and urged the Education Ministry to revise its reform plans.“Side effects of the ministry’s forced, half-baked reform plans can be witnessed on several university campuses. The evaluation of the grading system has resulted in (universities) pushing ahead with unilateral changes to school rules, prompting conflicts on campus,” they said.Student discontent is not the only problem hindering education authorities. Although the government has procured the budget for college reform, a bill that will provide it legal grounds ― proposed in April by Rep. Kim Hee-jung of the ruling Saenuri Party ― is still pending at the National Assembly.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","college openings by 2022 measures ,government initiated college reform about ,signing up for new semesters ,budget for college reform ,of college openings by 2022","['the Education Ministry', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Seoul', 'Korea Council for University Education', 'Seoul National University', 'Korea', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Seoul', 'Kyung Hee University', 'GPA', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Ewha Womans University', 'HUFS', 'Seoul', 'Korean Educational Development Institute', 'the Education Ministry', 'Kim Hee - jung', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Yoon Min - sik']",2,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.10047696  0.13685875

Korean Air Line Co., South Korea’s largest full-service carrier, last year reported 246 cases of unruly behavior, including smoking, air rage and sexual harassment, compared with 120 in 2013. Smoking, punishable by fines up to 1 million won ($916.5), soared to 190 cases last year from 90 a year earlier.Among 490 passengers who violated aviation safety rules over the past three years, Korean Air handed over 155 to police, with 39 becoming subjects of legal punishment.No. 2 Asiana Airlines Inc. reported 51 cases of unruly passenger problems from January to November, more than triple the figure recorded the previous year, with smoking accounting for the highest ratio of violations.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation, the number of safety violations by air passengers rose to 187 in 2013, up from 140 in 2010. A total of 190 cases took place in the first seven months of last year. Among 843 cases over the past five years, 81 percent were related to smoking and commotion accounted for 12 percent, followed by physical abuse and sexual harassment with 5 percent and 2 percent, respectively, the ministry said. Unruly behavior of passengers has become a growing concern among local airlines, raising calls for clear regulations to prevent such behavior.On Wednesday, Bobby Kim, a popular R&B; singer in South Korea, was questioned by the U.S. investigators after his alleged sexual harassment of a cabin crew member while intoxicated on a Korean Air flight from Incheon to San Francisco. Korean Air found itself in hot water after its former vice president and the eldest daughter of CEO Cho Yang-ho sparked national uproar after ordering a crewmember to deplane over in-flight service last month. Cho Hyun-ah was indicted Wednesday on charges of obstructing aviation safety after ordering a chief flight attendant to deplane over the way she was served macadamia nuts, in an unopened pack instead of on a plate.

The sectors include laundry, disposal of military waste, operations of post exchanges and maintenance of military equipment.The plan comes amid criticism that assigning soldiers for such peripheral missions was inappropriate when North Korea’s military threats remain high and the number of service members is expected to decrease due to the nation’s low birthrate.By commissioning civilians to manage military supplies and post exchanges, a total of 2,100 troops can be reassigned for combat roles, ministry officials explained.The ministry also plans to gradually replace soldiers in charge of managing military resort facilities with civilians. The basic plan also includes commissioning civilians to take up chores such as cleaning barracks and offices and weeding, so as to ensure draftees have enough leisure time.“We will continue to develop our related policies to effectively use our limited defense resources and troops by actively using civilian resources, with an aim to enhance our combat readiness,” said the ministry in a press release. The ministry also unveiled a plan to purchase civilian products to maintain what have been strictly military supplies. Some 240 billion won ($218 million) in defense spending can be saved by 2019 from the commercialization process, the ministry estimated.“We will unveil our defense supply standards to the civilian firms so that we can obtain good civilian products for military supplies (at good prices),” said the ministry.To save water and energy, the ministry also plans to invite commercial companies to invest in the projects for some 30 military bases to improve lighting, heating and pipe systems. It seeks to save utility costs of around 59 billion won by 2019.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","to relieve some 500 troops ,30 military bases to improve ,plan also includes commissioning civilians ,jobs to civilians for 2015 ,relieve some 500 troops","['the Defense Ministry', 'North Korea ’s', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50372922  0.01090401
